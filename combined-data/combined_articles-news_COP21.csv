A cruise that will cost the climate
campaign dear

By Christopher Caldwell

When a Chinese helicopter rescued 52 passengers from a Russian climate-science cruise ship trapped in ice off Antarctica, it was a skilfully managed end to an ordeal that had begun on Christmas Eve. It was also a debacle for climate change activists. The 233-foot Akademik Shokalskiy, a Russian meteorological ship, had been on a mission called the ""Spirit of Mawson"". It aimed to replicate part of a gruelling voyage the explorer Douglas Mawson had made in 1912. The ship carried 22 scientists looking to perform various experiments, led by Chris Turney, a professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales. They were joined by 26 tourists paying for the adventure, along with journalists for The Guardian, BBC and The Sydney Morning Herald.

Amid the worldwide relief that the passengers are now en route to Tasmania on the Australian supply ship Aurora Australis, another note is audible. Many websites where readers normally take climate change for granted have been inundated by posts from gloating disbelievers. The Australian group belittled the cold conditions that almost killed them and got a comeuppance, say the detractors. Such posts appear on the many YouTube videos uploaded by passengers (""For all your self-aggrandising bluster, you will go down in history as Turney's turkeys . . . You are an international laughing stock""), on the Spirit of Mawson Twitter feed (""If the #spiritofmawson has taught us anything it's the low level of intellect among those who have 'settled' the science"") and even on the New York Times's Dot Earth blog, where the writer Andrew Revkin notes that the incident has ""energised climate change contrarians"".

Of course, a scientific dispute cannot be settled by one near-tragedy on the high seas and a week's worth of online invective. But the episode is a setback for those making the case for what used to be called global warming - probably the largest such setback since emails stolen from the University of East Anglia in 2009 cast doubt on the scientific neutrality of several climate researchers.

A beset ship is like a skint bank, and we can draw certain parallels to the financial crisis of 2008. The voyage of the Akademik Shokalskiy mixed public and private purposes, and all such enterprises nowadays invite scepticism. Those who stood to reap the benefits of the voyage were able, when things went sour, to pass on many of the costs.

These were of three kinds. The first was a cost in danger. Precipitation and wind complicated rescue plans in the week between Christmas and New Year's day. Andrew Luck-Baker of the BBC called his own 15-minute rescue flight a ""white-knuckle ride"" - but the Chinese helicopter had to cover the distance between the Russian vessel and the rescue vessel eight times over the course of four hours. The second is a cost in money. The Xue Long, the Chinese icebreaker that sought to free the stricken vessel, became stranded itself, and will now lie idle until the weather changes. Twenty-two Russian crewmen will remain aboard the Akademik until help arrives weeks from now. French personnel and equipment were involved, too. The final cost is to science. The Aurora Australis had to delay offloading supplies to other, more purely scientific projects along the Antarctic coast in order to respond to the emergency call.

That is why the generally sympathetic Revkin found ""vexing"" the ""devil-may-care"" attitude of the ship's passengers, who videotaped their raucous and self-referential New Year's eve singalong. Nerves could be an explanation for that, but there was something unseemly in press reports of crew members dragging sleds with the passengers' luggage to the helicopters. This looked like pampering. It made Mr Turney's tweet of thanks to his rescuers - ""for all their hard work"" - sound less like the acknowledgment of an unrepayable debt to someone who has saved your life, and more like something you would say when tipping a barmaid.

How to keep well-meaning but overconfident people from imposing on others when they fail is a familiar problem. In his healthcare reform, Barack Obama sought to solve it (for better or for worse) with the ""individual mandate"", which requires people to buy health insurance even if they are certain nothing could ever go wrong with them. The state of New Hampshire has a controversial ""negligent hiker law"", which bills lost hikers for the cost of their own rescue, should they require one. In the world's deadliest waters, that approach would be neither charitable nor fair. But that does not make it reasonable, in any walk of life, to confer the rewards of risk on people who need never heed the costs.

Innovators give voice to charity, climate and creativity
By Justin Cash

Nelson Rayner

New Zealand

Born in Australia and educated in New Zealand, Nelson Rayner, 28, was named the winner of Google's 2013 Young Innovators Award for his fundraising application Donate Your Desktop.

When users download the app, they allow advertising space on their computer to be rented out, with 75 per cent of the revenue generated going to a charity of their choice.

Amnesty, Oxfam New Zealand and the NZ Breast Cancer Foundation are some of the charities involved already.

""Originally, it was a campaign-based idea; that's the nature of the product,"" Mr Rayner says.

""Trying to market without a budget was a challenge, and everything had to be done from the bootstraps.""

He is currently working on Little Lot, a mobile reincarnation of Donate Your Desktop that aims to channel more of the estimated $100bn spent on digital advertising into charitable causes.

""A lot of it is about having passion, not just a business head,"" Mr Rayner says. ""My advice [for young entrepreneurs] would be to make sure you choose the right people from the start.

""Don't give away too much equity or spend too much cash. You've still got an obligation to your investors, even if you are young.""

Esperanza Garcia

Philippines

As co-founder of the International Youth Council, an organisation formed at the UN to develop future world leaders, Esperanza Garcia, 26, is a passionate ambassador both for the environment and for the potential that young people have to tackle climate change.

A single mother since the age of 18, Ms Garcia was an official Filipino delegate at the UN's 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference, and has served as a consultant to the Philippine Senate's climate change committee - where she lobbied for renewable energy laws.

""Engaging with the youth of today, I have seen a generation with an increasingly strong sense of social and environmental awareness, one that is taking action,"" says the president of the Philippine Youth Climate Movement (PhilYCM). ""Youth are not the leaders of tomorrow. We are the leaders of today.""

She recognises the exceptional work of other young environmentalists through PhilYCM's Climate Hero award.

""Our goal is to mobilise youth all over the Philippines to take action on climate change,"" she says.

""Weneedto believe and prove that we are the great generation that will overcome this challenge.""

Boniface Mwangi

Kenya

Photojournalist Boniface Mwangi was propelled to fame in 2007 when he captured images of the violence following Kenya's elections that year.

He became a visual artist, with an eye to using photography to spur social change.

In 2009, he founded Picha Mtaani, a street exhibition showcasing photographs of the post-election bloodshed across the country.

Picha Mtaani has spawned another social enterprise, Pawa254, a Nairobi-based community for young, creatively minded individuals.

Mr Mwangi says that youth movements are almost non-existent in Africa, apart from extremist, religious or women's groups.

""We are trying to build a movement in Kenya, but it will take time for it to have significant impact. A young person is more likely to end up in jail, a single mother, a substance addict or shot dead by police than get a job here.""

The 30-year-old says young people need to be given reasons to believe in themselves and in their ability to shape the future of the nation.

""If young people can learn that their actions count no matter how small, then they will do something.""

The evidence for climate change is increasingly challenged

From Lord Turnbull.

Sir, A year ago I wrote to the FT (Letters, January 31, 2013) challenging an article by Edward Luce in which he claimed that ""the reality of global warming is starker than four years ago - in most respects alarmingly so.""

I pointed out that the evidence led in the opposite direction; for example the Met Office's global temperature series was moving sideways, despite the continued rise in CO2 concentrations, and that after the large retreat in the summer of 2012, by January 2013 Arctic ice was close to where it had been in January 2007.

This drew a sharp response (Letters, February 4) from Professor Chris Rapley of the Department of Earth Sciences, at University College London. He stated that ""we know that the ice is significantly thinner than in the past. From this we can be confident that the rapid decline in Arctic ice is set to continue.""

What has happened since? The summer retreat of Arctic ice in 2013 was substantially less than in 2012 and indeed its extent was about the average of the last decade. (Not mentioned in the correspondence was the growth of Antarctic ice.) The Met Office has just produced its annual figure for global temperature and it showed that in 2013 temperature continued to move sideways, in sharp contrast to its prediction that global temperature would rise by 0.3C between 2004 and 2014.

Prof Rapley ended his letter by saying that ""the UK has many climate experts"" to whom I can turn. I would prefer to be able to turn to those who are more modest about their claims and who do not express themselves as ""confident"" about things which are still subject to doubt.

Why stop at climate change - let's question all groupthink!

From Mr Paul Dickinson.

Sir, I must commend you for the courage to print the contrarian Lord Turnbull (""The evidence for climate change is increasingly challenged"", Letters, January 31). Government scientists, universities, presidents, prime ministers, UN organisations, the World Bank, the World Meterological Organisation, The Royal Society, etc, etc, all fall foul of ""group think"" on climate change. Sometimes it takes a distinguished peer of the realm to say the unfashionable.

But if the doors really are open for us to look consensus in the face, can I ask about another orthodoxy that people have kept buried for almost a century? Should women really have the vote? Misery for millions through world war and Twitter have followed universal suffrage. Tobacco is derided but I like a smoke.

I have many other opinions and would welcome the opportunity to see my name in the media, saying those things that others choose not to say. Hoorah for the lone voice against ""political correctness gone mad""!

Pacific trade winds are stalling
global warming, scientists say

By Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent



Researchers have cast new light on one of the most baffling riddles in climate science: why has global warming stalled when emissions of the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change have kept soaring?

The explanation lies in an unprecedented strengthening of Pacific trade winds over the past 20 years, according to a study by US and Australian scientists.

These easterly winds, which blow across the tropics, have speeded up ocean circulation at the equator, pushing heat deep down into the ocean's depths and bringing cooler water up to the surface.

This has driven more cooling in other regions and accounts for much of the reason why global average air surface temperatures have stayed virtually steady since 2001, says the paper, published in this week's Nature Climate Change journal.

This pause could persist for much of the present decade if the strong trade winds continue, but the paper warns that once they slow down ""rapid warming is expected to resume"".

""Scientists have long suspected that extra ocean heat uptake has slowed the rise of global average temperatures, but the mechanism behind the hiatus remained unclear,"" said the study's lead author, Professor Matthew England of the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science.

The implications of the research were of concern, he added. ""We should be very clear: the current hiatus offers no comfort. We are just seeing another pause in warming before the next inevitable rise in global temperatures.""

&lt;



&gt;The stalling in air temperature rises, which follows a steady trend of warming through much of the 20th century, has led some to question whether climate change is a serious problem, or whether it exists at all.

The proportion of Americans who do not believe global warming is happening rose 7 percentage points to 23 per cent between April and November last year, according to a recent US study.

While nearly two-thirds do believe climate change is occurring, the number who think humans are causing it has fallen slightly since 2012.

However, some climate scientists say the findings on the role of Pacific trade winds, which build on previous studies pointing to the oceans' role in absorbing heat, suggest the change is linked to human activity.

""These changes are temporarily masking the effects of man-made global warming,"" said Professor Richard Allan, professor of climate science at the University of Reading in the UK.

""It is likely that the current slowdown is only a temporary reprieve from rapid increases in global temperatures,"" he said, adding that it would be surprising if big changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation over the past 20 years had not already disrupted weather patterns.

&lt;&gt;The past two years have been marked by a series of unusual weather extremes.

Australia recorded its hottest year on record in 2013, while the continental US had its warmest year in 2012.

In the UK, where large parts of England have just had their wettest January in more than a century and the country's south has been hit by serious flooding and coastal damage, Met Office scientists said it was still not possible to say definitively that climate change was to blame.

""Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested an increase in the intensity of Atlantic storms that take a more southerly track, typical of this winter's extreme weather,"" the scientists say.

""There is also an increasing body of evidence that shows that extreme daily rainfall rates are becoming more intense, and that the rate of increase is consistent with what is expected from the fundamental physics of a warming world.""

Storms whip up policy debate on
climate change

When huge seas smashed into a sea wall in the Devon resort town of Dawlish and left a rail track designed in the 1800s swaying in mid-air last week, global warming sceptics around the world paid attention.

This was no example of how climate change is wrecking structures that have stood for a century, according to a lengthy article posted on the popular US site Wattsupwiththat, a showcase for climate science critics.

""The real story is that an already inadequate sea wall structure which carries the mainline railway has taken numerous hits from waves and storms since its inception and has become steadily weakened,"" the item said.

""The line was clearly built to a budget in the 1840s and the measures needed to compensate for its problematic location have only sporadically been implemented ever since.""

The article underlines how the UK's extreme winter weather has fast become a flashpoint in the debate over whether climate change is already affecting weather systems, and how governments should respond to it.

The debate is not just rhetorical for ministers such as the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, Ed Davey, whose multibillion pound programme of green energy subsidies is frequently attacked by Tory climate sceptics as a waste of money.

""We can see around us today the possible consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are much more likely,"" Mr Davey said in a speech on Thursday that accused Conservative party ""fringes"" of ""parroting the arguments of the most discredited climate change deniers"".

This ""wilfully ignorant, head in the sand, nimbyist conservatism"" was creating a ""diabolical cocktail"" threatening the UK's entire climate policy structure, he said.

His comments drew a swift riposte from Michael Fallon, Conservative energy minister, who told the Evening Standard: ""Unthinking climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up consumer bills.""

Mr Davey has made similar attacks in the past, but his comments may have more resonance at a time when the public is focused on the flooding that has submerged 5,800 homes and crippled rail networks.

The number of people who think the ""environment"" is the biggest cause of concern in the UK has jumped from 6 per cent to 23 per cent in a month - on a par with welfare - according to pollsters YouGov.

Still, this is unlikely to sway prominent Conservative climate policy critics such as Lord Lawson, the former Conservative Chancellor.

""There has been all sorts of bad weather in the past. This is nothing new,"" he told the FT yesterday, adding that neither he nor climate scientists really knew if the climate was changing.

""They don't know and I don't know. The jury is still out. It may change and it may not and if it does change we need to intelligently adapt to it, which is what mankind has done all along,"" he said.

""Every prediction so far that the alarmists have made has been falsified,"" he said, adding that while increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere undoubtedly warm the planet, it is unclear by how much, or how natural forces affect such changes.

Such claims are shared by other Tory MPs, such as Peter Lilley, and there is much speculation about whether Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, agrees.

According to sources inside Defra, the environment department, Mr Paterson does not even like to read documents which refer to ""climate change"" and often speaks passionately in favour of fracking at cabinet meetings.

David Cameron's beliefs remain inscrutable. On the one hand the prime minister was recently quoted as ordering officials to ""get rid of the green crap"" - in other words green subsidies - to get household bills down.

At the same time, however, he has approved huge new subsidies for renewables through the recent energy bill.

His deft footwork was on display at a press conference on Tuesday when he was asked whether he believed that climate change had caused the floods.

""I think the point I would make is whatever your view, clearly we have had and are having some pretty extreme weather,"" he said. ""So whatever your view about climate change, it makes sense to mitigate it and act to deal with that weather.""

  John Kerry warns on catastrophic climate change 
 By Ben Bland in Jakarta 


 John Kerry, US secretary of state,  has called on industrialised and developing nations to work together ""urgently"" to reduce carbon emissions if the world is to avoid the catastrophic impact of climate change.  Speaking in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on Sunday, Mr Kerry said that while industrialised nations, including the US, were responsible for much of the carbon emissions that are believed to cause climate change, developing nations did not have a ""free pass"" to follow the same path of development.  ""They don't have a right to go out and repeat the mistakes of the past,"" he said. ""It's not enough for one country or even a few countries to reduce their emissions when other countries continue to fill the atmosphere with carbon pollution as they see fit. At the end of the day, emissions coming from anywhere in the world threaten the future of people everywhere in the world.""  Mr Kerry, who is on a three-country tour of Asia to call for action on climate change and seek to ease maritime tensions in the region, is hoping to spur progress toward a stringent global deal to cut emissions through a series of bilateral agreements with major emitting nations such as China.  In Beijing on Saturday, he signed an agreement with China for the world's  two biggest economies to share information and discuss policies ahead of next year's UN climate change negotiations, that are meant to lay out the path for a new global agreement on climate change mitigation.  ""I'm pleased to tell you that the leaders of China agree that it is time to pursue a cleaner path forward,"" said Mr Kerry, noting that China and the US together account for 40 per cent of global emissions. ""We have hopes that this unique partnership between China and the US can help set an example for global leadership and global seriousness.""  Although the Obama administration has tried to push climate change mitigation up the domestic political agenda, it has faced heavy opposition from those who dispute both the cause of the phenomenon and arguments about the scale of the damage it will cause.  Mr Kerry hit out at these critics, saying that 97 per cent of scientists who have examined the issue agree that climate change is a real threat.     Indonesia, which is a major emitter of carbon because of rampant deforestation, is one the large emerging nations that is struggling to a find a balance between curbing emissions and promoting economic growth.  Mr Kerry said that people in Indonesia and elsewhere had to pressure their governments to act now before it is too late.  ""It is not a lack of ability that is a problem, it is a lack of political resolve that is standing in our way,"" he said. ""Today I call on all of you in Indonesia and concerned citizens around the world to demand the resolve that is necessary from your leaders.""    "

 Kerry calls for action on climate threat  By Pilita Clark in London, Ben Bland in Jakarta and Clive Cookson in Chicago 

 John Kerry , US secretary of state,  has issued a plea for action on global warming, calling it as big a threat as terrorism and ""perhaps the world's most fearsome weapon of mass destruction"".  Speaking in Jakarta after the US and China announced fresh strides on jointly tackling climate change before a global summit next year, Mr Kerry hit out at ""a tiny minority of shoddy scientists"" and ""extreme ideologues"" trying to hijack the debate.  His comments come amid a spate of extreme weather events around the world, from heavy weekend snowfalls that killed a dozen people in Japan, to relentless US snow and ice storms; the hottest January on record in parts of Brazil and severe winter flooding in Britain.  The weather patterns have galvanised debate about the influence of global warming, with political figures such as Ed Miliband, the UK opposition leader, saying it has become a national security issue, while climate sceptics continue to question the science. Mr Kerry likened such views to those held by people who used to insist the earth was flat. ""The science is unequivocal, and those who refuse to believe it are simply burying their heads in the sand,"" he said.  Countries are preparing to negotiate a  firm global deal to curb warming at UN negotiations in Paris late next year. World leaders failed to achieve such an agreement at the Copenhagen summit in 2009.  The US and China will play a decisive role in the Paris outcome as they account for about 40 per cent of the carbon emissions linked to warming.  Mr Kerry said the US and China had made progress on a range of measures, including cutting heavy-duty vehicle emissions, capturing and storing carbon, and collecting data.  While precise details remain unclear, he said: ""I'm pleased to tell you that the leaders of China agree that it is time to pursue a cleaner path forward."" He added: ""We have hopes that it will help to set an example for global leadership.""  The US administration's credibility on climate change faces a big test in the coming months as it decides whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline opposed by many environmentalists to bring Canadian crude to US refineries.  Mr Kerry's comments came as scientists studying the jet stream winds said the bad weather that has battered the US and UK this winter may persist for longer in future in patterns lasting weeks or months.

Miliband warns of complacencyHomes at risk set to double by 2020s

The floods and storms of the past month have prompted a fresh Westminster row over climate change even as official figures predict the number of flood-prone homes will double to as many as 800,000 by the 2020s.

Ed Miliband, the Labour party leader, warned Britain yesterday it was ""sleepwalking into a national security disaster"" for failing to reach a political consensus, even though ""the science is clear"" on the reality of climate change .

Mr Miliband, who since 2010 has been quiet on the subject, has carefully timed his re-entry into the debate as thousands of households are flooded or without power. His comments seem to be a deliberate political salvo against the Conservatives, home to many climate change sceptics. Lord Lawson , the former Tory chancellor, told the Financial Times no one knew if the weather was changing.

""There has been all sorts of bad weather in the past. This is nothing new,"" he said. ""Every prediction so far that the alarmists have made has been falsified.""

Defra, the environment department, has predicted that the number of residential properties in England and Wales at ""significant likelihood of flooding"" will jump by the next decade. These affected homes will rise from 370,000 to 500,000-800,000, the ministry wrote in the small print of its climate change assessment report in 2012.

The department said the forecast was based on a scenario with no preventive action. ""We are investing heavily in flood defences.""

Amid calls for ministers to reconsider the number of homes being built on flood plains, Mark Wilson, chief executive of insurer Aviva, called in The Sunday Telegraph for houses to be given a ""flood rating"", so that potential buyers were made aware of the risk.

Insurers have paid out more than £5bn to British homes and companies hit by flooding since 2000, compared with just £1.5bn in real terms over the previous decade. Today, David Cameron will unveil a £10m package of support to help small and medium-sized companies meet clean-up costs and keep trading after the storms.

Guy Shrubsole, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said Defra's own figures suggested the problem would only worsen, with even more pressure on insurers and households.

Mr Miliband's intervention underlines how the extreme winter weather has fast become a flashpoint in the debate on climate change. The debate is not just rhetorical for ministers such as Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy secretary, whose multibillion-pound programme of green energy subsidies is often attacked by Tory sceptics.

""We can see around us today the possible consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are much more likely,"" Mr Davey said last week.

His comments drew a swift riposte from Michael Fallon, the Conservative energy minister, who said: ""Unthinking climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up consumer bills.""

But the number of people who think the ""environment"" is the biggest cause of concern has jumped from 6 per cent to 23 per cent in a month, according to pollsters YouGov.

 Climate change one of 'most serious threats' we face, says Cameron 
 By Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent 


 Man-made climate change is  among the greatest threats confronting the world, David Cameron declared on Wednesday, as prominent members of his party launched a drive to reclaim the environment as a Conservative political issue.  Pressed in the House of Commons to explain why he was happy to have ""climate change deniers"" in his cabinet, the prime minister gave one of his most forthright statements yet on the risks posed by global warming.  ""I believe man-made climate change is one of the most serious threats that this country and this world faces,"" he said, a comment that jars with the beliefs of some Tory party members who question the dangers posed by a changing climate.  Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, and Peter Lilley, Conservative MP, are among those who share such views and it is often claimed that Owen Paterson, the environment secretary, agrees with them.  However, Mr Paterson is one of 14 contributors to a booklet launched at Westminster on Wednesday by the Conservative Environment Network, a body that argues it is wrong to equate environmentalism with the left.  Other contributors include education secretary, Michael Gove; Kathryn Murdoch, wife of Rupert Murdoch's son, James; former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Unilever chief executive, Paul Polman.  Mr Gove, who was last year accused of allowing climate change to be downgraded in the national schools curriculum, told the launch event that it was clear that man has an impact on the climate and ""unarguable"" that climate change can have a ""devastating and wrenching impact on societies"".  He added that Conservative leaders had long sought to protect the natural environment, from Anthony Eden's Clean Air Act to the drive against sulphur emissions led by Margaret Thatcher, also a vigorous backer of climate research.  However, Tory backbencher, Zac Goldsmith, said it would be dishonest to ignore the fact that this momentum had slowed, largely because of what he said was the ""unhelpful rhetoric we're seeing at all levels of the party"".  His brother, financier Ben Goldsmith, who chairs the network, told the Financial Times that he believed climate change deniers were becoming a dwindling minority as the science grew more or less indisputable.   ""If Nigel Lawson was told the aeroplane he was about to board had a 5 per cent or 10 per cent or 15 per cent chance of crashing, he wouldn't board it,"" he said.  ""So the idea of purchasing an insurance policy [against climate change] is becoming more and more obvious to people and moreover, more and more people are realising it's not actually a purchase, it's an investment that is going to yield us a financial return so I think the climate argument is going to win itself.""

 Scientists back David Cameron on weather link to global warming 
 By Clive Cookson  
Climate scientists have backed  David Cameron's statement that he ""very much suspects"" the recent extreme weather events Britain has suffered are linked to climate change.  The prime minister's words in the House of Commons this week annoyed some Conservative MPs who are sceptical about man-made climate change. But leading climate scientists told a press briefing in London on Friday that abnormal weather, such as the succession of storms that made December one of the UK's wettest and windiest on record, was occurring more frequently.  ""I think [Mr Cameron] got the balance quite right in his statement,"" said Myles Allen, head of Oxford university's Climate Dynamics Group.  Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the Meteorological Office Hadley Centre, added: ""Yes, there are more extreme rainfall and temperature events around the world.  ""Yes, there is a mechanism by which climate change can increase rainfall, because there is 4 per cent more moisture in the atmosphere over the oceans than there was in the 1970s.""  At the same time, the scientists said, as they usually do after an episode of extreme weather, that an individual event  could not be attributed definitely to climate change rather than random climate variability.  A new buzzword in climate science is ""attribution"" teasing out the factors contributing to a particular spell of weather. The Met Office is building up research in this area but Prof Allen said much more could be done.  ""We do not need more pure research because we already understand these storms remarkably well. We need to take that understanding and apply it to attribution,"" he said. ""We could probably develop an attributional system for a few million pounds a year, and then we could quantify to what extent human influence has made particular types of flooding more or less likely. It is scandalous that we can't answer these questions now.""  In a region with such strong natural variability as the UK, no weather event has yet been so extreme that meteorologists can state categorically that it could not have occurred without man-made climate change. But the situation may be different elsewhere. ""If you look at Australian   weather for the whole of 2013 [Australia's hottest year on record] it is really, really unlikely that we would have seen those temperature extremes in the absence of climate change,"" said Mr Stott.  In the US, where a polar vortex has brought extreme cold over the past week, sceptics have taken the opportunity to ridicule the idea of global warming.  But climate scientists have fought back with support from the White House. In a video message John Holdren, President Barack Obama's science adviser, said: ""The extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States . . . is a pattern that we can expect to see with increasing frequency as global warming continues.""  Fortunately, as January progresses, the extreme weather on both sides of the Atlantic is easing. North America is warming up and northwestern Europe is calming down. Today, for the first time in several weeks, the UK Met Office has no warnings about heavy rain or severe wind.   "

Executives from some of Britain's biggest companies have written to the Financial Times calling on Westminster to tackle the ""growing risk of widespread flooding"" which they link to climate change.

Senior figures from companies including Lloyds Banking Group, Kingfisher and Aviva, have urged the main political parties to act to address the causes of climate change and ""look beyond the short term"".

In recent years, environmental concerns have been eclipsed in British political debate by issues such as the credit crunch and subsequent recession.

But the savage winter storms and record rainfall have prompted fresh calls for an urgent reassessment of climate change.

The issue dominated prime minister's questions on Wednesday, as David Cameron was challenged by Ed Miliband over whether he had ""climate change deniers"" in his cabinet.

Mr Cameron rejected this, saying: ""Man-made climate change is one of the most serious threats this country and this world faces.""

The letter to the FT, organised by the Aldersgate Group - an umbrella group for green-minded businesses - draws a direct link between the widespread flooding in Somerset and the Thames Valley and climate change.

""The type of extreme weather that we are currently experiencing is in line with climate-change predictions, which also warn that such events will become more frequent,"" says the letter. ""We believe that a far-sighted cross-party response is urgently needed.""

The signatories include Neil Carson, chief executive of Johnson Matthey, Russell Higginbotham, UK chief executive of Swiss Re, Neil Thomas, a managing director at Atkins, and Lynda Simmons, a director of Mitie.

They want the government to look not only at how to tackle flooding, but also at how to address the causes of climate change.

""All parties must look beyond the short term, and demonstrate their commitment to creating a low-carbon economy through domestic decisions and international leadership,"" says the letter.

  Lord Deben's sharp words for Australia's approach to climate change 
 By Pilita Clark in London 

 The Abbott government's move  to abandon the carbon tax and other climate measures has been contentious within Australia but few critics from outside the country have been as outspoken as Lord Deben.  The peer also chairs the UK's Committee on Climate Change, an older version of Australia's Climate Change Authority, which the Abbott government is planning to axe as part of its repeal of the carbon tax.  Lord Deben said he had discussed climate change at length with Mr Abbott before last year's Australian election, ""and I got five different views during that period of time"".  He said he had a similar conversation with Mr Abbott's mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, whom he said was also ""absolutely unscientific about it"", and appeared to have read only one book on the subject, by the former UK chancellor Lord Lawson, who says there is great uncertainty about the potential risk of climate change.  ""I have high hopes that people in Australia will recognise that the rest of the world is going in the opposite direction,"" said Lord Deben, adding that not every Abbott government minister shared Mr Abbott's views.  ""It's a joy to go and listen to some others, like [communications minister] Malcolm Turnbull who clearly seems to take a more sensible view,"" he said.  Mr Turnbull lost the leadership of the Australian Liberal party to Mr Abbott in 2009 after backing a climate change measure from the then Labor party government that many in his party opposed.  Since coming to power last September, the Abbott government has said it will repeal Australia's carbon tax and abolish bodies such as the Climate Change Authority and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which encourages investment in renewable energy schemes.  Last week, the government appointed an industrialist to review the country's renewable energy target, Dick Warburton, who says he is sceptical that man-made carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming.  If the government succeeds in getting parliamentary support for repealing existing climate laws, it plans to introduce the Direct Action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5 per cent from 2000 levels by 2020.  At the heart of the idea is a fund that would be used to pay for emissions reduction programmes done at the lowest cost.    "

  Canberra marked down for reversal of climate change law  Globe report
  By Pilita Clark in London 

 The Australian government has  taken an unscientific approach to climate change that is ""so unintellectual as to be unacceptable"", a prominent British Conservative peer has claimed.  ""Australia is very disappointing,"" said Lord Deben, a former chairman of the UK Conservative party and ex-cabinet minister who heads Globe International , a legislator body that annually assesses laws to combat climate change.  The conservative Australian government led by Tony Abbott, prime minister, is singled out in the latest Globe report today for being the only one of 66 countries studied that tried to repeal national climate legislation in the past year.  The 66 account for nearly 90 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Eight passed flagship climate legislation last year while 19 made what Globe calls ""positive advances"". A total of 487 climate laws have been passed worldwide, up from fewer than 100 in 2002 and less than 40 in 1997.  The Globe report comes as two of the world's most authoritative scientific bodies the US National Academy of Sciences and the UK's Royal Society took the unprecedented step of publish ing a simple explanation of what they say is ""the clear evidence that humans are causing the climate to change"".  The document, available on their websites, addresses the highly polarised debate about climate change in many countries.  In the four years since Globe started charting worldwide climate change legislation, only Canada, and now Australia, had reversed significant laws, the report's authors said.  Japan may follow suit after declaring a shutdown of its nuclear plants in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster had made its previous climate targets impossible to meet.  The Abbott government began moving to dismantle the carbon tax and other measures introduced under the previous Labor government shortly after winning power in September.  It aims to replace them with a new scheme to cut greenhouse gas emissions at a lower cost, but Lord Deben characterised its attitude as a ""reversal"".  ""I think it's the last flourish of the dismisses,"" said the peer, who was known as John Gummer when he was a minister in the governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major.    He said Mr Abbott relied on the ""very dubious"" work of a small minority of climate analysts and this was ""the last example of a government coming to power on the basis that really all this is nonsense"".  For Australia to repeal climate measures when it had just recorded its hottest year on record was startling, he said in a Financial Times interview: ""It's so unintellectual as to be unacceptable, I mean it is just amazing.""  Only four of the 66 countries in Globe's report lack climate legislation: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates. But some Canadian provinces have plans, and Saudi Arabia has ambitious solar energy schemes.  The study acknowledges, that the hundreds of laws passed so far will not limit greenhouse gas emissions enough to prevent a 2C rise in global temperatures.  "

Developing countries lead the field
in climate legislation

 Sir, We would echo the message expressed in the report ""John Kerry warns on catastrophic climate change"" (February 16), about the importance of securing a global climate change deal in 2015.

In contrast to the slow pace of international negotiations to tackle this challenge, national legislation is advancing at a startling rate. As of 2013, almost 500 climate-related laws have been passed in 66 countries covering around 88 per cent of global greenhouse gases released by human activities. Encouragingly, this is being led by developing countries. These are among the key findings of the Global Legislators Organisation's latest Climate Legislation Study, released on February 27. Our message is that national legislation should be at the heart of an international agreement, and this study is proof it can be achieved in every country.

A national ""commitment"" put forward at the UN will only be credible - and durable - if it is backed by national legislation that puts in place measures to ensure effective implementation. That is why governments must prioritise supporting development and implementation of national legislation. GLOBE members have been at the forefront of developing the legislative response to climate change. However, we need to do more. That is why, with the support of the UN and World Bank, GLOBE has launched the ""Partnership for Climate Legislation"" to advance climate-related laws. Of course, the role of legislators does not end when legislation is passed. That is why GLOBE is equipping legislators to be as effective as possible in holding governments to account - crucial if the agreement in 2015 is to deliver.

Idea of benefits in climate change
completely wrong, says UK's chief
scientists

By Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent



The idea that the benefits of climate change will outweigh any risks is ""completely wrong"", according to the government scientist who advises the cabinet on the latest state of knowledge on global warming.

""Whilst there may be trivial benefits in some parts of the world for some of the time, the long-term direction for all of us is a negative direction,"" said Sir Mark Walport, the UK's chief scientific adviser.

Sir Mark was responding to MPs' questions in a Commons committee about claims by the peer and science journalist, Matt Ridley, author of The Rational Optimist, that climate change is likely to do more good than harm for most of this century.

""I understand the point he's making but I think he's completely wrong, unfortunately,"" said Sir Mark, adding brusquely: ""He describes himself as a rational optimist. I'm not sure about the rational bit.""

Sir Mark was giving evidence to a Commons inquiry into the latest assessment by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), issued in September.

He defended the report's central finding, that man-made emissions of greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures, and brushed aside suggestions that governments could wait for climate models to improve before tackling climate change.

""The question is, when do you take out fire insurance? If you take out your fire insurance by the time the first storey of your house is in flames, then you're a bit late,"" said Sir Mark.

""The metaphor I use is, what price a grandchild? And if not what price a grandchild, then what price a grandchild's grandchild?""

Some critics say the models climate scientists have used to predict the rate of future warming are flawed because some failed to take account of a slowdown in the rate of global warming over the past decade.

However, David MacKay, chief scientific adviser to the energy department, told the same committee that while the models used in IPCC reports were not perfect, they were steadily improving and had in fact underestimated the extent at which parts of the climate are changing.

Most of the models used in the IPCC's previous report, issued in 2007, had failed to predict how fast Arctic sea ice would be lost since then, Prof Mackay said, while some had erred on the low side when projecting global sea level rises.

""It's acknowledged by the climate community that in many ways their models are not perfect and in some cases those imperfections are leading to an under-prediction of climate change,"" he said.

However, it would be ""utterly inappropriate"" to decide to defer action on climate change until there was perfectly hard evidence of all aspects of the issue, he said.

Climate chief warns battle to curb
warming is becoming harder

By Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent



The struggle to curb global warming is becoming increasingly fraught and costly, the head of the world's leading climate science authority has warned.

""We will have to work much harder to win this battle now than we would have been required to do 10 or 15 years ago,"" Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, told the FT in an interview.

Speaking in London, Dr Pachauri said he was still optimistic the world would find a way of curbing the man-made greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are warming the planet to potentially dangerous levels.

""The challenge is daunting but I don't for a moment feel pessimistic,"" he said, explaining there were many examples of technical advances and political actions underway to combat the problem.

The IPCC was set up in 1988 to give governments an expert assessment of how the climate is changing, and why. It will release the latest section of its fifth lengthy report at the end of this month.

Each of its assessments has confirmed what it says is unequivocal warming, caused largely by emissions of carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas.

However, carbon emissions have kept steadily increasing over the lifetime of the IPCC and last year rose to more than 400 parts per million, the highest level in millions of years.

Average global temperatures have already risen 0.85C over the past century, and governments have agreed this rise should not exceed 2C, though there is evidence that even 1.5C of warming could be risky.

Sea levels have also risen and Arctic summer sea ice has retreated faster than many scientists were predicting only a few years ago. Meanwhile, there is evidence that heatwaves are increasing in intensity in some parts of the world, along with heavy rainfalls.

The IPCC's new report is expected to confirm that the cost of containing climate change will rise the longer governments wait to reduce emissions.

Dr Pachauri said: ""We will be looking at the costs of mitigation in next month's report but in our last report in 2007, we said if you want to stabilise temperature increases to no more than 2C - 2.4C at the least cost, then 2015 is the year when C02 emissions will need to peak.""

The world's governments have made two big attempts to come up with a global agreement on cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the past 17 years.

The first was the 1997 Kyoto protocol, a treaty that was supposed to lead wealthy countries to cut their emissions by about 5 per cent from 1990 levels.

It has been seen as a failure because the US, then the world's largest emitter, failed to ratify it and large developing countries such as China, now the biggest emitter, were never bound by it.

The second push came in 2009 at a meeting of world leaders in Copenhagen that was supposed to come up with a new deal but instead ended acrimoniously after failing to produce a stringent, binding agreement.

Governments are now negotiating a new binding treaty that is due to be agreed at the end of next year [2015] in Paris, and take effect from 2020.

There are already concerns that this attempt will also founder.

However, the head of the UN body that organises the negotiations, Christiana Figueres, said in London this week there was evidence governments now trusted each other to act far more than they did in 2009 at Copenhagen, especially China and the US.

""I am very hopeful about the US-China conversation and confident that both will be leaders in the agreement,"" she said, pointing out Washington and Beijing had been holding their own talks about boosting co-operation on climate change.

In addition, each has been taking domestic action to curb emissions. China has said it will rein in emissions from coal-fired power plants that are contributing to dangerous levels of air pollution, and has also launched pilot carbon markets.

The Obama administration has taken steps to regulate coal plant emissions.

In addition, Ms Figueres said a report this month by the Globe International legislators group found nearly 500 climate laws have now been passed in countries around the world, up from fewer than 100 in 2002 and under 40 in 1997.

Among 66 nations accounting for almost 90 per cent of global emissions, eight passed key climate legislation last year, while another 19 made what Globe called ""positive advances"".

However some countries, notably Australia, had taken steps to repeal existing climate laws and the combined sum of governments' actions so far is unlikely to halt rising emissions soon.

Green bonds crusade against
climate change

By Andrew Bolger



With billions of dollars of investment required to cope with climate change, the market for ""green"" bonds that finance environmentally friendly projects has taken off - and is forecast to grow rapidly.

Green bond issuance is estimated to have increased more than fivefold last year, with Dealogic recording 29 deals worth a total of $11.2bn. Already this year 11 bonds have been issued, worth a total of $3.78bn, so the surge is continuing.

Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, called for a doubling of the global market for green bonds to $20bn by September, when the UN convenes a high-profile climate summit. He added that it should reach at least $50bn by the UN climate negotiations in Paris by the end of next year.

The market has just been given a further boost with the recent publication of voluntary guidelines for such bonds by a consortium of leading banks including Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and JPMorgan Chase.

The green bond principles recognise several broad categories of potential eligible green projects, including renewable energy, energy efficiency (including efficient buildings), sustainable waste management and land use (including forestry and agriculture), biodiversity conservation and clean transportation and water.

Marilyn Ceci, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase, says increasing the amount of capital targeted to address pressing environmental challenges such as climate change is critical.

""By providing transparency and integrity to the green bond market and bolstering investor confidence, we expect the green bond principles will expand capital allocation to projects that provide environmental benefits,"" she says.

Mr Kim called the principles a key step toward attracting more financing for renewable energy and clean technology, especially for emerging markets where the green growth financing gap is significant.

""We need to seize the opportunity, one that many financial leaders have been calling for,"" Mr Kim said at Davos. ""Let's use appetite for green bonds to expand the universe of investors who are investing in green assets.""

Rachel Kyte, World Bank vice-president and special envoy for climate change, says green bonds create a crucial new flow of finance for low-carbon development. ""But they do more - they have the potential to move the finance fulcrum in a cleaner direction, away from traditional fossil fuel investments and into the projects that will build our low-carbon future,"" she says.

In Tunisia, green bonds issued by the World Bank help improve efficiency in irrigation and reliable water supply in rural areas where groundwater sources are stressed. In China, they help reduce communities' vulnerability to natural disasters through flood control management and warning systems. In Colombia and Mexico they support energy efficient mass transit systems, and elsewhere, renewable energy projects.

Most green bonds to date have been issued by supranational organisations such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank. But recent corporate issuers include SSE, the utility group, which was raising funds for an offshore wind farm, and Bank of America.

In November EDF, the French power group, launched the first euro-denominated green bond issued by a large corporate. The $1.9bn bond had a maturity of 7.5 years, and an annual coupon of 2.25 per cent. EDF says the issue was twice oversubscribed and was a great success among institutional investors and also achieved the group's aim of attracting new investors.

""This strong demand specifically came from investors integrating environmental, social and governance criteria in their investment decisions and which accounted for 60 per cent of the issuance allocation,"" says EDF.

Navindu Katugampola, vice-president at Morgan Stanley, says his bank was one of the leading underwriters of green bonds last year, with seven deals worth $4.75bn.

""We believe that the green bond principles will help act as a catalyst to develop this rapidly growing market, by providing a clear set of voluntary guidelines for issuers, investors and underwriters,"" he says.

Zurich Insurance Group recently said it aims to to become largest global green bonds investor, with an initial target of $1bn.

""Green bonds are a good fit with Zurich's overall investment strategy as well as its impact investing aspirations, targeted to support sustainable development and resilient communities,"" says Cecilia Reyes, chief investment officer with the insurer. ""It is an opportunity to invest both with impact and at a return fully compensating for the risk.""

  Earthlings, engage rationally with climate change

  Rational engagement would consider there to be a risk that human-caused climate change is real (whether at the IPCC's ""95 per cent certain"" level or not); that, if real, it would flood coastal areas, displace many millions of people and cause hardships greater than most wars; that once it happened, the carbon-dioxide levels causing it would take hundreds of years to reverse; that any reaction will take many decades (development of new technologies and introduction of these to our capital stock of buildings, vehicles and machines), and that we should therefore start now to work on the Plan B of a carbon-free economy.  Most people are fierce in defence of their children and grandchildren from potential risks to their wellbeing. Climate change, if it happened, would be among the greatest of these risks.  Mr Caldwell's article is a vivid illustration of how far removed the debate still is from a truly neutral pursuit of our own and our children's welfare.  James Denman, Berlin, Germany  From Mr James Denman.  Sir, Christopher Caldwell's article ""A cruise that will cost the climate campaign dear"" (January 4) is a telling comment on the climate debate just not in the way that he intends it. A ship getting stuck in ice has little bearing on the question of whether an entire planet is warming and what we should do about it that much should deserve no further debate.  Rather, the jeering tone of climate change sceptics he reports on and echoes in his writing goes to the heart of the issue. A Martian would be fascinated by the extent to which emotion and prior belief dominate the climate change discussion (on both sides, but more prominently on the sceptic side): ""Why do these Earthlings, faced with a potentially existential question, spend so little time rationally engaging with it and so much time lining up in two opposing groups and loudly echoing the views of the others in their group? Don't they care about the risk it might be real?""  Rational engagement would start with reading the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Summary for Policymakers (27 pages at www.ipcc.ch, which take a lot less time to read than many who have not read them spend pronouncing on them) and with a coolheaded search for objective and nonpartisan opinion beyond this.

 UN warns over climate change cost
  By Pilita Clark in London 

 Panel fears global GDP to feel 2% hitCrop yields likely to fall in warmer areas  The impacts of climate change  are already widespread and likely to cost up to $100bn a year to address, the most comprehensive assessment of global warming's effects in seven years is due to warn.  A summary of the latest report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , the world's leading climate authority, is being finalised by government officials and researchers in the Japanese city of Yokohama this weekend.  World gross domestic product could shrink up to 2 per cent if global temperatures rise by a widely predicted 2.5C, says a draft summary, dated March 25. Wheat, rice and maize crop yields are likely to decline in warmer regions in coming decades, though they may improve in cooler places in the short term.  Trying to figure out the costs of adapting to these impacts is still difficult but the price tag could range from $70bn to $100bn a year for developing countries alone, the draft says.  The summary for policy makers being finalised in Japan is the most closely watched section of the huge report due to be published on Monday. It sums up 30 underlying chapters that more than 300 authors from 70 countries have taken four years to complete.  It addresses the impacts of climate change, a subject that engulfed the Nobel Prize-winning IPCC in controversy after its last study in 2007 said the Himalayan glaciers could melt as early as 2035, a finding it later retracted.  A row has already broken out over this year's report, with one senior author taking the unusual step of asking for his name to be removed from what he says is an overly ""alarmist"" summary of the IPCC study.  Economist Professor Richard Tol from the University of Sussex said earlier drafts of the summary had emphasised the potential benefits of climate change and the prospect of successful adaptation.  However, the latest version highlighted the risks, including the ""silly"" finding that people in war zones were more vulnerable to climate change, he told the FT from Yokohama. ""People in Syria may be vulnerable to climate change at the moment, but it's probably not their first priority,"" he said. ""Reading this document you could come away thinking climate change is our biggest concern. I don't think that's true at all.""  Prof Tol is a member of the academic advisory council of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , a British think-tank that frequently criticises the reliability   of climate science and the cost of policies to address global warming.  He has been criticised in turn by Bob Ward, one of the hundreds of reviewers who comment on the IPCC's assessments, from London's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics  ""Professor Tol is wrong to describe the summary as alarmist because it simply summarises the state of knowledge from the existing literature,"" said Mr Ward. ""He personally appears to believe that the risks posed by climate change are relatively small but he is on his own in believing that.""  Mr Ward also complained to the IPCC in January that some of Prof Tol's research in the report contained small errors and played down the economic impact of climate change.  The panel's latest report is the second of three lengthy studies in its first big assessment of the climate in seven years. The first in September, on the science of climate change, concluded humans were ""extremely likely"" to be the main reason global temperatures had risen since the middle of the 20th century. A third report, on how to stop or reduce climate change, will be issued next month.  Many effects of climate change that the panel says are already evident can be seen in any suburban garden, as plants flower earlier and birds migrate home sooner. Other impacts are less visible, such as fish moving to cooler waters, acidifying oceans and melting glaciers.   "

UN study says climate change
already hitting food supply

By Pilita Clark in London



The most comprehensive study in seven years of the effect of climate change has found an ill-prepared world is already suffering from effects evident across the oceans and on all continents, including lands growing crucial food crops.

The most notable effects have been on the natural environment, according to the 30-chapter report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's most authoritative climate body. These include the extinction of a small number of species, the acidification of the oceans and melting glaciers.

However, in a departure from its last major assessment in 2007, the IPPC makes the striking finding that global warming is affecting two of the world's most important food crops and may be linked to food price rises.

""Climate change has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global aggregate,"" according to a 48-page summary of the report, which was finalised by its authors and government officials in the Japanese city of Yokohama over the weekend.

Since 2007, it adds, ""several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of current markets to climate extremes, among other factors"".

""This is a radically different picture of how climate change is impacting food production, compared with what was in the 2007 report,"" said Tim Gore, head of policy for food and climate change for aid agency Oxfam.

""In its previous report, the IPCC was sanguine about how climate change is hitting harvests. This report is categorical that climate change has already meant significant declines in net global yields of staple crops like wheat and maize.""




The effects of climate change on two other crucial foods, rice and soybeans, have been smaller in the most important producing countries, the IPCC says, and there may be some positive effects on crops in cooler climates in future.

However, the outlook for wheat, rice and maize production in tropical and temperate regions is expected to be more negative than positive.

This is the second of three major reports the IPCC is releasing, following one in September on the science of climate change, which found that humans were extremely likely to be the main reason global average temperatures have risen since the middle of the last century.

A third study will be released in April on ways of stopping the climate from changing.

Much of the report on impacts published on Monday lists gloomy findings about the potential disruption to all forms of life in a warming world, from advancing spring times that could affect animals' food supplies, to water scarcity, power interruptions and heatwaves that could make human life far more miserable.

A few possible benefits of climate change are mentioned, such as higher crop yields in cooler regions and better fish catches in some places as marine species move from warming waters. Deaths related to extreme cold weather may also decrease.

But these benefits are substantially outweighed by the many downsides identified in the report, which has taken 309 researchers from 70 countries some four years to complete.

&lt;&gt; Chris Field, the US scientist who co-chaired the study's working group of researchers, said the findings reflected the reality of an issue that was not necessarily the ""downer"" it was often perceived to be.

""It is true that we couldn't find very many benefits of climate change,"" he told reporters before the report's release on Monday. ""I believe that's because there aren't that many. We worked really, really hard to identify every benefit we could find.""

But this did not mean there were not a large range of important opportunities ahead as governments and businesses worked to adapt to a changing climate, he said.

""Climate change is a really challenging set of issues, there are lots of things to be concerned about,"" he said. ""But I really feel like one of the things that's made it so difficult for individuals and countries to be serious about climate is that the agenda is such a downer.

""I think the opportunities for dealing with climate are really exciting.""

 Leading climate scientists in clash over 'silly' statements on report
  By Pilita Clark in London  

Two of the world's leading cli mate researchers have clashed over a report on the impact of global warming and rising sea levels. The chief author of the study by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change challenged the views of an economist drafting a key chapter.  Chris Field, professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, made the comments about Professor Richard Tol of the University of Sussex in the UK, a senior author of the report's chapter on climate change's economic impacts.  Prof Tol revealed last week that he had asked for his name to be removed from the study's summary the most widely read section of the IPCC report because he believed it was too ""alarmist"" and included ""silly"" statements about the vulnerability of people in war zones to climate change.  However, Prof Field, co-chair of the IPCC working group that produced the weighty report, said Prof Tol was outside the mainstream scientific community. He suggested that the economist was upset because his research had not been better represented in the summary.  ""When the IPCC does a report, what you get is the community's position. Richard Tol is a wonderful scientist but he's not at the centre of the thinking. He's kind of  out on the fringe,"" Prof Field said ahead of the report's release.  ""We have other authors who are out on the fringe on the other side and I can assure you that every one of the 309 authors on my report thinks that his or her research is under-cited and is not adequately represented in the findings of the overall report.""  Both men took part in discussions over the weekend in Yokohama, which finalised the summary for policy makers highlighting the main findings of the 30-chapter report, the most authoritative study of climate change impacts since the last major IPCC report in 2007.  An early draft of the summary last week, based on Prof Tol's chapter, had said that if global temperatures rose by 2.5C, it could lead to losses of between 0.2 per cent and 2 per cent of world GDP. Some economists believe that warming would actually have a far greater impact and the final summary reflects this uncertainty.    "

Bogus prophecies of doom will not
fix the climate

By Richard Tol



Humans are a tough and adaptable species. People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. We survived the ice ages with primitive technologies. The idea that climate change poses an existential threat to humankind is laughable.

Climate change will have consequences, of course. Since different plants and animals thrive in different climates, it will affect natural ecosystems and agriculture. Warmer and wetter weather will advance the spread of tropical diseases. Seas will rise, putting pressure on all that lives on the coast. These impacts sound alarming but they need to be put in perspective before we draw conclusions about policy.

According to yesterday's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a further warming of 2C could cause losses equivalent to 0.2-2 per cent of world gross domestic product. On current trends, that level of warming would happen some time in the second half of the 21st century. In other words, half a century of climate change is about as bad as losing one year of economic growth.

Since the start of the crisis in the eurozone, the income of the average Greek has fallen more than 20 per cent. Climate change is not, then, the biggest problem facing humankind. It is not even its biggest environmental problem. The World Health Organisation estimates that about 7m people are now dying each year as a result of air pollution. Even on the most pessimistic estimates, climate change is not expected to cause loss of life on that scale for another 100 years.

Rising temperatures may even be beneficial at first. Many more people die in unusually cold winters than in unusually hot summers. Carbon dioxide helps plants grow, and higher ambient concentrations make them less thirsty. These benefits are rapidly outweighed by the harm that occurs as warming becomes more pronounced, and are probably gone with a 2C rise. Incremental impacts turn negative once temperatures rise by about 1C - a level that seems unavoidable regardless of what we do with greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate change is complex and its impacts more so. We have limited knowledge of the consequences of the modest change that has occurred in the past. There is even more uncertainty about the effects of the rapid change expected in the future.

Poorer countries - which are more dependent on agriculture and tend to be in hotter places - are much more vulnerable to climate change. If Britain's climate becomes more like Spain's, it can copy that country's regime of siestas, late dinners and houses that keep the heat out. But hotter places will need to invent new coping mechanisms from scratch. They are also likely to have fewer resources, and may not have access to the needed technologies.

To protect London against the rising sea, the Thames Barrier will need to be replaced. This is expensive but it will be done. Bangladesh is also vulnerable to a rise in the sea level; it has a hard time coping even with current floods. However, it is about as poor as another low-lying, densely populated country was a century and a half ago when it started its first big flood-safety programme - the Netherlands. It did so because it had a strong government capable of decisive action. As long as that is lacking in Bangladesh, the country will be vulnerable to climate change. But its core problem is political.

Malaria is another example. It was once endemic in Europe and North America. But clouds of pesticide killed the mosquitoes, and draining of inland wetlands reduced their habitat. Today malaria is confined to poor countries. Climate change will make the disease worse. Economic growth will make it go away.

In the worst case, climate change could cut crop yields in Africa in half. Yet yields would increase tenfold - in the same climate, on the same soil - if subsistence farmers started using crops and techniques pioneered on experimental farms. Climate change may be a big issue in Africa. But it is not nearly as important as lack of tenure, poor roads, roving warlords and so on.

Cutting emissions is not the only way to reduce the impacts of climate change. Adaptation and development are alternatives. But these trade-offs are rarely discussed. More than 15 per cent of all development aid is now spent on attempts to prevent climate change. Is that the best way to help the intended beneficiaries? Or does it reflect the donors' priorities?

None of this is to say that climate change is not a problem that needs to be solved. We cannot let the planet grow warmer and warmer. It will take decades at least before carbon-neutral technologies saturate the market. We had better start now.

But emissions reduction is not the only way to keep the impacts of climate change in check. Yesterday's IPCC report - repeating its prophecies of doom if emissions are not curbed - missed an opportunity to advise policy makers on how to improve lives.

Exxon warns global warming
targets 'unlikely' to be met

By Ed Crooks in New York



ExxonMobil, the US oil group, said it is ""highly unlikely"" that the world will cut greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to keep global warming within the internationally agreed limit of 2C.

In two reports on the implications of climate change for its business published on Monday afternoon, Exxon rejected suggestions that policies to cut emissions would leave many of its oil and gas assets ""stranded"": incapable of being profitably developed.

It accepted that carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil fuels were raising global temperatures, and that warming created risks, but argued that the threat needed to be weighed against other objectives, including the need for energy in developing countries.

Ensuring that the rise in temperatures stayed below 2C would mean cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, and putting a price on carbon far in excess of levels those now prevailing in the EU's emissions trading scheme, costing the average US household thousands of dollars per year, it said.

""The scenario where governments restrict hydrocarbon production in a way to reduce GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions 80 per cent during the outlook period [to 2040] is highly unlikely"", one of Exxon's reports said.

It added: ""Based on this analysis, we are confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become 'stranded'.""

Exxon's projections suggest that fossil fuels are likely still to be providing three quarters of the world's energy in 2040 - an analysis that is close to that of other forecasters including the International Energy Agency, the rich countries' watchdog.

Investors including Arjuna Capital, a sustainable investment firm, and As you Sow, a shareholder activist group, had filed proposals for Exxon's annual meeting in May calling for the company to give its assessment of the risks to its business presented by climate change and emissions policies. The proposals were withdrawn after Exxon agreed to publish its reports.

Large international oil companies have responded in differing ways to growing investor pressure over stranded asset risk.

Chevron, the second-largest US oil company by market capitalisation behind Exxon, has rejected similar investor proposals for disclosure on carbon risk, and faces a vote at its annual meeting.

BP also dismissed concerns earlier in March, writing in its sustainability review this month that ""we believe that the unburnable carbon approach to assessing the impact of potential climate regulation on a company's value oversimplifies the complexity of the issue and overstates the potential financial impact.""

Royal Dutch Shell plans to give its views on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in its sustainability report, due next month, and Total of France also plans additional disclosure on the issue.

Incomplete climate models lead to
complacency

 Sir, Richard Tol makes the valid point that action on climate change should be coolly compared with other investments (""Bogus prophecies of doom will not fix the climate"", April 1).

But his conclusions rest upon dangerously incomplete economic models that ignore critical risks and the failure to recognise that business as usual is taking us towards global warming of 4C, not 2C.

He cites figures, based on his own work, from the new report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which suggests that further global warming of 2C could cause losses equivalent to between 0.2 and 2.0 per cent of global income.

But the IPCC itself has warned that these numbers omit many of the impacts of climate change, including potentially catastrophic risks such as the irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet and resultant sea level rise. These are risks that would undermine economic growth and development across the world.

Prof Tol is on firm ground with his conclusion that ""we had better start now"". Climate scientists have shown current trends in annual global emissions of greenhouse gases to be more consistent with warming of 4C than 2C, which would create much higher risks of catastrophic impacts.

Although a 4C increase is not yet unavoidable, there are massive lags created by the lock-in of high-carbon energy infrastructure and the relatively slow response of the Earth's climatic system to rapidly rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Accelerated cuts in emissions are required to avoid the biggest risks.

The economically rational prescriptions are a strong carbon price, support for R&D to reduce costs of cleaner technologies, and measures to address related market failures.

Prof Tol's article unfortunately demonstrates that economic analysis based on incomplete models can lead to pronouncements about the risks of climate change that are at best complacent, and at worst reckless.

BBC coverage of climate science
under fire by MPs



Public bodies, including government departments, the Met Office and the BBC, are failing to communicate climate science effectively, MPs say in a report today.

The all-party Commons science and technology committee concluded after an extensive inquiry that government agencies do not inform the public adequately about the scientific reasons for acting against climate change caused by human activity.

""Efforts to create a clear narrative that is coherent, constructive and results in proper public engagement have been disappointing,"" the report says.

It calls on the government not only to rely on individual scientists to address the public on climate change, but also ""as a matter of urgency, draw up a climate change communication strategy and implement this consistently across all departments"".

Andrew Miller, committee chairman, said: ""The mandate to act on climate can only be maintained if the electorate are convinced that the government is acting on the basis of strong scientific evidence, so ministers need to do more to demonstrate that is the case.

""All ministers need to acquaint themselves with climate science and clearly and consistently reflect the government approach in all their communications, especially with the media.""

The MPs are unhappy about most media coverage of climate science, with the BBC as the leading public service broadcaster singled out for particular criticism. The report says BBC programmes ""continue to make mistakes in their coverage of climate science by giving opinions and scientific fact the same weight"".

Climate change and risk
management

Martin L Weitzman, Professor of Eco-
nomics, Harvard University, Cam-
bridge, MA, US

Prof Martin L Weitzman.



From Dr Gernot Wagner and Prof Martin L Weitzman.

Sir, Richard Tol asserts that ""Bogus prophecies of doom will not fix the climate"" (Comment, 1 April). He's right to highlight the importance of adaptation measures to deal with the worst, but he's wrong in presenting climate change as a problem with seemingly certain temperature outcomes.

It's not the near-certain warming of 2C that should worry us the most, though that might be damaging enough. The core problem is that we are deeply unsure of the relationship between high greenhouse gas concentrations and eventual high temperature changes like 4C or 6C (or possibly higher). And we are even more unsure about the relationship between high temperature changes and future climate-change damages, or how to discount these future damages into today's values.

Climate change, in the end, is a risk management problem. A lot of it has to do with buying insurance against worst-case outcomes. Far from declaring the notion of existential risk ""laughable,"" as Dr Tol does, we should focus seriously on these high-impact events to help drive our decisions around pricing carbon today. And price carbon we must.

Energy industry told to face reality
of global warming



The UN's top climate change official has issued an unusually blunt message to the oil and gas industry that it must radically overhaul its business model to meet the realities of global warming.

Three quarters of fossil fuel reserves need to stay in the ground if the world is to stop global temperatures rising beyond the internationally agreed limit of 2 degree Celsius, said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

""And the fossil fuels we do use must be utilised sparingly and responsibly,"" she told a meeting of IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues.

Ms Figueres warned the industry its oil and gas assets may become ""stranded"" as climate regulations prevented them from being profitably developed.

Exxon, the US oil group, rejected such a suggestion earlier this week, saying it believed it ""highly unlikely"" governments would take the sorts of steps needed to keep temperatures rising beyond 2 degrees.

Exxon's view is understandable.

The world's governments have made two attempts to forge a global agreement to reduce the atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide emissions produced by burning fossil fuels in the past two decades.

The first was the 1997 Kyoto protocol treaty, followed by UN climate talks in 2009 in the Danish capital, Copenhagen.




&gt;Neither effort succeeded and countries are now negotiating a new treaty to be agreed at the end of 2015 in Paris.

However, Ms Figueres said the negotiations towards 2015 were just one of a series of policy pushes on climate change likely to affect the fossil fuel industry.

""At the city level, citizens are increasingly demanding policy that ensures public heath, energy security and water supply,"" she said.

""At the national level, leaders are incentivising clean energy and efficiency and migrating toward resilient infrastructure and supply chains.""

Continued investment in expensive, difficult projects is already beginning to negatively affect the bottom line of fossil fuel companies, she said, even before considering stranded assets scenarios.

""Policy increasingly reflects these physical realities,"" she said. ""The highest CO2 concentration in over 800,000 years is potentially an unmanageable systemic risk not only to the environment but also to the global economy.

""Because of this, policy at all levels is undoubtedly and inevitably moving towards low-carbon.""

Many oil and gas companies have backed voluntary initiatives to address climate change, but these now needed to be stepped up, Ms Figueres said, adding: ""The time for experimentation, for marginal changes and for conditional response is now over.""

The industry could diversify into cleaner forms of energy, or promote carbon pricing, or other steps to reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas.

But to prevent the worst effects of climate change, a radical and fast transformation towards a low-carbon energy mix would be required.

The Panel, the world's leading authority on climate change, last year presented its strongest case yet that humans were the main reason global temperatures have risen since the 1950s, mostly because of fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which are used to generate electricity around the world.

Temperatures have already risen by 0.8 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution and governments formally agreed at UN climate talks in 2010 they should not rise beyond 2 degrees.

However, there has been little sign since then of any slowing of the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion that are the main man-made greenhouse gases scientists say are warming the atmosphere.

Scientists seek climate-friendly
cow of the future

By Barney Jopson in Washington



A White House climate initiative has boosted a quixotic search for the ""cow of the future"", a next-generation creature whose greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by anti-methane pills, burp scanners and gas backpacks.

Carbon dioxide from fossil fuels is the primary man-made gas warming the planet, but methane is far more potent and the US's biggest source of it is its 88m cattle, which produce more than landfill sites, natural gas leaks or hydraulic fracturing.

The Obama administration's launch last month of a plan to curb methane emissions has given fresh relevance to climate-friendly technologies for cattle that range from dietary supplements and DNA gut tests to strap-on gas tanks.

Juan Tricarico, director of the Cow of the Future project at the Innovation Center for US Dairy, an Illinois research institute, said the initiative had boosted his quest to create the ""star athlete"" of the bovine world.

""For us it is very encouraging because it basically demonstrates that important players out there are thinking in similar ways to us,"" he told the Financial Times.

But he said there were common misconceptions about where cattle methane comes from. ""Ninety-seven per cent of all the methane gas is released by the front end through burps, not from the back end,"" he said.

Based on his research priorities, the dairy cow of the future will be the unstressed inhabitant of spacious accommodation, munching on anti-methane gourmet grains that are processed by an efficient, best-in-species digestive system.

""We want it to be more productive, we want it to be healthier, we want it to be a problem-free cow,"" said Mr Tricarico.

Methane accounts for 9 per cent of US greenhouse gas emissions and does not linger in the air as long as CO2, but it has a global warming effect more than 20 times greater than CO2, the White House says.

However, financial barriers are hampering the adoption of tools to limit methane from cattle, as was the case with early technology to curb pollution from power stations and motor vehicles.

The costs are prohibitive for dairy and beef farmers and the kind of research that could make the tools more cost-effective would require public funding.

C-Lock, a South Dakota company, sells a feeding station that gives animals dietary supplements such as basil to cut methane production and measures the content of their breath by pulling it towards trace gas sensors with a vacuum.

Patrick Zimmerman, C-Lock's founder, says prices start at $45,000 but stresses the economic benefits of improved efficiency. ""Of the energy the animals eat, 3 to 15 per cent is lost as methane and that's a waste,"" he says.

At Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology, scientists have created backpacks that collect gas via tubes plugged into cows' stomachs. A typical animal emits 250-300 litres of methane a day and researchers say this could be used to power a car or a refrigerator, but Jorge Antonio Hilbert of the institute says the tanks' use on a large scale is ""totally improbable"".

Jonathan Gelbard of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, says: ""Anyone who can come up with a cost-effective way to harness that methane is going to make a lot of money.""

Ilmi Granoff of the Overseas Development Institute said an alternative to controlling cattle emissions would be to cut the number of cows.

""Forget coal, Forget cars. The fastest way to address climate change would be to dramatically reduce the amount of meat people eat,"" he said. ""But that involves cultural preferences and they are difficult to touch.""

Climate change is a fashion disaster
By Gary Silverman in New York

The great and the good gave it another go this week. Led by Hank Paulson, the former US Treasury secretary, a bipartisan group of prominent Americans issued a report aimed at stirring conservative interest in global warming.

The study does its best to scare the right wing, warning of more killer storms, devastating coastal floods and other horrible things unless we do a better job of limiting the emission of greenhouse gases.

But I suspect it will take more than scientific data to unnerve US conservatives who blanch at the mere mention of climate change - and reckon that any warning about the weather is a ruse employed by federal bureaucrats who want to meddle with the private sector.

If environmentalists want to get the right really riled up, they should talk about the fashion implications of global warming. Sure, there are more pressing issues for our planet. But there are few better suited to the political demands of our time.

Let's face it, if it gets much hotter, people are going to dress differently - and that poses a clear and present danger to the sartorial underpinnings of our traditional American way of life.

Simply put, more heat and more humidity mean less clothing - and maybe no clothing at all, in some circumstances. If conservatives think that our young people dress inappropriately in public places now, imagine just how scantily clad everyone is going to get if Mr Paulson's report is correct.

By this century's end, it says, the average American will have to endure 45 to 96 days a year in which the mercury will top 35C. In places such as the great plains of the central US or the southeast, it will be that hot for even longer.

As a result, I would anticipate a fashion situation approximating that of an unexpurgated Britney Spears or Beyoncé music video. Wherever you look, there will be thongs and halter tops, daring decolletage, bared abdomens, buttocks and backs, and exposed flesh of both the male and female variety bathed in sweat - more, in other words, than many of our conservative friends can handle.

Golfers and other summer athletes will have to give up their shirt-and-trouser combinations and dress more like swimmers or those martial artists we see rolling around on the floor together in US television's Ultimate Fighting Championship.

This could suit svelte competitors along the lines of a Rory McIlroy or a Tiger Woods but I hate to think what will happen as pudgier players of the Kevin Stadler or John Daly ilk bend over their putts.

Nor will semi-nudity remain the province of the young and the restless. The elderly and even the infirm will have to shed clothing in public to avoid being consumed by the heat. As our well-inked millennials age, all those tattoos in relatively private places - of pretty poppies and peacock feathers, Chinese characters and Maori symbols - will whither in full view of subsequent generations, as if they were so many raisins in the sun.

The death knell could even sound for that great symbol of bourgeois rectitude and patriarchal authority: the male necktie. It seems like only yesterday that the well-executed Windsor knots of Ronald Reagan functioned as something of a symbol for the US conservative movement he led. But the neckwear that was fit for a Gipper has fallen on hard times as a new generation of executives has taken to dressing like teenagers.

Further rises in our temperatures could relegate these respectable, but obviously restricting, accessories to the same status as spats or the top hat. Tomorrow's US alpha male will not be the buttoned-up sort of times gone by. He will bare his chest, and probably wax it as well.

It all adds up to an American fashion disaster of Janet Jackson-wardrobe-malfunction proportions - speaking, of course, from the perspective of our Judaeo-Christian heritage. Americans of all kinds will be showing more skin, in more places, threatening to distract those among us who trying to focus their thoughts on their faith and families.

Of course, none of this proves that the planet is getting warmer. But it raises the stakes for conservatives, and suggests a new way forward for Mr Paulson and his cadre of well-meaning friends in high places.

It's all well and good for them to trot out more research and call for a carbon tax to limit fossil fuel use. But if they really want to save the world, they should include more pictures in their next report of people shedding their clothes to cope with the sweltering heat. It's a way to get more clicks online, you know. "

Climate change disasters
avoidable, say scientists

Call for move away from fossil fuels

By Clive Cookson in London



Disastrous effects of global warming can still be avoided, the world's leading climate scientists say, but only by making a concerted international effort to cut carbon emissions through heavy investment in renewable and nuclear energy sources.

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's third report of a trilogy on global warming, released on Sunday, focuses on ""mitigation"" - how to fight rising temperatures by limiting the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

""This is a message of hope,"" Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chairman of the group that wrote the report, told the Financial Times. ""It can be done, but it means moving away from business as usual to avoid dangerous interference with the climate system.""

The main objective is to keep the average worldwide temperature rise below 2C, the internationally agreed target that would avoid catastrophic global change.

The report, based on 1,200 scenarios from scientific papers analysed by 31 modelling teams around the world, concludes that global greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by between 40 and 70 per cent compared with 2010 by mid-century. By 2100 there should be minimal net emissions - or even ""negative emissions"", which means extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by growing trees on a large scale or scaling up technology still in the early stages of research today.

Big changes in investment, particularly in the energy industries, will be required to achieve the 2C goal. The report estimates that investment in power generation from conventional fossil fuels should fall $30bn a year, while investment in low-carbon plants (nuclear, renewables and carbon capture) rises $147bn a year. Total global annual investment in the energy system is about $1,200bn today.

In addition, the IPCC says investment to improve energy efficiency in transport, buildings and industry needs to rise $336bn a year.

The economics of mitigation are a particularly controversial issue in climate policy. The report acknowledges that estimates of the net costs vary widely according to assumptions, model design and technologies available.

It concludes that an ambitious fight against climate change will cut annualised economic growth by somewhere between 0.04 and 0.14 percentage points, with 0.06 percentage points the most likely figure. This would leave global consumption in 2050 just 3.4 per cent lower than under the ""business as usual"" scenario.

The most immediate need, said Mr Edenhofer, is to end ""the renaissance of fossil fuels, particularly coal for power generation in China, India and elsewhere, that we have seen over the past decade or so. To solve that problem, we need to put a price on carbon, which reflects the emerging scarcity of disposal space for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.""

Most environmental groups welcomed the report. But Lord Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, author of an influential economic review of climate change, was disappointed that the IPCC did not go further. ""This report should have provided a much stronger warning about the dangers of delay and been much clearer about the immense risks from unmanaged climate change,"" he said.

The final stage in the IPCC fifth assessment round will be the release in October of a ""synthesis report"" that pulls together this analysis with the two previous reports on the physical science of climate change and its impacts .

At the same time, the political process of trying to reach a binding international agreement will continue, with a UN climate summit scheduled for September in New York. The next milestone will be a meeting in Paris at the end of 2015, which is supposed to agree comprehensive and legally binding measures to fight climate change on a global basis.

""International co-operation is key,"" said Mr Edenhofer. ""Putting in place the international institutions needed for co-operation is a challenge in itself.""

Time to change the political climate



The past five years have been a bad time for those fighting against climate change. Since the chaotic failure of the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, political leaders have been focused on other issues while the world pumps carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, although scientists point to growing evidence of climate change such as melting Arctic ice and more extreme weather, their arguments are undermined by the fact that the simplest measure of global warming - average temperature across the world - is not rising in line with earlier predictions.

In this difficult environment the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is publishing its fifth assessment - a series of reports produced by hundreds of authors running to many thousands of pages. Taken at face value, these reports should inject a new sense of urgency into the political process of reaching a binding global agreement to restrain the build-up of greenhouse gases.

Last month the IPCC analysed the dire impacts of climate change, from declining agricultural yields to water scarcity, heatwaves and reduced biodiversity. This month's report shows that carbon emissions continue to rise, driven by economic and population growth. Although it may still be possible to cap the global temperature rise to 2C, the internationally agreed target intended to avoid catastrophic effects, this will require a radical change in energy policy, with greatly increased investment in renewables, nuclear and energy efficiency.

Given that the reports represent middle of the road consensus statements by a huge contingent of scientists, economists and others, it makes sense to take their findings seriously. Indeed some experts, including climate economist Lord Nicholas Stern, feel that the IPCC should have warned more strongly about the dangers of delay and the risks of unmanaged warming.

Yet the IPCC faces extraordinary - almost visceral - hostility in some quarters. A sceptical minority seems to regard it as a self-serving conspiracy designed to trick governments into spending billions of dollars more on climate research. Nothing short of a sensational rise in global temperature is likely to win them over.

More realistic is the prospect of enthusing the majority, who accept the reality of man-made climate change but are rather apathetic about tackling it. This will require a quality of writing and argument in the ""synthesis"" report - which the IPCC plans to bring out in the autumn as the final offering in this fifth assessment process - that exceeds anything produced so far.

In particular the economic cost benefit analysis of climate change and its mitigation needs improvement. The most recent report gave a reassuringly low figure for the cost of an ambitious fight against global warming: it would shave between 0.04 and 0.14 percentage points off annualised economic growth, which is assumed to be 1.6 to 3 per cent under a ""business as usual"" scenario. But there has been no meaningful attempt to compare this with the costs (or benefits) of climate change itself.

Of course, the science and technology, politics and economics of climate change are immensely complex. But it should still be possible to present the risks, benefits and options for action more clearly in good time for the next really big event in the climate calendar - a summit in Paris at the end of 2015, which is meant to achieve the comprehensive and legally binding global agreement that the Copenhagen event failed to reach.

Although failure in Paris would still leave scope for action by individual nations, regions and cities, the battle against climate change must rest on the bedrock of international co-operation.

A wakeup call on the impacts of
climate change

 Sir, Your excellent editorial ""Time to change the political climate"" (April 21) is right to highlight the need for politicians to understand better the risks posed by unmanaged climate change, which will continue to grow unless action to cut greenhouse gas emissions is accelerated. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have been rising because of weak and inadequate climate policies, increasing the probability of potentially catastrophic impacts, such as the irreversible melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which contains enough water to raise global sea level by about 6m.

Politicians in rich industrialised countries, including the US, need to wake up to the fact they will not be able to insulate themselves from all of the potential economic and social impacts, both direct and indirect, of unmitigated rises in greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. The US Congress, in particular, should recognise that there are limits to how resilient the world's largest economy can make itself to changes in the climate that pose a mounting threat to the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people at home and around the world.

The US's Third National Climate Assessment, due to be published in final form in the next few weeks, will warn that climate change is already affecting the American people, with worse still to come. A comprehensive analysis of the economic risks of climate change in the US, which has been overseen by Michael Bloomberg, Hank Paulson and Tom Steyer, will also spell out this summer how exposed and vulnerable the nation is to impacts, such as sea level rise and shifts in the patterns of extreme weather. These national reports, together with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, should end the arguments among federal and state lawmakers about whether there are severe and growing risks from climate change, and instead focus debate on how best to manage them.

Compelling case for global deal on
climate, says UN

By Ed Crooks in New York



The need for international regulation to tackle the threat of climate change is ""much more compelling"" now than at the failed talks in Copenhagen in 2009 because of the mounting evidence of the effects of global warming, the UN' top climate official has said

Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said she expected a draft agreement of less than 50 pages, including a goal of zero net greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century, to be ready for discussion at climate talks in Lima at the end of the year.

Speaking to the Financial Times in New York, she accepted it would be a ""tall order"" to transform the world's energy system to reach that goal, but said she expected advances in technology to make it possible.

Hopes of a global climate agreement face a critical two years, culminating in what is intended to be the decisive meeting in Paris in December 2015.

The last international push towards a deal collapsed at the Copenhagen talks, and recently some countries have moved to weaken their curbs on greenhouse gases.

Japan said in November that its shift away from nuclear power following the Fukushima disaster meant its emissions would rise by 3 per cent between 1990 and 2020, instead of falling 25 per cent as it had promised in 2009. In Australia the coalition government is pushing for repeal of the country's carbon tax.

In the EU, there is fierce debate over the cost of policies to boost renewable energy and cut emissions, while in the US, although President Barack Obama has launched regulatory moves to control greenhouse gases, there is no chance of climate legislation passing through Congress.

However, Ms Figueres argued that conditions were now more favourable for a global deal. About 30 countries or groups of countries - counting the EU as one - have climate legislation, and many more have targets. Even China has a carbon dioxide emissions market covering seven cities, and policies for improving energy efficiency and developing low-emissions power from nuclear and renewable sources.

""It's very difficult to have international regulation before you have enough national legislation,"" Ms Figueres said.

""It's [now] much more of a building process, where the process is to integrate national efforts out of national interests with the global effort out of global interests.""

She also argues that evidence of widespread effects of climate change, from record temperatures in Australia to droughts in the US, will help push countries towards a deal, in spite of the apparent pause in global warming, with average temperatures roughly flat since 1998.

""True, there's not terribly much variation here [in the past decade],"" she said.

""But the average of this decade is substantially higher than the previous decade, and that decade is substantially higher than [the one before]. So the direction of travel is very clear.""

The new treaty is expected to be more flexible than the plans for limits on national greenhouse gas emissions that were proposed and rejected at Copenhagen. Countries will be able to offer a range of approaches, including emissions limits, reductions in the greenhouse gas intensity of their economies, and specific measures such as improvements in energy efficiency.

Previously, the UN jargon talked about countries' ""commitments"" to curbing emissions; now they are called ""contributions"", in an attempt to reassure governments that they will not be asked to make promises that they cannot keep. This less rigid approach, however, has problems of its own.

""There will be a major gap between the sum total of their contributions and where we have to be in the second half of the century,"" Ms Figueres said.

""That's the gap that we need to think very creatively around. How do we best optimise technology, finance, policy, to be able to fill in that gap in a manner that is feasible for corporations and countries?""

As Ms Figueres acknowledges, the transformation of the world's energy sector that will be needed to achieve the emissions cuts she is talking about, including reduced reliance on oil and gas, and ""very little"" coal, is a daunting challenge. But she argues that technology will make it possible.

""Look at the advances in the telecommunications industry over the past 30 years . . . That is the kind of technological advance we will see in energy,"" she said.

""If you had told me when I was in college that I would have a little thing that could do 1,000 times more than a mainframe computer, I would have laughed my head off. But that is the kind of revolution that has to occur - and will occur - in the energy sector.""

Australian heatwave shows man-
made climate change, scientists
say

By Jamie Smyth in Sydney and Clive Cookson in London



The extreme heatwave griping southern Australia forced the suspension of matches at the Australian Open tennis tournament on Thursday, as temperatures soared to 42C in Melbourne and officials warned of escalating risks of bush fires and power outages.

Tournament organisers implemented an extreme heat policy and stopped matches played on outer courts, which do not have retractable roofs. Temperatures are forecast to reach 44C in Melbourne, putting pressure on electricity networks struggling to cope with surging demand. Government officials have warned of health risks caused by the extreme heat amid reports of increases in cardiac arrests.

A third day of 40C-plus temperatures has focused attention on scientists' warnings that heatwaves are one of the clearest examples of man-made climate change and Canberra's recent decision to scrap a carbon tax introduced to curb emissions.

An interim report published on Thursday by the Climate Council, a non governmental group staffed by Australian scientists, found heatwaves in the country are becoming more frequent, lasting longer and the hottest days are becoming even hotter. It blames increased greenhouse gas emissions for the intensity of the heatwaves.

""Australia has always had hot weather. However, climate change is loading the dice toward more extreme hot weather,"" said Professor Will Steffen, author of the report.

The Climate Council was formed following a decision by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government to scrap a formal state Climate Commission, which was set up to provide reliable information on climate change.

Australia's second severe heatwave in a fortnight follows confirmation by the Bureau of Meteorology that 2013 was the country's hottest year on record. Average temperatures were 1.2C above the long-term average, breaking the previous record set in 2005 by 0.17C.

""Rising temperatures in Australia are a signal of climate change that has emerged very clearly from recent analysis,"" said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the UK Meteorological Office Hadley Centre. ""Last year's temperatures were a long way outside the envelope of variability that we would expect in the absence of climate change.""

Climate change is harder to detect unambiguously in regions such as northwest Europe where there is greater natural variability. ""Temperatures in the Arctic have risen by more than those in Australia but the signal there is not as clear,"" added Mr Stott.

Sarah Perkins, an expert on Australian climate extremes at the University of New South Wales, pointed out that the latest heatwaves were taking place in the absence of El Niño, the periodic warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean. ""We usually expect to see hotter temperatures at higher frequencies during an El Niño phase, yet we've seen hot event after hot event when the modes of climate variability are not conducive to this,"" she said.

When El Niño returns, heatwaves may become even more severe - bad news for summertime events such as the Australian Open.

""Today, 30 minutes after the match I could not walk,"" said Ivan Dodig, a Croatian tennis player on Wednesday. ""I was thinking I could maybe even die here.""

Extreme heat poses risks to both humans and wildlife. ""When average conditions are exceeded over a period of time by continuously high night-time and daytime temperatures, heat stress becomes a critical factor in human survival and infrastructure resilience,"" said Alisdair Hainsworth, assistant director for weather services at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Fire chiefs have warned of the severe danger of bush fires on Friday when winds are due to pick up and temperatures remain extremely high. Authorities in Victoria said on Thursday that 1,000 fires had been reported over the past two days and 40 were still burning. Adelaide, the state capital of South Australia, is forecast be the hottest city in the world with a temperature of 46C.

Electricity demand has reached record levels prompting blackouts in some areas. Ten thousand homes lost power in Melbourne on Wednesday afternoon and the government in Victoria has warned that 100,000 properties may face power cuts in the next two days.

 EU sets out new climate change goals 
 By Christian Oliver in Brussels and Pilita Clark in London 

 Brussels has taken a step back  from the ambitious environmental agenda that made the EU a global green leader with a new set of energy targets that emphasise the need for economic growth and industrial competitiveness.  A keenly anticipated climate and energy blueprint unveiled on Wednesday requires member states to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030, extending an existing goal to cut emissions 20 per cent by 2020.  The new target is relatively stringent compared with other developed countries.  in a victory for  However, industry groups and countries such as the UK, the 2030 targets do not include another mandatory goal to increase the amount of energy EU countries generate from renewable sources such as wind power and solar plants.  Nor do they spell out how to boost energy efficiency.  Instead, the package unveiled by the European Commission proposes a goal to produce 27 per cent of energy from renewables by 2030, but says it will be up to individual countries to decide how to meet it.  This was a recognition that renewables were no longer a ""small baby in the pram"", said one senior commission official, but had now grown to be ""a fully fledged teenager"".  The 2030 package, which builds on current 2020 targets launched seven years ago, also in effect gives the green light for shale exploration throughout the region.  And it includes a series of studies and papers that address industry complaints that the 2020 targets launched before the eurozone crisis and global recession undermined EU competitiveness by making energy too costly.  These included a report showing how high EU industrial electricity prices were compared with trading partners such as the US and China, and a paper calling for a ""European industrial renaissance"".     Commission officials said this was in line with a need to ""mainstream competitiveness"" throughout the bloc.  ""The 2030 framework sets a high level of ambition for action against climate change, but it also recognises that this   needs to be achieved at least cost,"" said EU energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger.  another binding renewables target while Germany, which is shutting down its nuclear reactors, had lobbied for binding targets.  Environmental groups say the 40 per cent emissions reduction target is still going to be too low to stop global temperatures rising to potentially dangerous levels.   The targets drew immediate scorn from renewable energy groups and green campaigners who said the commission was lowering its environmental ambitions.  ""The previously far-sighted and ambitious European Commission is a shadow of its former self, hiding behind the UK and other backward-looking member states and lobbies,"" said the chief executive of the European Wind Energy Association, Thomas Becker.  However, some business groups said they were pleased with the turnround.  ""It is positive that the pack of measures published today acknowledges the challenge of high energy prices in the EU and addresses the risk of investment leakage better than in the past,"" said Markus J Beyrer, director-general of BusinessEurope. Connie Hedegaard, the climate commissioner, rejected the idea that Europe's desire to lead in green energy was holding the EU back against US and Asian competitors, noting renewables had already created 1.2m jobs in Europe and stood to create 3m by 2020.  ""How many sectors do we have in Europe that contribute so much to job creation?"" she asked. ""It is a strategic question for Europe: do we want to leave these expanding markets energy efficiency and renewables to the Chinese, South Koreans and others?""

 Climate change and the V-word 
 By Gillian Tett

  Once again, politicians are wailing about the weather. Just over a year ago, the east coast of the US was ravaged by Hurricane Sandy. Now North America is reeling from another bout of heavy snowstorms and record low temperatures. Meanwhile, the UK has been hit by floods and other parts of the world have struggled to cope with hurricanes, heatwaves and so on.

Little wonder that there has been hand-wringing from politicians about climate change and extreme weather shocks. Or that the World Economic Forum declared earlier this month that one of the key risks stalking the world is a renewed round of environmental shocks due to climate change: ""Environmental risks, such as climate change, extreme weather events and water scarcity, have become more prominent since 2011, while health-related risks (pandemics and chronic disease) have become less so.""

But as those Davos luminaries ponder the problem of climate change, they should take a peek at a thought-provoking piece of research conducted by David McDermott Hughes, an anthropologist at Rutgers University. Five years ago, he travelled to Trinidad and Tobago to analyse how the chattering classes of that small island country discussed environmental problems in their national political debate and overseas dealings. Unsurprisingly, he found that the Caribbean state was deeply concerned about climate change. Trinidad and Tobago is surrounded by vast, capricious oceans and, in recent years, has suffered from hurricanes, droughts and fires. Since the islands are low-lying, there is also particular concern about the prospect of rising sea levels if, say, the polar ice caps were to melt.

When Hughes listened to the local debates, he noticed that the politicians repeatedly referred to themselves as ""victims"" of global warming. The assumption was that the Caribbean nation was being harmed by the reckless climate abuse of other wealthier countries, particularly in the ""north"" (ie the US and Europe).

But there is an irony here: Trinidad and Tobago is not just a passive victim of climate change but a perpetrator too. Most notably, the nation has offshore oil rigs and ranks 38th in the world in terms of oil production, producing more than Bahrain and Ecuador combined. In terms of carbon emissions per capita, the nation was the fourth worst offender in the world. However, this second point, Hughes discovered, was almost never explicitly acknowledged by politicians; instead, climate change was invariably discussed as something being imposed from beyond. That V-word - ""victimhood"" - dominated the debate.

In the global scheme of things, this example might seem trivial. And since Trinidad and Tobago is poor, its local population certainly has reasons to feel aggrieved about the behaviour of wealthier countries over many issues, including the environment. But what is perhaps most interesting is that it is not just Caribbean nations that talk about victimhood in relation to climate change; on the contrary, if you analyse how the European and US media cover extreme weather events on their own shores, that V-word keeps appearing.

. . .When Hurricane Sandy hit, families living on the US east coast were described as victims of climate change; so too during the recent UK floods. Environmental change is presented as something we all suffer passively, rather than actively influence.

And that, in turn, illustrates a bigger question relating to the word ""victim"", and the degree to which it has become a convenient cultural category in modern policy debates, both in the west and emerging markets. ""Victimhood increasingly constitutes a 'slot' [in the climate change debate],"" Hughes writes, referring to the work of Michel-Rolph Trouillot, a fellow anthropologist, who defined a cultural slot as ""an enduring category of thought and inquiry"". As such, Hughes suggests, it echoes the way that ""barbarian"" or ""savage"" was used in medieval Europe - a convenient shorthand that conceals otherwise ambiguous or uncomfortable debates. ""Like the 'savage slot' or the 'tribal slot', the victim slot artificially clarifies an inherently murky moral situation,"" Hughes suggests. ""It whitewashes - as innocent - societies, firms and industrial sectors otherwise clearly complicit with carbon emissions and climate change.""

To the credit of those Trinidad and Tobago politicians, Hughes reports that their rhetoric is starting to change - a touch. Groups such as the WEF are echoing this shift by engendering a stronger sense of collective responsibility about the environment among the corporate elite.

But the next time that a big weather shock hits, listen closely to the language politicians use - and, yes, journalists too. And if you hear the word ""victim"", take note; not least because of the impact that this has on another ""V"" category: voters. "

COP21: Paris climate talks
extended until Saturday

Pilita Clark and Michael Stothard in Paris


Talks on a new international climate deal are to continue into Saturday, a day after they were due to end, after negotiators wrangled into the early hours of Friday morning over the extent to which wealthy countries should continue to lead the fight against global warming.

Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, told French news channel BFMTV that he would present a new text of the agreement on Saturday morning, aiming to seal an accord among almost 200 nations at around midday.

The move was widely expected, since UN climate talks rarely finish on time and this meeting is more fraught than most. Delegates are aiming to reach a new global deal six years after the last attempt collapsed in heated disputes in Copenhagen.

The French hosts of the Paris talks had still hoped to buck the trend this year and finish on schedule, releasing a 27-page draft of the agreement at 9pm on Thursday in an effort to capture the dozens of compromises needed to finalise the accord.

""We're extremely close to the finishing line,"" Mr Fabius told weary delegates before ordering them back to negotiations.

But his hopes were scuppered by the same string of disagreements between rich and poor countries that have brought deadlock to climate negotiations for more than 20 years.

The last global climate treaty, the 1997 Kyoto protocol, obliged wealthy countries to cut their carbon emissions, but did not so for countries deemed at then time to be developing, including China - now the world's biggest greenhouse gas polluter.

The new accord is aimed at getting all countries to limit their emissions. Developed nations, led by the US and the EU, also want large developing countries to start pitching in to deliver funding to help the very poorest nations cope with global warming.

But this has run into tough resistance from China, India and a batch of developing countries led by Malaysia, which say it amounts to a dilution of wealthy countries' historical responsibility for climate change.

The latest version of the draft agreement says governments should stick to a previously agreed goal to keep warming below 2C from pre-industrial times, and ""pursue efforts"" to stop temperatures rising more than 1.5C. But the emissions cuts needed to meet these temperature goals have been watered down from earlier drafts.

Previous versions had echoed a call by G7 leaders in June for the ""decarbonisation"" of the global economy over the course of this century and a specific cut in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 40 per cent by 2050.

This was opposed by several countries, including Saudi Arabia, a leading exporter of fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide when burnt to produce energy.

In a statement explaining their position on Thursday, Saudi delegates said the agreement should ""consider all greenhouse gas emissions and not just CO2"". Policies to reduce emissions ""must cover all sectors instead of focusing exclusively on energy"" and should not ""discriminate against any of the energy sources"", they said. .

The new version of the draft agreement says that countries should try to ensure their emissions peak as soon as possible and then fall rapidly to reach ""greenhouse gas emissions neutrality in the second half of the century"".

This term was not defined in the text but is generally understood to mean a drastic cut in greenhouse gases, the most abundant of which is carbon dioxide. Climate experts, however, differ over the precise meaning and implications of the term.

""Our analysts back in Washington are crunching through the literature on this,"" Jennifer Morgan of the US World Resources Institute think-tank told reporters late on Thursday. She said the draft showed ""there has been significant progress"" made at the talks, and other US and EU environmental groups broadly welcomed the new document.

But Lucy Cadena, climate justice and energy co-ordinator at Friends of the Earth International, said it would produce ""a deal that fails humanity"".

""After all the warm words of developed countries on a 1.5C limit, the new text contains no obligation to stay under this threshold,"" she said. ""Shockingly, the text could allow for carbon emissions to continue until 2099.""

The latest draft sets out plans for countries to revisit their emissions-reduction plans every five years, starting in 2020 - a central demand of dozens of countries including the US, the EU's members and many developing nations.

""Without the five-year cycles, the agreement is meaningless,"" said Miguel Arias Cañete, the EU's climate commissioner, on Thursday. That was because, he said, the current batch of pledges that more than 180 nations had made for the Paris accord did not add up to enough action to stop temperatures rising above 2C from pre-industrial times - meaning the new agreement had to require regular updating of plans.

However, Gao Feng, special representative for climate change negotiations at China's foreign ministry, said Beijing would not be able to change its climate plans for at least another 15 years. China's plans to limit its carbon emissions covered the 10 years from 2020 to 2030, he said. ""I can't say that in the middle, 2025, we would be in a position to change it,"" he said on the sidelines of the talks.

The draft still contains rival options for several other bitterly contested issues, including making sure countries follow through on their emissions reduction pledges and the type of support that low-lying island countries might get for suffering loss and damage from climate change.

Voters' views on global warming
pose test for US presidential
hopefuls

Climate change



Global warming or hot air? Democratic politicians say climate change is a grave threat to the US. Their Republican counterparts accuse them of alarmism over a non-issue. A close study of public opinion suggests neither stance chimes with a majority of Americans.

Voters are best described as worried but unwilling. They are more concerned about climate change than most Republican politicians, but less willing than Democrats to back potentially pricey measures to curb it.

That creates a test for presidential candidates in 2016.

Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan who has done extensive analysis of opinion polls, says: ""All the evidence suggests there is growing concern about this issue, but limited evidence that that translates to any groundswell of support for any particular policy, especially one that imposes costs.""

Here are six key messages from the polls:

A clear majority of Americans say climate change is real

Seven in 10 Americans say there is solid evidence of global warming - an assertion that is still challenged by many Republicans, even though scientists say it is beyond dispute . The proportion of people who believe in warming has, however, been unusually volatile, according to the University of Michigan, and Mr Rabe says opinion is easily influenced by events. A campaign against President Barack Obama's proposed cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide emissions helped push belief in global warming down to 58 per cent in 2010. More recently, belief has rebounded as more people cite the evidence of weather patterns. Pope Francis's call for climate action also made a difference, says Mr Rabe.

Conservative Republicans stand apart from the mainstream

Political partisanship has a big influence on voter attitudes towards climate change. But the dividing line does not run between the two parties, as often presumed. Conservative Republicans - who have an outsized influence in primary elections - are the only group in which a majority (56 per cent) say there is no solid evidence of a rise in the earth's temperature, according to the Pew Research Center. The views of moderate Republicans are similar to those of moderate Democrats. Tony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, says this could create some rare middle ground for policymakers to exploit.

Americans are more concerned than the Chinese

Americans care more about climate change than their Chinese peers, according to Pew. Forty-five per cent of Americans say climate change is a ""very serious"" concern - below the global average, but above the 18 per cent who rated it as such in China.

Before this month's Paris climate change summit, 62 per cent of Americans said it was at least moderately important that the world reached an agreement to limit global warming, according to Yale polling. Seventy-four per cent wanted emerging economies such as China and India to do more.

But US voters say climate change is less important than other issues

Climate change appears to be a far less urgent issue for Americans when they are asked to rate its importance alongside others. In a Fox News poll in November only 3 per cent of people named it as the most important issue facing the country. Terrorism came out top, chosen by 24 per cent of people who were polled in the days after the Paris terror attacks. In the summer the same pollster found the economy and jobs mattered most, picked by 30 per cent of respondents. Climate change then got 5 per cent of the votes. Such findings have emboldened Republican politicians to dismiss calls for climate action.

Climate change is not even the biggest environmental problem

In a Gallup poll, 32 per cent of Americans said they worried a ""great deal"" about climate change. But more fretted about the loss of tropical forests and species extinction - and the greatest concerns were water and air pollution.

Americans like a variety of climate-friendly policies, but are not willing to pay much for climate action

Viewed in isolation, Americans support a number of energy policies designed to combat climate change. Among those covered by a Yale survey, the most popular with Democrats and independent voters was funding for renewable energy research . Even Republicans liked the idea, but their favourite policy was expanding offshore drilling for oil and gas, which is not seen as climate-friendly.

Yet cost is a nagging concern. Polling by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows people are not willing to pay much more on their monthly electricity bill to solve global warming. The average acceptable increase was about $12 in 2013.

A hypothetical $12 per month from every household could enable any number of climate policies, but experts say it would probably not be enough money to make a serious difference. Republicans are seeking to use voters' cost concerns to score points against Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential frontrunner, arguing her favoured policies would raise utility bills too high and hurt the economy.

Bangladesh plans big jump in coal
power

Climate change: Energy paradox

By Joseph Allchin in Dhaka

 Country says increase is vital to economic development despite environmental risks

Low-lying and densely populated, Bangladesh is among the countries most at risk from climate change and rising sea levels. Yet this vulnerable south Asian nation has ambitious plans to increase its use of coal - a big contributor to global warming - with the help of international donors.

The aim is to increase coal's share of electricity output from 2 per cent to 50 per cent by 2030. Like neighbouring India, which will also be severely affected by climate change, Bangladesh says it has little choice but to expand coal-fired power generation to develop its fast-growing economy, even at the expense of its own environment.

This south Asian paradox is most visible at the Rampal project, a 1,320 megawatt coal plant under construction 15km from the Sunderbans swamplands, a Unesco world heritage site on the Ganges delta that is the world's largest contiguous mangrove forest.

The location for the plant, a joint venture between Bangladesh and India's state-owned National Thermal Power Corp, was chosen near the coast to access shipments of 5m tonnes of imported coal each year. Ships will enter the forest - which is rich in wildlife and home to the Bengal tiger - and transfer their cargoes to smaller vessels at a dolphin sanctuary inside the park.

Potential western financiers, including French bank BNP Paribas and the Norwegian state pension fund, said they would not lend to the Rampal project because it could contribute to what one called ""severe environmental damage"".

Albrecht Conze, then German ambassador to Bangladesh, also criticised the project, but Fichtner, a German engineering company, won the bid to become its chief consultant.

While working at home to remove coal from its domestic energy mix, Berlin continues to finance the export of coal technology. The Overseas Development Institute, a UK think-tank, notes in a joint study that in 2013-14 German international coal-fired power subsidies amounted to almost $1.5bn worldwide.

Bangladesh, like many developing nations, suffers severe energy shortages. An energy ""master plan"" - published in 2011 with the assistance of Japanese donors and Tokyo Electric Power Co (Tepco) - recommended the building of a dozen coal plants around the country, which would help increase the country's generating capacity from 8GW in 2015 to 33GW by 2030.

Industry, including the crucial garment sector, suffers severe power shortages that it mitigates with the use of costly and polluting diesel generators. Heavy generators on upper floors are thought to have contributed to the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in 2013, which killed 1,100 garment workers.

Domestically produced natural gas provides 80 per cent of Bangladesh's electricity, but gasfields are fast being depleted and government regulations, including a ban on exports and subsidised prices, leading some of the lowest prices globally, have discouraged further exploration. The remaining electricity supply is generated by expensive diesel and furnace oil plants.

In spite of protests against new coal plants, Professor Ijaz Hossain of the Bangladesh University of Engineering Technology asks: ""What choice do we have? It's either coal or nuclear. LNG [liquid natural gas] is too expensive."" Rampal will use the most efficient ""ultra supercritical"" technology, exports of which are excluded from a recent OECD ban on coal technology trade.

Japan, which helped to write the energy master plan, is also involved in funding coal plants in Bangladesh. The $4bn Matarbari ""energy hub"" project, near the southern town of Cox's Bazar, will be mostly financed by Jica, the Japanese development agency. This will see an initial two 600MW coal plants operational at the site by 2026, and possibly two more by 2030.

In spite of the promise of relatively efficient coal plants, some Bangladeshis and foreign analysts suspect that foreign donors or suppliers will try to sell power station technology that will lock Bangladesh into a high-carbon economy for decades to come. Professor Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, says ""donors are trying to keep companies afloat by paying them"" to provide Bangladesh with ""the energy of the past"".

Prof Huq says it would be better to save energy by improving the efficiency of transmission; losses through theft and technical problems can run as high as 50 per cent. Bangladesh, he insists, can ""leapfrog"" the centralised, fossil- fuel-reliant model of electricity supply and focus more on renewable energy.

The World Bank seems to agree. It has funded small rooftop solar systems for Bangladeshi homes and says more than 18m Bangladeshis use solar electricity.

Environmentalists worry not only about Bangladesh contributing to the global warming from which it will suffer, but about the immediate damage around plants such as Rampal.

Professor Anu Muhammad of Jahangirnagar University says Rampal will lead to a loss of mangrove cover as land grabbers follow the arrival of transport infrastructure in the area to seize terrain for land-hungry industries.

This, says Prof Muhammad, will threaten not only the flora and fauna, but also a natural barrier of marshland that protects millions of Bangladeshis from cyclones and the rising seas resulting from climate change.

Extreme weather causes chaos
around the globe

Climate change: Rising temperatures

By Clive Cookson, Science Editor

 Scientists say man-made warming is amplifying natural patterns and El Niño effect

Two weeks after the Paris agreement on an international effort to fight climate change, extreme weather across the world is illustrating the impact that global warming is having, in combination with natural climatic variability.

Record December warmth is affecting large areas of the northern hemisphere, including most of Europe and the eastern US, while severe flooding hits places from Paraguay to the north of England.

Climate scientists pin responsibility for the exceptional weather on man-made warming, combined with random variability and El Niño - the natural heating of the tropical Pacific Ocean that occurs every few years.

David Rooke, an expert on flooding and deputy chief executive of the UK Environment Agency, said yesterday that flood preparations needed a ""complete rethink"" as a result of climate change. ""We are in a period of known extremes and we are moving into a period of unknown extremes,"" he told BBC Radio.

The World Meteorological Organisation expects the global average temperature this year to hit a record high - ""the symbolic and significant milestone of 1C above the pre-industrial era"" - as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases resulting from human activities trap more heat in the atmosphere. The Paris accord called on governments to contain global warming to 1.5C, with 2C as an outside limit.

The UK Met Office says the world is likely to become even warmer next year, barring an event such as a large volcanic eruption that pumps cooling dust into the atmosphere. Professor Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at the Met Office, said: ""This forecast suggests that by the end of 2016 we will have seen three record, or near-record years in a row for global temperatures.""

Scientists resist making a direct causal link between global warming and individual weather events but say climate change tends to increase the intensity of rainstorms because a warmer atmosphere contains more moisture and energy. There is 4 per cent more moisture in the air over the world's oceans today than in the 1970s, according to Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the UK Met Office.

December's warmth in relation to long-term averages has been remarkable in the UK. In England the mean temperature of 9.5C is not only 5.1C above average but 2C above the previous record set in 1934 - usually monthly temperature records are beaten by a small fraction of a degree.

Researchers at Oxford university and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) calculated that climate change had made the floods associated with Storm Desmond this month 40 per cent more likely. The storm dropped 34cm of rain on Honister Pass in Cumbria over a 24-hour period, a UK record.

Throughout Europe, ski resorts are lamenting the lack of snow. It is so mild that even snow-making machines are unable to whiten the bare brown pistes; freezing levels in the Alps have been as high as 3,000 metres. St Anton in Austria has had to cancel its Skiing World Cup races scheduled for January.

While the scientific link between El Niño and weather is weak in north-west Europe, the impact of warm waters in the Pacific is much stronger in the southern hemisphere. Parts of South America are always susceptible to heavy and prolonged rainfall during El Niño. Even so, the extent of current flooding in Paraguay and surrounding areas of Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil is said to be the worst for decades, with more than 100,000 people forced to evacuate.

In the US the weather story combines record-breaking warmth in the east with storms that have killed at least 43 people in the Midwest and southern states in less than a week. Most remarkable have been some lethal tornadoes, particularly in Texas; such ferocious twisters are more characteristic of spring and summer than December, when there is normally less tornado-generating energy in the atmosphere.

The next demonstration of the storm-generating power of a warm, wet atmosphere will be felt across the British Isles and north-west Europe over the next couple of days.

""We expect stormy conditions to return midweek,"" said Andy Page, Met Office chief meteorologist, ""as an explosively deepening area of low pressure passes to the north-west of the UK.""

That ""explosively deepening"" depression, dubbed Storm Frank, is expected to cause further flooding in northern England, Wales and Scotland on Wednesday, as well as severe gales.

Business hits at cuts in green
energy subsidies after Paris

Climate change

By Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent



Ministers unveiled a string of subsidy cuts for rooftop solar and other green energy systems yesterday, five days after hailing a climate change accord sealed in Paris aimed at bolstering such technologies.

Support for household solar systems and small wind turbines will be as much as 65 per cent lower than current rates under new tariffs taking effect from February 8. The industry said this would be likely to cause the loss of thousands of jobs.

The cuts are not as steep as those the energy department proposed in August , which would have seen the amount of money paid to households for generating their own solar power cut by up to 87 per cent . But companies said the reductions in support were still a big blow for the industry.

The Conservative government has argued since its election in May that renewable subsidies, which are paid for through household and business energy bills, are likely to become too costly if they are not reined in and the energy department estimates the cuts in support announced yesterday will shave additional costs by £500m to £600m.

""The measures are a slight improvement on the original proposals but still mean that installing solar panels will no longer be attractive to British homeowners,"" said Juliet Davenport, chief executive of the Good Energy power utility.

The reductions in so-called feed-in tariffs, and confirmation that another subsidy system called the renewables obligation would close for many solar power systems, ""suggest that Paris has changed nothing"", said Seb Berry, head of public affairs at the Solarcentury company. ""The increase in generation tariffs for smaller solar photovoltaic installations compared to the ridiculous numbers in the original consultation are welcome,"" he said.

But caps on the amount of installations that could be carried out mean ""this is now a scheme for the few rather than the many"", he added.

Amber Rudd, energy and climate change secretary, said she was determined to ensure subsidies were a temporary rather than permanent practice.

""My priority is to ensure energy bills for hardworking families and businesses are kept as low as possible while ensuring there is a sensible level of support for low carbon technologies that represent value for money,"" she said.

Ms Rudd played an active role in the talks that led to the Paris climate deal, which aims to encourage all countries to lower their dependence on fossil fuels.

After the accord was finalised, she said: ""This deal will ensure all countries are held to account for their climate commitments and gives a clear signal to business to invest in the low carbon transition.""

But the Renewable Energy Association was one of several green power trade bodies that said the new tariffs still fell short of delivering the robust support needed if the UK was to live up to the rhetoric it used in Paris. ""While the changes will help save some in the industry, it remains [the case] that many will be exiting,"" said James Court of the REA.

Paris talks usher in a more active
climate for institutional investors

By John Authers

Whether or not the COP21 Paris conference saves the planet, it appears to have marked a turning point for institutional investment. There are at least two important legacies. First, from now on co-operation between activist investors will be the norm. Allowing activists to gang up on corporate targets is a contentious idea. But institutions should have changed that in Paris.

Big European investors formed the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, with nearly €13tn in assets between them, and peppered negotiators with proposals. It worked with several non-governmental organisations. As Stephanie Pfeifer , IIGCC chief executive put it, coordination on environmental issues is critical and it works.

Second, the notion of investors' fiduciary responsibility has changed and is unlikely to change back. The science of climate change is controversial in the US, but the need for investors to take into account climate risks, not just financial risks, is accepted. Companies with a poor environmental record are a good bet to underperform in future.

In part this reflects a broader and more ambitious view of the role of a big investment fund. The phrase ""universal owner"" is becoming common. The biggest pensions and endowments hold swaths of the equity market, and hence own the negative externalities created by stocks in their portfolio that affect others.

They also have a holistic duty to ensure a good retirement for their members - which arguably includes making sure they have a healthy planet on which to live. Ambitious pension and sovereign wealth funds see themselves as guardians of all their members' interests.

From this follows a new phrase in the lexicon: ""active ownership"". Unlike traditional ethical investing, which does not own the stock of problem companies, or hedge fund activism, which involves aggressive campaigns to improve returns for shareholders, active ownership attempts to reform companies' behaviour on ESG - environmental, social and governance - issues.

Preliminary academic evidence in a paper called ""Active Ownership "", by Elroy Dimson of the University of Cambridge and London Business School, Oguzhan Karakas of Boston College, and Xi Li of Temple University, suggests that it works. They had access to a database kept by an (unnamed) US asset manager from 1999 to 2009, during which it practised active ownership. Crucially, this listed both standard corporate governance campaigns - aimed at improving issues such as board structure - and more ambitious campaigns on environmental and social issues that did not have a direct financial impact.

It listed when the campaigns started and gave a ""milestone"" that the asset manager hoped would be reached, along with information on whether this had been reached.

The strategy worked well. On average environmental and social engagements gained 2.3 per cent above the market, even though the great majority of them were unsuccessful. Successful engagements gained 7.1 per cent, although they tended to flatten once the milestone had been reached. Failed campaigns moved with the market.

Collaboration boosted the chances of success greatly. In environmental and social cases, asset managers that ganged together had a success rate of 47.8 per cent (or 36.5 per cent when they collaborated with NGOs), compared with 13 per cent for all their comparable campaigns. There was also evidence of greater success when the manager came back for a second or third campaign.

The academics found that targets tended to have poor corporate governance, which could get in the way of implementing projects that help their ESG scores, and were concerned about their reputation.

Many successful investment strategies carry the seeds of their own demise, because they attack market efficiencies and make them go away. But this evidence suggests that there have been rich pickings so far, and that the returns in terms of the externalities of universal owners' portfolios could be great.

Companies should get used to the notion that big institutions are going to gang up together to force them to sort out their environmental act.

 European carmakers face climate deal headache  
Joel Lewin
  
  Moody's says that tighter carbon regulations will encourage substitution for less carbon intensive products such as renewable energy, which will further hurt these companies.  It also says that airlines, logistics companies and transport groups will face further restrictions on carbon emissions, warning:  The cost of achieving this efficiency (e.g., by regulating the performance of industrial equipment) could affect energy intensive issuers' credit profiles... potentially weakening their competitive positions  The oil and gas industry is going to suffer to some extent. While explorers and producers will be the most affected, Moddy's says companies involved in refining could actually benefit from the impact of the climate agreement by taking advantage of increased demand for alternative fuels such as biofuel and renewable diesel.  T he climate change agreement  struck in Paris last weekend risks proving a headache for  European carmakers, Moody's says.  European carmakers are likely to face further difficulties, warns Moody's:  In our view, the cost of complying with increasingly tougher emissions standards is significant and, in general, negative for the credit quality of European automotive manufacturers.  In a highly competitive industry already grappling with generally low margins and overcapacity, the probability that these costs can be recovered from a price-sensitive customer base is questionable.  The technical challenge of meeting increasingly demanding fuel efficiency requirements and emission reductions is one of the many risks facing automotive manufacturers over the long term. Indeed, these challenges are clearly reflected in the still evolving case of Volkswagen AG's (A3, negative) emissions crisis.  Unsurprisingly, the credit rating agency also reckons:  Extractive industries, such as coal mining and oil & gas, face significant challenges from more stringent regulation, albeit over an extended period of time.

 Miners under pressure over climate risks  Mining  
Bg James Wilson, Mining Correspondent  Rio, Anglo American and Glencore face investor calls after Paris agreement  Investors want a trio of the world's  largest miners to make greater disclosure of risks associated with climate change, after this month's Paris agreement to limit global warming.  Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Glencore could face shareholder votes next year on whether they should reveal more about how their businesses might perform in a low-carbon world.  The targeting of the mining companies, which are among the largest UK-listed miners of coal, comes after a coalition of investors succeeded in winning similar votes at BP and Shell at their shareholder meetings this year.  Both boards at the groups supported the shareholder resolutions, which were approved with 98 per cent in favour and became binding on the companies.  Glencore said yesterday that it would support the resolution that investors in the Aiming for A coalition intend to put to its annual meeting in May.  Anglo said it was also likely to support a resolution, while Rio said it had had ""constructive"" talks with the group.  The Paris deal on climate change under lines the growing expectation that companies depending substantially on fossil fuels including coal miners, oil producers and power generators will have to adapt their businesses over the longer term.  ""Investors need to revisit their stewardship of companies and companies need to look hard at their business plans for climate change,"" said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at the Church Commissioners, which manages investments for the Church of England. The church is one of the members of the Aiming for A group.  The investor coalition includes other private asset managers and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum. They say they want to make sure their longterm investments are protected against the impact of climate change .  Helen Wildsmith, of CCLA, a specialist investment manager involved with the Aiming for A group, said the investors so far backing the resolutions have a combined $4tn under management.  Resolutions would demand that Glencore, Anglo and Rio show ""strategic resilience"". Each miner would have to report what it was doing to manage carbon   emissions and also how its assets would perform under various scenarios.  The resolutions would also require companies to disclose whether climate change considerations played any part in incentives for executives.  Glencore said it would support such a resolution while Anglo said it expected it would. Rio said disclosure on climate change risk ""is under constant review to ensure we are in line with best practice and are disclosing information that is beneficial to our shareholders and other stakeholders"".

Carbon dated?

FT BIG READ: CLIMATE CHANGE

By Pilita Clark

 The hard-won pact in Paris will not be enough to solve global warming. But many predict it will spur further investment in renewable energy while dealing a long-term blow to the fossil fuel industry. By Pilita Clark

If there was one sound that captured the frantic nature of the talks that led to the Paris climate change deal last weekend, it was the ping of an incoming WhatsApp message.

The instant messaging smartphone app was used by dozens of delegations from the 195 countries involved in the two-week negotiations . Among them were the representatives from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter and one of the countries with most to lose from a robust accord. As haggling over the agreement spilled into a series of private meetings, delegates from more than 20 Arab nations received a stream of WhatsApp messages advising them on what to say in each session.

""A lot of it was intended to marshall the troops to make sure the Saudi position was backed up by at least one other country in the room at all times,"" says one delegate who saw the messages. ""Otherwise their arguments could have been viewed as those of an isolated country.""

The Saudis were deeply opposed to something that many other countries insisted should be in the pact : a goal to stop global temperatures rising more than 1.5C above pre-industrial revolution levels.

Riyadh's unease was understandable. Temperatures have already risen by nearly 1C and meeting the 1.5C target would require heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, a lifeblood of the Saudi economy , to come down much faster than if governments stuck to a 2C warming target agreed at UN climate talks in 2010.

Reaching the 2C goal means energy-related emissions would need to be cut to zero by around 2060 or 2070, according to Niklas Höhne, an author of the latest report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""For 1.5C, you have to be at zero at around 2050,"" he says.

In the end, the Paris agreement said countries should aim to keep temperatures ""well below 2C"" and ""pursue efforts"" to limit warming to 1.5C. It was one of a series of compromises made in the final fevered hours of the COP21 talks that eventually produced a grand bargain among nations with vastly different economies on the fairest way to tackle global climate change .

The question now is, can this pact - born out of such compromises and riddled with non-binding conditions - actually deliver a big enough cut in emissions to curb temperatures that are on track to warm the world by around 3C or more by the end of this century. An increase of that size, say scientists, would intensify the risk of fierce storms, intolerable heatwaves, higher sea levels and melting ice caps.

The UN has been trying to orchestrate a global agreement to limit emissions for more than 20 years, starting with a 1992 accord struck in Rio de Janeiro. This was followed by the 1997 Kyoto protocol, a treaty that required only rich countries to cut their carbon pollution, and a failed attempt to produce a new pact at Copenhagen in 2009.

Fuel for activists

The Paris agreement differs from earlier efforts in several ways. Its new 1.5C target is only aspirational and meeting it would require substantial cuts in emissions and unprecedented growth in existing renewable energy technologies . But its implications will be seized on by advocates who have already translated the 2C goal into a string of campaigns highlighting the amount of coal, gas and oil that needs to stay unburned if such a target is to be met.

The same goes for another goal in the agreement to achieve a balance in the second half of the century between man-made greenhouse gases and carbon-absorbing ""sinks"", such as forests. Another big difference between the Paris pact and its predecessors is that it requires virtually every country in the world, not just wealthy ones, to publish a climate plan every five years, probably from 2020.

Any targets in those climate plans, such as the US goal to cut emissions by at least a quarter from what they were in 2005 by 2025, or China's aim to get its emissions to peak by 2030, are not legally binding for signatories to the agreement. But the plans themselves are mandatory, as is a stronger UN system for monitoring countries' emissions and assessing how they are being curbed.

We have already seen what happens when countries are merely invited to publish voluntary plans, as they were in the run-up to the Paris meeting . More than 180 nations did this, including Saudi Arabia. But it only plans to reduce emissions if its economy continues to grow and there is a ""robust contribution from oil export revenues"".

Still, Riyadh did submit a plan and under the new accord, it will have to table a new one every five years that cannot be any weaker, using a more stringent set of reporting rules. The same applies to the largest emitter, China, which accounts for 27 per cent of global carbon pollution.

Like Saudi Arabia, it was reluctant to support the 1.5C target and other measures backed by a group of countries led by small island states - those most at risk as sea levels rise - that labelled itself the ""high ambition coalition"" at COP21.

Only a day before the agreement was adopted, Liu Zhenmin, deputy head of China's delegation, dismissed this coalition as ""a kind of performance"" or stunt.

But the group included the US, the second-largest emitter. Its diplomacy under John Kerry, secretary of state and a life-long climate action advocate, led to Washington and Beijing jointly announcing climate plans late last year - a move that at the time raised hopes that a Paris agreement could be sealed.

Breakthrough of the Big Two

In the end the US-China relationship proved crucial to Saturday's accord. In the tense moments before the deal was signed it almost came unstuck, but China showed that, despite its officials' public rhetoric, it wanted the agreement to go ahead.

As France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius , was preparing to bang the gavel on the agreement's adoption on Saturday, panic set in after the US delegation saw the final text, drawn up in the early hoursof the morning by exhausted officials.

Unlike previous versions, which said developed countries ""should"" take the lead in fighting climate change, it said they ""shall"" undertake emission reduction targets. This was a legally problematic change for the Obama administration, which wants to sign up to the new deal by executive agreement rather than submitting it to a hostile Senate for consent.

Mr Kerry took one look and said: ""We cannot do this and we will not do this, and either it changes or President [Barack] Obama and the United States will not be able to support this agreement.""

A group of developing country delegates, still nervous about the accord, seized the chance to declare they would not accept any changes.

But as envoys huddled on the conference floor to try to iron out the problem, Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate negotiator, stepped in.

""He said, 'Stop it now, we want this agreement, don't play games with this, it isn't fair',"" says Laurence Tubiana, France's COP21 ambassador. The text was duly changed - ""should"" replaced ""shall"". ""Without Xie, we would not have had an agreement,"" Ms Tubiana told the Financial Times.

The relief in the convention hall was profound. The most important immediate outcome of the Paris agreement is that it was not another flop like Copenhagen. In the aftermath of that failure governments continued to launch climate policies, but opponents were bolstered by the absence of a global agreement committing all countries to take similar action.

The paradox of UN climate negotiations, where all countries have an equal vote, is that they are destined to produce deeply compromised agreements with a limited chance of having a positive impact on lowering emissions. But they can easily have a negative effect on such efforts if they fail in the way the Copenhagen conference did in 2009.

Paul Marty, a senior credit officer at Moody's, the rating agency, says that if Paris had been another Copenhagen, it might have affected even climate policy pioneers such as the EU, home of the world's largest carbon market and some of the earliest solar power subsidies.

""It's likely it would have undermined the EU's long-term decarbonisation policies and targets on the grounds that if the rest of the world isn't doing much, why would EU economies need to make the effort,"" he says.

Declarations of intent

The immediate impact of the agreement was mixed. France's President François Hollande was the first leader to say his government would revise its existing climate targets before 2020 in the wake of the Paris agreement, but few other nations have shown any sign of being willing to join him.

Shares in a number of European and North American solar and wind companies ticked up on Monday; Elon Musk's SolarCity, the biggest residential installer in the US, jumped 12 per cent.

Many market specialists said the rise was likely to be temporary. But Barclays analysts predict that the deal would ""speed up the deployment of renewable and other zero and low-carbon energy sources"".

The initial response from oil and gas companies was a broad shrug, but some coal industry groups were more perturbed about its implications, and especially its 1.5C goal.

Brian Ricketts, secretary-general of Euracoal, a trade body representing the EU coal industry, says: ""That 1.5C might be a target, but it means NGOs will be striving for the complete phase-out of fossil fuels very quickly, which means we will be hated and vilified in the same way slave traders were.""

It was ""bizarre"" to think coal companies could change their business models to adapt to such goals, he says, adding that he feared climate activists' ""mob rule"" was already replacing the rule of law in some countries and the Paris agreement would exacerbate the trend.

Other coal industry executives say the accord ought to bolster their argument that tougher climate targets should translate into more support for technologies such as carbon capture and storage systems that allow fossil fuels to be burnt without harming the climate.

But it may not be long before such systems are competing against newer technologies that eliminate the need for coal, oil and gas altogether.

That is the hope of Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, who announced at COP21 that he had teamed up with other billionaires to get nascent clean energy innovations out of the lab and into the market. This group will work with 20 countries, including the US and China, pledging to double their $10bn combined spending on clean energy research and development over the next five years. It is initiatives like this that could end up doing more to meet the Paris agreement's goals than the accord itself.

Ultimately, it is impossible to know if the pact will make this century the last to be powered by fossil fuels. Even Mr Obama, one of the agreement's strongest proponents, conceded on Saturday that global warming ""is not solved because of this accord"". But it does create ""the architecture for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way"", he argued.

Perhaps that is all that can be expected from UN talks that have taken more than 20 years to get to this stage, and may take another 20 to start fixing a problem that has so far proved insoluble. "

The Paris climate change summit
is one small step for humankind

Martin Wolf

Is the Paris agreement a breakthrough in the struggle to limit the risks of climate change, as weary negotiators claim? Or is it just another way station on the road to calamity, as critics insist. At this stage it is neither. It is far more than the world could have reasonably expected a year or two ago. But it is also far less than the world needs.

As it stands, it will at best slow the pace at which the world reaches a possible disaster. Whether it averts disaster depends partly on how the climate system works, on which much uncertainty remains.

But it also depends on what happens in the near future. Is the agreement the beginning of revolutions in policy, as well as the energy system? Or is it yet another piece of paper that promises far more than it delivers? The answer depends on what happens now.

The achievements of the negotiators, ably chaired by the French government, are far from nothing. They showed that it is possible to get the world's countries to agree to action in response to a shared danger, even one that seems both remote and uncertain to many of those now living.

These agreed that all countries must participate in the effort. They agreed that the rich should help the poor meet their decarbonisation objectives. They also agreed on the goal of keeping global temperature rises well below 2C and even to ""pursue efforts"" to keep them below 1.5C

Yet these are, on the face of it, largely hollow achievements. The provision of needed finance is an aspiration, not a bankable commitment. No limits are to be imposed on emissions from aviation or shipping.

No mechanism is to be established for setting a global carbon price. Countries are above all committed only to communicate and maintain plans - described, in slippery language, as ""nationally determined contributions"".

No sanctions will fall on any country that fails to live up to these intentions. Worse, the intentions themselves, even if implemented (on which much doubt must be expressed) fall far short of what is needed to deliver the 2C goal, let alone a lower one. Average global temperatures have risen by nearly 1C since the industrial revolution and limiting warming to 1.5C would require another revolution.

So why should an agreement that is not only toothless, but falls far short of what is needed to reduce the risks to manageable proportions, be taken seriously? One answer is that it forces each country into a process of peer review.

Every country will need to resubmit their plans every five years. Moreover, the reporting and monitoring system is to be more transparent and comprehensive than ever before. In particular, emerging and developing countries that now dominate emissions (China, above all) will be part of that system. In the end, it was decided, monitored aspirations would be more effective than any binding commitments that could (or, more probably, could not) be achieved.

Above all, with everybody committed to producing a plan (because everybody agrees the challenge is important), it will be far more difficult for any country to argue that failure to meet its promises does not matter. Or so it should, provided the next US president is not a Republican.

Nevertheless, the case for scepticism is strong. Recall that over the past quarter of a century of climate negotiations, emissions of carbon dioxide, stocks of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and even emissions per head have been rising. The task now is far bigger than it would have been if action could have been taken sooner. But growth of the world economy has overwhelmed the fall in emissions per unit of output. If growth is not to be sacrificed (which humanity will not tolerate), this rate of decline must accelerate hugely. That is a daunting challenge. (See charts.)

What really matters is not the Paris agreement, but what follows. The national plans must be ambitious and become more so, swiftly. The world also needs a new pattern of investment and new sources of finance, backed by changed incentives.

One way or the other, a global carbon price will be needed. So will increasing technological innovation. The announcement in Paris of ""mission innovation"" to accelerate advances in clean energy - based on the idea of ""a global Apollo programme"", launched in June - could be a game changer. But it will turn out to be one only if enough financial and human resources are devoted to the task.

Not surprisingly, the reaction of many in the fossil fuel industry shows that it does not, as yet, feel threatened. Political leaders have huffed and puffed before, but demonstrably failed to blow their house down.

The immediate threat for them is low prices of the fuels they produce and sell, not a high price on carbon dioxide emissions. Both the industry and the big users are politically powerful. They may well feel that when it comes to creating national plans and setting priorities, they remain in an excellent position to see off any ambitious commitments, particularly ones instigated by so undemanding a process.

In some countries, notably the US, the opposition will be open and fierce. Elsewhere it will be more genteel. But the results might not be so different.

I sympathise with the enthusiasm of many of those in Paris. This agreement was hard won. But it is only a small step, even if one in the right direction. It is far too early to feel confident that the curve of emissions will now bend decisively downwards. Laozi, the ancient Chinese sage, said: ""The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.""

The question is whether humanity has the will or even the time to finish a journey that it has started so late. "

Climate agreement obstacles rise
as oil and coal groups play down
impact

By Pilita Clark in Paris and Demetri Sevastopulo in Washington



The obstacles facing this weekend's global climate change accord were thrown into relief last night when businesses and government officials played down its impact and US Republicans underlined their opposition.

The Paris agreement, which requires all countries to publish plans to deal with global warming, was hailed by international leaders as a turning point after more than 20 years of effort to make this century the last to be powered by fossil fuels.

Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said the deal was ""the first time that the entire world community has obligated itself to act in the battle against global climate change"", while Pope Francis cautioned it would need ""concerted effort and generous dedication"". It was adopted by nearly 200 nations.

But coal and oil industry executives shrugged off any suggestion that the new agreement sealed on Saturday night would have any immediate impact on their businesses. The goals include driving down carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels as soon as possible to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times and perhaps as little as 1.5C, a target requiring much deeper emissions cuts than most countries are planning.

Amber Rudd, the UK energy and climate change secretary, described the 1.5C goal as merely ""aspirational"" while defending the government's decision last month to scrap £1bn in funding for carbon capture systems that could hold down emissions.

Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association, did not see the new agreement spurring a ""massive change at the moment"" for companies that produce coal because many developing nations planned to keep burning it.

The American Petroleum Institute said it was still reviewing the accord, but Amjad Bseisu, chief executive of EnQuest, a UK oil explorer, said that the oil industry had more immediate concerns beyond the Paris agreement.

""We already look at our carbon costs, but right now the industry has other challenges [with the falling oil price].""

In the US, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, said that the US portion of the deal relied on measures being challenged in court.

The world, together, will fight
climate change





Complicated problems do not generally yield to simple solutions. And few are more complex than the question of how to confront the challenge posed by anthropogenic global warming.

The Paris climate accord, signed amid great fanfare on Saturday by the representatives of nearly 200 states, does not supply the final answer. What it does is to spread the responsibility for finding one beyond a small coterie of developed countries. This in itself is a historic achievement. But its success or failure ultimately hinges on how solemnly its many signatories are willing to accept this weighty charge.

The preparedness of the developing world to accept a share of the burden was always vital if any credible way forward on tackling climate change was possible. Past deals have mainly heaped the onus on those advanced economies that were responsible for much of the historic growth in emissions.

But with China and India alone now responsible for a third of global carbon discharges between them, their presence in any future framework agreed at Paris was essential. Without it, no deal could even have curbed future increases at a global level, let alone started to drive them down.

The French hosts, under the able leadership of foreign minister Laurent Fabius, deserve credit for finally squaring this circle and forging a compromise that both developed and developing worlds could accept. The price, as expected, is the jettisoning for the most part of any pretence at copper-bottomed legal obligations of the sort that characterised the last global deal, the ill-fated 1997 Kyoto accord.

While the deal sets a new tougher objective to limit global warming to ""well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels"" (and, indeed, a stretch goal of 1.5 degrees), there are no binding mechanisms for achieving this. The climate action plans submitted by an impressive 188 of those countries participating do not cumulatively deliver even the less demanding total. They would lead to temperatures rising by some 2.7 per cent. Yet signatories are under no legal obligation to meet even these.

What the plan does require is for signatory states to set out their plans to avert climate change every five years. These must be accompanied by an assessment of current progress, compiled according to a common reporting standard that permits comparisons to be drawn.

The hope is that this will create the necessary framework for regular reviews on progress as the world tries to avoid dangerous warming. It may not be possible to compel countries to meet their targets. But by embedding transparent information exchanges and regular international dialogue into the system, it may be possible to establish new norms of behaviour, whereby countries not only strive to meet targets, but also set more demanding ones.

Inevitably, the deal remains a work in progress. Trust of the sort that will be required to build solidarity will take time to develop. The developed world has not inserted into the treaty its commitment to transfer funds to poorer nations in order to help them adapt to a low carbon future. The commitments beyond 2020 are vague.

Paris is not the end of the matter. It is not even the beginning of the end. The problem will not be solved for years to come. The treaty does however provide a sensible foundation for international co-operation. This opens the door to greater ambition over time. Now a viable path lies before them, countries must show the courage and foresight to take the next crucial steps.

Big polluters see no short-term
change

CLIMATE TALKS

By Michael Stothard in Paris and Kiran Stacey in London

The international accord to limit greenhouse gas emissions signed in Paris over the weekend is unlikely to change -economic choices for big polluting industries in the short term, many executives say.

Oil industry officials told the Financial Times the deal would not affect their immediate investment choices, already shaped by national environmental legislation.

A senior executive at one European utility company with coal assets, who did not want to be named because it was not ""in vogue"" to bash the deal, said: ""We are not too worried to be honest, it does not change much right now.""

Keith Anderson, chief corporate officer at Scottish Power, one of the UK's biggest energy suppliers, welcomed the deal but said that to make a real difference we ""need a stronger pan-European price for carbon"".

Business has been pushing for a global carbon price to be part of the agreement in Paris, but in the end such a price was only given an oblique mention as one way nations can help meet emission targets.

Over time the agreement to keep global temperature rises ""well below 2C"" and make the world economy carbon neutral in the second half of the century should lead to growing pressure on heavy-emitting industries. But this is to an extent hypothetical, at least at present, since the deal relies on voluntary national commitments.

""The immediate implications for business have not changed over the weekend,"" said Jonathan Grant, a director in PwC's climate change team. ""The sharp end of the agreement is in the national plans.""

Some figures have predicted huge changes ahead. Lord Browne, the former chief executive of BP, said last year that energy groups faced an "" existential "" challenge from climate change and the expected energy transition away from fossil fuels.

Coal companies have increasingly been the target of divestment campaigns, with the French government cutting state support this year. Groups such as French oil and gas group Total have been diversifying into renewable energy.

Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, said earlier this year that with the world changing its energy mix, the country could phase out the use of fossil fuels by 2050. He told a conference hall in Paris that the kingdom planned to become a ""global power in solar and wind energy"" instead.

Many business leaders over the weekend said that the biggest impact of the climate deal would be less about discouraging fossil fuels than encouraging investors to support low carbon technologies.

""The global market for low carbon goods and services is already worth $5.5tn a year and this deal will turbocharge the amount of capital chasing new low carbon investment opportunities,"" said Abyd Karmali, managing director for climate finance at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of a European network of institutional investors with €13tn in assets, said: ""This agreement provides an unequivocal signal for investors to help escalate the development of low carbon infrastructure.""

John Kerry, US secretary of state, said that the agreement was ""sending a critical message to the global market place"", adding that only by mobilising trillions in investment could emissions be reduced.

Alongside the Paris agreement other initiatives were launched to try to shift capital towards renewable sources. India and France, for example, launched a global alliance to mobilise $1tn worth of investment towards developing solar power around the world. "

Teeth of accord lies in emissions
scrutiny

CLIMATE TALKS

By Pilita Clark in Paris

Monitoring system should make it easier to see how countries curb
their pollution


The fact that it took the world's governments so many sleepless nights of intense haggling to seal the Paris climate accord on Saturday night is in many ways baffling.

The 12-page pact will be legally binding for the countries that go on to sign it and is the first new global climate deal in 18 years. But it only requires countries to ""communicate and maintain"" plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to meeting any targets in those plans. And the system to make sure governments comply with its provisions is to be explicitly ""non-adversarial and non-punitive"".

The deal pays lip service to the idea of a global carbon price and lays out ground rules that could help link up existing emissions trading schemes, but it does not require an international price to be set.

Nor does it say fast-growing emissions from airlines, or ships must be cut, despite EU efforts to insert a clause aimed at reaching such a goal. It sets a goal for countries to collectively keep global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times and ""pursue efforts"" to keep warming below 1.5C, suggesting carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels that cannot be absorbed by natural carbon ""sinks"", such as forests, or carbon-capturing technology, should be phased out in the second half of the century.

But these are only goals. The teeth in the accord, to the extent there are any, instead are the obligation it places on all countries - rich and poor - to resubmit their voluntary emissions-cutting commitments every five years, probably from 2020, and to do so in a way that has never been done before. At present, there is a two-tiered UN system of rules for reporting and checking up on countries' volume of emissions. It is much stricter for developed countries than those the UN classed as developing in 1992. The latter group includes China, whose 27 per cent share of global carbon dioxide emissions dwarfs that of the US (15 per cent) and EU (10) combined.

The agreement establishes a new, more common reporting and monitoring system that should make it easier to see how much all countries are emitting and what they are doing to curb their pollution. This may be more significant than it first appears. The last legally binding global climate accord, the 1997 Kyoto protocol, only obliged a few wealthy countries accounting for a small share of global emissions to meet pollution reduction targets, and failed to stop emissions rising.

The Paris agreement may not require countries to meet targets (few would have agreed to it if it had) but it does oblige all nations to at least subject their plans to scrutiny every five years in a far more transparent manner than most have ever done before. In return, developing countries wanted the pact to oblige wealthy states to deliver at least the $100bn a year by 2020 they had already promised to help poor ones cope with global warming, and larger amounts in later years.

The US and most other developed countries balked at including this sum in the Paris agreement itself. But the pact does commit them to provide more climate finance to poorer nations and an adjoining decision of the Paris meeting says they should set a goal of more than $100bn a year by 2025.

France's president François Hollande offered a taste of what could lie ahead on Saturday night when he announced he would revise his country's existing carbon reduction targets before 2020 and invited other nations to join him.

His did not find many immediate takers. Even the US, one of the countries that pushed hardest for the Paris agreement, seemed to be caught off guard by Mr Hollande's commitment. ""It's certainly a bold and welcome action by President Hollande,"" said a senior US administration official on Saturday night. But US President Barack Obama had been working ""flat out"" to meet its existing carbon reduction goals, he said, adding: ""I wouldn't expect those targets to be revised.""

The accord will be open for signature from April next year and will only enter force once at least 55 countries accounting for at least 55 per cent of global emissions have approved or ratified it.

US Republican Party lawmakers have vowed to block the first tranche of the $3bn of climate finance the Obama administration offered ahead of the Paris meeting, unless it abandons plans to wave through the accord by executive agreement, and submits it to a hostile Senate for consent. With the US producing about 15 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, the Paris agreement is likely to proceed more smoothly if such legislators do not prevail.

Opec should consider impact of climate change

Sir, Further to Roula Khalaf's Notebook (Comment, December 30) on Saudi Arabia's attitude to oil prices: are the Saudis also considering climate change? Late last year governments met in Lima to talk about climate change and greatly reducing fossil fuel use by 2050.

While this change may seem remote for many, for Opec countries with oil reserves of 50-100 years of production at current rates, it means they have oil that may never be used. Such countries may well want to defend market share to sell as much as possible before the oil becomes valueless.

Perhaps we are seeing the beginning of an end-game, pass the stranded asset, where we find out which countries are left with oil they cannot exploit.

If Opec is responding to climate change, how should oil-importing nations react? They should certainly try to avoid any increase in fossil fuel use resulting from lower prices as that would make the transition to a low-carbon economy more difficult. They should increase carbon taxes to compensate.

In the UK, the new government in 2015 must consider reform of the EU emissions trading scheme, reactivating the fuel duty escalator, and removing the subsidy of a 5 per cent (rather than 20 per cent) value added tax rate on electricity and gas.

Science may hold key to hitting
climate targets

Clive Cookson, Science Editor

To achieve the grand ambitions set out in the Paris climate accord will require huge changes over the next few decades in the energy sources we use for transport, heating, lighting and the provision of goods and services.

With global temperatures already 0.9C above pre-industrial levels, restraining the overall rise this century to 1.5C - the new aspiration - is monumentally challenging, climate scientists say. But they are generally reluctant to sound too negative about a political agreement that is better than most had expected.

""Some are saying that 1.5C is an impossible target - it is not,"" says Piers Forster, professor of climate change at Leeds University. But Professor Kevin Anderson of Manchester University warns: ""There is only a slim chance of maintaining the global temperature rise even to below 2C.""

Progress will depend on financial incentives to wean the world economy off fossil fuels, combined with intensive research and development of non-carbon energy sources. The economic challenge is to find a way to levy a substantial ""carbon fee"" through a market mechanism and/or taxation, which would raise the cost of coal, oil and gas while demand for them was falling.

The scientific and technical challenge is to continue to drive down the cost of alternative sources, particularly solar and wind power but also nuclear, while improving the technology for distributing and storing energy.

Perhaps the greatest need is for better batteries that store electricity with much higher density and charge up much more quickly than those available today. They would not only solve the ""intermittency problem"" of solar and wind power but also enable electric vehicles to surpass the range and performance of petrol and diesel engines.

For shipping and particularly air travel it will be harder for alternative fuels to beat the convenience of liquid hydrocarbons. While manufacturers such as Airbus are beginning to experiment with electric aircraft, these are unlikely to replace liquid-fuelled airliners for several decades. However plant-derived biofuels may be able to substitute for fossil fuels in transport.

For people living in sunnier parts of the world, only a relatively modest improvement in technology would be required for a combination of solar-photovoltaic cells and night-time battery storage to provide an economic and reliable household electricity supply. They could then leave the main electric grid or choose to feed power into it.

On nuclear power, many scientists part company with the green campaigners with whom they have made common cause on other issues during the UN climate negotiations. They see a new generation of smaller and less expensive nuclear power stations - downsized from today's multibillion-dollar monsters - as a valuable contribution to non-carbon electricity generation. In the long run there could be a role for nuclear fusion reactors.

In a future carbon-neutral world, any power stations built to burn coal, oil and gas will have to scrub carbon-dioxide out of their emissions through carbon capture and storage technology. Whether this can be achieved in a practical and affordable way remains to be seen.

However all these measures may not be enough on their own to limit global warming to 1.5C. Prof Anderson warns that success may eventually depend on ""highly speculative ""negative emission"" technologies"" that absorb immense quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere many decades from now.

Laurence Tubiana - Climate change
ambassador

Interview

By Pilita Clark

 The economist chosen to lead the French delegation at this month's UN conference tells Pilita Clark about the importance of candour and why she supports everyday activism

Laurence Tubiana was working as a visiting professor at New York's Columbia University last year, far from her home in Paris, when the phone rang. On the other end of the line was Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, who had a proposition that was about to change Tubiana's life. France had been confirmed as host of a huge UN conference that was supposed to deliver the first new global climate change accord in 18 years. Would she be willing to be his ambassador in the fraught negotiations needed to make it a success?

""I didn't hesitate of course,"" says Tubiana. ""But at the same time I realised it was an enormous job, very challenging, very risky.""

That's a considerable understatement. Her new job, which started in June last year, instantly propelled the 64-year-old economist and environmental policy expert from the calm pools of academia to the centre of some of the most trying global negotiations ever held - and to a senior position in France's formidable foreign ministry.

""Fabius took a brave decision to bring in... somebody who hadn't had a diplomatic career,"" says Nicholas Stern, a British economist and climate change expert who has known Tubiana for nearly 20 years. ""I think it's the case that there was the odd nose out of joint because the foreign office felt this was their big moment and somebody from outside was drawn in.""

In person, Tubiana is not exactly the model of the conventional ambassador. It's not so much her shock of white hair, fondness for skinny trousers or the bright chunky jewellery she wears. It's her feet. Unlike other senior female diplomats, Tubiana is never in heels, spiky, low or otherwise. She wears sneakers. Quite stylish ones at times but always sneakers. This is entirely sensible, given the vast distances that need to be covered at the huge UN climate gatherings. But it is still an exception.

When we spoke shortly before the start of COP21, the UN term for this month's climate conference, she said a horse was to blame. She fell off one during a team-building exercise this year in Paris, damaging some ligaments in her leg so badly she was forced to wear flat shoes. ""Everybody was noticing, it was like a joke, particularly in the ministry of foreign affairs where, you know, that's not the style,"" she said. Undeterred, she bought different pairs of sneakers to match more formal outfits. ""I decided to make a fashion statement out of it. For the COP, I decided to wear a different colour every day,"" she said.

As it turned out, Tubiana had far more pressing physical considerations than footwear choices at the COP. A week before the meeting started, she suffered severe abdominal pain while flying to Paris from South Africa. On landing, she was rushed to hospital to have her appendix removed. She spent the first days of the climate conference, held in a big convention centre on the outskirts of Paris, traversing its vast corridors via an electric scooter with a ""Tubiana mobile"" sign on the front, insisting to anyone who asked that she was fine.

Tubiana may not be a career diplomat but she is no stranger to the workings of the French government. She was an environmental adviser to socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin between 1997 and 2002 and created an international environmental affairs division in the foreign ministry when the centre-right Nicolas Sarkozy was president. But it is her unusual career, spanning the worlds of academic research, non-governmental organisations and the byzantine UN climate negotiations, that led Fabius to pick her for this latest job.

""She knows the entire world,"" says Michel Colombier, research director at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), the Paris think-tank Tubiana set up more than a decade ago. He met her in 1997 when they were on France's delegation to the UN climate talks in Japan that produced the Kyoto protocol, the last global climate treaty reached by the world's governments. Today, her work at IDDRI and a clutch of global academic institutions means she is still close to many of the Chinese negotiators, Indian officials and US envoys involved in the Paris talks.

""She has an incredible capacity for getting people together and finding a solution,"" says Colombier, pointing to her work a couple of years ago on a national committee that helped put France's energy policies on a lower carbon footing. He attributes this to an unprepossessing demeanour that disguises the fact that ""she is someone who knows what she wants and usually gets it"".

Indeed, Tubiana often speaks so quietly that people strain to hear her and she tends to pad rather than stride into a room. But she stands out from the conventional ambassadorial crowd because of her tendency to say pretty much what she thinks.

She acknowledges that she can be ""quite candid"". ""I think it can be a weakness but it can be a strength, because most of the time people trust you or believe what you are saying.""

The reason UN climate talks have plodded on for more than 20 years is that they are aimed at getting countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - which power most nations' economies. Diplomats inside the talks typically tread carefully when it comes to climate change campaigns such as the divestment movement that urges investors to ditch assets in fossil fuel companies. Not Tubiana. She says she supports the divestment campaigners because they have given ordinary people an opportunity to act on climate change. ""I'm very interested in this kind of movement where you take action that can have a global impact,"" she says. ""I think it's very interesting to see that.""

Then there is meat. Many countries involved in the climate talks are home to powerful farming industries and rely heavily on meat export revenues. Senior climate diplomats tend to avoid taking a public stand on meat-eating, even though clearing land to raise methane-emitting cows and other livestock is a big contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Tubiana is not a vegetarian but supports campaigns that advocate at least one meatless day a week. ""I think this campaign of one day without meat and trying to decrease meat consumption could be good,"" she says, especially in countries where ""we are consuming too much"".

Tubiana was born in the Algerian coastal city of Oran, to a lawyer father and interior decorator mother, and moved to Paris as a child. She studied at the prestigious Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris, better known as Sciences Po, whose alumni include four of France's presidents and four of its prime ministers.

It was her interest in international trade, farming and environmental policies that led her to focus on global warming, and periodically to join France's delegations to UN climate conferences. Disarmingly, she says what many climate diplomats think but rarely say about these events: ""I was happy not to go because they are very boring."" Butmany veterans of climate talks were relieved when she was appointed to her current role. ""She's added waves of energy and imagination to the process,"" says Michael Jacobs, a climate adviser to former UK prime minister Gordon Brown who has worked with Tubiana at IDDRI.

It has also demanded an inordinate amount of time from Tubiana, who is divorced with one daughter, a 26-year-old who works in theatre and cinema lighting. She has lost count of the exact number of weekends she has given up in the past 18 months and the working days that have started at 7am and ended close to midnight. She thinks she has made about 45 trips abroad but it could be 50, each one typically requiring a slew of meetings with ministers, journalists, think-tanks and business groups. There have been times when she has literally forgotten which city she was in. One morning, she flew back from a distant city to Paris and got into a cab with an adviser. ""I told her, 'I think I have time to go to the hotel before the meeting' and she laughed and said, 'You're in Paris!"" I had forgotten.""

All that work has meant a lot less time for her favourite pastimes, including horseriding and visits to her farmhouse in the south of France. But she was there on a rare day off on November 13 when the terrorist attacks on Paris shook the city. There was initial speculation that the Paris climate conference could be called off but Tubiana says it was quickly apparent that it had to go ahead. ""What we felt strongly was that there was the support of people saying we should continue and we should maintain the COP.""

Her academic training is evident when she talks about how she approached her role for the Paris climate meeting, designing a strategy that recognised the importance of domestic policies in pushing global action on climate change. The talks in the lead-up to Paris have been based on all countries volunteering climate action plans, drawn from national policies, that would collectively lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions.

More than 180 of the 195 countries involved have put forward such plans since March, the first time so many nations have published so many climate pledges in such a short time. ""It's incredible,"" says Tubiana, revealing that she initially thought there could be as few as 90 plans. The process has led countries to have deep discussions about how they would combat climate change, she says, including some that have long resisted proffering such policies at an international level.

A couple of months ago, she said she thought there was a 70 per cent chance there would be a successful deal in Paris this weekend (the outcome was still unknown at the time the magazine went to press). But she has always known that the task of getting 195 countries to agree on an accord with profound implications for their economies would be immense. ""Process can derail and that's my main concern,"" she says, adding she believes there is still a good chance of an agreement that would make a difference. ""It will not be the perfect one by far. It will not solve everything by far. But I think it will make a difference."" "

COP21: Climate activists target
sceptics in Paris campaign

By Michael Stothard and Pilita Clark in Paris



Paris has seen men running around in green felt tree-suits, a roaring mechanical polar bear and liberal use of face paint.

Amid the light-hearted fanfare generated by environmental activists in the French capital, however, the climate summit has also been notable for a hardening of tone against perceived climate-change deniers - several of whom have been subject to highly personalised campaigns.

Fiona Wild, a representative of the mining group BHP Billiton at the talks, flew back to Australia on Thursday after becoming the focus of an aggressive campaign against individuals in Paris accused of trying to water down the final climate agreement.

Ms Wild and several others had their faces plastered on more than 1,000 large ""wanted"" posters, which were put up around luxury hotels in Paris. The targets were accused of being ""climate criminals"" trying to ""keep fossil fuels at the centre of human development"".

""Wanted"" flyers were also handed out around the Metro stations near the conference centre in northern Paris, where delegates from almost 200 countries are attempting to reach a binding accord to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

A spokesperson for BHP Billiton said Ms Wild flew back to Australia before the end of the summit ""following a very concerning campaign by French activists . . . which incorrectly claimed BHP Billiton [and Ms Wild] were climate-change deniers"".

One person close to Ms Wild said she had also been warned that more personal attacks against her were to come. The BHP Billiton spokesperson called the campaign ""highly personalised and unfair"".

The crusade reflected the generally hostile attitude to climate sceptics in Paris, with senior policy figures making clear that this time they were not welcome and their point of view was no longer valid.

""These people are so out of touch with science that they believe rising sea levels don't matter, because in their view, the extra water is just going to spill out over the sides of a flat Earth,"" said John Kerry, the US secretary of state, to laughter.

Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, the global pressure group that organised the ""wanted"" posters, said: ""Ministers should be listening to their people, not polluters, and [should] refuse meetings with lobbyists.""

Others on the ""wanted"" list included Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association; Marc Morano, who runs the climate sceptic website ClimateDepot.com; Myron Ebell, director of the US think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute; Bjorn Lomborg, Danish author of The Skeptical Environmentalist ; and James Taylor, senior fellow at the Heartland Institute, another US libertarian think-tank.

Some were more relaxed than others about being branded ""criminals"". Mr Morano, who premiered his new climate-sceptic documentary Climate Hustle, responded to a Financial Times request for comment by sending a photograph of himself posing by his ""wanted"" sign with an expression of mock fear.

""You have to wonder how strong their scientific case really is if activists resort to accusing anyone who disagrees of being a wanted criminal,"" he said. ""I did not let any low-brow intimidation tactics impact my trip to COP21.""

Others took it more seriously. Mr Ebell said it was a concern in a ""free society"" that in a conference attended by thousands of environmental non-government organisations, activists would want to ""exclude and silence"" a small group of ""climate realists"".

Mr Sporton said the World Coal Association was ""fully committed to playing a central role in reaching an effective and sustainable outcome in Paris"", while Mr Taylor said it was ""vile"" and ""hateful"" and ""libellous"".

Mr Lomborg denied ""silly"" claims that he was funded by any fossil-fuel interests.

He said he was being attacked for his research showing that the carbon-cutting promises made so far - which will form the heart of the Paris agreement - would cut global temperatures by only 0.05 degrees Celsius by 2100 and would cost $1tn a year.

The stated aim of the Paris agreement is to lower greenhouse gas emissions in order to reduce the expected rise in global temperature by the end of the century from roughly 4C to less than 2C (above pre-industrial levels).

Greenpeace campaigners said they had launched a sting operation posing as representatives of energy companies and offering to pay two climate academics to write papers on the benefits of coal and carbon emissions. They said the offers had been accepted.

The environmental group said this ""exposed how fossil-fuel companies can secretly pay academics at leading American universities to write research"". The two US scientists involved said they had nothing to be ashamed of, and stood by all their research.

Climate recommendations will
apply across all sectors

Sir, It was somewhat puzzling to see the Financial Times label the new report from the Bloomberg task force as insurance news ("" Disclose climate change impact, urges report "", December 15).

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures is headed by Michael Bloomberg and was set up by Bank of England governor Mark Carney in his role as head of the Financial Stability Board. Its recommendations are intended to apply to companies across all sectors around the world to inform decision-making by lenders, investors and financial regulators, as well as insurers.

The task force outlines a set of voluntary reporting guidelines which should put greater pressures on companies such as ExxonMobil, for instance, which has so far ignored shareholders' requests to disclose whether its business strategy is predicated on the assumption that the world will fail to cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous climate change.

A key recommendation is that companies consider a scenario in which the rise in global mean surface temperature is limited to no more than 2 degrees C above its pre-industrial level, to test the impact on businesses of a transition to a low-carbon economy. This is a good start, but it must be remembered that there is much scientific evidence indicating that global warming of 2 degrees C would be dangerous. The Paris Agreement on climate change, which came into force on November 4, aims to hold the average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees C, and no more than 1.5 degrees if possible.

Notwithstanding this caveat, companies should embrace and implement the report's recommendations, or else financial regulators should consider how to enforce compliance.

Regulator warns Trump on overturning climate policies
By Barney Jopson in Washington

The chief architect of President Barack Obama's climate change policies has warned the incoming Trump administration that US law and the scientific evidence of global warming will constrain any attempt to overturn her work.

With the outlook for global climate action uncertain after the US election, Gina McCarthy, the top US environmental regulator, told the Financial Times that climate change sceptics led by Donald Trump would have limited room for manoeuvre.

""It's going to be a very high burden of proof for them,"" said Ms McCarthy, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, outlining why US law would ensure that Mr Trump could not easily abolish climate change regulations.

His presidential victory delivered a shock to global efforts to tackle climate change. Mr Trump vowed in his campaign to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate pact and to end US funding for UN climate programmes.

The president-elect has embraced the Republican party's doubts on global warming, tweeting in 2012 that it was a hoax invented by China. This month he said it was ""a big scam for a lot of people to make a lot of money"", but on the scientific evidence declared: ""I'm still open-minded. Nobody really knows.""

Ms McCarthy said: ""I frankly am disappointed that we're still talking about the science of climate, because that really has been long settled.""

To replace Ms McCarthy, Mr Trump has nominated Scott Pruitt , a politician who has repeatedly excoriated the EPA and made it his mission to try to scupper her signature achievements.

Ms McCarthy said that, just as she had to provide a scientific foundation for her regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions, the Trump administration would be required by the Clean Air Act to show that any attempt to tear up the regulations was scientifically justified.

""If they choose [to] develop a different record then they have a right to do that, but it's going to be a very high burden of proof for them, because I have no question that what we have done will be solid from a science perspective.

""They have to figure out why the climate science isn't overwhelming and go back all the way to the Supreme Court to explain why decisions we've already made are no longer correct, and I wouldn't want to have that burden myself.""

Ms McCarthy warned of the dangers of clinging to climate change denial like ""a religion or a belief system"". She insisted that climate sceptics remained a ""small group"" outside mainstream opinion, even though Mr Trump's victory will put them in positions of power.

As the attorney-general of oil-rich Oklahoma, Mr Pruitt has denounced Ms McCarthy for allegedly violating the law and joined at least eight lawsuits aimed at consigning her work to the scrapheap. Now Mr Trump is offering him a chance to officially dismantle it. After his nomination was announced this month the green group 350.org called Mr Pruitt a ""fossil fuel industry puppet"" and one left-leaning news website published a story headlined ""The End of the EPA?""

Ms McCarthy thinks not. She predicted that Mr Pruitt would find the reality of office to be sobering. ""If you look at some of the background of Scott Pruitt and others, they don't do environmental work,"" she said. ""So some of their arguments don't really rest in the kind of record that you need and the kind of authority that we're given.""

With an overwhelming majority of scientists agreeing that humans have caused global warming, Ms McCarthy warned that questioning that conclusion jeopardised the US's credibility as a leader in other science-dependent fields. ""People need to remember that you can't just selectively undermine the science in one area without undermining science everywhere.""

Noting that most of the rest of the world had pledged to keep cutting fossil fuel pollution despite Mr Trump's vow to quit the Paris deal, Ms McCarthy said: ""We're going to be in the back. And we're going to be in a very lonely place. I think it's only us and Nicaragua that would be there. It's sort of not the company you want to keep.""

But she argued that regardless of government policy, the US energy market was moving towards cleaner energy simply because the cost of wind and solar power had dropped so much. ""If the market is valuing renewables because it's cheaper energy, then I don't know why anyone would disrupt that,"" she said.

Ms McCarthy met Mr Pruitt at a September court hearing over a lawsuit in which he argued that the EPA exceeded its authority by telling states to cut carbon pollution from power plants. The lawsuit has already frozen the implementation of the power sector regulations, the centrepiece of Mr Obama's climate policy.

Before the case reaches the Supreme Court, the Trump administration could choose to abandon the legal fightback that Mr Obama began, leaving the rules to die. In other areas, if the new EPA chief wants to avoid having to justify the repeal of McCarthy regulations, he will have the option of initiating a go-slow on their implementation or denying them funding.

Disclose climate change impact, urges report

Insurance
By Oliver Ralph in London

A task force led by Michael Bloomberg and backed by Mark Carney has urged companies to disclose to investors the impact of climate change on their businesses.

The billionaire media owner and Mr Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, are behind new recommendations designed to give investors, lenders and insurers a better idea about how climate change will affect individual businesses.

Their report comes amid a possible challenge to global efforts to combat climate change. Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, moves into the White House next month and could pull the US out of the Paris climate change agreement. The president-elect has already appointed Scott Pruitt, a fellow sceptic, as head of the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Last year Mr Carney, in his role as chair of the Financial Stability Board, asked Mr Bloomberg to lead a task force that would examine the threats and opportunities presented by climate change. Yesterday the group, called the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, published its suggestions.

Mr Bloomberg said: ""Climate change is not only an environmental problem but a business one as well. We need business leaders to join us to help spread these recommendations across their industries in order to help make markets more efficient and economies more stable, resilient and sustainable.""

The task force wants companies' financial reports to include a discussion of the impact of climate change scenarios and the carbon-reducing policies that are designed to combat them.

Although the FSB cannot force companies to adopt the recommendations, it hopes that they will become common practice across a wide range of sectors.

Mr Carney said: ""The disclosure recommendations will give financial markets the information they need to manage risks, and seize opportunities, stemming from climate change. The task force has focused on the practical, material disclosures investors want and which all capital-raising companies can compile.""

More than 30 organisations, including Aviva, Axa, BHP Billiton, JPMorgan and Daimler, have publicly come out in support of the project.

Thomas Buberl , chief executive of Axa, said: ""As an insurance company, Axa is directly impacted by climate change and - as a major global investor - we are also able to foster adjustment so that climate-related risks are better taken into account among the diverse companies we work with and invest in.""

However, there is some scepticism about the impact of the report. Client Earth, a pressure group, said companies could use the recommendations to avoid their legal obligations.

Alice Garton, ClientEarth senior lawyer, said: ""A company's legal duty to disclose material risks is clear and this duty applies equally to climate risk.

""These recommendations should set the standard for compliance with these existing laws. It is already evident that financial regulators are not providing adequate oversight of climate-related risk disclosures and enforcement.""

Experts play down Trump impact on climate

US threat to pull out of Paris accord would have minimal effect, says PwC

Donald Trump has sent his clearest message yet about his plans for reshaping US policy on global warming by choosing a chief environmental regulator who has questioned the science of climate change

But leading experts say the nomination of Scott Pruitt, Oklahoma's attorney-general, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and the policy he pursues may have less effect than many imagine on global greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr Trump had sent a different signal earlier this week when he met two prominent climate change campaigners at his New York office: first Al Gore, former US vice-president, then the Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

Even as the meeting with Mr DiCaprio took place on Wednesday it emerged that Mr Trump had picked Mr Pruitt for the position at the EPA, which has been at the forefront of US efforts to rein in fossil fuel pollution. The president-elect's decision prompted outraged howls from green advocates and approval from the fossil fuel industry.

Mr Pruitt has spent much time fighting the agency he has been nominated to lead over its Clean Power Plan, a hallmark of the Obama administration's efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector.

He has also raised doubts about climate change, writing in May that the debate over global warming ""is far from settled"" and claiming scientists continue to disagree about ""its connection to the actions of mankind"".

His nomination suggests Mr Trump, who has called global warming a hoax, is likely to follow through on his campaign pledge to pull the US out of the Paris agreement that commits almost every nation to take some form of action on climate change.

Since his November 8 election victory, Mr Trump has been vague about whether he will take such a step. He told The New York Times he would ""take a look at it"", adding he believed there was ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change.

Whatever he chooses to do, he may be constrained by market movements and technological developments.

Analysis by PwC, the financial services group, shows G20 countries need to reduce their carbon intensity - the amount of carbon dioxide they emit for every dollar of gross domestic product they produce - by an annual average of 3 per cent to meet their Paris agreement targets.

Even if the US abandoned the deal it would have a limited direct impact on the overall G20 effort. If all other countries stayed on track to meet their carbon targets, but the US returned to business as usual, the average annual cut for the G20 as a whole would fall only slightly, from 3 per cent to 2.8 per cent.

That is chiefly because of market developments such as the US shale gas boom that has squeezed out coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, a situation some think unlikely to change no matter what Mr Trump does.

""The impact on the global emissions projection is pretty small even if the US shelves its Paris target,"" said Jonathan Grant of PwC. He emphasised the contribution of market and technological shifts to tackling emissions, adding: ""It's doubtful that can be thrown into reverse by one country."" But he said: ""The message the US sends on climate is more important than the maths.""

Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said he hoped the Trump administration would apply pollution rules more evenly so the industry in the US could ""operate on a level playing field"".

Mayors look to tackle climate change at city level
Ed Crooks in New York

The mayors of Atlanta, Cape Town, Paris and Vancouver have pledged to lead a 7,000-city push to combat the threat of climate change, even as Donald Trump's election as US president dims hopes for co-ordinated national action.

The cities, along with Seoul, Quito and others, will join the board of the Global Covenant of Mayors, chaired by Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York, and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, vice-president of the European Commission.

The group's more than 7,000 members have all signed up to work on measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to make cities more resilient to the potential impacts of climate change.

Mr Bloomberg said he expected US businesses, states and cities to continue with action on climate change, even if Mr Trump puts a brake on initiatives at the national level.

""Almost all the progress made in the US was made by corporations and states,"" Mr Bloomberg told the Financial Times. ""What's driving the climate issue is public support.""

Mr Trump has sent mixed signals on his views on the scientific consensus on climate change. Having said on Twitter that global warming was ""a total hoax"" and ""created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive"", he acknowledged in a recent meeting with the New York Times that there was ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change.

In the same conversation, however, he also said his view ""depends on how much it's going to cost our companies"".

Reince Priebus, who will be Mr Trump's chief of staff, told Fox News on Sunday that the new president had an open mind on climate change, but ""he has his default position, which is most of it is a bunch of bunk"".

Mr Trump has said he will ""cancel"" the Paris climate accord agreed by almost 200 countries a year ago, and promised in his ""contract with the American voter"" that on his first day in office he would start work to scrap regulations restricting production of fossil fuels, including coal.

Mr Bloomberg said it was still unclear what the Trump administration would do. ""He said one thing during the campaign, and then another after the election. So it's all up in the air,"" Mr Bloomberg said.

He added that leadership from the federal government was anyway unnecessary for the US to make progress on curbing emissions.

""It would be helpful if the Trump administration turns out to be very environmentally friendly. But [US] companies have closed 230 coal-fired power plants, and that's not thanks to the federal government.""

The Global Covenant of Mayors - formed from the merger of two earlier groups, the Compact of Mayors and the EU Covenant of Mayors - is one of the groups seeking to do more to address climate change than national governments. It brings together the leaders of about 7,100 towns and cities from 119 countries to work on best practice for curbing emissions and protecting against the possible threats posed by global warming.

Its members represent about 8 per cent of the world's population. However, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said, cities in total accounted for about 70 per cent of the world's energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, so supporting them in efforts to reduce those through policies on transport, lighting and waste could have a significant impact.

""We want to invite mayors of other important cities to join,"" he said. ""They have a lot of power in their localities that they can use in the fight against climate change.""

Mr Bloomberg added that, unlike in national politics in the US, environmental policy at a local level was often not a partisan issue.

Quoting Fiorello La Guardia, one of his most lauded predecessors as mayor of New York, Mr Bloomberg said: ""There's no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage.""

Global warming likely to turn UK into top wine producer, study finds
Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent

Fancy a glass of crisp Edinburgh Riesling? How about a drop of Margate Merlot or a cheeky little Sauvignon Blanc from Essex?

Forget Château Petrus. Château Cheshire is on its way, according to researchers who forecast that large areas of Britain could become improbable wine-producing centres of excellence because of global warming.

Growing Pinot Grigio as far north as the Scottish borders or Chardonnay in Shropshire is a real possibility as UK temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change, said Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London.

""Malbec is the one we are most shocked by,"" he said, referring to the popular red wine from Argentina and the south of France made from a grape variety that needs a lot of heat and sunlight.

""For anybody who knows their wines, if you talk about Malbec and say it's possible in the Thames Valley, they are going to go: really? I don't believe this,"" said Professor Maslin. But his study, commissioned by the Laithwaite's wine merchants, suggested this could occur if British temperatures increase by 2.2C by 2100.

Prof Maslin cautioned that climate change alone is not going to be enough to turn the UK into a rival to Bordeaux overnight, since winemaking is ""as much an art as a science"" and also depends on other factors such as soil conditions, slopes and drainage.

And in France, wine experts predicted the research would not leave vignerons quaking. ""I think they would probably find it quite amusing more than anything else,"" said Iain Munson, a British winemaker based in Languedoc, one of the world's best known wine-producing regions.

""I wouldn't think anyone in most of France would actually believe wine was made in England, full stop,"" he said. ""It's like what we British think of French rock music.""

In fact, south-east England has been producing award-winning sparkling wines for many years. Mr Munson said he had used some of them in blind tasting sessions where French wine lovers had enjoyed them.

""When you tell them it's English wine they are pretty much gobsmacked,"" he said.

There was no reason why the UK should not be able to produce excellent wines in future, he added, potentially even for export.

But if global warming is the reason for this, it far from uniformly good news, said Prof Maslin. ""If the British Isles has the climate of south-west France, it means other places in the world are also shifting by equally dramatic amounts,"" he said.

Temperatures high enough to grow Merlot in Margate, for example, may make it impossible to grow important food crops such as wheat.

Scientists also predict climate change will cause more extreme weather.

That is one reason nearly every country in the world agreed to the Paris climate deal last December, which aims to cut fossil fuel pollution enough to keep average global temperatures rises well below 2C from pre-industrial times.

Prof Maslin said if countries stick to the initial pledges made for the Paris accord and then progressively upgrade them, as the pact requires, some of the predictions made for British wine-growing would not be achieved. But it is far from clear this will happen. "

It should not matter what is causing climate change

Sir, In response to Martin Wolf's carefully argued article "" Inconvenient truths and the risks of denial "" (November 2), John-Paul Marney ( Letters , November 3) wheels out the old chestnut that climate change may not be anthropogenic, that is, caused by human activity.

Why exactly does that matter? In most developed countries there are regulations governing building in areas at risk of earthquakes, without us thinking that human activity causes earthquakes; billions have been spent on a tsunami early-warning system across the Pacific, despite no evidence that tsunamis are anthropogenic; we build flood defences without feeling responsible for flooding; and we spend billions to buy insurance precisely to protect us from events that we do not cause.

It may well be true, as Mr Marney argues, that the actual temperature trends are open to various interpretations. However, we do know for certain that concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are rising, because we can measure them, and we also know for certain that their physical properties are consistent with a warming effect. What is it about greenhouse gases that makes them, uniquely, exempt from action?

EU unveils plan to axe subsidies for fossil fuel energy plants

Climate targets
By Arthur Beesley and Rochelle Toplensky in Brussels

Brussels will announce plans today to eliminate public subsidies for power generation by coal, gas and peat as part of efforts to push the EU towards its Paris climate deal commitments.

The overhaul of energy markets by the European Commission will strengthen binding EU targets requiring member states to increase energy efficiency, step up use of renewable energy and scrap subsidies for fossil fuels in power generation in a five-year transition period.

The 1,000-page plan follows the EU's ratification of the Paris pact in October but it comes amid doubt over Washington's support for the deal reached by almost 200 countries, which is supposed to limit global warming. Having campaigned to pull the US out of the deal, Donald Trump, since winning the presidency, has said he would ""keep an open mind"" on it.

Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate and energy commissioner, said it would ""not be a very intelligent move"" for the incoming US president to repudiate the Paris deal but he argued there had been a ""substantial change"" in Mr Trump's language.

""Electoral campaigns are something. But when you take your seat, you are responsible for growth and jobs,"" Mr Arias Cañete said. ""I think when it's a global trend, you cannot oppose it . . . Even in a hypothetical scenario in which the [US] federal government withdrew, we would see action in the United States at state level.""

He said the US should ""think about"" what happened when President George W Bush withdrew from the Kyoto pact, making the point that Washington ultimately returned to climate talks as an ""extremely active"" participant.

Mr Arias Cañete presented the overhaul of energy markets as an opportunity to spur the creation of 900,000 jobs and pump €190bn into Europe's struggling economy by increasing investment in wind power and other forms of renewable energy. Other measures include more support for investment to speed up renovation of Europe's building stock to use less energy.

But the plan includes targets that are politically sensitive for some EU member states. Britain, Poland, Greece, Finland and the Czech Republic have lobbied against tougher pollution rules for coal power stations.

The plan will say that capacity mechanisms - payments to power stations to supply electricity at times of peak demand - should still take harmful emissions into account if fossil fuels are burnt. Member states will have to reduce and eliminate subsidies for plant that exceed a specified emissions threshold.

Mr Arias Cañete will require the EU to become more energy efficient in the decade from 2020, raising from 27 per cent to 30 per cent the bloc's binding target for energy savings compared with a ""business as usual"" scenario.

EU targets under the Paris pact are binding on the bloc at large but targets for member states are not binding. This has prompted concern among environmental campaigners that voluntary governance mechanisms are too weak.

Member states must produce a draft climate and energy plan by 2018 for regional consultations and a formal evaluation in Brussels, said Mr Arias Cañete.

Marrakesh sends out strong signal on climate change
Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

Donald Trump's sweeping victory in the US presidential election has revealed a profound shift in the world's commitment to fixing one of its most intractable problems: climate change.

But it is not the shift that might have been expected after the election of a president who vowed to rip up the Paris climate deal that virtually every nation agreed last December.

Instead, delegates at a UN climate conference in Marrakesh have expressed renewed determination to meet the agreement's goal to cut fossil fuel pollution enough to curb global warming.

While Mr Trump has derided climate change as a money-making ""hoax"" invented by China to damage US industry, no leading economy at the two-week talks disputed Beijing's delegate, Xie Zhenhua, when he said tackling the phenomenon was ""a global trend that is irreversible"". Mr Xie added that ""a wise leader will follow the global trend"".

Envoys from the EU, Japan, Africa, Latin America and even the oil-rich Middle East all joined in a chorus of commitment to the Paris deal.

""We're committed to staying the course,"" Antonio Marcondes, a Brazilian delegate, said after a meeting of large developed countries including India and China. ""It makes sense politically. It makes sense economically and it makes sense socially, so that's what we will continue to do.""

Liu Zhenmin, Beijing's vice foreign minister, took a swipe at Mr Trump's claim that global warming was a Chinese hoax, saying climate negotiations were initiated in the 1980s with the backing of the Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush senior.

Alexander Bedritskiy, the head of Russia's delegation and a climate adviser to President Vladimir Putin, said on Friday that ""the whole world"" needed to work together on climate action and Moscow would stick with its Paris deal commitments ""even if others don't"".

Both Australia and Britain formally ratified the Paris accord in the wake of the US election result.

Despite the seemingly united front, signs of the difficulties that could lie ahead emerged late on Friday as a familiar bout of bickering pushed the final day of the Marrakesh meeting into overtime.

The unwieldy process of negotiating agreement among nearly 200 nations means UN climate meetings rarely ever end on time and some of the disputes on Friday centred on rules for implementing the Paris agreement that are not due to take effect for at least another year.

But far more serious divisions could easily occur in future if Mr Trump acts on his campaign vows to end US funding for UN climate programmes, a move that could strain the agreement's requirement for wealthy countries to help fund poorer nations to cut their emissions.

That in turn could undermine the accord's aim to ensure countries progressively ratchet up their climate action plans every five years. The pledges made for the deal so far are not nearly enough to meet its overarching goal to keep future global temperature rises ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times, and 1.5C if possible. The UN says they will probably lead to a rise of up to 3.4C this century.

But the response to Mr Trump's election still underlines how much has changed since Washington last abandoned a global climate agreement, the Kyoto Protocol treaty, in 2001.

Scepticism about the need to cut the use of fossil fuels, the lifeblood of most economies, was more widespread back then, not least in the world's two largest emitters, China and the US.

It was sometimes joked that China thought global warming was a capitalist plot created to undermine communism, while the US thought it was a socialist ploy to emasculate the west.

At that time, alternatives to fossil fuels, such as solar power and wind farms, were deemed unaffordable for all but the richest nations. But costs have plummeted by as much as two thirds since 2010 and in 2015, developing nations for the first time invested more in renewables than developed countries.

Although solar and wind still accounted for less than 5 per cent of global power generation last year, and many southeast Asian countries are planning to build more coal power stations, the growth of renewables shows little sign of stalling. China alone has been installing two wind turbines every hour and last year, renewables overtook coal as the world's largest source of installed power capacity. The green energy sector now employs an estimated 9.2m people worldwide, a number that would more than double by 2030 if current growth rates continue.

The attitudes of some of the world's largest companies and investors have also altered since 2001.

Dozens of large corporations, from India's Tata Motors to Coca-Cola and Goldman Sachs in the US, have pledged to get 100 per cent of their energy from renewable sources. Others, such as Walmart, plan to cut their emissions in line with the targets of the Paris agreement itself.

Oil and gas companies have also abandoned their past approach to the climate debate, which ranged from indifference to hostility.

On the eve of the Marrakesh meeting, 10 large oil groups, including Saudi Aramco, Shell and BP, said they would spend $1bn over the next 10 years on carbon capture systems and other measures to cut emissions. That is a small amount compared with the $348bn spent on clean energy last year alone but it still underlines a shift that was not evident 15 years ago.

Such moves have come as a growing number of investors have started pushing energy companies to disclose more about the physical and financial risks that climate change poses to their operations.

Against that background, many delegates in Marrakesh said they found it hard to imagine any country would ignore the global consensus on the need to tackle climate change.

""I have met ministers from nearly every major economy here and everyone is committed to the Paris agreement,"" said Mattlan Zackhras, the Marshall Islands' climate minister. ""Going it alone will not work.""

UN summit clouded by threat to dismantle Paris accord

Global warming
By Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

The Kellogg and Mars food companies have joined Hewlett-Packard and more than 360 other businesses and investors to urge Donald Trump not to tear up the Paris climate accord when he takes office.

As Mr Trump's election victory oversha-dowed UN climate talks in the Moroccan capital, the DuPont chemicals group, the Nike sports goods company and the Starbucks coffee chain added their names to businesses warning that ""failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk"".

Mr Trump has called global warming a ""hoax"" and has threatened to ditch the Paris accord that delegates are working to implement. However, the signatories have urged him to reconsider.

Matt Patsky, chief executive of Tril-lium Asset Management, the US investment firm, said business support for policies to address global warming ""cannot be reversed and cannot be ignored by the Trump administration"".

""That train has left the station, and to stand in its way is folly,"" he said.

Michael Kobori, vice-president of sustainability at Levi Strauss, the clothing company, said that ""now more than ever"" it was vital to back the Paris deal.

Their comments underline the concern Mr Trump's election has cast over the talks, but also a sense of determination among China, the EU and other nations to press on with plans to curb emissions.

John Kerry, US secretary of state, tried to reassure delegates yesterday that millions of Americans were still dedicated to tackling global warming.

""No one should doubt the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the US who know climate change is happening and our determination to keep our commitments that were made under Paris,"" he said.

""One of the things I've learnt is that some issues look a bit different when you are actually in office, compared to when you're on the campaign trail.""

Still, the incoming Trump administration is expected to slash many of the climate actions President Barack Obama had promised for the Paris deal, raising questions about whether other countries will be willing or able to fill the gap left by a US withdrawal. It is also unclear how other multinationals will respond to the new administration. The list urging Mr Trump to hold to the Paris accord did not include many big companies that backed climate change efforts before his election, including Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks.

Organisers of the list, which included Ceres, a non-profit sustainability group, said these companies had been approached but their absence did not suggest opposition, as the initiative had been done in a rush in a matter of days.

The Paris deal, sealed in December by nearly every nation, requires countries to draft a plan to curb climate change and update it so global temperature rises are kept ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times, or 1.5C if possible.

The World Meteorological Organisation said this week it was 95 per cent certain that 2016 would be the warmest year since records began in the 19th century.

Climate change: picture is not quite so bleak

Sir, Nick Butler ("" Climate change: time for adaptation to reality "", FT.com, November 14) is correct in saying that the Paris agreement, significant though it is, does not ""solve"" climate change. A ""solution"" needs concrete moves by governments to cut emissions - an issue that the election of Donald Trump necessarily clouds.

Elsewhere, Professor Butler's analysis is a little behind the times. The use of coal in growing emerging economies does not look set, as he suggests, to ""outpace anything being achieved elsewhere"". As the Financial Times reports this week, global CO2 emissions have stayed almost flat for three years in a row now, despite global economic growth. This is largely down to a decline in emissions from coal-burning in China, the most important emerging economy of all. Recent government edicts that have virtually halted approval of planned coal-fired power stations and suspended some midway through construction are likely to accelerate the trend.

In India, as US research initiative CoalSwarm has shown, only one in six planned coal-fired power stations reaches completion - and the usage rate of new plants is going down, trimming the economic viability still further. India's energy minister recently observed that solar power is now cheaper than coal-fired generation in his country. The International Energy Agency, as it recently admitted, has a history of underestimating the pace at which renewable energy advances, and the forensic, plant-by-plant approach methodology used by CoalSwarm is likely to be a far more accurate guide to the future than the IEA's modelling.

In the US itself, even if Mr Trump does secede from the Paris agreement, does anyone seriously think that four years of changed political rhetoric will magically make new coal mines or new coal-fired power stations investable - especially when many states such as California are pursuing their own ambitious clean energy plans?

Prof Butler is right in arguing that reducing emissions on the timescale indicated by science is profoundly difficult, and that some degree of adaptation will be needed (as is explicitly acknowledged in the Paris agreement). But real-world evidence indicates the picture is not as bleak as he claims.

US urged to keep faith in Paris climate deal

Marrakesh talks
By Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

The EU has sent a thinly veiled message to Donald Trump that the US risks a backlash from other countries if the president-elect pulls America out of the Paris climate accord.

""At the moment we are sending the Americans the message that it's in the interests of the US to deliver clean energy policies and ambitious climate change policies,"" Miguel Arias Cañete, EU climate and energy commissioner, said at UN climate talks in Marrakesh yesterday.

But in a sign of the growing frustration pervading the Moroccan meeting in the wake of Mr Trump's election win last week, Mr Arias Cañete added: ""We are in a positive attitude, not a negative attitude - at the moment, under present circumstances.""

The commissioner was responding to questions about a suggestion from Nicolas Sarkozy, France's former president, that Europe impose a carbon tax on US imports if Mr Trump pulls out of the Paris deal struck by nearly 200 nations in December.

His suggestion ricocheted around the makeshift meeting halls at the Marrakesh talks, where delegates have been rocked by the election of a man who has called climate change a ""hoax"" and is reportedly already looking at how to exit the Paris accord as soon as possible.

While economists are generally divided about border taxes of any nature, Nicholas Stern, professor of economics and government at the London School of Economics, said a case could be made for them under some circumstances.

""In principle, border tax adjustments can be justified in cases where companies are being heavily subsidised by their country's government,"" said Prof Stern, author of a 2006 report on the economics of climate change. ""Allowing damaging activities, such as air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions, to take place at zero cost is clearly an implicit subsidy,"" he told the FT.

Jonathan Pershing, US climate envoy, who has been in the difficult position of representing the outgoing Obama administration in Marrakesh, said it appeared that other governments were ""holding judgment"" on how to respond to the incoming Trump presidency.

Meanwhile new data revealed that a dramatic spike in global temperatures has put 2016 on track to be the hottest year since records began in the 19th century and close to the 1.5C of warming that the Paris climate accord is supposed to prevent.

Average temperatures this year have soared to 1.2C above what they were before the industrial revolution as warming reached what World Meteorological Organisation officials said were ""very alarming"" levels around the world. The record rise will mean 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been this century, with the other one being 1998.

The Paris agreement aims to keep future temperature rises ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times and if possible only 1.5C.

Petteri Taalas, WMO secretarygeneral, said it was still ""theoretically possible"" to meet the accord's 1.5C goal. But doing this would, he said, require a ""very dramatic"" fall in global emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas produced when fossil fuels are burned.

Mr Taalas said the warming this year had been striking, with temperatures in parts of Arctic Russia reaching 6C to 7C above long-term averages and 3C higher in Arctic sections of Alaska and Canada.

The WMO listed other striking events that had occurred as global warming surged, including:fierce heatwaves that set records in southern Africa, Thailand, India and the Middle East; deadly storms including Hurricane Matthew in Haiti;droughts in several parts of the world; and an above average rise in sea levels and ""significant"" melting of the Greenland ice sheet.

A separate group of scientists released data yesterday showing global emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels has stayed nearly flat for the last three years, despite the absence of a global economic downturn that normally leads to such a slump.

But scientists cautioned that emissions would need to fall sharply, rather than slow down, if the Paris agreement's goals are to be met. "

UN climate talks: 2016 set to be hottest year since records began
Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

A dramatic rise in global temperatures has put 2016 on track to be the hottest year since records began in the 19th century and close to the 1.5C of warming that the Paris climate accord was supposed to prevent.

Average temperatures in 2016 have risen to 1.2C above that which they were before the industrial revolution, as warming reached what World Meteorological Organization officials said were ""very alarming"" levels.

A powerful El Niño weather event helped push up temperatures in 2015 and 2016, WMO data have revealed. But underlying global warming means this year's levels are higher than they were during the last big El Niño event in 1998. It also means 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been this century, with the other one in 1998.

The provisional data were unveiled at UN climate talks in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, where thousands of delegates are supposed to be working on rules for the global climate deal sealed in Paris in December.

The Marrakesh summit, which continues this week, has coincided with the election of Donald Trump as US president. Environmentalists fear that having a climate change sceptic in the White House - Mr Trump has called global warming a ""hoax"" created by China to weaken US manufacturers - will derail attempts to manage its most damaging effects. The president-elect has vowed to rip up the Paris accord after he takes office in January.

The Paris agreement is aimed at keeping future temperature rises ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial times and if possible only 1.5C.

Petteri Taalas, WMO secretary-general, told reporters that it was still ""theoretically possible"" to meet the accord's 1.5C goal. But doing this would, he said, require a ""very dramatic"" cut in emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas produced when fossil fuels are burnt.

He added that this year's warming had been striking, with temperatures in parts of Arctic Russia rising 6C-7C above long term averages. ""We are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a degree, and so this is different,"" he said.

The WMO listed a raft of other striking events that have occurred as global warming has surged.

— Heatwaves that set records in southern Africa, Thailand, India and the Middle East, where temperatures hit 54C in Kuwait; 53.9C in Iraq and 53C in Iran.

— A series of deadly storms including Hurricane Matthew in Haiti, Typhoon Lionrock in North Korea and Cyclone Winston in Fiji.

— Deadly floods in China's Yangtze basin and Sri Lanka that killed hundreds.

— Major droughts, especially in southern Africa, where the UN estimates as many as 17m will require assistance in coming months.

— The most damaging wildfire in Canadian history, in May at Fort McMurray in Alberta.

— Warming ocean temperatures that contributed to a spate of coral reef bleaching, including the Great Barrier Reef off the east coast of Australia, and Pacific island countries such as Fiji and Kiribati.

— A rise in sea levels of about 15 millimetres, well above previous averages seen since 1993 of 3mm to 3.5mm per year.

- ""Significant and very early melting of the Greenland ice sheet, as well as ""very low levels"" of Arctic sea ice.

Average global temperatures for January-September this year have been about 0.88C above the average of 14C measured in the 30 years before 1990, but the long-term 1.2C rise since the industrial revolution is a closely watched figure because it is an indicator of what has happened since the use of fossil fuels such as coal and oil have surged.

A separate group of scientists released data on Monday showing global emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels has stayed nearly flat for the past three years, despite the absence of a global economic downturn that normally leads to such a slump.

But the researchers cautioned that emissions would need to fall sharply, rather than slow down, if the Paris agreement's goals are to be met.

Concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere have also surged to record levels above 400 parts per million this year, partly on the back of the El Niño event, which dried out vegetation that would otherwise have been able to absorb more CO2.

Saudi Arabia to press on with Paris accord pledges

Climate talks
By Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

Saudi Arabia says it will press ahead with pledges it made under the Paris climate change accord, even if president-elect Donald Trump pulls the US out of the global deal.

In an indication of how isolated the US may be if it abandons the climate agreement that virtually every country in the world struck last December, the largest oil exporter said the commitment of other big economies such as China underlined the accord's strength.

""The US is very important for the climate process, there is no doubt,"" a Saudi delegate told the FT at UN climate talks in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh, the first since the deal was adopted in Paris.

""But at the same time we need to recognise that the climate issue is a global issue . . . this process is resilient enough to move forward and China's comments are an example of that.""

Chinese negotiators in Marrakesh have said there was a clear consensus to back the Paris deal and any shift in the US position would not derail Beijing's efforts to shift to a greener economy.

The Saudi delegate, who declined to be named, said the fact that so many countries had rushed to ratify the Paris deal was ""a very nice surprise"" that amounted to the icing on the cake.

""The US election means you have to eat it fast,"" he said, adding fossil fuel-rich Saudi Arabia had ""no intention of watering down"" its commitments.

Mr Trump, who will be inaugurated as US president in January, has called global warming a ""hoax"" created by China to weaken US manufacturers. His advisers say he is already looking at ways to withdraw from the Paris deal, Reuters reported over the weekend.

Much may depend on who the president-elect picks to lead bodies such as the US state department, whose officials helped negotiate the Paris accord, and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Mr Trump is reported to have chosen a prominent questioner of climate science, Myron Ebell of the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute think-tank, to his EPA transition team, raising hopes in the fossil fuel industry that like-minded figures will be chosen for other key posts.

The Paris accord has been hailed as an end to the fossil fuel era because it requires all countries to come up with climate action plans to curb emissions of greenhouse gases enough to prevent runaway global warming.

Saudi Arabia has pledged to install more solar panels and other renewable energy systems, as long as its economy grows, while the US has said it will cut its emissions by at least 26 per cent from 2005 levels over the next nine years.

Since his election victory, Mr Trump has reaffirmed his intention to boost fossil fuels and ""end the war on coal"" by scrapping President Obama's central climate plans.

However, Benjamin Sporton, head of the World Coal Association, warned such actions were unlikely to overcome the woes of the struggling US coal industry because the sector was primarily suffering from wider competitive pressures from cheaper natural gas.

""There are a good number of other countries that appear to remain pretty committed to the Paris agreement,"" Mr Sporton told the FT in Marrakesh.

He said he hoped a Trump administration might make it easier for countries to finance international coal projects than the Obama administration, but his association backed the Paris agreement pledges many countries had made to build cleaner coal-fired power stations.

The US election came on the second day of the two-week Marrakesh talks that last until November 18, and cast a shadow over the meeting, which is supposed to be working on the rules needed to make the Paris deal work.

Moroccan government organisers have acted to show the accord is still on track, drawing up a draft document inviting countries to ""speed up"" their climate actions. But these steps have been complicated because the Paris deal requires billions of dollars in public and private climate finance to be channelled from rich to poor countries and Mr Trump vowed to end US funds to UN climate programmes.

If the world's richest economy ditches its commitments, it will raise questions over how the accord proceeds.

Trump to slash and burn Obama climate policy

VIEW FROM THE US
By John Dizard

""I've got a pen, and I've got a phone. And I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.""

Barack Obama, January 14 2014

The problem with President Obama's strategy is that an ""action"" that lives by the pen can die by the pen. So it will be, apparently, with his administration's environmental policies, which are on the way to being largely undone by Donald Trump's administration after the property tycoon won the US election last week.

US and international climate activists will try to hang on, kicking and screaming, to the various big Obama climate actions. Unfortunately, it would seem to be the case that if a president decides to undo a previous president's executive orders he can do so. So kicking and screaming may describe the limits of the effective response to Mr Trump's undoing of President Obama's climate agenda.

For the most part, the outgoing president's climate policy was enacted by decree, rather than laws or treaties ratified by the Senate. This seemed to be a clever idea at the time. After the 2010 elections, climate sceptics among the Republicans and fossil-fuel friendly Democrats were able to block controversial environmental legislation.

So the administration's significant climate actions were taken without Congressional participation.

The Paris agreement reached at the UN climate change conference last November was, according to US law, an executive agreement rather than a treaty. Under the US constitution, treaties must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate, which is a major cat-herding problem even at the best of times.

The advantage of a treaty is that it has a higher ranking in law than executive actions or legislation.

The Paris agreement negotiators thought they had gotten around this problem by including a cumbersome three-year process that any signatory nation would have to follow to withdraw. So this made the agreement ""legally binding"", as everyone who mattered was saying at the time.

However, the people who did not matter at the time just elected a new US president, who has made promises to coal miners, mining companies and coal-burning utilities that he would rip up ""Paris"".

They took note that the Paris agreement is really a subsidiary agreement of another international accord, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change . That has been governing all the annual gatherings on climate change since then. Any signatory, such as a Trump-led America, can withdraw from the UNFCC on one year's notice.

Legal experts from US environmental organisations point out that under ""customary international law"" the country is bound to respect international executive agreements that are not treaties ratified by the Senate. And they are right.

Unfortunately, there is a conflict on this point between customary international law and the US constitution, one that has not really been tested. In the end, a president can probably just withdraw from an executive agreement when he decides to do so. He might be reviled by the international community, Congress and even the public, but he can almost certainly do it.

The coal people and their allies intend to collect on Trump's promise.

The Clean Power Plan, a comprehensive and ambitious set of regulations for carbon emissions by electricity generators proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency under Obama, was one of the principal means for the US to comply with its ""Paris"" obligations.

The Clean Power Plan was opposed by state attorneys-general and their industry allies. It is now wending its way through the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington.

President Trump will have the authority to order the EPA to request the US court of appeals to ""remand"" the Clean Power Plan. Then it can be revised into something weak or nearly meaningless.

The environmental movement's lawyers and advocates will fight this process. But the election shows that clever lawyering and diplomacy cannot ever make up for the failure to build a political consensus.

HSBC pension puts £1.85bn in green fund

Climate change
By Chris Flood

Pressure on large investors to protect portfolios from climate change risks

HSBC has invested £1.85bn of its UK employees' pension savings in a new environmentally friendly fund, as pressure mounts on large investors to protect their portfolios from the risks associated with climate change .

The UK bank has chosen the Future World fund run by Legal & General Investment Management, Britain's largest fund house, as the default equity option for its defined contribution pension scheme.

Mark Thompson, chief investment officer at HSBC's UK pension scheme, which has 80,000 members, said that taking action on climate change was now the ""new normal"" for investors.

""This fund will offer our members better risk-adjusted returns, incorporate greater climate change protection and deliver improved company engagement,"" he said.

Investment managers have been stepping up their efforts to address the risks of global warming after governments around the world signed an agreement to tackle climate change in Paris in December 2015.

Mark Carney , the governor of the Bank of England, also warned last year that action to meet global climate change targets could leave companies that rely on fossil fuels as worthless ""stranded"" assets.

LGIM's decision to launch the Future World fund signals a hardening of the UK asset manager's stance on environmental issues affecting investors.

Meryam Omi, LGIM's head of sustainability, said: ""Companies that fail to meet the minimum environmental standards will be excluded from the Future World fund. This is a powerful message that we are sending to companies that they need to step up to meet the challenges of moving to a low-carbon economy.""

LGIM is planing to use its clout as the UK's largest investment manager to vote against the chairmen of companies that perform poorly on its environmental scores across all of its funds.

The Future World fund tracks a new FTSE Russell index of global companies that score well on four performance measures - value, quality, low volatility and size - that have delivered outperformance compared with conventional benchmarks.

The fund then reduces its exposure to companies with high oil and gas reserves and those with high carbon emissions, while increasing its exposure to companies with low carbon emissions and those with increasing revenues from environmentally friendly activities.

This means that coal producers have been excluded from the fund's portfolio, while the weighting of diversified mining companies that produce coal as part of their total output has been reduced by 75 per cent. The weighting of two energy sectors, oil and gas producers and oil equipment, services and distribution companies, has been reduced by 25 per cent.

LGIM surveyed 1,600 pension scheme members and found that 81 per cent want their pension scheme to be invested in responsible companies that are likely to improve living standards for future generations. However, nearly half of those surveyed were only prepared to sacrifice up to 1 per cent of returns by divesting from companies that harm the environment.

Emma Douglas, LGIM's head of defined contribution, said: ""There is a perception that investors have to give up returns to invest responsibly. But let us be clear, savers do not want to see their returns reduced to meet climate change goals.""

China warns Trump against abandoning climate change deal
Pilita Clark in Marrakesh

China has warned Donald Trump that he will be defying the wishes of the entire planet if he acts on his vow to back away from the Paris climate agreement after he becomes US president next January.

In a sign of how far the world has shifted in recognising the need to tackle global warming, Beijing - once seen as an obstructive force in UN climate talks - is now leading the push for progress by responding to fears that Mr Trump would pull the US out of the landmark accord.

""It is global society's will that all want to co-operate to combat climate change,"" a senior Beijing negotiator said in Marrakesh on Friday, at the first round of UN talks since the Paris deal was sealed last December. The Chinese negotiators added that ""any movement by the new US government"" would not affect their transition towards becoming a greener economy.

India also joined in the warnings, saying Mr Trump's appointment would force countries to reassess an accord hailed as an end to the fossil fuel era.

""Everyone will rethink how this whole process is going to unfold,"" India's chief negotiator, Ravi Prasad, told the Financial Times.

Recalling the way support for the earlier Kyoto protocol climate treaty crumbled after it was abandoned by another Republican president, George W Bush, Mr Prasad said he feared the Paris accord could suffer ""a contagious disease that spreads"" if the US withdrew.

Mr Trump's sweeping victory on Tuesday has shaken what had appeared to be an unstoppable bout of global action to tackle climate change in the run-up to the two-week Marrakesh talks, which began on Monday.

Governments struck the first climate deal for aviation in October, just days before agreeing to phase out planet-warming hydrofluorocarbon chemicals used in air-conditioners.

The Moroccan hosts of this week's talks had been planning a celebratory meeting to cap this unprecedented bout of activity. Instead, organisers awoke on Wednesday morning to find the world's wealthiest country had a president-elect who has called global warming a hoax, pledged to ""cancel"" the Paris agreement and vowed to stop US funding of UN climate programmes entirely.

""They were in absolute shock,"" said one person who saw Moroccan officials on Wednesday morning.

Adnan Amin, the director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, said ""a sense of helplessness"" had pervaded the Marrakesh talks, and ""a certain amount of fear"".

The EU and Japan also reaffirmed their commitment to the agreement, which requires all countries to come up with a plan to curb climate change in order to stop global temperatures from rising more than 2C from pre-industrial times.

But neither they nor China were willing to offer extra cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to fill the vacuum a US withdrawal would create, nor additional money for an agreement requiring billions of dollars in public and private funds to be channelled from rich to poor countries to tackle climate change.

""If the US changes its position that would be very serious for us, especially the aspect of the finance,"" said Shigeru Ushio, a Japanese foreign ministry official.

As delegates absorbed the ramifications of Mr Trump's sweeping victory, many swapped stories of how the result had hit them.

""At 3am in the morning I started to hear the results and I said, 'No, you're having a nightmare, go back to sleep',"" said one developing country participant. ""When I got up and realised it was true, this was really, really happening, I walked around in a daze. I think a lot of us were.""

The negotiations have continued nonetheless and some countries have been adamant that the US election result should not interfere with a meeting that is due to start negotiating a raft of important rules for how the Paris agreement will operate.

""We're talking about the big challenge of climate change,"" said Russia's lead negotiator, Oleg Shamanov. ""This issue is bigger than life. This is a long-term issue, longer than any mandate of any president of country X or Z, even if that country is a big one.""

The prospect of the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement has been a topic of endless discussion beneath the sun-shaded walkways in the temporary convention centre built for the Marrakesh meeting.

A pullout would take four years, unless Mr Trump chose to take the US out of the accord's parent treaty, the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which case it could only take a year.

That would be a highly provocative move, said international climate law expert, Farhana Yamin. ""It would escalate non-cooperation to the highest level possible.""

But as the first week of the talks drew to a close, a mood of defiance was emerging among some delegates who said past US retreats from UN climate action had only spurred other countries' determination to unify and proceed.

""The talk in the corridors is, 'OK, this is not going to stop us from moving forward, we will just redouble our efforts',"" said Hugh Sealy, a lead negotiator for an alliance of small island countries.

""This is still an existential threat,"" he said. ""I still want to pass on that little house I have on the coast in Grenada to my children and the rest of us are going to have to step up.""

MDBs will need to scale up climate finance

Sir, You rightly refer to the urgency to act on climate change and to the important role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) in mobilising finance to help countries address the threats posed by climate change in developing countries (""Focus on Marrakesh to limit global warming"", editorial, October 29).

While sustainable infrastructure will command a large share of the $100bn a year that MDBs committed to last October, other key investments will need to be made in areas such as biodiversity, forestry and agriculture.

The latest reports from the New Climate Economy and the Centre for Global Development highlight this role as well as underscoring the comparative advantages of MDBs, given our country and regional knowledge, technical capacity, operational expertise, convening power, and role as trusted partner and honest broker both with public and private sector clients.

Long before the Paris Agreement, we at the Inter-American Development Bank Group were engaged in adjusting our organisational structure, systems and processes to better address the challenges that the climate finance agenda implies, particularly to mobilise private sector investors and long-term finance.

In addition to having climate change at the heart of our updated institutional strategy, in 2015 we set out the goal of doubling our climate-related finance by 2020. Last month I also announced a new initiative, called NDC Invest, that will align resources from across the IDB Group to provide governments and the private sector with the support they need to deliver their nationally determined contributions under the Paris agreement.

However, there is a further need for scaling up the availability of concessional climate finance through instruments such as the Green Climate Fund, the Climate Investment Funds, and bilateral funds such as the Canadian Climate Fund.

Furthermore, delivering the staggering scale of investment that is needed not only for climate finance but also for the broader 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda will require financing well beyond what MDBs can provide today, even fully leveraging their current capital.

We have all implemented most of the measures called for by the Group of 20 to optimise our balance sheets to maximise the use of our capital. However, there is a risk that any gains from this process will be lost, given potential changes in how some rating agencies assess our portfolio risk. Capital increases will be needed in the near term in order for the MDBs to be able to fully and effectively support their borrowing member countries to deliver on the 2030 agenda. "

Trump election casts shadow over COP 22 climate change talks
Pilita Clark, Environment Correspondent

Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election reverberated around the world this week, not least in the Moroccan city of Marrakesh that is hosting the first major UN talks on global warming since last year's landmark Paris climate deal was struck.

Mr Trump has vowed to ""cancel"" the Paris accord and sweep aside many of the commitments to cut fossil fuel emissions that the US had pledged as part of the agreement.

No single country can abolish the Paris deal and it is still too early to know exactly what a Trump presidency will mean for an accord that caps more than 20 years of international negotiations on curbing climate change.

What is clear, however, is that Mr Trump's election brings to an abrupt halt the excitement surrounding the lead-up to the Marrakesh COP 22 meeting, which had been marked by a rare high point of global co-operation on climate action.

In the space of 11 days in October, governments around the world agreed to take three separate steps to tackle the rise of greenhouse gas emissions, a moment with little parallel in the fraught history of attempts to combat global warming.

First, so many countries rushed to ratify or join the Paris climate accord adopted last December that on October 5 the two thresholds needed for the agreement to enter into force were met: approval by 55 countries accounting for 55 per cent of global emissions. It took more than seven years for the agreement's predecessor, the 1997 Kyoto protocol climate treaty, to come into effect. The architects of the Paris accord had expected a wait of at least another year.

Then, on October 6, governments struck the first global climate deal for aviation, a fast-growing source of emissions long deemed too hard to include in UN accords such as Paris and Kyoto.

Finally, in the early hours of October 15 in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, another global deal was sealed - to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs.

These planet-warming chemicals are used in millions of air conditioners and refrigerators and it is estimated that the Kigali agreement could help avoid as much as 0.5C of future global warming.

It is hard to think of another period when so much international action occurred in such a short time.

Patricia Espinosa, the veteran Mexican diplomat recently appointed the UN's top climate official, had seen nothing like it before. ""I have spent a good part of my career in multilateral affairs and I can tell you it is really unprecedented,"" she said, shortly before the US election.

Even before Mr Trump's victory, large questions remained about whether it would be possible to meet the Paris agreement's central aim of avoiding dangerous global warming.

Some of the answers will come at the two-week Marrakesh meeting on November 7-18.

Because the Paris agreement came into force sooner that expected, every country ratifying the pact is now legally bound by its terms - including the US for the moment.

That has thrown the spotlight on the climate action plans that countries have volunteered under the accord, known in UN jargon as ""nationally determined contributions"".

Countries are not legally obliged to meet any emissions targets in their plans but they do have to update them every five years so that, ultimately, global temperature rises are kept ""well below"" 2C compared to pre-industrial revolution levels, and 1.5C if possible.

Many decisions still have to be made about the rules guiding exactly what is in these updated plans. The first batch, made ahead of the COP21 meeting in Paris, would still put the world on course for at least 2.9C of warming this century, the UN said last week.

Collectively, these plans amount to a hotchpotch of pledges, from building wind farms to planting trees, with an array of different targets for bringing down emissions.

The US, for instance, has proposed an emissions cut of up to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2025, while the EU is planning a 40 per cent cut from 1990 levels by 2030. China has no goal for an outright cut at all, but instead says its emissions will peak by 2030.

The Paris accord stipulates that a new governing body for the agreement should decide ""at its first session"" on rules for common timeframes in climate plans and other measures making it easier to compare each country's actions. That includes more common standards for reporting greenhouse gas emissions in a timely and accurate fashion, which is far from the case at present.

The EU, the US and other developed countries have generally submitted emissions data to the UN for at least the year 2013. But some of China's latest figures date back to 2005 while those of other countries are from the 1990s.

Poorer countries also want to see more transparent reporting of the financing commitments wealthier nations have pledged to deliver to help tackle global warming.

Because the agreement is coming into force unexpectedly early, its new governing body can technically hold its first session in Marrakesh. But dozens of countries have yet to formally ratify the deal, meaning they cannot take part in the early shaping of any decisions.

As a result, it had been expected that the new body would convene and then be suspended, leaving time for more countries to join.

At a minimum, many governments want the Marrakesh meeting to set a deadline of 2018 for agreeing on the ""rule book"" needed for the Paris accord.

That still makes the meeting important for investors, says Zoe Knight, managing director for climate change at HSBC.

""More clarity on how the aims set out in country plans will be measured and monitored allows a more effective climate risk assessment,"" she says.

More than 600 companies have already said they expect to change their strategy as a result of the Paris agreement's adoption, says Paul Simpson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project, a non-profit body that compiles company environmental data for hundreds of investors. Some plan to adopt an internal carbon price; others say they will use more renewable energy. But corporations will still be watching closely to see how countries implement the agreement's rules, as will climate scientists.

Temperatures have already risen nearly 1C since the industrial revolution, following a fossil-fuelled boom in carbon dioxide emissions, and some scientists think the goal of limiting the rise to 2C will be hard to meet, let alone 1.5C.

Average global CO2 levels in the atmosphere reached 400 parts per million in 2015 and surged to new records this year on the back of a powerful El Niño weather system that is likely to make 2016 the warmest year on record.

Experts at Oxford university held a conference in September to consider the Paris agreement's 1.5C goal. Some attendees had sobering views.

""The very first year at 1.5C could be in about 10 years time if we happen to get an extra warm year on top of the long-term warming trend, like we had with the recent El Niño event,"" said Professor Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office Hadley Centre in the UK. While it may take more time for temperatures to stick at that level, it illustrates the challenges of meeting the Paris deal's targets.

The good news is that there has been ""remarkable"" progress in the growth of renewable energy alternatives to fossil fuels, says Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute research group in the US.

The International Energy Agency recently reported a record-breaking number of installations of wind and solar power last year that has led to renewables overtaking coal to become the world's largest source of installed power capacity.

""We've got a lot to be enthusiastic about,"" Mr Steer says. But there is no room for complacency, he adds. ""We are still a long, long way off from getting to where we need to get to.""

A recent report by the International Bar Association suggests concrete steps to getting the law right for the victims of climate change

Monday 12 January 2015 07.00 GMT Last modified on Monday 12 January 2015 10.15 GMT
We are learning to see climate injustice. We see it in the distressing stories of lives destroyed, epic droughts, floods and typhoons, and families and whole peoples uprooted. Climate injustice is not at first glance a legal problem any more than climate change itself is: it is economic, political, scientific. And yet, year after year, it is to law we turn for a solution in the hope that each next round of climate talks will yield a binding international agreement.

Today, faced with the reality of the human cost of climate change, all around the world people are turning to law for help, seeking a remedy, redress, some guarantee that it won’t happen again. This is the challenge of climate justice.

So far, the law has not seemed up to the task. Indeed, as the recent report of an International Bar Association (IBA) Task Force (pdf) has shown, some of our laws, both national and international, apparently make climate action more rather than less difficult. The report, however, has plenty of suggestions for improvement. Here are five recommendations that are politically palatable and could make a big difference.

1. Recognise climate change victims
We need to recognise that climate change has victims and give them a day in court. The report proposes that states adopt a “model statute on legal remedies for climate change” that can open doors to those directly affected by climate change. This is largely a matter of clarifying procedural rules. As a next step, the IBA has already embarked on drafting a model statute of this kind.

2. Reinforce human rights
It has been clear for a long time that climate change harms human rights. What has been less clear is whether courts can apply existing law and legal precedent to cover these violations. After all, the law was developed without the enormity and urgency of climate change in view. But, like other human rights harms, climate change has agents, victims and injuries. It does not require much legal imagination to make the causal connection. Politicians, lawyers and the international community can help by making the connection clear.

3. Hold corporations to account
At present, multinational corporations can escape carbon accountability in much the same way as they have often escaped responsibility for human rights violations caused by subsidiaries and suppliers abroad. As with human rights, what is needed is simple due diligence. The point must be to ensure that carbon emissions are counted right along the international supply chain, from sourcing to production to distribution to point of sale.

4. Beef up international institutions


When it comes to environmental disputes, states rarely make use of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the world’s principal court for international law disputes.

No climate-related actions have come to the court. There are political reasons for this, of course, but there are also concerns about the competence of the court to manage what are often highly technical questions.

The ICJ needs bolstering. Recent appointments to the court’s judicial panel may help. A recently-disbanded environmental panel could be reconstituted and strengthened. Courts are at least better than arbitration panels in these matters. But where states do choose arbitration, especially in disputes with investors over energy or environmental policy, everything should be fully transparent – not always the case today. The IBA also suggests making use of the environmental expertise at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.

5. Get the trade system right
We need to make sure trade rules do not penalise climate actions such as low carbon trade policies. The same governments who have spent decades hashing out a climate agreement can more easily send ministers to the WTO to make this happen. At present, governments wanting to tax high-carbon imports, for example, may fear a slap from the WTO’s judicial authority. It is an easier matter by far to issue a ministerial declaration to the effect that such measures are lawful.

Of course, similar measures ought to be included in all bilateral and regional trade agreements, such as the Transpacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership now under negotiation. These and any other future agreements need to be thoroughly vetted for long-term climate impacts before they are finalised.

The IBA report has much more to say besides these recommendations and, in my view, ought to be mandatory reading for lawyers and policymakers everywhere. It is high time we began thinking seriously about preventing and redressing the human harm caused by climate change.

Guardian-10.txt,"COP21: France to spend billions on African renewable energy projects
François Hollande tells Paris climate summit that his government will double investments in wind, solar and hydropower to €2bn


Tuesday 1 December 2015 15.32 GMT Last modified on Friday 28 April 2017 14.08 BST
France plans to spend billions of euros in renewable energy and other environmental projects in its former west African colonies and across Africa over the next five years, President François Hollande said on Tuesday.

Africa produces little of the greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, produced by burning fossil fuels, linked by scientists to rapid climate change. But it is particularly vulnerable to a changing climate, as much of its population is poor, rural and dependent on rain-fed agriculture.

Hollande told a conference on Africa, held as part of climate change talks in Paris, that his government would double investments in renewable energy generation, ranging from wind farms to solar power and hydroelectric projects, across the continent to €2bn between 2016 and 2020.



In addition, he said Paris would triple to €1bn a year by 2020 its contribution to Africa’s battle with desertification and other climate change challenges.

Most of that investment will be directed at some former West African colonies, where Paris has significant security interests and has deployed thousands of troops to fight Islamist militants.

One project, dubbed the “Great Green Wall“, was initially intended to create a barrier of trees reaching from the Sahel in west Africa to the Sahara in the east, but will now focus on creating pockets of trees to revive the soil.

Another aims to protect Lake Chad, which is threatened by pollution.

African leaders want the biggest polluting nations to commit to financing as part of contributions to an internationally administered Green Climate Fund, that hopes to dispense $100bn a year after 2020 as a way to finance the developing world’s shift towards renewables."

Heathrow expansion should face strict environmental conditions, say MPs
Final government approval for the expansion of Heathrow should be withheld until Europe’s busiest airport can demonstrate that it accepts and will comply with key environmental conditions, a parliamentary committee has concluded.

MPs on the environmental audit committee have been hearing evidence on the likely carbon emissions, air quality and noise levels after the government-appointed Airports Commission recommended a third runway at Heathrow as the preferred plan for London airport expansion.

However, as British diplomats engage this week with others from more than 190 nations at the COP21 UN climate conference in Paris, the MPs found there was a gap between the government’s current policies on carbon emissions and the policies modelled by the commission to show that expansion could be achieved within CO2 limits.

They called on the government to set out its approach to international negotiations on aviation emissions and establish a strategy to deliver aviation emissions no higher than 2005 levels by 2050 in line with an economy-wide target set by the Climate Change Act.

The committee’s chairman, Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies, said: “Planes are becoming more fuel efficient, but this alone will not keep aviation emissions in line with the government’s climate change targets given the growth in passenger numbers.

“Even without expansion, aviation is on track to exceed its climate change target. We heard evidence that those targets might be met in theory, but at present there is a policy vacuum and evidence-based scepticism as to whether they can be met in practice.”

On air quality, the committee noted concerns that the commission’s interpretation of the EU air quality directive implied that significant increases in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) resulting from Heathrow expansion would be allowable due to worse performance elsewhere in London.

It said that the government should make clear that this is not the position it intends to take when assessing Heathrow’s compliance with the directive.

“The communities living near to the roads around Heathrow already put up with noise and extra traffic. It would be quite unacceptable to subject them to a potentially significant deterioration in air quality as well,” said Irranca-Davies. “Increased pollution should certainly not be permitted on the grounds that other areas of London are even more polluted.”

On the issue of noise, the MPs “strongly supported” a ban on night flights and called on the government to improve trust between local people and the airport by setting up a community engagement board.

Heathrow airport said this month that a new runway would not increase the number of cars on the roads or make air pollution any worse than in central London, because public transport access to the airport would be greatly improved.

The airport’s CEO, John Holland-Kaye, told the committee that fewer people would be affected by noise because planes were getting quieter, flying higher and changing their angles of descent into Heathrow"

Food at COP21: three new initiatives spotlight food insecurity, soils, waste
It’s become a catch-22 of our times: the global food system is both a villain and a victim of climate change. Agriculture accounts for almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, and yet floods, drought, and the planet’s increasing climatic variability play with the fate of our food. Continuing on the current climate trajectory will mean a future of profound food insecurity, especially for developing nations.

This week, these concerns have been prominent on the agenda at the COP21 climate talks in Paris. For the first time at a COP conference, agriculture had its own dedicated focus-day, held on Tuesday by the Lima-Paris Action Agenda (LPAA), a partnership established between France and Peru to showcase and strengthen on-the-ground climate action in 2015 and beyond. “For years, agriculture, food systems, including oceans, including forests, have been knocking hard at the door—and now there’s movement starting,” said David Nabarro, former special representative of food security and nutrition for the United Nations, at the LPAA agriculture press briefing on Tuesday afternoon.

That door should have been yanked open a long time ago, considering that our food systems are due to bear so much of the brunt of climate change. But there are strong signs of progress. The world needs creative solutions if we are to reduce agricultural impact and feed everyone on the planet (an estimated nine billion by 2050)—and some of the best have recently been aired at the talks.

Here are three that caught my eye: each places our global food system squarely on the climate table.

Charting future insecurity

The first step in prioritising food systems is to confront what will happen if we don’t. On Tuesday at COP21 the World Food Program and the U.K.’s Met Office Hadley Centre launched a new, interactive mapping tool that predicts, in unprecedented detail, how future climate scenarios could influence food security, especially in the world’s developing nations. Based on five years of meteorological and agricultural research, the Food Insecurity and Climate Change Vulnerability Map shows how food security could change at the individual country level, either worsening or improving depending on three variables that users can tweak on the map: time scale (you can choose between the present day, 2050s, 2080s), emissions (low, medium, high), and adaptation (high, low, none).

As a starting point, the map could help countries forecast their food security risk and inform their planning, says Richard Choularton, chief of climate and disaster risk reduction at the World Food Programme. “The results of the analysis can provide some insight into vulnerability at the national level, when the specific factors behind the index are unpacked.” For example, in one country road access might emerge as the main limit on food security, in another it might be the variability of rainfall.

The map also shows what can be achieved if reduced emissions are paired with increased adaptive measures—like climate-smart agriculture—to make food systems more secure. “What’s most important, especially in the context of Paris, is that mitigation or adaption alone is not enough,” Choularton says. “We need a very serious combination of both.”

Keeping soil carbon on lockdown

The planet’s soils naturally hold vast quantities of carbon—two to three times more carbon than the air. Releasing it through unsuitable, soil-degrading agricultural techniques will contribute to climate change and also reduce soil health—but, if we keep more carbon locked in the soil, it has the power to both mitigate climate change and increase agricultural productivity.

On Tuesday as part of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, hundreds of partners joined to launch ‘ 4/1000 ’, an initiative designed to increase the storage of carbon in the earth: “If we were to increase the amount of carbon in the soil by just 0.4% then we would compensate entirely for the increase of carbon in the atmosphere—just to show how huge the potential is,” says Frank Rijsberman, CEO of the CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Centers, one of the partners contributing to the initiative. As part of 4/1000 the CGIAR itself is proposing a $225 million project that aims to increase carbon storage by promoting better farming techniques in developing world agriculture. Methods like agroforestry and reduced soil tillage could keep carbon enclosed in the soil, leading to a 20 percent boost in yields, and in theory offsetting greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent. The benefits will be three-pronged, says Rijsberman: “We will mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; adapt agriculture to climate change and thus improve food security; and improve ecosystem functioning.”

Global brainstorm on food waste

An estimated 1.3 billion tons of food is lost and wasted annually between farm and fork, producing 3.3 Gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent each year. On Tuesday at COP21, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the International Food Policy Research Institute announced that to counter it, they’re launching a new platform that will encourage G20 member countries, the private sector, and NGOs to pool their resources toward the goal of fighting food waste. Today, that new forum—called the G20 Technical Platform on the Measurement and Reduction of Food Loss and Waste —goes live.

The platform is designed to “provide up to date information on policy, strategy and actions for food loss and waste reduction, and share best practices across countries—something which is badly needed,” says Anthony Bennett from the Rural Infrastructure and Agro-industries Division at the FAO. G20 member countries—which include China, Brazil, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States—along with other countries, will be encouraged to use the forum to share what works for them in cutting food waste, and what doesn’t. As the platform grows, it will also feature a database of low-cost, accessible technologies available to tackle this problem. The hope is that the platform will become a place where countries can unite and ultimately scale up their efforts to reduce the global impact of food waste.

These are just three of the many projects worth knowing about: as part of the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, several other food-focused initiatives were launched this week, touching on everything from low-carbon beef to the sustainable management of marine food systems.

Naomi Klein and Bill McKibben call on Paris to divest in Le Monde letter
Emma Howard
Naomi Klein, author of This Changes Everything, and environmental activist Bill McKibben have written a joint letter in Le Monde to Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, asking her to pull the city’s investments out of fossil fuels.

The campaign to divest Paris was launched on 350.org, the global climate movement founded by Bill McKibben. It calls upon the mayor to divest the pension fund of the city’s councillors and employees from fossil fuel companies, as well as to commit to not investing its new endowment fund in the same companies.

Printed in the newspaper on Tuesday, the letter begins:

People concerned about climate change were so happy to hear the news that the Paris City Council had gone on record as favouring divestment from fossil fuel companies.

The letter follows a motion to divest the funds, which was submitted by the Green Party and passed by the assembly of the city’s councillors on 16 March. However, the motion requires the mayor to approve it before it can be implemented.

Klein and McKibben write:

It’s imperative that the city government now agrees to implement this wise recommendation, and ensures that the newly created endowment fund never invests in fossil fuel companies (and refuses their donations), while making sure that the council members’ pension fund divests from the sector.

If Hidalgo backs the campaign, Paris would become the first capital city in the world to divest from fossil fuels. Klein and McKibben pay tribute to this and to its role as the host of the international climate conference, COP21, in December:

Paris will be at the center of the world’s attention. Tens of thousands of citizens will come to push for bold climate action. It has a responsibility to set an example and to go a step further. Paris should clearly use its time in the spotlight to convince other capitals to divest."

Students Speak: rich countries must engage with the global goals
The UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) will come into effect on 1 January next year, with the aim of driving the global fight against extreme poverty, inequality and climate change. And unlike the millennium development goals that preceded them, the SDGs – also known as the global goals – will apply to all countries, both rich and poor.

We asked students to share their views on the role wealthy nations should play in implementing the goals. Can the new agenda succeed? And given that the 17 goals equally apply to high- and low-income countries, which of them should wealthy countries prioritise? The response was mixed. Some students believed the world’s poorest should be front-and-centre in the new agenda, while others thought it was more important for wealthy countries to tackle problems in their own backyards.

Below is a selection of our favourite responses.

‘The new global goals represent a paradigm shift’

Whereas the millennium development goals focused mainly on the developing world, the SDGs are meant to be “global goals” equally applicable to all. As such, rich and poor countries alike need to focus on achieving the targets of the SDGs. This truly is a paradigm shift because, under the MDGs, rich countries were “developed countries”, suggesting development was complete. Under the SDGs, pure growth and economic success are insufficient: social equity and environmental impact must be considered. With the global goals, there is room for everyone to improve and, in a global environment and interconnected community, we need everyone to improve.

However, in working to achieve these goals at home, rich countries should not exclusively turn inwards in isolation. The international community needs to [unite] to achieve the SDGs globally. With the new paradigm, though, assistance should not unilaterally flow from rich to poor. Instead, universality suggests partnerships.

Thus, while the role of rich countries still needs to include aid, technology transfers, security assistance, the view of poor countries needs to shift from dependents to partners. For example, many developing countries are aggressively tackling sustainability and have lessons to teach the so-called developed countries. Likewise, mutually beneficial business endeavours can be created between rich and poor. The global goals are about working and succeeding together.

So, what’s the role of rich countries in the new global goals? Accepting that there is room to improve domestically and engaging in global partnerships to achieve the goals everywhere.

Ryan Brenner, Michigan State University College of Law, US ‘The goals must be more than a set of ideals lumbered on the poor’

The SDGs are a first world problem. The sustainability challenges identified by the SDGs are not unique to poor countries. The UN’s SDGs and their 169 proposed targets are a complex set of unwieldy yet aspirational goals. Just as the SDGs invoke scepticism as to what can be achieved in poor countries, the relevance of the SDGs to rich countries is equally contested.

Accomplishing the global and social changes embodied in the SDGs requires rich countries to prioritise sustainable development in their national policymaking.

Accordingly, their efforts must extend beyond mere lip service to the actual ratification of the UN goals. I doubt that a rich country like Australia, however, will voluntarily pursue target 13.2, which seeks to “integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning”.

As the first developed country to repeal a carbon tax, Australia’s current political climate – under Liberal leadership and the pressures of big business – makes the implementation of substantive climate change mitigation policies highly unlikely.

Looking forward, the SDGs need to become more than a set of normative ideals espoused by the rich and lumbered on the poor. The developed world must work together to enact legally binding commitments. The new global goals provide a timely opportunity for rich countries, such as Australia, to reorient their development trajectories, address problems in their own backyards, and give the cause of sustainable development more “teeth”.

Claire Guiver, University of New South Wales, Australia ‘We cannot lose sight of the ultimate goal - to assist the world’s poorest’

The SDGs have been conceived to try to dismantle the global north-south divide, through a framing that makes them applicable to all nations, regardless of wealth. While achieving equity among nations on this front is a worthy aspiration, it is important that, in pursuit of their own objectives, wealthier nations do not lose sight of the SDGs’ primary purpose: dramatically improving quality of life for the global poorest. Incorporating more affluent nations in a way that allows active engagement with targets is admirable, but it is important that this does not distract from helping those most in need.

This is highlighted by the current gap that exists in nutritional funding: recent research by the Lancet has estimated that deaths among children under five could be reduced by 15% globally if 10 nutrition interventions, ranging from iron supplementation to salt iodisation, were scaled to 90% coverage worldwide. The projected cost of doing this is $9.6bn (?6.2bn), yet the Countdown Collaboration estimates nutritional funding for 2012 as only $324.5 million. While there has been some progress in addressing this disparity (the Department for International Development has committed to tripling its nutrition funding between 2013 and 2020), a huge gap in what is needed and what is available still exists.

It is vital that the focus of more affluent nations, the largest aid donors, remains on closing this gap and others like it, and that the shift of focus from poorer nations to all nations that accompanies the adoption of the SDGs does not trigger a concomitant shift in funding away from the global poorest.

Charlie Whittaker, University of East Anglia, UK‘The SDGs provide a golden opportunity for rich countries to act’

It is outdated thinking that poorer countries are the sole recipients of development. The SDGs must apply to all, including rich nations. There are development issues faced by all the world’s countries, no matter their prosperity. For example on SDG 7, prosperous countries must tackle their gender pay gaps just as much as poorer nations eradicate female genital mutilation.

Rich nations must also take action on issues that directly affect poorer countries’ ability to meet the SDGs. Climate change is an important example. Sustainability is another. An area of the Amazon rainforest the size of 100 football pitches is cut down every hour for grazing cows, to keep up with the levels of meat consumption demanded by rich countries. Therefore it is inconceivable to promote sustainable development (SDG 15) without rich countries first acting on consumption (SDG 12).

However, this isn’t to suggest that poorer countries are no longer the priority. Richer nations mustn’t lose focus on the deprived nations the SDGs aim to help. It is the responsibility of the relatively rich to help those in need, including the 700 million in extreme poverty. Also, the government, private sector and public of every rich nation has a fundamental role to play in raising the large investment needed to meet the goals, for instance the €3.3tn (?2.3tn) for global infrastructure called for under SDG 9.

The ratification of the SDGs and COP21 makes 2015 a golden opportunity for change. Going forward, we must ensure rich countries play their fullest role at home and abroad, in helping the world reach the SDGs.

Chujan Sivathasan, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK‘We have to be sceptical of wealthy countries’ agendas’

The SDGs represent a modern take on the ideal society. While the millennium development goals focused on aspects of global health and economy, the introduction of an explicit focus on sustainability is a key point that distinguishes the SDGs.

These goals represent a real attempt to implement policy changes on a global scale, in line with modern sustainable development theories. I am, nevertheless, sceptical of the commitments made by rich countries to achieving these goals. Current levels of resource and energy consumption indicate that not all of the world can achieve high levels of development. While countries like India and China are closing the gap, rapidly growing populations, transboundary resource disputes and water shortages forecast worrying future scenarios for the next 50 years.

There is an unhealthy tendency in the west, however, to conflate sustainability targets with the politics of the left and right. In Australia, the political right often tries to sweep efforts to mainstream sustainable practices under the rug. Just as they claim that pursuit of these goals would make the country economically vulnerable, massive industrial constructions along the Great Barrier Reef promise to seriously degrade the surrounding environment. It is imperative that rich countries make sustainable development less of a political choice, and more an integral part of the system. Only then will their sustainability efforts become truly “sustainable”, serving also as a model for developing countries to emulate.

Damian Meduri, University of New South Wales, Australia‘Big polluters must be held to account’

Since the narrative of the SDGs and the agenda behind them are products of the global north’s imagination and construction, rich countries should inevitably be held accountable on the sustainability progress they make. However, their scenario for the adoption of the SDGs will differ substantially from the path developing countries have to take.

From my vantage point, rich countries should join forces to keep climate change at bay. The current development model is based on growth that is at odds with our planet’s finite resources. In this context, never ending pledges to get on more environmentally benign tracks are often hypocritical. Take Germany, with its ambitious Energiewende plan to cut emissions 40% by 2020 and almost completely decarbonise by 2050. With this in mind, it is easy to forget that Rhineland Coalfield, according to Klimacamp, is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. One of its coal plants alone emits 29m tonnes of CO2 a year, which is an equivalent of nearly one tonne a second.

The global north is fortunate enough to be able to prioritise certain SDGs and it should be goal 13 they take urgent action on. We share this planet with 7.2 billion people and the potential success of other SDGs will pale beside the fact that climate change continues to grip the Earth and rich countries do not change their course from mindless pursuit of growth to a more sustainable model.

Activists promise largest climate civil disobedience ever at Paris summit
Thousands of climate change campaigners have promised to blockade a major UN climate summit in Paris with what they say will be non-violent direct action on a scale Europe has not seen before.

Grassroots groups from 350.org to Attac France are throwing their weight behind the “Climate Games” event for the landmark climate conference in December. The protests will involve 10 blockades, themed around “red lines” which they fear negotiators for the nearly 200 countries inside the summit may cross.

Governments are meeting in the French capital in the hope of reaching an agreement for action on climate change after 2020. Campaigners have shelved earlier plans to prevent delegates leaving the summit until they reach an emissions-cutting deal that matches activist ambitions.

“The redlines idea strikes just the right balance between ‘shut it down’ and ‘do your job’,” the author and campaigner Naomi Klein told the Guardian. “I also think that it is strong enough to grab the narrative, which will be critical if governments try to sell a bad deal as a success.”

On the last day of the summit - 11 or 12 December - thousands of people are expected to converge around the Le Brouget summit site with inflatable red lines, said John Jordan, an artist and prominent activist in the laboratory of insurrectionary imagination.

“The idea is not to lock the delegates in but to have acts of civil disobedience that block the streets and infrastructure, if they cross red lines that are minimal necessities for a liveable planet.”

Protesters can choose the red line they want to join, whether it is equitable climate finance for poorer countries, or meaningful emissions reductions. At the blockades, forums will debate a new wave of actions in 2016 aimed at keeping fossil fuels locked underground.

“It is going to be the largest mass civil disobedience climate justice action that we have ever seen in Europe,” said Prayal Parekh, a campaigner with 350.org. “We’re sensing a lot of excitement and appetite. It’s going to be colourful.”

Juliette Rousseau, a spokeswoman for Coalition Climat 21 added: “It is the first time in France that we have had such a broad coalition - over 130 members - backing such a diversity of actions and tactics, from demonstration to disobedient actions.”

A potentially huge march on 29 November will kick off the protests as world leaders arrive at the summit. The demo is an attempt to emulate last year’s People’s Climate March in New York city, which drew 300,000 people onto the streets. Major environmental groups such as Greenpeace and WWF are jointly organising it with online campaigners Avaaz, trades unions and faith groups.

After that, the so-called Climate Games will begin. Activists can anonymously register for teamsonline and, over the two-week period, download targets for non-violent direct actions – or upload maps to enable others to join in.

As the summit continues, the games are intended to escalate with a mixture of protests, street art, attention-grabbing actions and online hacks.

“There have definitely been conversations with Anonymous,” one activist source said. I know that [the Climate Games activists] have been chatting with them but I don’t know if they’ve made any concrete plans yet.”

In a taste of things to come, Attac France last week began a process of “ requisitioning” 196 chairs from global banks (one for each of the countries at the climate talks) to draw attention to the potential climate funds that could be raised from a clampdown on tax evasion.

A business conference, Solutions COP21, whose partners include Engie (formerly GDF Suez), Renault Nissan, Suez Environment and L’Oreal, also looks likely to be targeted.

The Climate Games’ internal guidelines, seen by the Guardian, say it will oppose any attempts to “use our mobilisation for reactionary, nationalist or violent goals.”

Parekh said that non-violent action was vital. “I’m from India and civil disobedience is how my country got its independence,” she said. “Now we’re at the cusp of a chance to shift away from fossil fuels and make our societies more equitable and I want to seize the opportunity for a better future. I don’t want to have to read about the hottest summer ever or Pacific islands disappearing anymore.”"

Will politicians embrace open data at the COP21 climate talks?
At the end of the month, world governments will convene at the UN COP21 conference in Paris for the next round of binding emission commitments aimed at restricting global warming to no more than two degrees by the end of the century.

When it comes to agreeing potentially tougher targets, both policymakers and members of the public will now be armed with the COP21 climate change calculator, developed by the Climate-KIC, the EU’s main climate innovation research centre, in collaboration with Imperial College, London and FT.com.

Using data on the emission reduction pledges made to date and scientific forecasts on future warming, it aims to inform the public and policymakers on the impact a variety of choices by individual countries would have on overall global warming.

Users can track the progress of current pledges until 2030 and then see what other action is needed by sliding countries’ individual emissions up and down to see the overall impact on the two degree target.

The project was led by Jeremy Woods, co-director of the Centre for Energy Policy and Technology at Imperial College London, which also developed the Global Calculator from open data made available by the International Energy Agency and the Department of Energy and Climate Change. It allows users to change emissions from different contributors, such as transport and land use, to see how changes in behaviour, across the globe could impact climate change.

“The calculators shows that it’s still possible to hit two degrees warming but the big take out is [that] though it’s not too late, we need some major commitments from the biggest emitters, they’ve got to lead the way,” he says.

“The beauty of the open data and scientific forecasts we’ve put in to the calculators is it empowers people to have a go for themselves and see how individual changes can add up to make an overall change. It means the policymakers and the public can be well informed with free, simple-to-use tools.”

Mapping risks

At the European Environment Agency the emphasis is on taking the data on pollution levels EU countries must supply to the Copenhagen-based organisation and combining them with other sources of open data, such as population statistics, held by Eurostat. This information can be cross-referenced with freely available satellite imagery which shows land use and soil conditions.

This end result are fascinating maps where multiple layers of data can be added or taken away by any member of the public, as well as policymakers, to answer all manner of environmental enquiries. Typical areas of investigation include the level of soil permeability, which is useful for flood risk evaluation, to temperature variations in cities which could lead to health issues, as Birgit Georgi, EEA project manager, explains.

“We don’t make decisions or predictions, we put the data in the hands of the public and policymakers,” she says.

“We have maps which show where the surface can absorb less water and also where there is likely to be a scarcity of water, both now and predicted in the future. We are also working on showing how urbanisation can mean towns and cities have so much built up areas without green spaces to let them cool down.

“Our maps show the cities which are 10 degrees warmer than the surrounding rural areas at night. It’s important because in 2003 there was a heatwave across Europe which was linked to thousands of premature deaths. When cities can’t cool down at night, citizens’ bodies don’t have a chance to rest and it risks the health of vulnerable people.”

Lifting the lid on pollution

The EEA also produces pollution maps which track, in near real time, levels of ozone, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide in addition to any airborne particles that are smaller than 10 micrometres in size. According to Alberto Gonzalez Ortiz, project manager for air quality data and policy assessment, the maps can show citizens, as well as policymakers, where areas change colour to reveal levels at which governments are legally obliged to take remedial action.

“Most of the EU countries provide near real time information so we can show the latest situation for each pollutant with a sliding scale for the past week, so you can see how levels have built up or gone down,” he says.

“Nitrous oxide is a very important one because it comes from traffic pollution and there are levels, which we show, that member states can only exceed for 18 hours in a year or, at the top level, they are obliged to take immediate action. The information we are supplied from monitoring stations was undoubtedly part of the decision for Paris to recently ban cars from the city for a day and to make public transport free. The authorities would have had the data internally but we make it publicly available for free.”

More data coming soon

The good news for open data and the environmentally-minded is that over the next couple of years the European Space Agency’s ongoing Copernicus project will make imagery from a new family of six earth observation satellites freely available. Two are already launched and four more are expected to follow by 2021. They will allow more detailed research with imagery updated far quicker than ever before as gaps between satellite “footprints” get smaller, according to Karin Viergever, an analyst specialising in land use at environmental software company Econemtrica, which provides environmental services for governments, NGOs and corporates.

She predicts that ESA’s commitment to open data, which follows in the footsteps of NASA’s imagery having been free for many years, will greatly increase our understanding of the links between land use and the environment with the bonus of also providing data on marine conditions.

In the meantime, when the global governments meet in Paris at the end of the month, they will find that not only are they better informed on climate change than ever before, so too are citizens, thanks to researchers combining multiple streams of open data and making them freely available and available to explore online by an ever-curious public."

Labor says Australia must 'tell story of Pacific to world' at Paris climate talks
Australia should “tell the story of the Pacific to the world” when global leaders sit down to climate change talks in Paris at the end of this month, Labor has said.

The impact of climate change on the nations of the Pacific is a focus for both the government and opposition ahead of COP21, where governments of more than 190 nations will gather to discuss a possible new global climate accord.



The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, accompanied by foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek and immigration spokesman Richard Marles, will visit Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, and Kiribati over four days this week, while the government’s minister for international development and the Pacific, Steve Ciobo, will travel to New Caledonia, Fiji and Niue.

The Labor leaders said climate change was an existential threat to some countries in the region.

“The dangerous consequences of climate change is no more evident than in the Pacific region. Pacific leaders have consistently identified climate change as the greatest threat to their livelihoods, food production, housing, security and wellbeing.

“This is a serious problem that demands serious attention.”

Marles, the former parliamentary secretary for Pacific island affairs, told Guardian Australia that it was important for Australia to have strong and constructive relations with its Pacific neighbours.

He praised Pacific leaders, in particular Kiribati’s president, Anote Tong, for highlighting the issues being faced by Pacific nations on the international stage.

“It is crucial that, in the lead-up to Paris, the world understands the problems being faced by the Pacific. And it’s important that Australia plays a role in telling that story of the Pacific to the world.”

Ciobo said in a statement that climate change, along with the linked areas of economic growth and trade, were key challenges for Australia’s relationship with the region.

“Australia recognises climate change is a critical issue for our region, with significant potential to impact prospects for economic growth and stability. We are working with Pacific island countries on resilience measures through the Green Climate Fund and our regional aid program.”

Australia’s relationship with the Pacific, especially over the issue of climate change, was damaged in September when the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, was picked up by a boom mic joking about climate change with then prime minister Tony Abbott.

Related: Paris climate summit: 'The world is ready for change' | Christiana Figueres

Joking with Abbott about a meeting starting late, Dutton quipped it was running to “Cape York time”, to which Abbott replied: “We had a bit of that up in Port Moresby.”

Dutton replied: “Time doesn’t mean anything when you’re about to have water lapping at your door.”

Pacific leaders excoriated the minister. The Marshall Islands’ foreign minister, Tony de Brum, said he was “dismayed” by the “insensitivity... [of] the big polluting island down south”. PNG prime minister Peter O’Neill said the comments were unfortunate, and Tong described the joke as “vulgar”.

“As long as there is this kind of attitude, this kind of arrogance in any position of leadership, we will continue to have a lot of tension,” Tong said.

The impacts of climate change are being felt acutely by Pacific nations, many of which are low-lying, remote, and with vulnerable infrastructure.

Eight Pacific nations are in the top 20 in the world of highest losses of gross domestic product (GDP) from natural disasters, the World Bank says.

Natural disasters – an average of 41 tropical cyclones hit the region each year – cost the Pacific islands two percent of their GDP annually.

The Marshall Islands and Kiribati are particularly vulnerable. The land mass of the Marshall Islands is less than five metres above sea level and 97% of Kiribati’s land mass is below that level.

Climate change effects are being exacerbated by a significant El Nino weather pattern in the southern hemisphere this summer, which has already caused widespread drought across the Pacific, and could threaten the lives and livelihoods of millions.

An estimated 2.4 million people could face food and water shortages in Papua New Guinea alone, the country’s national disaster centre has reported. Up to two dozen people have already died from hunger and drinking contaminated water.

In Fiji and Tonga, emergency water supplies are being shipped into remote areas.

“El Nino has the potential to trigger a regional humanitarian emergency and we estimate as many as 4.1 million people are at risk from water shortages, food insecurity and disease across the Pacific,” said Sune Gudnitz from the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs."

India unveils global solar alliance of 120 countries at Paris climate summit
India’s prime minister Narendra Modi has launched an international solar alliance of over 120 countries with the French president Francoise Hollande at the Paris COP21 climate summit.

Modi told a press conference that as fossil fuels put the planet in peril, hopes for future prosperity in the developing world now rested on bold initiatives.

“Solar technology is evolving, costs are coming down and grid connectivity is improving,” he said. “The dream of universal access to clean energy is becoming more real. This will be the foundation of the new economy of the new century.”

Related: A story of hope: the Guardian launches phase II of its climate change campaign

Modi described the solar alliance as “the sunrise of new hope, not just for clean energy but for villages and homes still in darkness, for mornings and evening filled with a clear view of the glory of the sun.”

Earlier, France’s climate change ambassador Laurence Tubiana had called the group “a true game changer”.

While signatory nations mostly hail from the tropics, several European countries are also on board with the initiative, including France.

Hollande described the project as climate justice in action, mobilising public finance from richer states to help deliver universal energy access.

“What we are putting in place is an avante garde of countries that believe in renewable energies,” he told a press conference in Paris. “What we are showing here is an illustration of the future Paris accord, as this initiative gives meaning to sharing technology and mobilising financial resources in an example of what we wish to do in the course of the climate conference.”

The Indian government is investing an initial $30m (?20m) in setting up the alliance’s headquarters in India. The eventual goal is to raise $400m from membership fees, and international agencies.

Companies involved in the project include Areva, Engie, Enel, HSBC France and Tata Steel.

“It is very, very exiting to see India nailing its colours to the mast and providing leadership on this issue,” said James Watson, the director of SolarPower Europe, which represents the continents’ solar photovoltaic industry. “It will mean more opportunities for solar across the world and that can only be positive for combating climate change.”

The UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon placed the initiative in the context of the body’s sustainable development goals, particularly a related target, set in 2011, of achieving universal access to sustainable energy by 2030.

India has repeatedly said that it wants to use cheap solar to connect citizens currently without access to the electricity grid in remote and rural areas.

“The idea is that larger markets and bigger volumes will lead to lower costs making it possible to spur demand,” said Ajay Mathur, India’s senior negotiator and spokesperson at the Paris summit.

“This bold effort could bring affordable solar power to tropical villages and communities worldwide,” said Jennifer Morgan, the director of the World Research Institute’s climate programme.

India’s pledge to the Paris summit offered to draw 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. The country is projected to be the world’s most populous by then, with 1.45bn people.

Climate Action Tracker described the promise as being “at the least ambitious end of what would be a fair contribution”, and not consistent with meeting a 2C target.

But some see Modi as a clean energy enabler, after he rapidly rolled out more than 900MW of solar energy across Gujurat, while chief minister there.

“India has emerged as the natural leader for this alliance, with its ambitious targets to install 175 GW of renewable energy by 2022,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council for Energy, Environment and Water in India.

Modi’s announcement on Monday comes hot on the heels of a pledge by the US and 18 other countries to provide $20bn for clean energy research by 2020, a doubling of current funding commitments.

A separate ‘ Breakthrough energy coalition ’, which will act as an investment platform for clean energy projects is also being launched on Monday by Bill Gates and the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

On Sunday, Dubai announced a Dh100bn ($27bn) programme to make solar panels mandatory for all rooftop buildings by 2030, part of a plan to make the city a global clean energy centre.

Dubai aims to generate 25% of its energy from clean sources by 2030, rising to 75% by 2050.

The Indian initiative, called the International Agency for Solar Technologies and Applications (Iasta), aims to spread cheap solar technology across the globe – with pooled policy knowledge.

“We share a collective ambition to undertake innovative and concerted efforts aimed at reducing the costs of financing and urgent technological deployment for competitive solar facilities throughout our country,” a membership statement by the alliance says.

It adds that the alliance will “pave the way for production technologies and storage of solar-energy, adapted to the specific needs of our country”."

Solar technology: the US and China look to Australian innovators for solutions
In the last fiscal year, Australia earned $172bn from international sales of its natural resources. But earnings are decreasing. The office of the chief economist estimates that energy commodities earnings declined by 6% to $67bn last year because of a decline in revenue from coal exports, and that exports of refined petroleum products have declined by an average of 11% a year over the last decade.

There are hopes however, that Australia could bolster its position by developing its exports of renewable energy – especially those generated through solar technology. The opportunity is there. China – one of Australia’s major coal buyers – has committed to increase its share of non–fossil fuels as part of its primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030.

Keith Lovegrove, head of solar thermal at the IT Power Group, who is currently helping to develop a roadmap on solar fuels for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: “Here we are in a world where, as of COP21, we’re shooting to keep global warming below 2C, and we’ll all have to decarbonise. Exporting coal as our major export earner has a limited future. We need to talk about swapping that coal export for a renewable export.”

With more than 200 partly sunny days a year, and more than 8m square metres of land mass, solar seems like an obvious direction for Australia to take.

One company that’s been successful in this regard is Infratech Industries, an Australian–owned sustainable infrastructure company, which sold and exported its innovative floating solar system – similar to the one currently in operation in Jameson, South Australia that generates around 57% more power than a fixed, land-based system – to the city of Holtville in California earlier this month.

Manufactured to mitigate the need for solar installations to be built on valuable farmland, the 1MW floating solar assembly will float on the surface of water reservoirs at the city’s new water treatment facility next year. It will include 276 rafts and 3,576 solar panels, which are fitted with mirrors to concentrate the sunlight on the panels and generate more power.

As well as powering the water treatment processes, the array has the added advantage of reducing surface evaporation of the water. It diminishes the penetration of sunlight below the water surface and limits the growth of blue green algae and consequently the need for chemical treatment. And it’s also able to withstand earthquakes due to the assembly’s ability to shift on the surface of the water, which is handy given Holtville is situated near the San Andreas fault line.

Dr Rajesh Nellore, chief executive officer of Infratech Industries, says that there is a huge market for the technology – for the anti-evaporation aspects as well as the power generation.

“Practically every water reservation is an opportunity and this could be valued in the billions of dollars,” he says, adding that Los Angeles’ department of power and water recently purchased 96m rubber balls at a cost of US$34.5m (AU$48.2m) to prevent water evaporation.

“With this kind of renewable infrastructure [acting as] an alternative to rubber balls, the market potential is gigantic.”

Related: 'Game-changing' perovskite solar tech could be cheaper and more efficient

The US isn’t the only market investing in Australian concentrated solar photovoltaic technology (CSPV). China’s state-owned power company Three Gorges corporation signed a memorandum of understanding with Australian company RayGen earlier this year for the deployment of 500MW of utility-scale CSPV power over the next five years, which could deliver approximately $1bn of sales for the solar technology provider and its Chinese partners, JuYe Solar.

Dr Nellore believes that more government action is needed to establish confidence in the renewable energy export market.

He says there has historically been “limited [government] support for such decentralised infrastructure and especially for small- and medium-sized companies, which form the backbone of the Australian economy.” He calls on the federal government to “change its paradigm to become an exporter of renewable energy.”

“The federal government could start to value and monetise water savings [to] encourage local governments to do the same. Policies must support and encourage water savings in view of the changing climate.

With the global climate deal resulting in increased ambition to decarbonise the energy sector worldwide, it may not be long before Australia’s renewable energy export takes off.

Ian Kay, acting CEO of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which invested $1.7m in RayGen’s CSPV Australian pilot project, said: “The Australian market is relatively small in the global context. By tapping into overseas markets, Australian renewable energy innovation can be rolled out to a much larger customer base to bring down costs and become more competitive.”"

COP21: the climate case for investing in African livestock?
The potential of extensive livestock systems in African drylands is a topic buzzing in and around the United Nations climate change conference in Paris - COP21. Livestock trade driven by pastoralism in the Horn of Africa is worth some ?660m annually, in Burkina Faso and Mali at least ?120m annually and in Kenya, livestock accounts for about 10% of GDP and about 42% of agricultural GDP.

Livestock losses during the 2011 drought in Kenya caused an average growth reduction of 2.8% each year from 2008-2011. If pastoralists – livestock herders – had been able to sell their livestock or access forage and water to keep them alive, these losses could have been avoided and emergency aid reduced in the order of ?260 savings for every 66p spent on reducing the quantity of stock held - a clear investment case for the public and private sectors alike.

There is growing recognition that customary institutions that characterise pastoralism, not least mobility of herders, offer a climate resilient production system for drylands that are increasingly dealing with climate change impacts like drought.

For the first time, a wide range of stakeholders are now coming together to find ways to expand opportunities for pastoralists. At Development and Climate Days, the organisation Pathways to Resilience in Semi-Arid Economies (Prise) brought together the private sector, government, civil society and researchers in discussions on unlocking the economic potential of livestock systems for climate resilience with a high-level panel on climate-resilient growth in the drylands.

“Pastoralism is a sustainable enterprise – economically, ecologically and socially,” said Maryam Niamir- Fuller, former special advisor to the executive director on Post 2015 and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), at a session on moving towards sustainable pastoralism and responsible consumption of livestock products organised by United Nations Environment Programme at the Global Landscapes Forum in Paris on Sunday.

Governments are making important investments in the livestock sector: building abattoirs, livestock markets and water infrastructure. The private sector is also investing in pastoralist regions. In Kenya, insurance companies and veterinary manufacturers are extending their supply of goods and services to pastoralist regions, finding that pastoralists are willing to pay for products that improve their herds. But barriers to entry are still high for investors.

Potential for adaptation

The theme across these discussions is that adaption to climate change is synonymous with good development. In Africa’s drylands, pastoralists have been marginalised from development for decades and live with climate variability every day; livestock is the most appropriate basis for climate-resilient, inclusive economic development. Adaptation finance and planning offers governments the means to create an enabling environment for a thriving livestock sector.

While there appears to be general consensus among UN member states on the need for adaptation finance, there is growing recognition that subnational adaptation planning and finance can be just as important. Adaptation opportunities can be driven forward by appropriate allocation of resources to devolved government, such as counties in Kenya and states in Ethiopia. Climate change offers some development opportunities in these regions, but adaptation finance must be available to those decision makers closest to the ground for these to be realised.

Countries in the Horn of Africa are also waking up to the fact that regional cooperation on drought risk management can reduce economic losses and build resilience, in part by supporting investment in markets, infrastructure and human capital. Such investments can put livestock markets on an equal footing with other primary sectors. From discussions in Paris, it is clear that countries in west Africa are keen to learn from the experiences of other regions.

Potential for mitigation

Livestock often gets a bad rap in emissions discussions. There has been no shortage of sound-bites in the past couple of weeks about the contribution of livestock production to global warming. However, there are few conclusive studies on the carbon and methane footprints of different livestock systems. Failing to recognise the difference in discussions of emissions gives a misleading, and frankly dangerous, picture of the livestock sector.

What we do know, is that there is growing and compelling evidence that rangelands can store as much carbon in soils and vegetation as forest, if managed sustainably. Experience from carbon markets in forest ecosystems tells us that communally managed carbon stores are attractive to investors and enhance opportunities for inclusive adaptation and climate adaptation.

The SDGs explicitly include pastoralists in the goal to end hunger, “through secure and equal access to land, other productive resources and inputs, knowledge, financial services, markets and opportunities for value addition”. Harnessing the potential of livestock in Africa’s drylands sounds as close to a triple win as we are likely to get. Luckily for the world’s 200 million pastoralists, politicians, investors and donors are finally beginning to see things the same way."

Around the world, fresh water supplies are drying up: California in the US and São Paulo in Brazil are enduring historic droughts, groundwater sources have been plundered in south Asia, and globally more than 750 million people lack access to safe drinking water. The global fresh water shortage is one of the world’s most pressing challenges, yet the issue is not scheduled to be discussed at Cop21 – the UN’s climate change conference – in Paris this December.

Those working to deliver water to communities or conserve fresh water sources have a duty to demonstrate ways to adapt to climate change and help policymakers understand the importance of water in a warming world. NGOs, businesses and others working in the sector must build alliances to show how to improve the world’s water problems, such as making the transition to solar energy or planting drought-resistant crops.

This was the central message of a panel discussion, organised by the Guardian and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), and sponsored by Fundación Femsa, which creates programmes focused on conservation and the sustainable use of water. The panel discussion was held at SIWI’s annual World Water Week conference.

Although Cop discussions have been held for the past 20 years, the issue of fresh water has not been part of the official agenda, even though it is so closely linked to climate change.

Water projects that help communities adapt to climate change
The panellists suggested that the most effective way for water to be incorporated into climate policy would be through an action agenda where those working in the sector could show governments the types of water projects that could help communities mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

“It’s important to demonstrate initiatives and good examples to drive the process – don’t depend on the decisions being made in Paris,” said Karin Lexén, director of World Water Week, International Process and Prizes. Benedito Braga, president of the World Water Council, agreed: “We need to have interesting proposals of projects on the ground, which means involving not only national governments, but also the private sector and the academic community.”

However, there was some debate around whether or not water needs to be included in the resulting climate change agreement from Cop21. “One of the things I’ve seen throughout all these years of Cop talks is that even if the topic is not present [in the text], the water still creeps in,” said Vidal Garza Cantu, director of Fundación Femsa.

The language used to talk about climate change was a key theme throughout the discussion. David Tickner, WWF’s head of fresh water programmes, said that while some people do not understand climate change, they do understand floods and droughts. “If we communicated on floods and droughts and their connection to climate change in some areas, that could help our politics.”

Encouraging governments and policymakers to look at how water is essential to their biggest priorities, such as energy supply, could also help, said Dominic Waughray, head of public-private partnerships at the World Economic Forum.

India’s reliance on coal
Waughray cited India’s pursuit of energy access through coal as an example. While coal may be the cheapest and most reliable source of energy for India, it is crucial to demonstrate that in the long run, it is not the most sustainable option because of the amount of water needed. “How secure is your coal plan when you’ll need an awful lot of water to cool all those power stations?” said Waughray, demonstrating how to present the issue to officials. “In the US, 26% of installed capacity for coal is in water-stressed areas, and look what’s happening to them right now – they are close to blackouts in some states. Is that where you want to be?”

This highlighting of the risks of using water so recklessly has encouraged action in the private sector. “We have looked at our business risk and understood how climate change and water issues are going to change how we do business in 10 or 20 years’ time, and impact on our profitability” said Ellen Silva, senior manager of applied sustainability at General Mills.

“I would call out to corporations to be transparent about your risks. Face them and you’ll find partners lining up to work with you and solve those problems.”

Tickner, however, urged caution around using risk terminology, saying that while it resonates with the private sector and governments, opportunities must also be talked about. “What are the opportunities here for governments and business to do things better? Opportunity terminology can also be very powerful,” he said. Waughray agreed: “The risk issue has sunk in. The next stage is opportunity and that’s where this momentum, the alliance-building and the positive engagement about solutions, comes into play.”

Collaboration was frequently proposed as a way to see water included in climate change discussions, with many recognising that, in the past, some of the most effective alliances were formed on the sidelines. Waughray cited the New York declaration on forests, a commitment by world leaders to end natural forest loss by 2030 that grew out of the secretary general’s Climate Summit in 2014, as a successful example in the forestry sector.

Lexén explained that during the various climate conferences and diplomatic processes over the years, SIWI has tried to stay on the sidelines, talking to people about how they can assist the organisation’s work. “What we’ve seen when we’ve been in the corridors of conferences, is that we get more and more requests from the secretariat to feed into their programmes.” Sometimes, Lexén told the audience, it is more important to be there and be ready to respond to the cause than to ask decision makers: “Please could you put a bit about water in [the Cop21] text?”

One alliance the water community could build upon, said Cantu, is with science. “When you get the basics of scientific knowledge and technology in to the discourse on water, you get all the allies that you want,” he said. “It’s important that we pursue knowledge on water to the edge, to share it with other communities and make it available so we can allow other allies to join in a very clear effort.”

The issue of finance, and how to obtain funding for climate change adaptation and mitigation projects, was raised by several of the expert panellists. The water sector must reach out to governments that can make changes, support ideas around adaptation, and put the financial resources in place, said Braga: “You have a beautiful declaration, you commit to this and that, but where is the money going to come from?” The goal, he said, is to motivate governments to contribute to a fund that will support poor countries already facing the effects of climate change to become more resilient.

Green Climate Fund
The chair of the debate, Karl Mathiesen, however, questioned whether or not such a financial mechanism already existed in the form of the Green Climate Fund – a framework established by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – to redistribute money from developed to developing countries, to fund adaptation and mitigation initiatives.

Braga said yes, that is the purpose of the fund, but that until now it has focused on reducing carbon emissions and not measures such as building water infrastructure and supporting water governance.

Lexén added that throughout the World Water Week conference, she had listened to talks by Héla Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the Green Climate Fund: “I think the message she is conveying is that there’s a decision for the fund to give 50% to adaptation projects and 50% to mitigation projects. But so far, they haven’t received high-quality projects on water so we need to deliver on that.”

Tickner stressed the importance of water professionals being involved in the planning and design of any financial mechanisms geared towards funding climate change adaption and mitigation measures.

As for the types of initiatives water professionals show to decision makers, Tickner had a range of ideas: “We could show how you can conserve areas such as peatlands or wetlands, which are important carbon sinks.

 Headshot of Vidal Garza Cantu, Director, Femsa Foundation

“We could help to show how you can zone river basins to get the maximum sustainable hydropower out of them, without screwing up ecosystems.

“We could work on demand management for water. We can show urban spatial planning and its win-wins for water, climate, biodiversity and health. There are 101 things we can do that would be positive, full of great opportunities and will produce mutual benefits.

“If bad mitigation or adaptation projects get funded, they can have really negative trade-off effects,” he said. “So we need to get in there and ask how can you design a project where: those trade-offs are transparent; there is an equitable process for making decisions about what gets approved and what doesn’t; and as many win-win projects are funded as possible.”

On one viewpoint the panel was unanimous: that Cop21 is not the end of efforts to get water included in climate change talks. “This is just part of a process,” said Braga. “We should not think only of one single event – it’s a process that moves forward.”"

Tutu, Klein and Chomsky call for mass climate action ahead of Paris conference
Desmond Tutu, Vivienne Westwood, Naomi Klein and Noam Chomsky are among a group of high-profile figures who will issue a mass call to action on Thursday ahead of the UN’s crunch climate change conference in Paris in December.

They call for mass mobilisation on the scale of the slavery abolition and anti-apartheid movements to trigger “a great historical shift”.

Their statement, published in the book Stop Climate Crimes, reads: “We are at a crossroads. We do not want to be compelled to survive in a world that has been made barely liveable for us... slavery and apartheid did not end because states decided to abolish them. Mass mobilisations left political leaders no other choice.”

Bill McKibben, founder of environmental movement 350.org, which has launched the project with the anti-globalisation organisation Attac France, described the move as a “good first step” towards Paris.

“It’s important for everyone to know that the players at Paris aren’t just government officials and their industry sidekicks. Civil society is going to have its say, and noisily if need be. This is a good first step,” he said.

There are now less than 100 days until the UN’s Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris, where leaders from more than 190 countries will gather to discuss a potential new agreement on climate change. Last week the EU’s climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete warned that negotiations ahead of the conference must accelerate if any agreement is to be meaningful.

Artists, journalists, scientists and academics are among the 100 signatories to the statement alongside activists Vandana Shiva, Nnimmo Bassey and Yeb Sano, the Filipino diplomat who lead a fast of hundreds at the 2013 UN climate change summit in Poland after typhoon Haiyan devastated his country.

They target corporations and international trade, calling for an end to government subsidies for fossil fuels and a freeze on extraction.

“Decades of liberalisation of trade and investments have undermined the capacity of states to confront the climate crisis. At every stage powerful forces – fossil fuel corporations, agro-business companies, financial institutions, dogmatic economists, sceptics and deniers, and governments in the thrall of these interests – stand in the way or promote false solutions. Ninety companies are responsible for two-thirds of recorded greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Genuine responses to climate change threatens their power and wealth, threatens free market ideology, and threatens the structures and subsidies that support and underwrite them,” they state.

The book is a collection of essays, many published for the first time. In the foreword, Desmond Tutu, the former archbishop of Cape Town who rose to fame for his stance against apartheid, writes: “Reducing our carbon footprint is not just a scientific necessity; it has also emerged as the human rights challenge of our time... history proves that when human beings walk together in pursuit of a righteous cause, nothing can resist.”

In an essay on how climate change is impacting Africa, the Nigerian environmental activist Nnimmo Bassey writes: “Temperature rises pose universal problems to the whole world, but more so for Africa. This is so because Africa has 50% higher temperatures than the global average... burning Africa is what is at stake.”

Elsewhere, climatologist Valerie Masson-Delmotte and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Jean Jouzel write on the current state of the science, while Pablo Solon, former Bolivian ambassador to the UN presents a paper diagnosing the failure of the conferences."

BP tops the list of firms obstructing climate action in Europe
BP is Europe’s fiercest corporate opponent of action on climate change, according to a ranking of companies by their efforts to obstruct carbon-cutting initiatives.

Nearly half of the world’s top 100 global companies are trying to subvert climate policies by lobbying, advertising, and influence-peddling, said the UK-based non-profit, Influence Map.

But while all the major fossil fuel firms rank close to the bottom of the group’s table, BP emerges as Europe’s strongest advocate of dirty energy, opposing even mild measures to raise carbon trading prices.

“BP has been consistently opposed to all the main forms of climate change regulation,” said Thomas O’Neill, Influence Map’s research director. “There is very little positivity coming out of them and they are a board member of several obstructionist trade associations, some of which give a very dubious account of climate science.”

Related: BP lobbied against EU support for clean energy to favour gas, documents reveal

The new rankings used a methodology developed by the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists to measure corporate positions on climate legislation against criteria such as transparency, company performance and lobby interventions.

Google and Unilever were judged the best performing global businesses – both taking a ‘B’ rating – while Koch Industries, Phillips 66, Reliance Industries and Duke Energy footed the table, receiving ‘F’ grades.

Altogether, 45% of the top 100 global brands were found to be blocking moves to a low carbon economy.

Not all of these firms carry the same geopolitical punch as BP. A briefing document given to the former UK business minister Vince Cable for a meeting with senior BP officials last year, seen by the Guardian, gives a glimpse of the firm’s tight connections to British government officials.

“UKTI (UK Trade and Industry) see Iraq’s oil and gas sector as a significant opportunity for UK companies, and I know they are working closely with BP Iraq, in particular your Chief Procurement Officer Philip Usherwood, to help reinforce your supply chain through its High Value Opportunity programme,” said the heavily redacted document, which is dated 1 September, 2014.

In Europe, BP joined Shell in sculpting a winning industry push to scrap the EU’s renewable energy and energy efficiency goals, in favour of a single greenhouse gas target for 2030 that could be met by an increased use of natural gas.

Related: Revealed: BP's close ties with the UK government

BP’s influential trade representative, Eurogas, was the strategy’s prime advocate in Brussels. The group pursued a strategy which accepted long-term EU climate goals, while resisting action to deliver them through renewables.

“Eurogas is very involved in the EU’s policy-making process and warrants close attention,” O’Neil said. “Trade associations don’t have to protect their reputations in the public eye.”

In 2011, BP requested that EU leaders meet with Eurogas. In one of the many lobby forays that followed, Eurogas’s secretary-general Beate Raabe urged an audience of senior EU officials and diplomats to recognise the role that fossil fuels could play in cutting emissions by a switch from dirty coal to cleaner gas.

The strategy was well-received. An email to Eurogas last year from the commission’s director-general for energy, Dominique Ristori, said that the bloc “fully shared” its objective of linking a single climate goal for 2030 to considerations of industrial competitiveness, energy security and economic recovery.

“Please rest assured that there will be more opportunities to take into account Eurogas’s priorities in the new [climate and energy] framework,” said Ristori in the email, which the Guardian obtained in an access to documents request.

Gretchen Goldman, the lead analyst at the Union of concerned Scientists, said it was unacceptable for industry to obstruct climate action, without due processes of accountability.

“More and more, we’re seeing companies rely on their trade groups to do their dirty work of lobbying against comprehensive climate policies,” she said. “Companies get the delay in policy they want, while preventing nations from acting to fight climate change.”

BP is also a board member of the National Association of Manufacturers, and the American Petroleum Institute, which has raised doubts as to whether oil and gas emissions are responsible for global warming.

Shell was judged the best performing fossil fuel firm in the new table, gaining a ‘D-’ grade, due to its support for higher carbon prices, which could be used to fund its plans to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.

However, Shell was recently forced to leave the Prince of Wales corporate leaders group, a green business umbrella group in Brussels.

Unlike Shell, BP has opposed measures to bolster slumping carbon prices, although the firm says it views climate change as “an important long-term issue that justifies global action”.

“BP regularly engages on issues of common interest with the European commission and governments and policy-makers around the world,” a BP spokesman said. “We support the introduction of a price on carbon because this will encourage innovation and investment in the most cost effective ways of reducing carbon emissions widely.” But O’ Neil said that such support was not borne out by BP’s positions and opposition to any form of carbon taxation or command and control legislation. And he had a warning about the lobbying role that fossil fuel firms could play at the forthcoming COP21 climate conference in Paris."

Paris climate march banned: what do you want to say to UN climate talks?
Thousands of climate change campaigners had planned to blockade the major UN climate summit COP21 in Paris this Sunday, but security concerns following the Paris attacks have seen some demonstrations banned.

Although none of the 130-plus heads of state and government due to converge in Paris have pulled out, the terrorist attacks have changed the mood of COP21 – protests – some long-planned – have been prohibited and security has been stepped up.

A potentially huge march organised by environmental groups including Greenpeace and WWF aimed to emulate last year’s People’s Climate March in New York city, and forums held in ‘red inflatable’ blockades around the main summit site are uncertain.

Protest organisers of what has been dubbed the ‘Climate Games’ – two weeks of games escalating with a mixture of protests, street art, non-violent action and online hacks – appear to acknowlegde the ban but defend the right to protest. A statement on their website reads:

“We will not bend to the politics of fear that stifle liberties in the name of security. The biggest threat to security, to life in all its forms, is the system that drives the climate disaster. History is never made by those who ask permission.”

Current commitments on greenhouse gas emissions run out in 2020, so in Paris governments will need to decide what happens for the decade after that at least, and potentially beyond.

Were you planning to protest in Paris but are put off by the ban, or maybe you’re still planning on attending? We want you to tell us what message you want to send to the heads of state and government. We’ll use a selection of responses in a feature about why people protest at climate summits and what they want."

How do I... reduce my carbon emissions?
On Monday, one of the biggest meetings in the world will begin in Paris. COP21, or the 21st conference of the parties, is the UN’s most significant summit on climate change since the 2009 meeting in Copenhagen, bringing together political leaders and delegates from just about every country in the world. Their mission is to negotiate a new deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions after 2020 – a deal on which the earth’s future may depend.

Related: World set to use more energy for cooling than heating

Why so serious?

Humanity’s emissions are approaching critical mass. Governments know this. Getting every country in the world to agree on something is not an easy task, but international negotiators recognise that in order to avoid climate calamity, global temperatures must not rise by more than 2C.

If current trends persist, that rise will be locked in within 30 years, triggering ever more extreme weather events – from droughts to heatwaves – not to mention the dramatic impact on food cycles, water insecurity and mass migration. Some even argue that climate change is a significant cause of the Syrian war, but whether you accept that or not, there is little doubt that the climate crisis will create many more conflicts. Closer to home, it is predicted that 7,000 UK homes will be lost to rising seas this century – including 800 in the next two decades – with no prospect of compensation for householders.

Indeed, even if we stay within this limit, a rise of 2C is tantamount to a death knell to many small island states.

There is also the small matter of a global economic crash, triggered by the overvaluation of fossil fuel reserves – a problem known as “the carbon bubble”. As the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently pointed out, future generations may be unable to tackle the issue when it reaches crisis point.

Essentially, we need to accelerate the transition to a world run on clean energy. Thankfully, the global climate change movement is swelling and claiming victory after victory.

Ok, I’m up for the challenge. How big is my carbon footprint anyway?

When it comes to the climate crisis, ultimately, we are all culpable. In the west in particular, almost every aspect of our lifestyles – from our smartphones to our toilets – does environmental damage. Even something necessary and seemingly innocent like a heart bypass operation swells your carbon footprint more than a flight from London to Madrid.

Every year, the average person in the UK produces about 12.5 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. The good news is that this figure has dropped as our energy use has become more efficient. The bad news is that according to the body that advises the government on climate change policy, this figure needs to shrink to two tonnes – just to give us a 50% chance of avoiding catastrophe. Thankfully, there are a multitude of ways that you can cut your carbon budget. Here are the most significant:

Stop flying

There’s a reason 13 people chained themselves to Heathrow’s northern runway in July. According to climate change expert Chris Goodall, one return flight from London to New York will blow your carbon budget for a year, creating approximately 2.25 tonnes of greenhouse gases.

If you must fly, try to reduce your impact by taking trains to nearby countries, combining trips, taking direct flights rather than multiple connections, and offsetting your emissions with ethical companies.

The health and financial benefits of cycling are well known, but if you’re investing in a new car, join the surging electric car market. Even the world’s racing car drivers are doing it now, following the launch of Formula E, the green alternative to Formula One. If you do own a car, join a network to share it with others, and if you’re of a competitive bent, learn the secrets of hypermiling, saving fuel and money by changing the way you drive.

The meat of it

Now we come to the real elephant - or more accurately, chicken, pig, or cow - in the room. If you’re not a frequent flyer, cutting your meat consumption is probably the single most significant act you could do to help save humanity from itself. The worldwide livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, trains, planes and ships on the entire planet.

In fact, based on current trends, it looks practically impossible to avoid catastrophic climate change if we retain our current diets. By 2050, emissions from the global agriculture industry will consume the world’s entire carbon budget if we don’t change our habits.

But full-bellied veganism isn’t the only way to help. Cutting down on the beef you eat is a significant first step – it warms the planet approximately 14 times more than chicken. You could also join up with other people by taking the Meat Free Mondays challenge. There could be hidden advantages, too: recent research showed that processed meat, such as bacon, ham and sausages, may significantly increase your chances of developing cancer.

Home is where the carbon is

Insulate your home: draughts are responsible for a quarter of heat loss from a home, but substantial proofing is cheap, will cut your bills, and could save half a tonne of CO 2, especially if you live in an older house. If double glazing is too big an investment, purchase radiator reflectors or an insulation jacket for your hot water tank, which will set you back about ?15 but save you half a tonne of CO 2 and more than ?100 in bills per year.

LED lights make a difference, too, consuming as little as 10% of the electricity of traditional bulbs. They also lower the nation’s risk of power cuts at peak times and, while they are expensive, you can earn the money back within two years.

You can also accelerate the transition to renewables by using them to power your home or business. Get your energy from the wind, sea and sun by switching to a renewable supplier such as Ecotricity or Good Energy.

If home improvements are your thing, go the full mile and find out how to turn where you live into a superhome.

Quit with the cat videos

Yes, I said it. The internet may seem like a paper-saving planetary friend, but the carbon footprint of the world’s data centres is now equivalent to all flights taken across the globe. More to the point, the industry is only going to grow. According to research by Greenpeace, the energy needed to power the data centres of publishing corporations now outstrips the demands of their printing presses.

But not all internet companies are equal. Some are starting to wake up to the necessity of accounting for their impact on the planet, even if their footprint is still huge. You can use the scorecard created by Greenpeace to browse selectively and put pressure on companies to make the switch to clean energy.

Internet data is growing by 20% a year and video streaming is by the far the biggest culprit. This of course means that you must under no circumstances watch videos of cats, even if they are playing keyboards, because for every minute of feline viewing pleasure, you use up 0.1g of greenhouse gases.

(Of course, this is a relatively minor habit for an individual to kick – you would have to watch this video on repeat 22.5m times to have the same impact as that trip to New York.)

Right, you’ve gone too far now. This sounds utterly rubbish. Is it possible to have any fun at all?

A few gung-ho liberals seem to think that this is still possible. Saving the planet has been used as a decent excuse for many a party, with new friendships blossoming through the growing system of initiatives that has become known as the sharing economy.

World Bank pledges extra $29bn to poorer nations for climate change fight
The World Bank has pledged to boost by up to $29bn the financial assistance pledged to poorer nations to cope with climate change, bringing closer the possibility of reaching a target of $100bn a year by 2020.

Related: Migration can help to forge a more prosperous world, says World Bank

Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank Group, said it could boost funding by a third, from 21% to 28%, in response to client demand. He spoke at a meeting of the World Bank and the IMF in Lima, Peru.

As we move closer to Paris countries have identified trillions of dollars of climate-related needs. The bank, with the support of our members, will respond ambitiously to this great challenge, Kim said.

In 2014 rich countries and businesses provided close to two-thirds, nearly $62bn, of the climate finance which is part of the global climate change negotiations, before the Paris conference this December, according to the OECD.

Rachel Kyte, the World Banks special envoy for climate change, said the banks pledge coupled with commitments from Germany, France and the UK to double their climate finance and similar pledges from multilateral development banks in Asia, Europe and Africa meant the total pledges were well on the way to $100bn.

Its a global investment plan for moving the world towards [limiting temperature rises to] two degrees which represent trillions of dollars of investment opportunity, she told the Guardian.

But Oxfam estimates only $2 billion of the total is going to the countries hardest hit by extreme weather caused by climate change, in the form of adaptation grants.

Related: World Bank's Jim Kim global slowdown harm anti-poverty drive

The charitys climate change policy expert Isabel Kreisler said finance ministers should agree at least half of public funding going towards the $100bn goal should be for adaptation.

Most of the money is going to green energy investments such as climate-smart transport solutions, renewable energy and enhanced water security.

We should now see climate finance as investment in the low carbon transition, Laurence, the French ambassador for the COP21 said.

Finance ministers from the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change, the V20, who held their inaugural meeting on Thursday, echoed calls to boost adaptation funding.

The countries range from Tuvalu, a Pacific island of 10,000 people, to Bangladesh and the Philippines."

James Hansen, father of climate change awareness, calls Paris talks 'a fraud'
Mere mention of the Paris climate talks is enough to make James Hansen grumpy. The former Nasa scientist, considered the father of global awareness of climate change, is a soft-spoken, almost diffident Iowan. But when he talks about the gathering of nearly 200 nations, his demeanour changes.

Related: John Kerry rejects leading climate scientist's claim Paris talks were 'fraud'

“It’s a fraud really, a fake,” he says, rubbing his head. “It’s just bullshit for them to say: ‘ We’ll have a 2C warming target and then try to do a little better every five years.’ It’s just worthless words. There is no action, just promises. As long as fossil fuels appear to be the cheapest fuels out there, they will be continued to be burned.”

The talks, intended to reach a new global deal on cutting carbon emissions beyond 2020, have spent much time and energy on two major issues: whether the world should aim to contain the temperature rise to 1.5C or 2C above preindustrial levels, and how much funding should be doled out by wealthy countries to developing nations that risk being swamped by rising seas and bashed by escalating extreme weather events.

But, according to Hansen, the international jamboree is pointless unless greenhouse gas emissions aren’t taxed across the board. He argues that only this will force down emissions quickly enough to avoid the worst ravages of climate change.

Hansen, 74, has just returned from Paris where he again called for a price to be placed on each tonne of carbon from major emitters (he’s suggested a “fee” – because “taxes scare people off” – of $15 a tonne that would rise $10 a year and bring in $600bn in the US alone). There aren’t many takers, even among “big green” as Hansen labels environment groups.

Hansen has been a nagging yet respected voice on climate change since he shot to prominence in the summer of 1988. The Nasa scientists, who had been analyzing changes in the Earth’s climate since the 1970s, told a congressional committee that something called the “greenhouse effect” where heat-trapped gases are released into the atmosphere was causing global warming with a 99% certainty.

A New York Times report of the 1988 testimony includes the radical suggestion that there should be a “sharp reduction in the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide”, a plea familiar to those who have watched politicians who have traipsed up to the lectern or interviewer’s microphone in Paris over the past two weeks.

After that, things started to get a little difficult for Hansen. He claims the White House altered subsequent testimony, given in 1989, and that Nasa appointed a media overseer who vetted what he said to the press. They held practice press conferences where any suggestion that fossil fuels be reduced was considered political and unscientific, and therefore should not be uttered.

“Scientists are trained to be objective,” Hansen says. “I don’t think we should be prevented for talking about the the implications of science.” He retired from Nasa in 2013. “That was a source of friction. I held on longer than I wanted, by a year or two. I was in my 70s, it was time for someone else to take over. Now I feel a lot better.”

From being possibly America’s most celebrated scientist, Hansen is now probably its most prominent climate activist. He’s been arrested several times in protests outside the White House over mining and the controversial Keystone pipeline extension.

He is also an adjunct professor at Columbia University. When he’s in New York, he lives near the campus, surrounded by books piled on groaning shelves. Hansen’s not slowing down – he’s involved in a climate lobbying group and still undertakes the sort of scientific endeavor which helps maintain his gravitas.

One particular paper, released in July, painted a particularly bleak future for just about anyone living near the coast. Hansen and 16 colleagues found that Earth’s huge ice sheets, such as those found in Greenland, are melting faster than expected, meaning that even the 2C warming limit is “highly dangerous”.

The sea level could soon be up to five meters higher than it is today by the latter part of this century, unless greenhouse gases aren’t radically slashed, the paper states. This would inundate many of the world’s cities, including London, New York, Miami and Shanghai.

“More than half of the world’s cities of the world are at risk,” Hansen says. “If you talk to glaciologists privately they will tell you they are very concerned we are locking in much more significant sea level rises than the ice sheet models are telling us.

“The economic cost of a business as usual approach to emissions is incalculable. It will become questionable whether global governance will break down. You’re talking about hundreds of million of climate refugees from places such as Pakistan and China. We just can’t let that happen. Civilization was set up and developed with a stable, constant coastline.”

The paper has yet to be fully peer reviewed and some of Hansen’s colleagues, including his protege at Nasa, Gavin Schmidt, have voiced their doubts whether sea level rise will be quite this bad, with the IPCC projecting up to a meter by 2100.

Brickbats are thrown in a bipartisan way. Hansen feels Obama, who has made climate change a legacy issue in his final year in office, has botched the opportunity to tackle the issue.

Related: COP21 environmental photography exhibition – in pictures

“We all foolishly had such high hopes for Obama, to articulate things, to be like Roosevelt and have fireside chats to explain to the public why we need to have a rising fee on carbon in order to move to clean energy,” he says. “But he’s not particularly good at that. He didn’t make it a priority and now it’s too late for him.”

Hansen is just as scathing of leading Republicans who have embraced climate science denialism to the chagrin of some party elders.

Leading presidential candidates Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson have all derided evidence that the world is warming due to human activity while Ted Cruz, another contender, has taken time out from his campaign to to sit on an inquiry into climate science that has heard testimony from a rightwing radio host who has no scientific background.

“It’s all embarrassing really,” Hansen says. “After a while you realise as a scientist that politicians don’t act rationally.

“Many of the conservatives know climate change is not a hoax. But those running for president are hamstrung by the fact they think they can’t get the nomination if they say this is an issue. They wouldn’t get money from the fossil fuel industry.”

There is a positive note to end on, however. Global emissions have somewhat stalled and Hansen believes China, the world’s largest emitter, will now step up to provide the leadership lacking from the US. A submerged Fifth Avenue and deadly heatwaves aren’t an inevitability.

“I think we will get there because China is rational,” Hansen says. “Their leaders are mostly trained in engineering and such things, they don’t deny climate change and they have a huge incentive, which is air pollution. It’s so bad in their cities they need to move to clean energies. They realise it’s not a hoax. But they will need co-operation.”"

To destroy human civilisation we just need to continue with business as usual
Chinas strategy for dealing with air pollution is a cosmetic exercise cynically timed to coincide with the Paris summit on climate change ( Airpocalypse now: factories and schools in Beijing shut by unprecedented smog alert, 9 December).

The 24-hour WHO limit for small particulates is 25 microgrammes per cubic metre of air, though recent studies have demonstrated adverse effects on foetal development at levels well below this. During recent pollution episodes, levels as high as 900 have been recorded in Bejing and other large cities such as Baoding. Chinas ruthless determination to grow its economy has therefore rendered its cities wholly unfit for human habitation, and especially dangerous for pregnant women.

Despite all the fine speeches in Paris, China has 368 coal-fired plants under construction, and is planning a further 800. It may be investing in renewables but this does not alter the fact that China is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gases worldwide. It has also admitted understating its emissions of CO 2 by 14%. To destroy human civilisation it is not necessary to send in an army. We just needs to continue with business as usual."

Climate change could make 175 million more people go hungry  USDA report
Unchecked climate change risks plunging a further 175 million people into hunger and undernourishment worldwide, undermining progress in reducing food insecurity, a US government report warns.

Related: Food at COP21: three new initiatives spotlight food insecurity, soils, waste

The US department of agriculture analysis states that climate change is projected to result in more frequent disruption of food production in many regions and in increased overall food prices.

The impact of rising temperatures is expected to hit poor people and tropical regions the worst, while those in colder, higher-latitude areas could experience improved agricultural capacity. However, from 2050 onwards, every food-producing region in the world is expected to be detrimentally effected.

Under a business as usual scenario where global greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly cut and temperatures rise by around 4C (7.2F), the report estimates that an extra 175 million people will be undernourished by 2080. This is in addition to the number of people already going hungry today, estimated to be about 795 million by the UN.

Population growth, with an extra two billion people expected on Earth by 2050, increases the magnitude of the risk, especially when combined with social and economic changes that alter the types of foods demanded by consumers, the USDA report states.

Increasing temperatures, altered rainfall patterns and reduced availability of water in some areas will affect food production, while sea level rises  of up to a metre by the end of the century  and extreme heat may hamper the transportation of food.

The USDA report predicts that adaption and new technology will help this situation, as well as decisions on global trade that will dampen any spikes in food prices. An effective deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  which is currently being negotiated in Paris  would also be beneficial, although nations commitments thus far would still result in an average temperature rise of at least 2.7C with significant consequences for agriculture.

The past six years have been a success story in terms of global food security, said Tom Vilsack, the US agriculture secretary. Two hundred million fewer people are food insecure today than they were six years ago. The challenge we now face is whether we can maintain and even accelerate this progress despite the threats from climate change.

The USDA recently unveiled a range of voluntary programs aimed at farmers that would, if adopted, result in a reduction of 120 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2025.

Food insecurity has become a key topic at the Paris summit, with scientists at the talks revealing research that the world has lost a third of its effective arable land in the past 40 years due to erosion and pollution."

Adani’s huge Carmichael coal mine – the biggest in Australian history – has been overturned by the federal court, causing much consternation for coal advocates, chief among them Australian prime minister Tony Abbott.

He contends that Carmichael is critical for the human welfare of tens of millions of Indians and will provide power for 100 million people in India who currently have none.


Abbott warns against courts 'sabotaging' projects such as Carmichael coalmine

But the claim that 100 million will be lifted out of energy poverty by a new wave of coal exports – driven largely by Indian companies Adani and GVK’s proposals to open Queensland’s vast Galilee Basin coal fields – reveals a deep lack of understanding of the real situation in India and other countries, where large populations remain without access to electricity.

India’s population of 1.24 billion comprises 247 million households, 68% of whom live in rural villages. According to the 2011 census, 45% of these rural households – 75 million – have no electricity. Of urban households, 6 million remain without electricity, or about 8% of the total.

These figures have not changed appreciably since 2001, though around 95,000 MW of new largely coal-based electricity generation capacity was added during the intervening decade.

In other words, the benefits of adding new generation capacity accrued largely to the existing, affluent consumers. There are a number of reasons why this is the case.

In the rural areas, many remote villages are beyond the reach of the electricity grid. There are also many families in electrified villages who cannot pay for expensive electricity.

Studies have shown that when a village is more than 5km from the grid, the cost of supplying electricity from solar and other off-grid solutions is far below the costs of supplying from conventional sources such as coal.

This is due to the high cost of building out the poles and wires to provide access to coal electricity and the technical losses involved in transmitting and distributing electricity to the consumers.

In the urban areas, in addition to affordability, the constraints on the poor accessing coal power include the absence of firm ownership rights to the houses in which the families reside and the unsafe condition of the houses itself.

It is therefore simplistic and simply inaccurate to assume that new electricity generation capacity added to the grid will automatically reduce electricity deprivation among the poor.

There is also a growing public opposition to industrial projects, especially large centralised power plants, whether coal-based, hydro or nuclear, as they uproot thousands of families from their lands, pollute their environment and disrupt their lives. Upstream, coal and uranium mining activities are equally destructive.



Burning coal, whether local or imported, generates large quantities of fly ash containing toxic pollutants like lead, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, sulfur, mercury and radioactive uranium/ thorium isotopes, which adversely affect the health of the people near the power stations, often the rural poor, whose disadvantage is worsened by these health impacts.

Studies on people residing near coal-based power plants along the border of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh have revealed unsafe levels of mercury in their blood samples, at times as high as 110 parts per billion. Similarly, studies around a coal power plant in the Punjab have indicated widespread radioactive contamination of the environment, impacting the health of pregnant women and children.

Such huge social costs outweigh the perceived benefits of coal.

Though a large coal producer, India’s domestic production of coal has lagged behind the demand, increasing the country’s dependence on imports, which are presently 180 million tonnes. Most of this coal comes from Indonesia, which is cheaper than Australian coal.

The Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis has shown that the cost of producing electricity in India using Australian coal from the Galilee Basin is two times the current average wholesale cost of electricity. This makes Galilee Basin coal too expensive for India.

 Tony Abbott's defence of the Carmichael coalmine is passionate but baseless
Lenore Taylor Political editor

To address energy poverty and energy security, India’s focus must be on encouraging locally-generated and indigenous renewable energy systems and moving towards decentralised electricity generation based on renewables.

Even if one percent of the country’s land area were to be used to harness the abundantly available solar insolation at an efficiency of 10%, the country could generate 570 times India’s current electricity demand.

Australian coal, like any other coal, is not good for Indian people’s health and it will not deliver electricity to those who are currently living in energy poverty. It’s time for the Australian government and coal industry to realise that the era of Australian coal exports is coming to an end. What Indians need is affordable, locally-generated renewable energy, not coal."

Big business using trade groups to lobby against EU climate policy
Ben-Fagan Watson
When we embarked on our research into how trade groups are lobbying on EU climate policy, we knew trade associations were likely to be influential. However, we were surprised at just how important they are to companies, and how ferociously opposed some have been to recent progressive European Union climate policies.

These EU policies include attempts to strengthen the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and targets on energy efficiency and renewable power.

Related: We have three chances to change the world for the better in 2015

The policies and regulations put in place in Brussels matter to businesses. Some companies see the transition to a low-carbon society as a business opportunity, while others see it as a threat to their bottom line. It’s no surprise then that companies want to have a voice in the making of EU policy on climate change.

What has been surprising is the extent to which companies rely on trade associations to do their lobbying in the EU, and how ferociously some of these associations have opposed progressive EU climate policy.

The big eight lobbyists

In our report we investigated how eight big, influential trade associations – which either represent particular industrial sectors or claim to represent all business interests in the EU – lobby on EU climate policy. These included BusinessEurope, which has argued that EU climate targets undermine industrial competitiveness.

Another example is the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), which stated that strengthening the EU Emissions Trading System would cause “carbon leakage” – where businesses move overseas because of high energy costs in Europe – “without any environmental need”.

Trade associations are clearly a key way multinational companies influence policymakers. An independent NGO, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), surveyed thousands of companies, and found that 77% of Global 500 companies used trade associations to lobby on climate policy. That’s a huge percentage and is even higher than the percentage of companies that said they lobbied policymakers directly.

Related: Europe shouldn't be afraid of leading the world on environmental regulation

Trade associations are influential. As part of our study, we conducted anonymous interviews with people working for prominent trade associations. Some were frank about their impact with one saying that in environmental policy “there’s about 25 [MEPs] who really matter – these are the coordinators, the chairmen, the national delegation heads … I would personally consider myself a pretty crappy lobbyist if I didn’t have the mobile phone numbers of all those MEPs, if I didn’t know exactly where their offices were, and if I wasn’t in email contact with them on a pretty regular basis”. Another trade association employee claimed they had helped to shape the new EU 2030 targets.

These trade groups are well resourced; Cefic self-reported through the EU transparency register thatit has 75 lobbyists in Europe, 14 of whom have access to the European Parliament. It reported that it spends €6m a year on lobbying.

Undermining climate action

We were also surprised by how forthright some of the trade groups were in their opposition to reforms to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, or to targets on renewable power or energy efficiency. Many of the trade associations have member companies that have made strong statements on sustainability, and I question how well the positions of these companies align with the activities of their trade associations. A full list of the trade association membership (where available) can be found in the annexes to our report.

One major industry lobby group in Brussels recently said that since the arrival of the Juncker Commission it was “happy to see that growth and jobs are no longer overshadowed by environment and climate change” in the EU.

But should companies be celebrating? These lobby groups are winning short-term victories at the expense of the long-term interests of the economy and our climate. Companies with ambitious goals on climate change need to ensure their trade associations aren’t undermining their long-term interests.

I would argue that they and their trade associations need to sing from the same hymn sheet on climate policy. Many investors and civil-society groups are concerned about the “misalignment” between companies with strong sustainability statements and the actions of their trade associations. An NGO called ShareAction, as part of its Green Light campaign to highlight pension investments, is launching a campaign targeting companies on their lobbying activities in the run-up to the UN climate change conference, Cop21, in Paris in December.

Related: Climate change: how can we move beyond the committed few?

Companies need to go beyond “alignment”, and make sure that the EU is putting in place policy that protects the long-term interests of the climate and the economy. As Steve Howard, chief sustainability officer for Ikea, said in 2013 : “There is an old expression which is that winners go to market and losers go to Washington. But we now need the winners to go to Washington and Brussels and Beijing to help unlock business innovation and investment to get this problem solved.

“We have seen there is a silent majority of businesses that want to see effective leadership from government on climate change, but they have not known what to advocate for, or may have felt it is not their responsibility to do something about. The key is now for business to find its voice. We cannot defend the status quo and at the same time build a sustainable future at pace and scale,” said Howard."

'A-list' celebrities harnessed to climate deal
Arthur Neslen Brussels
Europe is launching a diplomatic push for an ambitious deal on global warming, with a plan to mobilise A-list celebrities and tens of thousands of diplomats to exert ""maximum pressure"" on key countries in international climate negotiations.

The EU plan, endorsed by ministers in Brussels, will entail 90,000 diplomats in more than 3,000 missions lobbying for pledges on carbon cuts ahead of the UN climate summit in Paris this December.

European celebrities will serve as ""climate advocates"" and front the move to make climate action a ""strategic priority"" at the G7, G20 and Major Economies Forum summits, the EU said.

The Action Plan for Climate Diplomacy, seen by the Guardian, calls for a climate action day in June and a ""100 days to Paris countdown"" event later in the year.

The aim is to raise the EU's profile and cement alliances by winning, before June at the latest, new pledges for greenhouse gas cuts (known as intended nationally determined contributions in UN jargon), which will be the backbone of a Paris deal.

""The EU has enormous soft power and we must use that to push for an ambitious agenda in Paris,"" the Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, said. ""I've urged my colleagues to commit to including climate diplomacy in their activities in the run-up to COP21 [the Paris summit], and the EU's foreign service to work more on this. We should focus our efforts on the major growth economies and climate financing.""

A British government spokesman called the diplomatic blitz ""a welcome step to ramp-up European climate diplomacy"".

The action plan cites climate change as ""a key element of preventive diplomacy"" aimed at preventing violent conflicts, through cooperation and dialogue.

The plan also goes further than past EU communications, describing climate change as ""a strategic threat affecting natural resource availability, economic stability and hence overall national and regional security"".

A diplomatic strategy plays to the EU's strengths, according to Jason Anderson, head of WWF's climate and energy policy. He said: ""The EU is not going to be a big dog in the fight, like the US or China, and having this huge diplomatic network is a real resource that it makes sense to rely on. It can have added value in preparations to build constituencies of interest ahead of Paris.""

However, the plan's recommendation that ""climate financing expectations need to be managed"" could disappoint emerging economies. Rich countries last year raised slightly less than 10% of the first tranche of a Green Climate Fund, which is supposed to provide $100bn-a-year of climate aid to poorer countries by 2020.

The action plan does note the value of multilateral action but also says that ""particular focus should be put on mobilising the private sector as a major source of financing and of innovation to tackle climate change"". Many countries are wary of profit-taking by multinationals with limited interest in helping them adapt to extreme weather events."

West must pay up to secure deal at Paris climate change summit, warns Fabius
Rich countries must keep their financial promises to the poor on global warming, or key international climate change negotiations this year risk falling apart, the French foreign minister will warn his counterparts in other developed nations this weekend.

The G7 group of industrialised countries are meeting on Sunday and Monday in Germany, and a key subject of the discussions will be the forthcoming UN climate change negotiations, scheduled for a crunch conference in Paris this December, which will determine world governments’ response to the climate crisis for decades to come.

Poor countries want financial assistance from the rich nations – which have, historically, been the most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions – to help them reduce their carbon output, invest in clean technology and adapt to the effects of climate change.

At the last major climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009, the developing world was promised financial flows of at least $100bn (?65bn) a year by 2020, but in many cases the money has been slow in coming.

Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who will preside over the Paris talks, said this aid would be the key issue.

“The question of financing is, in fact, decisive for reaching an agreement in Paris,” he said.

“The promise of Copenhagen must be kept, absolutely – it is the basis of trust, and for many countries it is the condition of reaching agreement. Therefore, it is a priority as president [of the negotiations].”

He said that the G7 meeting would be vital in sending a strong signal to developing countries ahead of the Paris talks.

“What the richest countries of the G7 will say is very important in itself and is eagerly awaited by all who are in COP21[as the Paris climate conference is known].

“The G7 allows for real discussion. So we have to be pragmatic, but we also have to fix ambitious objectives.”

At the UN climate conference in Paris this December, world governments are expected to forge a new global deal on climate change, including commitments from both developed and developing countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to take effect from 2020 when current commitments run out.

But while countries are still committed to meeting the carbon targets that were set at Copenhagen in 2009, the status of pledges on financial contributions from rich to poor countries is less clear.

Rich nations promised at Copenhagen that, by 2020, investments of at least $100bn a year would be channelled to the developing world, to help cut emissions and adapt to climate change. So far only about half of that target has been met.

The issue is muddied by a difference in interpretation among countries over what should be counted as “climate finance” under the Copenhagen agreement.

Some developing countries want all of the $100bn a year to come from the public purse of developed nations. But rich governments are strongly resisting that, insisting instead that private sector finance should form the lion’s share of the total.

There was “frequently a lot of confusion on this subject”, said Fabius. “Some developing countries will present commitments [on curbing greenhouse gas emissions] that are partly conditional, ie depending on international financial support.”

He made it clear that he wants a deal on the two key areas of the talks – limits on emissions and financing for developing countries – well in advance of the formal start of the negotiations on the last day of November.

The Copenhagen conference descended, in its final hours, into scenes of chaos and vicious recriminations among countries, which overshadowed the advances made there in climate financing and emissions goals.

Fabius is anxious not to repeat that experience, preferring to have the main elements of an agreement set up beforehand.

“I don’t believe in the virtue of waiting until the final minute for announcements,” he said. “I believe it is necessary to build trust, to prepare things carefully. To have an agreement [in Paris] we need some sort of financial package.”

He added that more money must be directed to helping poor countries adapt to the effects of climate change – this had been, to date, the “poor relation” of climate finance, he said.

For this reason, he is proposing the development in poor countries of an early-warning system on potential weather-related disasters for developing countries, consisting of weather forecasting, priming the emergency services and providing back-up resources for them.

These can be implemented at times of crisis, which are likely to become more frequent as climate change takes hold.

Fabius also called for much more investment into the development of renewable energy in the developing world, and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. He said this could enable the continent to bypass the need for fossil fuels.

He said the talks in Paris would succeed if governments managed “a solidarity between the industrialised countries and the countries that will suffer the most from climate damage, and that also engage in the effort to limit their emissions”."

COP21 climate marches in Paris not authorised following attacks
Major marches which had been planned to coincide with the COP21 international climate talks in Paris will not be authorised for security reasons, the French government has said.

Environmental activists – who had expected attract hundreds of thousands people on 29 November and 12 December – said that they accepted Wednesday’s decision with regret, but were now considering “new and imaginative” ways of making their voices heard.

Following the recent terror attacks in Paris, French authorities said a statement that all demonstrations organised in closed spaces or in places where security can easily be ensured could go ahead.

“However, in order to avoid additional risks, the government has decided not to authorise climate marches planned in public places in Paris and other French cities,” it said.

Environmental activists had hoped the marches would attract large numbers to put pressure on governments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. A range of groups have been involved in planning actions during the summit and the position of every one of them was not immediately clear on Wednesday.

Some of those involved say though that more than 2,000 protests in around 150 countries during the talks have taken on a greater significance. They include the campaign group Avaaz, which released a promotional video for the marches it is involved in organising around the world.

Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz, said: “The police have just informed us that the tragic attacks in Paris have made the march there impossible.

“Now it’s even more important for people everywhere to march on the weekend of 29 November on behalf of those who can’t, and show that we are more determined than ever to meet the challenges facing humanity with hope, not fear.”

Jean-Francois Juilliard, Greenpeace France executive director, said that it was a source of huge regret that the French authorities said that they cannot guarantee safety the safety of marchers but the decision must be respected.

He added: “Huge numbers were expected in Paris, but those people will not be silenced. We will find new, imaginative ways to ensure our voices are heard in the UN conference centre and beyond.

“In hundreds of towns and cities across the world people will still march for the climate, for Paris and for our shared humanity. We stand for a vision of human cooperation that the murderers sought to extinguish. They will not succeed.”

Talks between the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, and campaigners over the fate of a huge march before the forthcoming Paris climate summit ended without agreement earlier this week.

Fabius expressed fears on Tuesday about the risk of another terror attack and of the sort of crowd panic seen in Paris’s Place de Republique on 15 November, when hundreds of people fled a solidarity vigil after firecrackers were let off.

As well as the marches, other protest actions which had been planned include a “people’s summit”, a “climate action zone” involving schools and community groups and a day of civil disobedience at the summit’s end.

Coalition Climat 21, an alliance of civil society groups that had been centrally involved in the Paris protests, had pledged earlier this week to try to continue with public demonstrations within the city in close consultation with the police.

It said in a statement on Wednesday that it would try to find an “alternative form of citizen mobilisation” to demonstrate that COP21 would not just be left to the negotiators.

The organisation said that the climate summit, which was due to be held on 5 and 6 December in the eastern suburb of Montreuil and another event from 7 to 11 December in the centre of Paris should be maintained."

Global creative community calls on world leaders to tackle climate change
We, the creative community as represented by the signatories below, ask all those responsible for negotiating the post-2020 climate change framework to agree an ambitious and inspiring international agreement.

The creative community – design, broadcasting, publishing, film, gaming, fashion, literature, music, the performing and visual arts, galleries and museums – can make a unique contribution to the global sustainability challenge. Collectively we shape not just our material world, but our conceptual world too, including the values that underpin our lives. The creative industries generate wealth and employment but we also innovate, we shape and express cultural values, influencing how people feel and the choices they make: as such we have huge potential to prompt, and reinforce, positive and sustainable change.

We are deeply concerned that our global economic and industrial systems are accelerating rates of extinction, desertification and soil depletion, degrading ecosystems, acidifying and littering our rivers and oceans, and resulting in a relentless rise in greenhouse gas emissions driving irreversible climate change. In short, we are overwhelming the planet’s life-support systems. The outcomes of the COP21 climate change conference and the political decisions taken over the next months will determine many of the long-term conditions that will affect us today and for many generations to come.

In combining our collective strengths, the creative community will amplify world leaders’ commitments to positive change and strengthen the implementation of good policy decisions those leaders make now. An international policy framework with a long-term and realistic goal of limiting greenhouse gas emissions below 2C of warming will give us the confidence to deploy our considerable energy towards a sustainable and equitable future. A healthy creative community relies on collaboration. Using this as a first principle for action we will:

• Take action ourselves to make our businesses and our industries more sustainable, actively managing our impacts.

• Speak out to our audiences and customers, using our creative voices to affect the public narrative and create social consensus for action on climate change and environmental degradation.

• Work together to influence and support policymakers who have the capacity to accelerate positive change, to make the right decisions.

• Take a leadership role with a cultural mandate for action, which exceeds the commitments of governments.

• Do what we do best and use our creativity and our collaborative culture to help find, and scale, solutions to global environmental challenges.

We ask Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change and Laurent Fabius, foreign minister of France and president of COP21, to agree to a comprehensive, binding international framework agreement on greenhouse gas emissions reductions, with mechanisms to assess, review and revise commitments over the long term. We ask for:

• An ambitious commitment to climate action, starting now, that will limit future global warming to below 2C relative to pre-industrial levels.

• A legally robust and accountable global climate governance framework and implementation strategy that we will be able to support.

• Realistic delivery timetables which account for the long term and which enable us to invest in future-focused and collaborative creative practice.

• Financial mechanisms to stimulate extensive infrastructure for poorer nations to support them in achieving their reduction commitments while permitting equitable development.

• Significant investment in low carbon infrastructures which we can champion and deploy.

• Alignment with the sustainable development goals.

We understand the gravity of climate change and the historic opportunity represented by COP21. We will come together and intensify our efforts, but we need you to give us confidence in a sustainable future, to share our ambition, and recognise our capacity to strengthen your leadership. We must, we can, and together we will act on climate change.

Paris climate talks won't beat dangerous global warming but they will try to build a vehicle that can
UN climate meetings are curious events where the future of the worlds climate and everything thats part of it can come down to the removal of square brackets on documents and the strike of a gavel.

About 40,000 delegates from more than 190 countries will be in Paris for the next major talks starting on Monday, including more than 130 heads of state and governments.

If previous talks are any indication, then by the end of the second week the venue corridors will resemble a scene from an airport where all flights have been cancelled; most people are not really sure whats going on, bodies are collapsed on the floor from sleep deprivation and every now and then an important person stands up in the middle to give an update.

At least in Paris, there should be no shortage of caffeine and sugary goodness to keep the world from falling into a crevasse of its own unexploited fossil fuel reserves.

Now 40,000 people sounds like a lot, right? And it is a lot.

But for context, consider that more than twice that many went to the oil and gas industry-focused Offshore Technology Conference in Texas this year. Numbers at OTC were down from a record 108,000 last year.

But back to Paris. Almost every major media website in the world has been producing its own version of the story that tells you everything you need to know about the Paris climate talks, the Guardian included.

Thats because what happens in Paris is challenging to interpret but also stunningly important for the future.

Make or break?

But is it the make or break, sink or swim, do or die, cool or fry event that some commentators and campaigners are making out?

Well yes. And no. But first, a few basics.

The UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) has more than 190 signatories, known as parties.

The conventions last major agreement, the Kyoto protocol, was put together in Japan in 1997 at the third Conference of the Parties (COP3). The Kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions only included rich developed countries.

The 2009 COP meeting in Copenhagen tried, but failed, to negotiate a new deal. At subsequent meetings, the commitments being made under Kyoto were extended until 2020.

Since Kyoto, the world has changed drastically.

As Australias lead UNFCCC negotiator Peter Woolcott pointed out last week, back in 1992 there were only three developing countries on the list of the worlds 12 biggest greenhouse gas emitters. Now there are seven.

China has replaced the US as the major global emitter and geopolitical power has shifted towards Asia.

So we need a new deal. COP21 in Paris is the culmination of years of work to get that deal done. This time, all countries are being asked to sign it and because the process works on a consensus approach, all parties need to agree or the deal dies.

The Climate Institutes Erwin Jackson, who routinely attends UNFCC meetings, offered me a neat summary of how much further advanced the process is heading into Paris than at previous meetings.

At Copenhagen we had a draft agreement that was 200 pages long. At Kyoto it was 80 pages. At Paris, its 50 pages.

But there has also been a fundamental change in how the UNFCCC is trying to canvas agreement.

At Kyoto and at Copenhagen the UNFCCC was trying to impose targets to cut emissions from on high. This time the target-setting has been done by the countries themselves  a bottom-up approach.

Warsaw pact

It turns out that the Warsaw COP meeting in 2013 was key.

There, a deal was agreed whereby all the parties would go back to their own countries and work on whats known as an intended nationally Determined contribution.

This set in train domestic conversations across the world about how, and by how much, each country should cut its greenhouse gas emissions.

So now, those countries are coming to Paris having already determined what they see as a fair effort to keep global warming below 2C (which all major UNFCCC parties have agree to). You can see all the INDCs here.

But heres where some misconceptions start. The Paris negotiations wont be about the targets.

The targets themselves wont even be in the main text of the agreement, which will come out of a process with a title that only the UN could love  the ad hoc working group on the Durban platform for enhanced action.

The Paris deal will instead likely make it binding for countries to have an INDC.

As things stand, no analysts are finding that the INDCs are enough to keep global warming below 2C. Instead, they set us on a pathway to global warming of about 2.7C or higher by the end of the century.

Now that sounds a lot like failure. But a key aspect of the Paris deal will look to enshrine regular reviews of INDCs that would also make sure future pledges are better than previous ones. Or in other words, no backsliding.

This calls for an analogy. If getting below 2C of global warming is the destination, then the Paris deal is trying to build a reliable car to get us there. The car will need to be recharged (because its electric) and will need a service or two, but the Paris deal aims to plan for these eventualities.

Key elements up for negotiation will be to agree the rules around transparency and fairness of those INDCs.

Jackson says that the prospects for a deal look better than they did heading into previous meetings.

But thats not to say things wont be difficult, but given that climate change has become a central issue for many countries and regions, its now in their national interest to get this deal done.

The core issue at the end of the day is whether countries are implementing domestically binding policies. The international process can facilitate that. When countries communicate their targets, countries are expected to show how they are a fair and ambitious way to keep global warming below 2C. If Paris is an effective stimulus for further action then it needs to be bankable, transparent and fair. Without all those, it will be difficult to get all countries on board.

A major sticking point will likely be the support, both financial and otherwise, offered to poorer countries from the developed world (developed on the back of massive fossil fuel use).

Under the UNFCCC there are negotiations around pledges to the Green Climate Fund to provide US$100 billion a year to poorer countries by 2020 to help them cut emissions and adapt to climate change.

If its possible (which it is), an even more complex and contentious issue under the UNFCCC is known as loss and damage. This is an attempt to help poorer countries to cope with climate impacts that they cannot adapt to.

Some richer countries, including the US, are sensitive to the idea that this will lead to a compensation fund that will identify liability. Compensation and liability are not the sort of words that countries like the US are likely to be happy with.

Denialists on tour

At the beginning of the second week of the talks, the usual group of climate science denialists from conservative and fossil-fuel funded thinktanks will attempt to grab some limelight.

They are even premiering a documentary called Climate Hustle that will regurgitate the same old denialist myths. Ive also written about the links between Climate Hustle and a religious group claiming that climate policies kill while promoting creationism.

Groups such as these may look like theyre on the fringes, until you remember that in the US, many ( but not all ) Republicans refuse to accept the evidence that human-caused climate change is real and needs urgent action.

The public in many developed countries, including Australia and the US, continues to be split on the causes of climate change, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence.

New research suggests that this confusion among the public is down to campaigns supported by fossil fuel interests, including ExxonMobil and foundations linked to the oil billionaire Koch brothers.

The talks in Paris will, fittingly (or should that be ironically, or predictably), be taking place at the end of what is almost certain to be declared the hottest year on record and the end of the hottest five-year period on record.

You tend to get records like that when you pump out the key greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to levels not seen in millions of years at a rate that is likely unprecedented in the geological record.

No amount of French fancies are going to entirely soften that blow."

Massive Attack founder premiers dark film on fossil fuel lobbying at Paris climate talks
A short film by a member of trip hop grounp Massive Attack about the influence of fossil fuel corporations on climate change negotiations will premiere on Friday in Paris where crucial UN talks are continuing.

The dark satire features an original score by 3D – also known as Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja – and Mercury prize winners Young Fathers. It stars Fiona O’Shaughnessy , the lead in TV thriller Utopia and Natasha O’Keeffe from the BBC’s Peaky Blinders and Sherlock as an executive from oil giant ExxonMobil.



The film, shot in black and white, features a woman at a drug-fuelled party overlooking the bright lights of the Eiffel tower, as she identifies oil executives, spin doctors and government advisers in dark corners using a facial recognition camera.

“La Fete est Finie (The Party is Over)” was devised to coincide with the COP21 conference in Paris, also known as the Conference of the Parties. It will be premiered at Le Trianon theatre in Paris ahead of performances by Thom Yorke, Patti Smith and Flea for the Pathway to Paris concert.

In a statement about the film, 3D and co-director Mark Donne said: “As with any party, the skill is in knowing when to leave. For decades fossil fuel extracting trans-nationals and western governments have continued to dance and partake long after the bright lights of climate science evidence were switched on and the deafening music of denial had its plug pulled.”

The film is rooted in Donne’s experiences working as a journalist and researcher in Westminster where he said he was in close contact with corporate lobbyists.

Donne, who directed and produced the film with Joe Morris, told the Guardian: “I was always struck by just how close those relationships are – how commonplace and everyday they are – and the sheer level of situational lobbying that goes on which often isn’t recorded in formal meetings with ministers and special advisers and the policy capture that’s able to be achieved via those gateways and those methods. Quite often these things are in spaces of hospitality, as with our film.”

The release of the film follows an unauthorised advertising campaign by activists on the opening weekend of the conference in which fake adverts satirising the corporate sponsors and politicians at COP21 appeared at bus stops across Paris. A recent survey of 10 COP21 sponsors revealed that most are failing to meet EU targets on emissions reductions and do not publish relevant data on their carbon footprint.

Recalling how former UK prime minister Tony Blair’s closest aide Angela Hunter left in 2001 to take a communications role at BP, he said: “There are endless examples of that and I don’t think the public understand the extent of it. We’re certainly not saying there shouldn’t be constructive engagement with these important transnationals – those conversations have to go on – but when we’re talking about the level of emergency that we’re in with climate change, we need to look at the level of influence these people have.”

The fossil fuel industry is condemning us to climate disaster
The warnings from our most respected scientists are loud and clear and their findings are irrefutable. Science demands that average global temperature rises must stay below 2C if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change.

The world cannot wait until 2050, 2040 or even 2030 to act. The World Bank’s sobering report, Turn Down the Heat, told us in 2013 that without serious policy changes the world will warm by an average of 4C by the end of the century. Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, Angela Merkel’s adviser, concludes, “the difference between [2C and 4C] is human civilisation”, and Professor James Hansen warns that even a 2C rise will cause “major dislocations for civilisation”.

Every year through subsides UK citizens give ?2.5bn in taxes to the oil, gas and coal industries

The fossil fuel industry is condemning us to climate disaster: increasing frequency of severe weather events, natural disasters and loss of land due to rising sea levels. “Business as usual” means a 4C warmer world according to the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers – and a 6C warmer world according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) if coal use continues on its current trajectory. We need to stop business as usual and keep fossil fuels in the ground.

To prevent climate disaster we must restructure the world’s energy usage. Fossil fuel extraction and use needs to cease, and we must end the estimated $550bn in annual subsidies and embark upon a renewable energy revolution now. Taxpayers around the world are indirectly paying corporations to destroy our planet.

Scientists at the Potsdam Institute conclude that if we are to stay below 2C of warming then only 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide can be emitted by 2050. Fossil fuel corporations have reserves that if burnt would result in 2,795 gigatons of carbon dioxide emissions. This is five times more than the safe amount.

We are all hoping that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference Of Parties in Paris (COP21) in December will deliver the globally binding agreement that is required but I am concerned that there is a serious disconnect between what governments have been negotiating since the COPs began and what the science requires to keep temperatures under a 2C rise.

We need a comprehensive, just and legally binding climate agreement, the transfer of technology to developing countries, adequate adaptation, mitigation and implementation mechanisms, and a forestry agreement with safeguards for communities and indigenous peoples’ rights.

According to the 2014 United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) Emissions Gap Report, even if the most ambitious current pledges from countries to cut emissions are honoured, we will still be emitting more than four times the yearly carbon budget for the atmosphere.

Many communities are already on the frontlines fighting a losing battle to protect nature, while politicians procrastinate and fail to bring adequate commitments and solutions to the table. In the UN climate negotiations, leaders of the developed world have been seeking to ensure the best “deal” for their narrow national interests, and collectively they have failed to deliver and have lost sight of the reason we so urgently need bold and concrete action.

While the world impatiently awaits COP21, our irrational model of development continues unabated. Oil exploration, mining, large-scale agriculture, megadams and logging are causing irreversible environmental destruction and are violating the fundamental rights of communities, indigenous people and individuals.

I have witnessed the environmental devastation that fossil fuel extraction causes. Between 1971 and 1992 in Ecuador, Texaco carved 350 oil wells and dumped approximately 16bn gallons of oil-contaminated water into unlined pits. I saw residents afflicted with leukaemia, women who had experienced spontaneous abortions, and children suffering from skin diseases as a consequence of direct exposure to these toxic waters.

What I have seen is just the tip of the iceberg. You may remember the 11m gallons of oil spilled in Alaska in 1989 from the supertanker Exxon-Valdez which devastated one of the most beautiful places in the world, BP’s Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico where 11 people were killed and 210m gallons were spilled , Shell’s decades of operations in Ogoniland, Nigeria that leak oil and pollute water sources with benzene, and the widespread environmental damage from the Tar Sands in Canada… I could go on and on.

We need to keep fossil fuels in the ground and embark upon radical reforms to our model of development, encompassing principles of justice, respect for human rights, good governance, accountability, and environmental protection. Climate change is the overriding moral imperative of our time. It is not just an environmental threat but also a critical human rights issue that impacts every aspect of our lives: peace, security, poverty, hunger, health, mass migration, and economics.

I support The Guardian’s campaign calling for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust to divest from fossil fuels because I believe it is critical that we Keep it in the Ground and instead invest in renewable energy. Bill and Melinda Gates and Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust have a responsibility to avoid catastrophic climate change. I urge them to divest from fossil fuels. Our fate, the fate of our children, grandchildren and future generations is in their hands.

I appeal not only to these two institutions but also to all influential people in charge of charities, universities, religious institutions, pension and financial institutions to divest. The moment has come for you to make a stand.

Safeguarding our sustainable future through the power of communications
GeSI, the Global e-Sustainability Initiative, has just published, what in my view, is a truly groundbreaking piece of work. The report, SMARTer 2030: ICT Solutions to 21 stCentury Challenges, features some staggering numbers.

Principally, that ICT could generate more than $6tn (?3.87tn) of additional revenue opportunity alongside $5tn (?3.23tn) in cost saving opportunities by 2030.

What’s more, it identifies the potential for a near 20% cut in CO2 emissions by 2030 - all made possible by the smarter use of digital technologies such as smartphones, networked sensors, mobile applications and smart grids.

Related: Focusing on purpose: new BT report sets out ambitious goals to 2020

But for me, there are two things that make this report so much more than just another “abatement statement”. One, it’s the first study of its kind to examine the impact ICT can have on society, as well as the economy and the environment. Two, is that it identifies three key stakeholder groups and recommends priority actions they could take to help safeguard a sustainable, profitable future:

Policymakers should set national CO 2targets, recognising the critical role of ICT, creating investment incentives to connect the unconnected. Businesses should recognise the growth and innovation opportunities made possible by ICT that make sustainable investments viable. Consumers should be encouraged to adopt technology solutions that promote resource efficiency.

Essentially, SMARTer2030 tells us that the power of communications can help everyone live a better life. And the report is jam-packed with findings that help illustrate this. For example, it calculates that the roll-out of ICT could save up to 25bn barrels of oil, 332tn litres of water and 91m tons of paper.

It also highlights a future in which 1.6 billion people have access to e-healthcare and half a billion will have access to e-learning solutions. And it says that the 2.5 billion people who do not have access to ICT-enabled services today could be connected by 2030.

At the heart of the report is an examination of how ICT solutions can help make decoupling economic growth and carbon emissions an achievable goal. Historically, the link between GDP expansion, CO2 emissions and resource use has been very strong. In fact, for every 1% increase in GDP, CO2 emissions have generally risen by around 0.5% and resource intensity has risen by 0.4%.

Related: 'The internet of things': what the man who coined the phrase has to say

The modelling used in the SMARTERer2030 report is unpreceded in its range and depth. It paints a clear picture of how ICT can reshape the way we live, as well as reducing the impact that continued economic growth has on our environment.

So, while ICT can be used to generate at least $6tn of additional economic opportunity by 2030, it can be done without adding to our resource or climate footprints, keeping CO2 emissions steady at today’s (2015) levels.

BT is a long-time supporter of GeSI and a sponsor of SMARTer2013. The bold, disruptive statements it makes are of special interest to us in BT. A big part of this is because at BT we know that ICT can give us a triple win – namely tremendous social, economic and environmental benefits.

We’ve also already proved how decoupling growth and emissions can support economic success. Our ambition is to help our customers cut their carbon emissions by at least three times our own carbon impact by 2020.

The good news is that we are well on the way to achieving our goal. In March 2015 we reached a reduction ratio of 1.5:1.

Last year, we saw our customers spend ?3.4bn on carbon abating BT products, services and solutions. These include cloud computing, which is a much more energy efficient way for businesses to manage their data needs. Meanwhile connectivity services like videoconferencing help minimise travel.

Related: Can big data improve the lives of people in the developing world?

Our products and services are also having a positive impact on society across the globe. A good example is BT’s Connecting Africa programme which has seen us connect 20 locations in nine African countries to the internet via satellite. We’ve also helped the charity SOS Children’s Villages to provide better education, healthcare and training to around 73,000 people.

And we extended our pilot to provide high-speed Wi-Fi to tenants living in a housing association in Glasgow at a subsidised price and developed a shared internet service. Wi-Fi and satellite communications are among the ICT solutions discussed in the SMARTer2030 report - a report that says communications technology can make a better world.

This is something that we at BT agree with wholeheartedly.

So I hope that message and the whole of the SMARTer2030 report is debated with enthusiasm and optimism at The United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris this December.

Certainly, ICT Solutions to 21 stCentury Challenges should be essential reading for all policymakers attending the event. And let’s hope it inspires them to reach the right agreements and secure a more prosperous world for all of us."

The day we stopped Europe’s biggest polluter in its tracks
This month, I broke the law. I wasn’t alone; I was with 1,500 others, many of whom had never broken any law for their beliefs before. Together we managed to shut down Europe’s biggest source of CO2 emissions : RWE’s lignite mines in the Rhineland in Germany.

In total, around 800 of us were arrested, and hundreds of us refused to cooperate with the authorities by withholding our names and IDs. This hampered the bureaucracy so badly that we were released without charge. It was the world’s largest act of disobedience against the mining of fossil fuels – and it might be the spark that ignites a rising, cross-border movement of disobedience for climate justice.

With a circumference of 20km and a depth of 400 metres, the open-cast mine is the biggest hole I have ever seen. It feels part-desert, part post-apocalyptic movie set, a place that belongs more on Mars than on Earth. It’s a hole that makes money for a few and imposes misery on most. It has eaten up so many homes and lives: since the second world war, lignite mines have displaced 35,000 people – and 7,000 more await a similar fate.

Abandoned villages sit on the mine’s edge, with empty streets, churches, schools and hospitals, and ivy growing through broken letter boxes. Even the bodies from the graveyards have had to be moved to safety. These ghost villages then wait to be engulfed by the ever-expanding hole. The mine and its accompanying power stations are surrounded by fields of industrial wind turbines, a greenwashed, “eco-friendly” back drop, to make us forget that the “great green” German state – which is phasing out nuclear power, and is renowned for its “renewable energy transition” – still produces 45% of its electricity with coal.

I saw truncheons flailing: one hit me, but the adrenaline cut out the pain. Pepper spray was aimed at our eyes

Thousands had been preparing for this moment of disobedience for a week at the Climate Camp, a temporary model of an alternative society set up near the mine. At dawn on Saturday 15 August, we left the camp, with its self-managed workshops, trainings, film shows and lectures, approaching the mine from four different directions in “fingers” – long columns of about 250 people all dressed in white paper boiler suits. Our only protection against police truncheons and pepper spray was bags filled with soft straw to take the blows. Everyone on the action had agreed to remain calm and were determined not to escalate any police violence or sabotage the mine’s machinery.

To get to the mine we had to go through a narrow tunnel. But it was blocked by vans and three rows of riot police. It was terrifying, yet we knew what to do. We took a deep collective breath and our finger flowed like a river into the obstruction, body against body, the whole column pushing from behind. In the crush I saw truncheons flailing, one hit me but the adrenaline cut out the pain. Pepper spray was aimed directly at our eyes. Time stood still and then … we were through.

Despite 1,500 police officers and 800 RWE employees protecting the site, nothing could stop such collective courage. Eight hundred of us got into the mine, and some as far as the monstrous excavators. These are 222 metres long, and taller than the Statue of Liberty. Half a dozen of them continuously gnaw at the canyon sides of the mine, each one able to dig out 2,400 train carriages of coal a day. These are machines engineered to cut through mountains.

Down in the depths of the mine, we were again chased by police, this time riding on RWE-owned 4x4s. But we just kept running towards the machines. Group after group was eventually arrested and handcuffed and held for nine hours in the deep sand of the mine, but we nourished ourselves with acts of tender solidarity. Unable to feed ourselves, people passed food from mouth to mouth, kissing relative strangers in the process. And around us everything was blocked, the machines were silent; we had forced the mine to stop for an entire day.

Related: Activists target Europe’s biggest source of carbon emissions, in Germany – big picture

The protest was called Ende Gelande (Here and no further) – and it was direct action at its best. Not a symbolic gesture that just tells a story and makes an injustice visible, but an action that targeted the very source of the problem and stopped it in its tracks. Of course, the stories from the day are important, and will help build confidence within the movement. But the actual stopping of CO2 emissions themselves, the fact that the lignite coal – the dirtiest type of coal in the world – was not dug out and burned that day, is what counts. Ende Gelande was a collective act of resistance that for once felt proportionate to the scale of the emergency: catastrophic climate change.

The fact that 80% of the world’s fossil fuel reserves need to remain unburned if we are to avoid the catastrophe of runaway climate change means that we will have to fight with every tactic we think is just, strategic and, most importantly, effective. Historically, when movements win it is because they fought harder than they thought was possible and used a whole range of means. It is time to move away from purely symbolic and ritualised displays of dissent and use tactics that are proportionate to the problems. This is what our children will judge us on. They won’t ask: “Did you march in the streets or sabotage the machines at night?” They will ask: “Did you manage to stop them destroying our planet?”

At Ende Gelande, thousands experienced a collective power. I have never seen so many people jump so far out of their comfort zones, by taking direct action for the first time. Never have I been part of such disciplined, determined disobedience. A line has been drawn in the sand. When the COP21 UN climate summit takes place in Paris, and thousands take part in a day of disobedience on 12 December, the shout from the streets may well, once again, be: Ende Gelande. The corporations and governments have failed us. It’s time for direct action."

A new report suggests consumption of coal for power is likely to have peaked in 2013 and is set to decline by between 2% and 4% in 2015.
Monday 16 November 2015 12.17 GMT Last modified on Friday 28 April 2017 14.09 BST
Coal power plants are not the solution to help billions of people without electricity or clean cooking facilities, aid agencies have warned.

Analysis by Cafod, Christian Aid and thinktank the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) suggests that continuing with current energy policies that focus heavily on coal, risks leaving a billion people without access to electricity and three billion without access to clean cooking facilities by 2030.

The analysis comes as a new report suggests consumption of coal for power is likely to have peaked in 2013 and is set to decline by between 2% and 4% in 2015.

The report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said “peak global coal” had occurred as a result of declining consumption by big coal-using countries, particularly China.



China had seen coal consumption decline 5.7% in 2015 while US use fell 11%, Germany 3% and the UK 16%.

Of the major coal users, only India, as it pursues rapid economic growth and increased electricity access for its population, has seen consumption increase significantly, up 3% to 6% year on year.

The coal industry is under sustained attack, with scientists warning more than 80% of known reserves must stay underground to help tackle climate change, investors pulling out of the polluting fossil fuel and prices depressed.

Now, the industry’s claims that the use of coal can tackle energy poverty are being challenged, with campaigners saying the easiest and most affordable way to get power to people who do not have access to it is often off-grid systems powered by solar or wind.

Most new coal developments in these countries power industry and the homes of wealthier consumers who are already connected to the grid - which the ODI’s Ilmi Granoff said are important sectors to serve, but means coal is not helping the energy poor.

Alison Doig, senior adviser on climate change at Christian Aid, said: “There’s very little evidence to suggest that coal has a role to play in poverty alleviation.

“Even where substantial coal development takes place large populations are often left without access to electricity.

“From Bangladesh to Indonesia and South Africa, there are clear opportunities to deploy clean energy systems and to leapfrog dirty coal development.”

They also warned that climate change, caused by the polluting emissions of fossil fuels such as coal, is hitting the poor hardest."

Tea farmers in Kenya bear the brunt of climate change
When Britons put a cup of freshly brewed tea to their lips, climate change is probably the furthest thing from their minds. To us as Kenyan farmers who grow the precious tea leaf, however, climate change poses a daily threat. Not just to our crops, but also to our livelihoods. This impact has been particularly poignant over the last few years.

We can’t afford to sit around and wait for global leaders to take action

Where climate change is most obvious, and extremely concerning for farmers, is the rain cycles which have become so erratic that they don’t know when to plant anymore. This year, we had no rain for four whole months from January to April. This is highly unusual, as this used to be known as the rainy season in Kenya. On the other extreme end, we’ve also been experiencing highly unusual periods of frost and heavy hail.

Any farmer will tell you that planting during a dry spell is foolish. And, when you do risk it, being hit by hail or frost will irrevocably damage your tea shoots. In either scenario you lose your cash crop, and it can take months if not years to recover from such a setback. Based on this year’s climate, we’ve known for some time already that 2015 is going to be a disastrous year for yields.

Kenya is listed among the top 20 countries most affected by climate change and studies show that tea growing areas in Kenya are set to lose around 40% of the land suitable for tea planting due to climate change.

Related: Cottoning on to the true cost of high street fashion

We can’t afford to sit around and wait for global leaders to take action. Our cooperative represents over 6,000 small-scale farmers already feeling the impact of climate change – we have no other option but to find a solution to climate change challenges.

With the support of partners like Fairtrade International and buyers like CafeDirect, we have been working to adapt. Last year, through the AdapTea project we received training from Vi Agroforestry on climate change risks and ways to adapt. The experience showed that knowledge is power indeed, especially for the farmers who now feel they can take action and also pass their knowledge onto others.

Following that training, we have started re-forestation projects to try to combat the effects of climate change. We are growing trees in our nurseries for farmers to inter-plant with their tea crops, planting more than 150,000 so far. The trees provide shade to the tea, and protect it from hail and frost. We are also introducing energy efficient cooking stoves to reduce deforestation.

As small farmers, our means are limited: we’re willing and eager to adapt, but we can’t do it alone

We are encouraging farmers to try to grow other crops which are less affected by drought – crops like cassava which they can harvest and use as food or even sell during the dry spell. Farmers have also started beekeeping so they can produce and sell honey, and growing bananas for food as well as an additional source of income.

We are making all the efforts we can to adapt but we definitely need more support. There are more than half a million smallholder tea famers in Kenya, all of whom depend on tea as their main source of income to feed their families. What’s more we need to ensure that the promised funds for developing countries are delivered, and that money gets passed down to smallholder farmers like us, at the forefront of climate change.

As small farmers, our means are limited: we’re willing and eager to adapt, but we can’t do it alone. That’s why I am attending the COP21 conference in Paris. We need to make sure that a binding climate deal is made so we can keep the global warming under two degrees – otherwise there is no chance that farmers like myself can continue producing that cup of tea I know both British and Kenyans enjoy so much."

Don't let Paris attacks stop COP21 climate change deal, Obama urges
Barack Obama has moved to ensure that the Paris attacks do not sabotage a crucial climate change summit in the city next week, urging his fellow leaders to attend and strike a new deal on global warming.

The US president spoke out amid concerns that security fears in Paris coupled with an understandable deflection of French attention away from the imminent two-week summit might undermine chances for a historic agreement to rein in greenhouse gas emissions.

“I think it’s absolutely vital for every country, every leader, to send a signal that the viciousness of a handful of killers does not stop the world from doing vital business,” Obama said.

He added that world leaders had to show the murderous adversaries who killed at least 130 people “that we’re not afraid”. And the first chance to do that is next Monday, when the Paris climate change talks, known as COP21, start.

The Paris attacks have cast a deep shadow over COP21 – demonstrations have been banned and security has been stepped up – though none of the 130-plus heads of state and government due to attend has yet pulled out.

France has made a huge play of preparing for the summit, which is supposed to achieve a new global deal to curb emissions from 2020 and prevent the planet from catastrophic overheating. But in the wake of the 13 November attacks, there have been concerns that the French political leadership, and president Francois Hollande in particular, might have other things on their mind.

Privately, French officials insist they are determined not to let their agenda be set by terrorists. And some observers are hoping that the threat might galvanisethe talks to greater solidarity and urgency.

Lord Stern, author of the landmark 2006 study finding that climate change could be dealt with more cheaply if action is taken swiftly, said: “World leaders are more likely to come, and I don’t think there will be any grandstanding [as seen at previous meetings]. It should be much more collaborative.”

Leaders will only be present for the start of the talks, not for the hard negotiations. But they will set the tone, and have the power to instruct their ministers and officials to come to an agreement, which has proved elusive in the past. “Negotiators will feel that they have to get it done,” said Stern. “It’s remarkable how people have been coming together, sharing a recognition of this problem. Paris could be a turning point [in negotiations over global warming]. This is about our common humanity.”

Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute thinktank in the US, said: “We’re struck by the resolve [to get a deal]. And one can intuitively see why. There is a degree of solidarity internationally over this issue, that is not exactly unprecedented, but since 9/11, we probably haven’t seen anything quite like that. If anything, it stiffens the spine in terms of determination to really solve what is the greatest collective action problem in history.”

Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth in the UK, hoped that countries would be more willing to come to a deal, but that he feared this pressure might lead to a weaker accord.

“They will want to give Hollande a deal at the end of the day. But the deal may not be as good as it might have been. Countries turning up in Paris will be reluctant for Paris to be seen as a failure, but we have a deal on the table that is not enough – we would have liked to see a stronger deal, and maybe we are less likely to get that now.”

Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G, said the terrorist attacks would “not have a huge impact on the outcome, but they will have a huge impact on the tone”.

Previous rounds of negotiations from the Copenhagen conference in 2009 – when the talks dissolved into chaos and public recrimination – have been marked by emotional outpourings, threats and public displays unusual in other forms of diplomacy. This year, such shows would be less welcome, said Nick Mabey, chief executive at the environmental lobby group E3G. “The tone will be more serious, and less festive. Activists will have to find more creative ways to show the world the impact of climate change. There will be less grandstanding, and more focus.”

He said the attacks on France would give Hollande more “moral authority”, and that delegates would feel a greater duty to show “the ability of people to cooperate and bring peace and work together. That is the core message, and it’s really important that this message gets through.”

The Paris meeting is the result of five years of hard negotiations, aimed at healing the profound differences between developed and developing countries in addressing the threat of global warming. Without a Paris agreement, global warming is set to reach as much as 5C (41F) above pre-industrial levels. Scientists estimate that warming above 2C (35.6F) will result in catastrophic and irreversible changes to the weather, including droughts, floods, heatwaves, fiercer storms and sea level rises.

The difference between today’s average global temperature and the last ice age is about 5C, showing what a great effect such a temperature rise could have.

If pledges currently on the table for a potential Paris agreement are followed, then warming is likely to be limited to 2.7C or 3C by the end of this century - still not enough to meet scientific advice, but with mechanisms such as a five-yearly review, advocated as part of a Paris pact, the difference could be made up."

France launches global drive for climate deal
France has launched an unprecedented diplomatic drive to shepherd nations big and small towards a major climate change deal, ahead of a Paris summit next month that is the next major make-or-break moment for the movement against global warming.

Every one of France’s ambassadors, in embassies and consulates around the globe, has been educated on the demands of climate change, and instructed in how to communicate the messages to the governments they deal with, ahead of the summit, which starts on 30 November.

Ambassadors have been holding public events, private meetings, talks with their diplomatic counterparts, businesses, NGOs and even schoolchildren.

At home, the outer walls of the foreign ministry, a stately 19th-century edifice on the banks of the Seine, are covered in a series of banners declaring, in several languages, the messages of Paris Climat 2015. Even the Eiffel Tower, further down the riverbank, has been pressed into service, lit up at night with climate slogans.

Francois Hollande, the president of France, has been visiting world leaders for the past year, urging them to come to Paris. Laurent Fabius, foreign minister, who will be in charge of the talks, has made it his mission, with a punishing schedule of events and public speaking. Segolene Royal, environment minister and co-host, has also been touring capitals and conferences.

Climate diplomacy has never seen such a concerted push.

“It’s a top priority for our diplomacy. All our ambassadors are fully mobilised, all around the world,” Sylvie Bermann, the French ambassador to the UK, told the Guardian.

She has hosted a series of public seminars and events in the UK, with one forthcoming on climate change and refugees. The embassy itself has also taken on the green message, with her new official car a hybrid Peugeot 508 – a French manufacturer, of course.

Even in countries such as India and Poland where, Bermann said “there might be more fisticuffs” over climate change, the embassies have been engaging governments, and in China, where she was posted before coming to London – she is a fluent Chinese speaker – she notes a major push involving government and NGOs.

Care has been taken to involve public opinion, too: there has even been a boat, the research vessel Tara, sponsored by the French fashion brand Agnes B, that has toured the US, London, Scandinavia and other regions before coming home to France.

A special ambassador has been appointed, Laurence Tubiana, who has also embarked on a whirlwind tour of capitals and dignitaries.

With three months to go before the conference, France’s ambassadors were lectured by Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, who also has a big stake in the success of Paris, having presided over the previous conference in Copenhagen in 2009 that was widely derided as a failure, as it collapsed into scenes of chaos in the final hours.

“For Hollande’s administration, this is not just about the climate: it is about the government’s political survival,” one prominent global official told the Guardian. “They need this to be a success, to have something to celebrate, as they’re in trouble in so many other areas of politics.”

At the two-week summit, governments will meet under the auspices of the United Nations in the first attempt for six years to forge a new global agreement on climate change.

COP21, as it is known in the jargon, is seen as a make-or-break conference, the last chance for the two-decades-old UN process to bring nations together to tackle what many scientists regard as the biggest single threat to humanity.

This week, governments will gather in Bonn for the last chance before the Paris conference to amend the text of the potential agreement. Previous such meetings have produced little progress, however.

For Hollande, whose low poll ratings have seen him become the most unpopular French president on record, securing a climate change deal is crucial for his reputation at home.

France, marked by high unemployment and economic sluggishness, will go to the polls in regional elections while the climate talks are wrapping up in December, in two rounds on 6 and 13 December. Hollande, who still hopes to run for the presidency in 2017, will seek to use any successful deal to boost his standing.

Will the climate diplomacy succeed? Elements of an agreement are slowly falling into place. Most countries, including all the biggest economies, have now submitted plans on their emissions to come into force after 2020, when current commitments expire. The US and China, the two biggest emitters, made a joint announcement on their emissions, for the first time, in a marked show of unity.

But there is still no guarantee of success, and France has tried hard to learn the lessons of Copenhagen.

Although a “political declaration” was signed at that summit in 2009, with major developed and developing countries jointly agreeing emissions targets for the first time, it did not amount to the formal treaty that many had hoped for.

That omission, and scenes in which delegates burst into tears, appeared to show world leaders did not know what was going on, and bitter public recriminations showed off all the fault lines among nations, allowed detractors to claim it as a resounding failure.

Many things will be different this time, Tubiana has promised. For instance, at Copenhagen the text of a potential deal was in tatters, too unwieldy to produce a formal treaty.

The text for Paris has been slimmed down to just over 20 pages, in a move the hosts hope will make it possible to sign it off in the two weeks of talks. World leaders, who arrived only at the end of Copenhagen, will land in Paris for the first day of talks, then hand over to their ministers and negotiators.

Another key question is over financial assistance from richer to poorer countries. At Copenhagen, the developing world was promised $100bn (?65bn) a year would flow to them by 2020. Significant progress has been made on this, not least at the World Bank meeting last week, where its president announced a $29bn increase in climate finance.

French diplomats have also been at pains to include civil society groups and businesses at a high level. Civil society groups were excluded from the final fraught day at Copenhagen, to their manifest disgust, which did not help how that conference was portrayed afterwards.

“The French have done an excellent job,” says Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief, who has also been persuading world leaders to participate. “They have made a great effort.”

Most of the world’s biggest economies have now publicly declared they want a deal. However, at the UN talks, small and desperately poor countries have just as much say as the richest. They may not be so happy to oblige.

“The biggest problem with Paris is that it is in Paris,” one prominent participant told the Guardian privately, meaning that holding such a major meeting in a G7 country risks alienating poor nations, who often feel that their interests are overlooked in the race to get big economies to commit.

The French can hardly help the location, and appear conscious of the need to draw in a broader coalition, sometimes using their historic ties to the French-speaking and French-influenced countries of Africa and Asia – a strategy that could backfire, given the colonial overtones.

But the charm offensive continued with President Hollande visiting Morocco recently. “We have a close cooperation with the Moroccans,” says Bermann. “I know there have been some problems but now cooperation is excellent so we’re keen to work with them.”

If Paris succeeds, it will not be down only to the French government and its troupes of ministers, civil servants, ambassadors and negotiators. But if it fails, the French and the UN know they will cop the blame."

How to fix climate change: put cities, not countries, in charge
Benjamin Barber
Climate change is the most urgent challenge facing humankind. Other issues make headlines: terrorism kills; inequality affects everyday life for billions around the globe. But climate is paramount, because in sustainability human survival itself is at stake. Why then have the nations governing the planet been so hopelessly ineffective in addressing the grave environmental crisis?

Is it because the consequences of carbon emissions seem hypothetical, or too far off? Politicians pay few costs for doing nothing, and receive little credit for acting aggressively. In the US, a nation that contributes one-fifth of all global greenhouse emissions (China is responsible for another fifth), Donald Trump has promised to reopen coal mines and free up oil drilling.

The problem isn’t the science. The merchants of doubt who claim there is a climate science that is open to scientific debate are not scientific adversaries at all. They are political adversaries, mostly bought and paid for. It is in the realm of politics that the struggle for sustainability must be fought and won.

Politics is hardly at its best right now, and that is perhaps the greatest challenge facing us. The weakness of politics undermines democracy – the faith behind politics. But democracy is crucial because climate change is also about justice: how to distribute the costs of decarbonisation and the transition to renewable energy fairly among rich and poor, developed and developing, large and small, north and south.

This politics can’t be found in increasingly dysfunctional nation states. The good news about the attempt to address climate change through government action is that it’s happening. The bad news is that it’s happening far too slowly. For every new hydroelectric plant built in the global north, some enormous lake dries up in the global south – Poopo, Bolivia’s second largest, has literally vanished over the last few years.

The US state of California is a leader in green public policies, but farmers there also grow pecans in semi-desert conditions where each nut harvested uses up to 300 gallons of water. For every urban fracking ban enacted, there is a move to block it in the courts. Coal is shut down, but fracked natural gas is accepted as a “transition” fuel – however pernicious its effect on decarbonisation.

The best-case scenario for what is likely to be done through nation-based environmental programmes hardly dents the worst-case scenario for the catastrophic consequences of all that is not being done.

However, there is an ample menu of sustainable options available to cities wishing to address climate change aggressively – and they can amplify their impact by coordinating their policies. The list includes divestment of public funds from carbon energy companies; investment to encourage renewable energy and green infrastructure; municipal carbon taxes; fracking and drilling bans; new waste incineration technologies; regulation of the use of plastic bottles and bags; policies to improve public transport and reduce car use; and recycling.

Oslo has been in the forefront of sustainable urban development. With Norway’s energy needs almost completely met by hydroelectric power, and its lion’s share of North Sea oil and gas going almost entirely to exports, almost all of the income goes to Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund. Oslo has thus had the luxury of pursuing a zero-emission campaign, and appears likely to achieve that goal by 2025.

The city is applying the goal with particular efficiency to transportation, and electric vehicle charging stations are plentiful. The plan is to make Oslo the most electric vehicle-friendly city in the world – one in four new cars sold in Norway are electric – and a champion of green housing and architecture: its new opera house is set in a neighbourhood that gleams with green infrastructure.

Asia also has exemplary green-leaning cities, including Hong Kong and Seoul. The greater Seoul region has a population of almost 25 million, and in 2015 it was ranked the continent’s most sustainable city. Seoul has made a massive investment in electric-powered buses. It already has the world’s third largest subway system, but its carbon fuel bus fleet of 120,000 vehicles has been a massive source of pollution. Current plans are to convert half this fleet to electric by 2020, which would be the world’s most ambitious achievement of this kind.

Such approaches can be undertaken to great effect one city at a time, but they are also mutually reinforcing: networks of collaborating cities can amplify their global impact. They can also make it more difficult for courts or governments to oppose environmental initiatives, standing firm on common approaches to sustainability and decarbonisation.

The challenge facing cities and citizens is to summon the necessary political will to do the things we know how to do – but have not done – and then to do them democratically. That will not be easy because democracy is in trouble, because moneyed interests and global oligarchies are corrupting government. But the fate of the campaign against climate change and other existential threats depends on democratic politics within and among cities.

Cities are the coolest political institutions on Earth. The odds are two to one or better that you live in a town or city, and not just for economic reasons. Spend a few days in Singapore or Cape Town or Nashville. Witness Oslo’s Tesla taxicabs, or Seoul’s rehabilitated centre-city river or Medellin’s public cable-car system. Keen to confront global warming, but not yet fully empowered to do so, cities must not only accept their responsibility for assuring a sustainable world but assert their right to do so.

There are two formidable obstacles blocking a larger role for cities: a paucity of resources and the absence of autonomy and jurisdiction. The European Union favours regions over cities, and works more on agricultural subsidies than affordable urban housing. In the United States, the structure of congressional representation means a suburban and rural minority rules over the urban majority.

If cities are to get the power they need, they will have to demand the right of self-governance – as I argued in my book If Mayors Ruled the World. The Global Parliament of Mayors, an international grouping of city mayors and the “global city rights movement”, held its inaugural session in The Hague last year.

Because urban citizens are the planet’s majority, their natural rights are endowed with democratic urgency. They carry the noble name of “citizen”, associated with the word “city”. But the aim is not to set urban against rural: it is to restore a more judicious balance between them. Today it is cities that look forward, speaking to global common goods, while fearful nations look back.

The world is getting too hot. Science makes it clear that sustainability is both necessary and possible. Politics shows it is achievable. Cities are poised to make it happen."

‘Shell knew’: oil giant's 1991 film warned of climate change danger
Damian Carrington and Jelmer Mommers
The oil giant Shell issued a stark warning of the catastrophic risks of climate change more than a quarter of century ago in a prescient 1991 film that has been rediscovered.

However, since then the company has invested heavily in highly polluting oil reserves and helped lobby against climate action, leading to accusations that Shell knew the grave risks of global warming but did not act accordingly.

Shell’s 28-minute film, called Climate of Concern, was made for public viewing, particularly in schools and universities. It warned of extreme weather, floods, famines and climate refugees as fossil fuel burning warmed the world. The serious warning was “endorsed by a uniquely broad consensus of scientists in their report to the United Nations at the end of 1990”, the film noted.

“If the weather machine were to be wound up to such new levels of energy, no country would remain unaffected,” it says. “Global warming is not yet certain, but many think that to wait for final proof would be irresponsible. Action now is seen as the only safe insurance.”

Related: Shell's 1991 warning: climate changing ‘at faster rate than at any time since end of ice age’

A separate 1986 report, marked “confidential” and also seen by the Guardian, notes the large uncertainties in climate science at the time but nonetheless states: “The changes may be the greatest in recorded history.”

The predictions in the 1991 film for temperature and sea level rises and their impacts were remarkably accurate, according to scientists, and Shell was one of the first major oil companies to accept the reality and dangers of climate change.

But, despite this early and clear-eyed view of the risks of global warming, Shell invested many billions of dollars in highly polluting tar sand operations and on exploration in the Arctic. It also cited fracking as a “future opportunity” in 2016, despite its own 1998 data showing exploitation of unconventional oil and gas was incompatible with climate goals.

The film was obtained by the Correspondent, a Dutch online journalism platform, and shared with the Guardian, and lauds commercial-scale solar and wind power that already existed in 1991. Shell has recently lobbied successfully to undermine European renewable energy targets and is estimated to have spent $22m in 2015 lobbying against climate policies. The company’s investments in low-carbon energy have been minimal compared to its fossil fuel investments.

Shell has also been a member of industry lobby groups that have fought climate action, including the so-called Global Climate Coalition until 1998; the far-right American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) until 2015; and remains a member of the Business Roundtable and the American Petroleum Institute today.

Another oil giant, Exxon Mobil, is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission and state attorney generals for allegedly misleading investors about the risks climate change posed to its business. The company said they are confident they are compliant. In early 2016, a group of congressmen asked the Department of Justice to also “investigate whether Shell’s actions around climate change violated federal law”.

“They knew. Shell told the public the truth about climate change in 1991 and they clearly never got round to telling their own board of directors,” said Tom Burke at the green thinktank E3G, who was a member of Shell’s external review committee from 2012-14 and has also advised BP and the mining giant Rio Tinto. “Shell’s behaviour now is risky for the climate but it is also risky for their shareholders. It is very difficult to explain why they are continuing to explore and develop high-cost reserves.”

Bill McKibben, a leading US environmentalist, said: “The fact that Shell understood all this in 1991, and that a quarter-century later it was trying to open up the Arctic to oil-drilling, tells you all you’ll ever need to know about the corporate ethic of the fossil fuel industry. Shell made a big difference in the world – a difference for the worse.”

Prof Tom Wigley, the climate scientist who was head of the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia when it helped Shell with the 1991 film, said: “It’s one of the best little films that I have seen on climate change ever. One could show this today and almost all would still be relevant.” He said Shell’s actions since 1991 had “absolutely not” been consistent with the film’s warning.

A Shell spokeswoman said: “Our position on climate change is well known; recognising the climate challenge and the role energy has in enabling a decent quality of life. Shell continues to call for effective policy to support lower carbon business and consumer choices and opportunities such as government lead carbon pricing/trading schemes.

“Today, Shell applies a $40 per tonne of CO2 internal project screening value to project decision-making and has developed leadership positions in natural gas and sugarcane ethanol; the lowest carbon hydrocarbon and biofuel respectively,” she said.

Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate change chief, said change by the big oil companies was vital to tackling global warming. “They are a big part of the global economy, so if we do not get them on board, we will not be able to achieve this transformation of the economy we need,” she said.

The investments the oil majors are making in clean energy are, Espinosa said, “very small, the activities in which they are engaging are still small and do not have the impact that we really need.”

Espinosa, who visited Shell’s headquarters in the Hague in December, said: “They are clear that this [climate change] agenda has to do with the future of their company and that business as usual, not doing anything, will lead to crisis and losses in their business.”"

Global trade deal threatens Paris climate goals, leaked documents show
Arthur Neslen
A far-reaching global trade deal being negotiated in secret could threaten the goals of the Paris climate deal by making it harder for governments to favour clean energy over fossil fuels, a leak of the latest negotiating text shows.

The controversial Trade in Services Agreement (Tisa) aims to liberalise trade between the EU and 22 countries across the global services sector, which employs tens of millions in Europe alone.

But a new EU text seen by the Guardian would oblige signatories to work towards “energy neutrality” between renewable energy and fossil fuel power, although amendments proposed by the EU would exempt nuclear power from this rule.

The document, marked “limited distribution – for Tisa participants only”, would also force member states to legislate against “anti-competitive conduct” and “market distortions” in energy-related services. This is viewed by campaigners as code for state support for clean power sectors, such as wind and solar.

A right to regulate is explicitly mentioned in the paper, but governments would first have to prove the necessity for regulations that legally constrain multinationals.

The same clause was used in the World Trade Organisation’s Gatt and Gats treaties which entered into force in 1995, and led to 44 complaints by multinationals via their governments. Of these, 43 were upheld.

Susan Cohen Jehoram, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, told the Guardian: “We fear the same thing will happen with Tisa but on a much larger scale, when legislation is proposed to keep temperature rises to 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels, as agreed at the Paris climate summit ].

“If we want to reach that target, governments will need a toolbox of measures that can give incentives to cleaner energy. Tisa, like the proposed TTIP and Ceta trade agreements, would increase the power of multinationals to prevent governments taking desperately needed measures to decrease CO2 levels.”

The Paris climate agreement called for “making finance flows consistent with a pathway to low greenhouse gas emissions” but the deregulatory thrust of the negotiating text, which was obtained by Greenpeace Netherlands, seems to run counter to this.

Related: UN criticises UK and Germany for betraying Paris climate deal

Its energy annex says that the trade rules will apply to all legislative measures covering power generation services, “whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable”.

It also contains a “standstill” clause freezing in perpetuity the high watermark of liberalisation in certain sectors, and a “ratchet” clause to stop countries reintroducing trade barriers that had been previously removed. Both mechanisms have been proposed by Australia.

Under their tenets, any government elected on a ticket of reversing the liberalisation of services contained in the treaty would thus be unable to do so, campaigners claim.

The UK’s shadow international trade and energy spokesman, Barry Gardiner, Labour MP, told the Guardian: “Whilst every effort should be made to promote business and trade, this must not be at the expense of the protection and enhancement of workers’ rights, environmental safeguards and the wider interests of the British people.”

While Brexit could prevent the UK from being bound by the planned trade treaty, any agreement allowing access to the EU’s single market would probably oblige it to follow the new rules.

Opposition to the proposed text from Theresa May’s government is thought unlikely. David Davis, the minister for Brexit, recently described the similar Ceta trade agreement with Canada as his preferred model for a trade arrangement with the EU.

Gardiner said: “The British people have voted to come out of the European Union to preserve the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, it cannot be right then that secret trade deals are currently being conducted entirely outside the scrutiny of national parliaments and law-makers.”

“The structure of such deals are like a lobster pot – once you have gone through and given power to the commercial interest it is no longer possible to recapture democratic control. What we do hear, through leaks and rumours, are terms which clearly prevent the ongoing capacity of governments to govern in the public interest.”

Before coming into effect though, any finalised Tisa text will most likely need to be approved by all EU member states – which currently includes the UK – and will also require approval from the European parliament.

Earlier this year, MEPs voted to back the deal, on the proviso that public services were excluded and that the deal legally secured the right to regulate at European, national and local authority level.

Parliament’s rapporteur, the former EU justice commisioner, Viviane Reding, has previously said that the assembly will “never consent” to any trade pact that diminished the EU’s right to regulate on climate, health and social laws.

Reding refused to comment on the leak but informed sources said that neither she nor the European parliament would consent to provisions which prevented public authorities from supporting renewables.

Reding, a conservative politician from Luxembourg, has also called on the Luxembourg government to demand an end to negotiations on the EU-US free trade deal known as TTIP, over the use of controversial secret investor courts, and threats to the environment and food safety.

Unlike TTIP, Tisa deals with the less tangible trade services sector that nonetheless constitutes more than half of the global economy, and could impact on an estimated 1.8 billion people.

As well as energy, any Tisa deal will apply to financial services, e-commerce, information and communications technology services, international maritime transport services, computer related services, postal and courier services, and government procurement of services.

A report by the UN conference on trade and development later this week is expected to say that mega-trade deals such as TTIP and Tisa are becoming increasingly politicised, and failing to provide a solution to the slowdown in global growth."

Anger over threat of VAT hike on renewable energy
The government has shocked the renewable energy industry by proposing a massive hike in VAT on solar panels and wind turbines from next summer.

The moves, announced by the revenue and customs authority, HMRC, made “a mockery of (David) Cameron’s claims to climate leadership” say critics and come amid proposed cuts of almost 90% in some solar subsidies.

HMRC blamed the planned increase in VAT from 5-20% on a European commission ruling covering energy saving materials used in the construction trade and said the EC decision had been upheld by the court of justice of the EU.

But the UK tax authorities stoked anger within the industry by claiming the changes would do little damage. “The measure is likely to affect fewer than 500,000 individuals and households and the impact … is anticipated to be negligible,” it wrote in a consultation document released on Wednesday.

The Solar Trade Association (STA), lobby group for the photovoltaic sector, said it was an astonishing and avoidable blow that could add ?900 to a typical domestic rooftop installation and would only serve to suck even more potential investment from low carbon power.

‘As countries are racing to secure the new global climate agreement, the UK has just proposed quadrupling VAT on solar installations for people’s homes to 20%, while oil heating, coal and gas remain on 5%. The International Energy Agency is in Paris right now calling for an end to fossil fuels subsidies just as the Treasury proposes tilting the playing field here away from clean power for British households,”

“This is clearly absurd. We will be strongly urging the Treasury to treat solar the same as they propose for oil, gas, heat pumps and biomass boilers. But it is incredible to have to argue for even level VAT treatment for solar VAT just as the Paris conference demands greatly accelerated action to avoid dangerous climate change.”

The solar industry is already nervous as it waits to hear next week whether ministers will proceed with a swath of cuts to the feed in tariff subsidies.

The STA said it was hopeful ministers would reach a compromise but remained concerned thatthe cuts could still be too heavy to save a sector reeling from thousands of redundancies as business confidence evaporates.

Greenpeace said the government should be resisting any misguided regulations from Brussels at a time when it was pushing for lower carbon emissions at the UN climate change talks.

“A vital part of the sustainable energy future being championed in Paris today is being undermined in London by changes to VAT that must be resisted,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.

“In addition to the confusion created by dramatic cuts to solar support, this creates a new round of uncertainty for business, and more expense for homeowners who are seeking to do their bit for the climate, as loudly requested by David Cameron last week. This move makes a mockery of Cameron’s claims to climate leadership, and shows once again that is Osborne who is ultimately holding the reins on energy policy in the UK.”

Leo Murray, a campaigner for the 10:10 climate change charity, added: “Our government promised to fight this. Something very wrong is going on with the EU tax system when short haul flights are zero rated for VAT meanwhile people who are trying to do the right thing by generating their own energy are being massively penalised for buying products that are absolutely essential to meeting legally binding targets on renewable energy and our climate change objectives.”

Critics want to know why some technologies such as insulation, draft-proofing, central heating and biomass boilers will not be affected by the change and yet wind and solar seem to have been singled out.

They suggest the government can avoid VAT increases if it shows that the solar panels or wind turbines are being used as part of a wider strategy to beat fuel poverty.

A spokesman for HMRC said the British tax authorities had done all they could by arguing in court for a different outcome. “We lost the case. We cannot appeal or go any further so we have to make changes to the rules to comply with European law.”

A government spokesperson said: “The government remains committed to improving UK homes to help tackle fuel poverty and keep energy bills low. Despite the EU’s ruling, we will continue to help the most vulnerable, such as the elderly, with the installation of energy saving materials, by retaining the vast majority of the relief on energy saving materials.”

We’re out of time on climate change. And Hillary Clinton helped get us here
There aren’t a lot of certainties left in the US presidential race, but here’s one thing about which we can be absolutely sure: the Clinton camp really doesn’t like talking about fossil-fuel money. Last week, when a young Greenpeace campaigner challenged Hillary Clinton about taking money from fossil-fuel companies, the candidate accused the Bernie Sanders campaign of “lying” and declared herself “so sick” of it. As the exchange went viral, a succession of high-powered Clinton supporters pronounced that there was nothing to see here and that everyone should move along.

The very suggestion that taking this money could impact Clinton’s actions is “baseless and should stop,” according to California senator Barbara Boxer. It’s “flat-out false,” “inappropriate,” and doesn’t “hold water,” declared New York mayor Bill de Blasio. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman went so far as to issue “guidelines for good and bad behaviour” for the Sanders camp. The first guideline? Cut out the “innuendo suggesting, without evidence, that Clinton is corrupt.”

That’s a whole lot of firepower to slap down a non-issue. So is it an issue or not? First, some facts. Clinton’s campaign, including her Super Pac, has received a lot of money from the employees and registered lobbyists of fossil-fuel companies. There’s the much-cited $4.5m that Greenpeace calculated, which includes bundling by lobbyists.

But that’s not all. There is also a lot more money from sources not included in those calculations. For instance, one of Clinton’s most prominent and active financial backers is Warren Buffett. While he owns a large mix of assets, Buffett is up to his eyeballs in coal, including coal transportation and some of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants in the country.

Related: Clinton and Sanders battle in New York over mounting hostilities

Then there’s all the cash that fossil-fuel companies have directly pumped into the Clinton Foundation. In recent years, Exxon, Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron have all contributed to the foundation. An investigation in the International Business Times just revealed that at least two of these oil companies were part of an effort to lobby Clinton’s State Department about the Alberta tar sands, a massive deposit of extra-dirty oil. Leading climate scientists like James Hansen have explained that if we don’t keep the vast majority of that carbon in the ground, we will unleash catastrophic levels of warming.

Did these donations have anything to do with the investigation found, Clinton’s State Department approving the Alberta Clipper, a controversial pipeline carrying large amounts of tar-sands bitumen from Alberta to Wisconsin? “According to federal lobbying records reviewed by the IBT,” write David Sirota and Ned Resnikoff, “Chevron and ConocoPhillips both lobbied the State Department specifically on the issue of ‘oil sands’ in the immediate months prior to the department’s approval, as did a trade association funded by ExxonMobil.”

Did they make Hillary Clinton more disposed to seeing tar-sands pipelines as environmentally benign, as early State Department reviews of Keystone XL seemed to conclude, despite the many scientific warnings? There is no proof – no smoking gun, as Clinton defenders like to say. Just as there is no proof that the money her campaign took from gas lobbyists and fracking financiers has shaped Clinton’s current (and dangerous) view that fracking can be made safe.

It’s important to recognise that Clinton’s campaign platform includes some very good climate policies that surely do not please these donors – which is why the fossil-fuel sector gives so much more to climate change-denying Republicans. Still, the whole funding mess stinks, and it seems to get worse by the day. So it’s very good that the Sanders camp isn’t abiding by Krugman’s “guidelines for good behaviour” and shutting up about the money in a year when climate change has contributed to the hottest temperatures since records began. This primary isn’t over, and Democratic voters need and deserve to know all they can before they make a choice we will all have to live with for a very long time.

Eva Resnick-Day, the 26-year-old Greenpeace activist who elicited the “so sick” response from Clinton last week, has a very lucid and moving perspective on just how fateful this election is, how much hangs in the balance. Responding to Clinton’s claim that young people “don’t do their own research,” Resnick-Day told Democracy Now!:

As a youth movement, we have done our own research, and that is why we are so terrified for the future…. Scientists are saying that we have half the amount of time that we thought we did to tackle climate change before we go over the tipping point. And because of that, youth—the people that are going to have to inherit and deal with this problem—are incredibly worried. What happens in the next four or eight years could determine the future of our planet and the human species. And that’s why we’re out there…asking the tough questions to all candidates: to make sure that whoever is in office isn’t going to continue things as they’ve been, but take a real stand to tackle climate change in a meaningful and deep way for the future of our planet.

Related: Let’s make this a real ‘leap’ year, and go fossil fuel-free | Naomi Klein

Resnick-Day’s words cut to the heart of why this is not just another election cycle, and why Clinton’s web of corporate entanglements is deeply alarming with or without a “smoking gun.” Whoever wins in November, the next president will come into office with their back up against the climate wall. Put simply, we are just plain out of time. Everything is moving faster than the scientific modelling has prepared us for. The ice is melting faster. The oceans are rising faster. And that means that governments must move much faster too. The latest peer-reviewed science tells us that if we want a good shot at protecting coastal cities this century – including New York, the place where Bernie and Hillary are currently having it out – then we need to get off fossil fuels with superhuman speed. A new paper from Oxford University, published in the journal Applied Energy, concludes that for humanity to have a 50-50 chance of meeting the temperature targets set in Paris, every new power plant has to be zero-carbon, starting next year.

That is hard. Really hard. At a bare minimum, it requires a willingness to go head-to-head with the two most powerful industries on the planet – fossil-fuel companies and the banks that finance them. Hillary Clinton is uniquely unsuited to this epic task.

While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview, against everything she’s built, and everything she stands for. The real issue, in other words, isn’t Clinton’s corporate cash, it’s her deeply pro-corporate ideology: one that makes taking money from lobbyists and accepting exorbitant speech fees from banks seem so natural that the candidate is openly struggling to see why any of this has blown up at all.

While Clinton is great at warring with Republicans, taking on powerful corporations goes against her entire worldview

To understand this worldview, one need look no further than the foundation where Hillary Clinton works and that bears her family name. Its mission can be distilled as follows: There is so much private wealth sloshing around our planet (thanks in very large part to the deregulation and privatisation frenzy that Bill Clinton unleashed on the world while president) that every single problem on earth, no matter how large, can be solved by convincing the ultra-rich to do the right things with their loose change. Naturally, the people to convince them to do these fine things are the Clintons, the ultimate relationship brokers and dealmakers, with the help of an entourage of A-list celebrities.

The problem with Clinton World is structural. It’s the way in which these profoundly enmeshed relationships – lubricated by the exchange of money, favours, status and media attention – shape what gets proposed as policy in the first place.

For instance, under the Clintons’ guidance, drug companies work with the foundation to knock down their prices in Africa (conveniently avoiding the real solution: changing the system of patenting that allows them to charge such grotesque prices to the poor in the first place). The Dow Chemical Company finances water projects in India. (Just don’t mention their connection to the ongoing human health disaster in Bhopal, for which the company still refuses to take responsibility.). And it was at the Clinton Global Initiative that the airline mogul Richard Branson made his flashy pledge to spend billions solving climate change (almost a decade later, we’re still waiting, while Virgin Airlines keeps expanding).

In Clinton World it’s always win-win-win: the governments look effective, the corporations look righteous, and the celebrities look serious. Oh, and another win too: the Clintons grow ever more powerful.

Related: This may shock you: Hillary Clinton is fundamentally honest | Jill Abramson

At the centre of it all is the canonical belief that change comes not by confronting the wealthy and powerful but by partnering with them. Viewed from within the logic of what Thomas Frank recently termed “the land of money”, all of Hillary Clinton’s most controversial actions make sense. Why not take money from fossil-fuel lobbyists? Why not get paid hundreds of thousands for speeches to Goldman Sachs? It’s not a conflict of interest; it’s a mutually beneficial partnership – part of a never-ending merry-go-round of corporate-political give and take.

Books have been filled with the failures of Clinton-style philanthrocapitalism. When it comes to climate change, we have all the evidence we need to know that this model is a disaster on a planetary scale. This is the logic that gave the world fraud-infested carbon markets and dodgy carbon offsets instead of tough regulation of polluters – because, we were told, emission reductions needed to be “win-win” and “market-friendly.”

If the next president wastes any more time with these schemes, the climate clock will run out, plain and simple. If we’re to have any hope of avoiding catastrophe, action needs to be unprecedented in its speed and scope. If designed properly, the transition to a post-carbon economy can deliver a great many “wins”: not just a safer future, but huge numbers of well-paying jobs; improved and affordable public transit; more liveable cities; as well as racial and environmental justice for the communities on the frontlines of dirty extraction.

Bernie Sanders’ campaign is built around precisely this logic: not the rich being stroked for a little more noblesse oblige, but ordinary citizens banding together to challenge them, winning tough regulations, and creating a much fairer system as a result.

Sanders and his supporters understand something critical: it won’t all be win-win. For any of this to happen, fossil-fuel companies, which have made obscene profits for decades, will have to start losing. And losing more than just the tax breaks and subsidies that Clinton is promising to cut. They will also have to lose the new drilling and mining leases they want; they’ll have to be denied permits for the pipelines and export terminals they very much want to build. They will have to leave trillions of dollars’ worth of proven fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.

Meanwhile, if solar panels proliferate on rooftops, big power utilities will lose a significant portion of their profits, since their former customers will be in the energy-generation business. This would create opportunities for a more level economy and, ultimately, for lower utility bills – but once again, some powerful interests will have to lose (which is why Warren Buffett’s coal-fired utility in Nevada has gone to war against solar ).

A president willing to inflict these losses on fossil-fuel companies and their allies needs to be more than just not actively corrupt. That president needs to be up for the fight of the century – and absolutely clear about which side must win. Looking at the Democratic primary, there can be no doubt about who is best suited to rise to this historic moment. The good news? He just won Wisconsin. And he isn’t following anyone’s guidelines for good behaviour.

Paris climate talks: delegates reach agreement on final draft text
Negotiators in Paris are to present their final draft text on Saturday morning for a deal on limiting climate change after working through Friday night to thrash out remaining details.

The French president, Francois Hollande, is due to join Ban Ki-moon at the landmark summit at 11.30am local time, when the text is expected to be published. The draft is predicted to be officially adopted in the afternoon.

Sources said the final text was only settled on at 6.45am after negotiators and ministers worked through Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights at Le Bourget in north-east Paris.

Laurent Fabius – the French foreign minister who has marshalled the text through its final stages as president of the talks – said on Thursday night: “All the conditions are ripe for a universal and ambitious agreement.

“We will never find a momentum as favourable as in Paris, but now the responsibility lies with ministers, who tomorrow [Saturday] will make their choice. I will present them a text that will be the most ambitious and balanced as possible.”

Earlier, Barack Obama had phoned the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, in a last-ditch effort to thrash out a climate change agreement to curb carbon emissions beyond 2020, when current commitments run out.

As the negotiations ran into overtime – something that has happened at virtually every such meeting of the last 20 years – Fabius on Friday called for a cooling-off period to allow more high level lobbying behind closed doors. He put off planned public plenary sessions, which risk being volatile, and gave the floor over to closed meetings in a last push for an agreement.

Peaceful protests are planned by climate activists across Paris. Civil society groups will hand out thousands of red tulips to represent red lines they say should not be crossed, and hold a rally under the Eiffel Tower if and when a deal is reached.

Even with Obama’s efforts to call in political favours with the Chinese president, sharp divisions remained on Friday between the US, India and China.

Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said the talks were the most complicated and difficult negotiations he had ever been involved in.

“I have been attending many difficult multilateral negotiations, but by any standard, this negotiation is most complicated, most difficult, but most important for humanity,” Ban told reporters.

The White House said Obama telephoned Xi to try and clinch a deal, following on from phone calls earlier in the week with the Indian, French, and Brazilian leaders.

Meanwhile, John Kerry, the US secretary of state, shuttled between delegations. “I think some of us have been working quietly behind the scenes to work out compromises ahead of time on some of those issues,” he told reporters. “And so tomorrow will be really a reflection of many of those compromises.”

The extraordinary expense of political capital reflects the extent to which Obama is invested in achieving a credible climate deal at Paris – as well as the immense difficulties of bringing the deal to a close. The US and China last year reached an historic agreement to work jointly to cut emissions.

But the Chinese leadership pushed back on Friday on the framing of the main issue of the agreement: how to get off fossil fuels. Liu Jianmin, the deputy foreign minister, complained there was no clear definition of “greenhouse gas emissions neutrality” in the latest draft text.

China and India have been accused by some negotiators of trying to water down the long term ambition of the draft climate deal, but its negotiators argued rich countries were trying to railroad them into a deal.

“The developed world is not showing flexibility,” said Prakash Javadekar, India’s environment minister.

Liu also dismissed the so-called “ coalition of ambition ” that has emerged at the Paris talks as a “performance”.

“We heard of this so-called ambitious coalition only since a few days ago, of course it has had a high in profile in the media, but we haven’t seen they have really acted for ambitious emissions commitments, so this is kind of performance by some members,” he said at a press conference.

On Friday, Brazil bolted from the bloc of powerful developing countries to endorse the coalition, which had been cobbled together earlier this year by the US, Europe and some low-lying states and African countries, to try to break down the old divisions that have stood in the way of an agreement.

“If you want to tackle climate change you need ambition and political will,” Izabella Teixeira, Brazil’s environment minister, said in a statement read out at a press conference.

As of Friday evening the agreement in the works recognised a more aspirational target of 1.5C for limiting temperature rise – which scientists say would offer a better chance of survival to low-lying and coastal states – as well as the internationally agreed 2C target. The latest draft also incorporates a long-term goal of decarbonisation, albeit without firm dates or targets, a five-year cycle for reviewing emissions cuts, and clear rules on transparency.

But for poor countries there was deep disappointment that the draft dropped any mention of climate or gender justice. There was also a backlash against Saudi Arabia, which leads important economic and regional blocs, and was accused of blocking a higher 1.5C target. “When Saudi Arabia talks about adaptation, I can not speak,” said Jahangir Hasan Masum, executive director of the Coastal Development Partnership, an NGO in Bangladesh working in low-lying areas vulnerable to cyclones. “I feel really disgusted talking about them because they are not serious for the planet. They are serious for their oil business and money and keeping their monarchy.”

Brazil’s support for the new US-sponsored alliance led to a sense of growing isolation around China and India, which had not signed on to the high ambition coalition, and expressed ambivalence about the 1.5C target.

But there remained much to play for between Friday night and Saturday. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru’s environment minister who presided over last year’s climate talks and is assisting Fabius, said countries had yet to find a formula for reconciling the core question of how industrialised countries and the rising economies should divide responsibilities for dealing with climate change. But he insisted talks – though moving slowly – were still headed in the right direction.

“The idea to postpone for some hours and not close on Friday has not been the result of a crisis,” he said. “We are used to have to postpone because of a crisis. In Lima, for example, we had a crisis, but today I think Fabius is giving people enough space to discuss all these issues.”"

Obama takes historic step to reduce carbon emissions from power stations: New regulations to cut pollution 30% by 2030: Executive move sets up mid-term election battle
Suzanne Goldenberg, US environment correspondent
The Obama administration unveiled historic environment rules cutting carbon pollution from power plants by 30% yesterday, spurring prospects for a global deal to end climate change but setting up an epic battle over the environment in this year's mid-term elections.

The rules, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, represent the first time Barack Obama, or any president, has moved to regulate carbon pollution from power plants - the largest single source of CO2 emissions. The EPA said the regulations, which would cut carbon pollution from power plants by 30% from 2005 levels by 2030, would ""fight climate change while supplying America with reliable and affordable power"".

Obama, in his first public comments on the new rules, urged supporters to ignore the ""naysayers"" and ""misinformation"". ""This is something that is important for all of us, as parents, as grandparents, as citizens, as folks who care about the health of our families and also want to make sure that future generations are able to enjoy this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space that we're a part of,"" he said.

The EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, said: ""The EPA is delivering on a vital piece of President Obama's climate action plan by proposing a clean power plan that will cut harmful carbon pollution from our largest source - power plants.""

The new rules were not as ambitious as some environmental groups had hoped. Even so, reaction to the new power plant rules ranged from ""momentous"" to ""historic"". Al Gore said the new rules were ""the most important step taken to combat the climate crisis in our country's history"".

Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said: ""Today the president made good on his promise to American families that his administration would tackle the climate crisis, and clean up and modernise the way we power our country.""

In an initiative organised by Ceres, the green investor network, 128 companies and 49 investors sent letters to the White House and leaders of both parties in Congress hailing the rules as ""a critical step"" towards dealing with climate change.

But a lobby group for the coal industry - which will be hit hardest by the new rules - said the regulations would hurt the economy and lead to power outages. ""If these rules are allowed to go into effect, the administration, for all intents and purposes, is creating America's next energy crisis,"" the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity said.

Obama had sought to deal with climate change through Congress. But after that effort collapsed, and with Republicans in Congress uniformly opposed to cutting carbon emissions, Obama decided last year to use his executive authority to cut carbon pollution.

In her announcement yesterday, McCarthy hit back at criticism from industry and conservative groups that the rules will lead to power outages and higher electricity prices.

""Critics say that energy bills will skyrocket. Well, they're wrong,"" she said. McCarthy argued that the new rules would result in pollution savings that amount to ""double the pollution every power plant in America generated in 2012"". The result, she said, would be lower medical bills and fewer trips to the emergency rooms, especially for asthma sufferers and the elderly.

McCarthy said the plan was ""also about environmental justice"" because ""lower-income families and communities of colour are hardest-hit"".

Power plants are the largest single source of carbon pollution, accounting for nearly 40% of the emissions that cause climate change. Carbon dioxide emissions from power plants had been falling since 2005, because of the economic downturn and because of the switch from coal to cheaper natural gas.

Ethan Zindler of Bloomberg New Energy Finance said the power industry was already about a third of the way towards the 30% goal. But emissions crept up last year and again in the first months of 2014, and the regulations would put America on course for long-term and lasting cuts to carbon pollution.

Andrew Steer, the chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said: ""These standards send a powerful message around the world that it's time to face the global threat of climate change.""

The rules could affect 1,600 power plants. About 600 of these operate on coal, including many that are nearly 50 years old and will have the most difficulty meeting the new standards.

Under the rule, states and power companies will have a range of options to meet the new standards: switching from coal to cleaner-burning natural gas; forming cap-and-trade markets; expanding renewables such as wind and solar power; or encouraging customers to use less energy by moving to more efficient heating and cooling systems and appliances.

The 30% national target will not be applied uniformly across the country. The EPA will set individual targets for each state, taking into account their energy mix. States have until 2016 to come up with their strategies.

However, the EPA rules will not come into force in all states until 2020, according to one individual briefed on the plan.

Contrary to industry claims, coal power would fail to deliver electricity to those suffering from energy poverty and would actively degrade their lives, says Gore and global investment manager David Blood

The global coal industry has mounted a “cynical and misleading campaign” to present coal as a solution to world poverty, according to former US vice-president Al Gore and global investment manager David Blood.

Writing in the Guardian on Thursday, the pair said that as investors have grown increasingly worried about coal assets being overvalued, coal’s industrial masters and political friends have embarked on a desperate fightback based on tenuous arguments and exploits an urgent humanitarian need.

 Cheap coal is a lie – stand up to the industry’s cynical fightback
Al Gore, former US vice-president, and David Blood

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates more than 1.3 billion people lack access to electricity – 95% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa and developing regions in Asia. The coal industry and coal producing nations have repeatedly cited this crisis as a moral imperative for the continued expansion of coal power in the developing world.

But Gore and Blood said coal power would not only fail to deliver electricity to those suffering from energy poverty, it would actively degrade their lives.

“... As the coal industry fights for survival, it has begun to rely on novel and increasingly tenuous arguments. It has embarked on a global campaign to promote coal as the solution to energy poverty. This disingenuous claim is predicated on the notion that coal is the cheapest way of providing electricity to the one-fifth of the world’s population lacking access to an electricity grid,” they said.

Energy poverty overwhelmingly (84%) hits rural areas where there is often no extant grid infrastructure. Gore and Blood cited research by campaign group Carbon Tracker that found the cost of building the lines to carry electricity from a central coal power station to these communities made the cost “prohibitively high”. In practice, they said, large energy projects in developing countries tend to bring increased capacity to those already connected – ie wealthy and industrial customers – not those living without power.


Gore and Blood are the co-founders of Generation Investment Management, a fund that supports renewable energy and sustainable projects in its investment strategy. They argued that renewable energy – especially solar – was the best solution to the urgent need for electricity in the developing world. Solar has dropped dramatically in price in recent years, is virtually free once established and can be built in rural areas without the need to carry power long distances.

“...The relative merits of different energy options must be considered over the long term with an emphasis on three factors: financial cost, reliability, and impact on society and the environment. And when viewed through this lens, renewable energy – particularly solar photovoltaic energy, or PV – far outranks coal as the best future energy choice for developing nations,” they said.

In response, representatives of the coal industry said coal had been, and would continue to be, a vital source of power for the developing world.



Vic Svec, a senior vice-president at the world’s largest private coal company Peabody Energy, cited a recent report by a conservative US think tank that found 830 million people had been connected to coal power in the past two decades.



“Half the world’s seven billion people lack adequate electricity, and coal is key to solving this problem. In the past 20 years, more than 800 million people gained access to electricity from coal, representing a ratio of 13 to one versus wind and solar. Coal remains the fastest-growing fuel this century and projections show coal will fuel more electricity than any other source over the next several decades,” said Svec.

Benjamin Sporton, acting chief executive of the World Coal Association, said “coal has a critical role to play” in solving the energy poverty problem. He said African leaders were supportive of coal’s role in their energy mix and the IEA predicted coal demand to grow by 4.8% per year to 2035 and to double in India by 2040.

“Rather than ignoring the huge role coal is playing in building energy access, the international community should be supporting developing countries deploy cleaner coal technologies, such as high-efficiency low-emissions coal plants and carbon capture and storage,” said Sporton.

But Gore and Blood said the impact of coal’s combustion on the climate and the air pollution it generates were already responsible for devastating the lives the industry claims to have improved.

In northern China and some Indian cities, where hundreds of millions of people have been connected to coal power in recent decades, life expectancy has decreased by 5.5 and 3.2 years respectively because of air pollution linked to coal plants.

“The price of coal would increase dramatically if it reflected the cost borne by society from the pollution that causes hundreds of thousands of premature deaths each year in coal-dependent countries,” said Gore and Blood.

According to IEA data, coal was responsible for almost 44% of global carbon emissions in 2012. The UN says the climate changes that result from these emissions will land disproportionately heavily on those in developing and rural communities.

Gore and Blood join a growing chorus of voices from the financial sector and politics who believe coal represents a poor option for investors. "

A story of hope: the Guardian launches phase II of its climate change campaign
A year ago, more than 300,000 people took to the streets in New York to demand action from their leaders on climate change.

Nearly the same number took part in similar events in 161 countries across the globe. For 24 hours, the sun did not set on the largest climate protest in history.

These grassroots activists are part of a powerful global movement for change that has continued to grow as crucial UN climate talks in Paris in December have drawn nearer, bolstered by interventions from other important global voices – Pope Francis, Graca Machel, Desmond Tutu and Mary Robinson, to name a few. The pope last week repeated his message of climate justice and change to world leaders at the UN.

Crucially, that change is now beginning to take hold, with clean energy on the march and the low-carbon economy becoming a reality on the ground, rather than just a PowerPoint aspiration.

It is against this backdrop that the Guardian is launching the next stage of its climate change campaign as our team of environment correspondents around the world champion a rare commodity in the climate change debate – hope.

There is hope in the many voices who are now calling for action from their leaders.

There is hope in the rapidly falling cost of renewable energy that is starting to transform our dirty energy system.

There is hope in the pledge by G7 countries to phase out coal power.

There is hope in the communities and innovators around the world who are getting on with the job rather than waiting for the politicians.

In short, the world is beginning to get to grips with the biggest problem it faces, but has arrived at a crossroads. Powerful forces are still at work against a meaningful agreement in Paris. So those who believe that climate change needs urgent solutions cannot let up the pressure.

More of that later. First a recap.

Six months ago, the Guardian took a stand on climate change with an editorial push and campaign. The intention was to highlight the uncomfortable fact that a large proportion of the oil, coal and gas reserves that states and companies already hold have to stay untapped in order to avoid dangerous climate change.

It is estimated that the world can afford to burn between one-fifth and one-third of proven reserves before there is a reasonable chance of tipping the planet over the 2C danger threshold of warming. Uncomfortable is putting it mildly. As our reporting has sought to demonstrate, the implications of this analysis are huge for our economies, the stability of our financial system and the way we live our everyday lives.

The project has also sought new and better ways to cover the biggest and most important issue of the age – one that affects so much else that the Guardian’s journalists around the world report on every day. Extreme weather, food and water shortages, conflict, migration, energy bills, technology and many other issues are influenced by the steady march of climate change.

Aside from making a big investment in investigative journalism and reportage from locations as diverse as the Arctic, China, Brazil, Australia and South Africa, the Guardian also launched a campaign in partnership with the NGO 350.org to persuade the world’s two largest health charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust – to move their investments out of fossil fuel-producing companies. The Guardian’s own commercial board took the decision to divest its ?800m fund from coal, oil and gas.

There was always a broader context, however – the Paris climate talks. In December, governments will attempt to thrash out a deal that many hope will chart a course to transforming the world’s dirty energy system and so keep at bay the worst consequences of climate change. Keep it in the ground phase one began to turn up the heat on politicians in advance of those talks by highlighting the stratospheric growth of the fossil fuel divestment movement.

In 43 countries, more than 400 organisations with a collective worth of $2.6tn – including Stanford University, the Church of England, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund and the Australian city with the largest coal port on the planet – have made commitments to move their investments out of fossil fuels. This is civil society putting serious money where its mouth is – something those involved in the talks have noticed.

With just over two months to go until the talks it is right that we shift the focus of the campaign. We will continue to highlight the message that the majority of fossil fuels must be kept under the ground and to make the divestment case to the Wellcome Trust and Gates Foundation. But it is time for a new direction.

Naturally, the journalistic focus now moves to the talks themselves. Which countries are the heroes and which the villains? Will the deal be fair to the poorest nations? Most importantly, can the agreement save the world? Despite a relentless diplomatic push by the French hosts to make the talks a success, an ambitious agreement is far from certain.

Notwithstanding the importance of the UN process, focusing solely on Paris would be to tell only part of the story. One of the most significant features of the Keep it in the ground campaign so far has been the response from Guardian readers. More than 226,000 of you have signed up as supporters from more than 170 countries – and you have been central to what we and 350.org have done. You bombarded us with ideas for stories to cover. Hundreds of you wrote well-informed and often moving letters to the Wellcome Trust board requesting divestment. Many of you took part in a video appeal direct to Bill Gates. And numerous others in his home town of Seattle have joined the cause with their own campaign. Nearly 1,000 health professionals – including the editors of the British Medical Journal and the Lancet – signed a letter urging health organisations to “do no harm” and divest their assets on grounds of medical ethics. Thank you for your support so far.

Related: The new cold war: drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic

So when deciding where Keep it in the ground should go next it made sense for us to ask this global movement where they wanted us to shift the focus. Naturally, there was a range of ideas but one clear message kept coming through time and again. It can be summed up in one word – hope.

Supporters told us they wanted to hear more about the positive climate stories – the new technologies that are capturing the sun’s energy even more efficiently; the rapid drops in the price of renewable energy; the currently off-grid communities in Africa that are developing clean power; the smart technology helping homeowners to use less energy.

Another message that came through was a desire to hear about the other side of the divestment coin. If you take your money out of the problem, where should you put it to be part of the solution? We’ve heard about “divest”, now what about “invest”?

Above all, you told us that even though the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust have not yet chosen to move their investments, the Guardian must not give up on the climate issue. With global warming so high on the world agenda, it would be wrong to abandon the momentum that Keep it in the ground has created.

So a major strand of our climate coverage up to Paris and beyond will be about climate change as a story of hope. That doesn’t mean wilfully ignoring the gravity of the situation we face. Far from it. The Guardian will continue to report on the science of climate change, visit the places around the globe that will experience the worst impacts and uncover bad corporate behaviour and misinformation where it happens. But we will also make a point of bringing positive stories to the fore. In particular, the next phase of Keep it in the ground will champion the amazing growth of solar power and its potential to transform the global energy supply. Since the disappointing outcome at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, the cost of solar panels has dropped by about 70% and continues to fall, meaning that solar is now as cheap or cheaper than fossil fuels in some countries.

In Queensland, Australia, last year, wholesale energy prices went negative during the day for the first time because of the expansion of solar installations to more than 350,000 rooftops across the state. There was so much power on the grid its price crashed.

In the US, solar is the fastest-growing source of power with residential rooftop installations up 70% year on year. And politicians there have woken up. Last month, President Obama announced measures to encourage more take-up by home owners. He was speaking in a Las Vegas casino that has 20 acres of solar panels on its roof. Hillary Clinton has made solar a big part of her pitch for the presidency with a pledge for half a billion panels across the country.

Republicans too – even those who don’t regard climate change as a problem – are seeing the potential of solar to give households energy independence and security. “ Rooftop solar makes it harder for terrorists to render a devastating blow to our power grid,” says Debbie Dooley, who was one of 22 organisers of the first nationwide Tea Party protest in 2009.

Around the world, far-sighted countries are helping investors to put serious money into solar. A few months ago, a deal was signed in conflict-riven Burundi for a solar field that will provide 15% of that country’s energy-generating capacity. Tanzania has a plan to give a million homes access to solar energy by the end of 2017. Bangladesh aims to expand solar power to every home by 2021. Morocco plans to build five big new solar plants by 2020 at a cost of $9bn (?6bn) and become a major energy exporter to Europe.

Technology improvements can and will help drive this transition by making clean energy cheaper, but we are no longer waiting for some mythical breakthrough invention to solve climate change. Many of the tools already exist.

With so much momentum behind clean energy around the world, it is all the more jarring that the British government is going in the opposite direction. With the opposition distracted, the Conservatives have moved to systematically remove support for renewable energy. The government is consulting on subsidy changes that will make it essentially uneconomic for people to install solar panels on their roofs. The Australian government too has acted as a brake on solar energy when we need an accelerator.

In the coming weeks and months, the Guardian will increase its reporting all of these developments and more. We will look in detail at the potential for solar power and the obstacles it faces. And campaign supporters will continue to play a crucial role. The Guardian will ask readers what you want to see covered and we’ll bring you closer to the experts who can help answer your questions. We will be at the Global Climate March in Paris on 29 November and will give information on what individuals around the world can do to get behind the climate movement.

So whether you are already a supporter of Keep it in the ground or whether you are seeing the Guardian’s campaign for the first time, please sign up to find out more. By doing so, you will receive regular updates on our coverage and the progress of the campaign, as well as an opportunity to participate and influence the direction we take.

This is the most exciting and hopeful time for anyone interested in solving the biggest problem that humanity faces. As Pope Francis put it in his encyclical on the environment in June : “All is not lost. Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start … to embark on new paths to authentic freedom.”

That new start is already rising from the dirty energy system we inherited from the 19th and 20th centuries but for now it is just that – a start. It is only with unrelenting pressure from below that world leaders will continue with enough purpose on the right path."

Church of England ends investments in heavily polluting fossil fuels
The Church of England has pulled its money out of two of the most polluting fossil fuels as part of what it called its moral responsibility to protect the world’s poor from the impact of global warming.

Related: Fossil fuel divestment: a brief history

In a move approved by the church’s board on Thursday, it divested £12m from tar sands oil and thermal coal – the first time it has ever imposed investment restrictions because of climate change.

The church’s huge £9bn investment fund and leadership on climate change has made it the target of a global campaign calling for organisations to divest from fossil fuel companies. Campaigners hailed the move, which they said in effect “read the last rites” to the two industries.

“This policy is sending a very clear signal about the church’s investments,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment for the Church Commissioners. “

“This is a really comprehensive policy, which aspires to put the church at the forefront of institutional investors, highlighting the urgency of the transition to a low-carbon economy and playing our part as investors in that.”

The CoE’s climate-change policy has been in place since 2008 but the new policy, the result of a two-year review, marks a much bolder and more interventionist stance by the church.

It has now divested and ruled out future investments in any company that makes more than 10% of its revenues from thermal coal – used for electricity generation – and oil from the tar sands.

One leading climate scientist, Prof James Hansen, has warned that it would be “game over” for efforts to stop dangerous global warming if Canada’s tar sands, the world’s third biggest oil reserve, are fully exploited.

The church argued that it had not been minded to divest from all fossil fuels as some campaigners had wanted, because engagement with some oil and gas companies produced results, such as the adoption of a church-led resolution on climate change by BP at its annual meeting earlier this month.

“Companies like the oil and gas majors are significant players in the business world and political world, and we’d like them to be part of a constructive call for the transition to the low-carbon economy,” said Mason. The church has about £101m invested in Shell and £91.9m in BP.

But the church made clear that it would divest when engagement did not work.

“Engagement is something that we will be looking to demonstrate success. If engagement with companies isn’t productive, the policy does make clear divestment is there as a last resort,” Mason said.

Rev Canon Prof Richard Burridge, deputy chair of the ethical investment advisory group that undertook the review, said: “The church has a moral responsibility to speak and act on both environmental stewardship and justice for the world’s poor who are most vulnerable to climate change.”

Christine Allen, director of policy and public affairs at the development charity Christian Aid, said she welcomed the move but hoped the church would address its investments in other fossil fuels in the future.

“The Church of England has effectively read the last rites to the coal and tar sands industry. The message must be heard loud and clear: they have no place in a sustainable future, and ultimately other fossil fuels don’t either,” she said.

Bill McKibben, a prominent environmentalist who has previously chastised the CoE for dragging its feet and not heeding calls by the Anglican archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu that organisations divest, applauded the new policy.

“This is the first great turnaround in the divestment fight, an institution which initially refused to move and then, in good Christian fashion, saw the light.

“Much credit to the CoE – they’re studying the signs of the times, as the good book says, and starting to show their concern for the poorest and most vulnerable parts of humanity and of creation,” he said.

The Guardian is currently running its own climate change campaign, calling on the Wellcome Trust and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to divest from fossil fuels."

Letter: Watch out for that sixth warning sign flashing in the economy
Dr David Dixon
*?Larry Elliott's scepticism about the longevity of the economic recovery might itself have been influenced by the received wisdom it purported to doubt. It puts global warming as a reason for concern, rather than economic growth per se, which is causing ""climate change"" (a more complex concept than global warming) and other serious environmental degradation.

There is still insufficient attention paid to the fact that we live on a finite planet and that as a result economic growth has to be finite. To get away from this model, one has to look at different paradigms for economics, as well as different measures for assessing how well people are living. The present system allows the richest nations to fool themselves into thinking that unbridled economic growth can continue, because they can print money, repress interest rates and import resources if theirs become scarce, thus depriving the poorest of basic necessities and social justice. What happens when we can no longer do this? Perhaps the colonisation and exploitation of Mars will keep us topped up?

More ""real"" realism, please, so that we can explore sustainable long-term alternatives in mainstream economic commentary, rather than confining the environmental discussions to doom and gloom pieces in other parts of the paper.

Schools, hospitals and care homes should not be built near main roads to reduce the tens of thousands of deaths being caused by the ""invisible killer"" of air pollution, a committee of MPs has warned.

The Commons environmental audit committee recommends diesel engines be scrapped over time and existing schools close to busy roads be fitted with air-filtration systems to avoid the minute particles and toxic gases emitted from vehicles.

""Air pollution is an invisible killer and a public health imperative. It is unacceptable that a whole generation of people . . . could have their health seriously impaired by air pollution above EU limits before government brings this public health problem under control,"" the MPs say.

The official UK death toll for air pollution is about 29,000 people a year but this does not take into account levels of NO2 gas mainly emitted by diesel engines. An official government scientific advisory body will state shortly that this could add a further 30,000 deaths a year, said Joan Walley, chair of the committee. ""New figures suggest air pollution could be killing almost the same number of people as smoking in the UK, yet government seems unwilling to put saving lives before economic growth"", she said.

""Children growing up near busy roads with high NO2 and particle emissions have stunted and impaired lung development. Over 1,000 schools are only 150 metres away from major roads. Protecting children and vulnerable people in the worst affected areas must be made a priority.""

She urged ministers to pluck up the political courage to take ""potentially unpopular"" decisions necessary to get the most polluting vehicles off the roads and encourage more people to walk, cycle or take public transport.

The report urges the government to change the tax system, which has favoured diesel vehicles over petrol as a way to hold down CO2 climate-change emissions. According to evidence given to the committee, diesel vehicles produce 22 times as much particulate matter and four times as much NOx as petrol vehicles.

""Government incentives over many years have encouraged the purchase of diesel rather than petrol vehicles because they were considered to be more environmentally friendly. Their greater fuel efficiency produced less greenhouse gas per mile,"" said the MPs, some of whom were fitted with monitors to help them understand the effects of air pollution.

""The original favourable tax treatment for diesel was the result of an understandable effort to limit greenhouse gases. It is important that policies are flexible enough to accommodate changing understanding,"" says the report. The MPs, who took evidence from the scientists, doctors, government departments and the mayor of London, want all cities to set up low-emission zones to reduce inner-city pollution as in Germany.

They recommended planners and roadbuilders take more account of air pollution and that a loophole that allows mechanics to remove air filters from trucks be closed.

Friends of the Earth called for a moratorium on roadbuilding and airport expansion that would increase air pollution emissions. ""This damning report reinforces the public health imperative to tackle our filthy air as soon as possible. Children and elderly and those with some medical conditions are hit hardest by our illegal levels of air pollution,"" said a spokeswoman. ""This is a call to action. A healthy population is an important economic imperative. Government must take air pollution seriously now,"" said Dr Ian Mudway, researcher at the Centre for Environment and Health at King's College, London, who gave medical evidence of air pollution dangers to the committee.

Barry Gardiner, Labour's shadow environment minister, said: ""Air pollution is a public health crisis that kills tens of thousands of people each year and yet this Tory-led Government has done nothing to tackle the problem.

""The committee's report is a thorough and comprehensive assessment of government inaction on air pollution and it fully backs Labour's commitment to deliver a national framework for low-emissions zones,"" he said. The committee report follows rulings this year by the supreme court and the European court of justice that the UK government had acted illegally in not addressing air pollution and should act urgently to improve air quality in British cities."

Climate change: why the Guardian is putting threat to Earth front and centre
Alan Rusbridger
Journalism tends to be a rear-view mirror. We prefer to deal with what has happened, not what lies ahead. We favour what is exceptional and in full view over what is ordinary and hidden.

Famously, as a tribe, we are more interested in the man who bites a dog than the other way round. But even when a dog does plant its teeth in a man, there is at least something new to report, even if it is not very remarkable or important.

There may be other extraordinary and significant things happening – but they may be occurring too slowly or invisibly for the impatient tick-tock of the newsroom or to snatch the attention of a harassed reader on the way to work.

What is even more complex: there may be things that have yet to happen – stuff that cannot even be described as news on the grounds that news is stuff that has already happened. If it is not yet news – if it is in the realm of prediction, speculation and uncertainty – it is difficult for a news editor to cope with. Not her job.

For these, and other, reasons changes to the Earth’s climate rarely make it to the top of the news list. The changes may be happening too fast for human comfort, but they happen too slowly for the newsmakers – and, to be fair, for most readers.

These events that have yet to materialise may dwarf anything journalists have had to cover over the past troubled century. There may be untold catastrophes, famines, floods, droughts, wars, migrations and sufferings just around the corner. But that is futurology, not news, so it is not going to force itself on any front page any time soon.

Even when the overwhelming majority of scientists wave a big red flag in the air, they tend to be ignored. Is this new warning too similar to the last? Is it all too frightening to contemplate? Is a collective shrug of fatalism the only rational response?

The climate threat features very prominently on the home page of the Guardian on Friday even though nothing exceptional happened on this day. It will be there again next week and the week after. You will, I hope, be reading a lot about our climate over the coming weeks.

One reason for this is personal. This summer I am stepping down after 20 years of editing the Guardian. Over Christmas I tried to anticipate whether I would have any regrets once I no longer had the leadership of this extraordinary agent of reporting, argument, investigation, questioning and advocacy.

Very few regrets, I thought, except this one: that we had not done justice to this huge, overshadowing, overwhelming issue of how climate change will probably, within the lifetime of our children, cause untold havoc and stress to our species.

So, in the time left to me as editor, I thought I would try to harness the Guardian’s best resources to describe what is happening and what – if we do nothing – is almost certain to occur, a future that one distinguished scientist has termed as “incompatible with any reasonable characterisation of an organised, equitable and civilised global community”.

It is not that the Guardian has not ploughed considerable time, effort, knowledge, talent and money into reporting this story over many years. Four million unique visitors a month now come to the Guardian for our environmental coverage – provided, at its peak, by a team including seven environmental correspondents and editors as well as a team of 28 external specialists.

They, along with our science team, have done a wonderful job of writing about the changes to our atmosphere, oceans, ice caps, forests, food, coral reefs and species.

For the purposes of our coming coverage, we will assume that the scientific consensus about man-made climate change and its likely effects is overwhelming. We will leave the sceptics and deniers to waste their time challenging the science. The mainstream argument has moved on to the politics and economics.

The coming debate is about two things: what governments can do to attempt to regulate, or otherwise stave off, the now predictably terrifying consequences of global warming beyond 2C by the end of the century. And how we can prevent the states and corporations which own the planet’s remaining reserves of coal, gas and oil from ever being allowed to dig most of it up. We need to keep them in the ground.

There are three really simple numbers which explain this (and if you have even more appetite for the subject, read the excellent July 2012 Rolling Stone piece by the author and campaigner Bill McKibben, which – building on the work of the Carbon Tracker Initiative – first spelled them out).

2C : There is overwhelming agreement – from governments, corporations, NGOs, banks, scientists, you name it – that a rise in temperatures of more than 2C by the end of the century would lead to disastrous consequences for any kind of recognised global order.

565 gigatons: “ Scientists estimate that humans can pour roughly 565 more gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by mid-century and still have some reasonable hope of staying below 2C,” is how McKibben crisply puts it. Few dispute that this idea of a global “ carbon budget ” is broadly right.

2,795 gigatons: This is the amount of carbon dioxide that if they were burned would be released from the proven reserves of fossil fuel – ie the fuel we are planning to extract and use.

You do not need much of a grasp of maths to work out the implications. There are trillions of dollars worth of fossil fuels currently underground which, for our safety, simply cannot be extracted and burned. All else is up for debate: that much is not.

Related: Gormley climate change artwork shown for first time in the Guardian

We need to keep it in the ground. This was the starting point for the group of journalists who met early in January to start considering how we would cover the issue.

But how?

Some will make the case for governmental action. Within nine months, the nations of the world will assemble in Paris, as they did previously in Copenhagen and Kyoto and numerous other summits now forgotten. Can they find the right actions and words, where they have failed before? It is certainly important that they feel the pressure to achieve real change.

Others will make the case for reducing the fossil fuel exposure of investment portfolios by decarbonisation. Or going further to full divestment from the most polluting fossil fuel extraction companies. Next week, McKibben will describe how the cause of divestment is moving rapidly from a fringe campaign to a mainstream concern for banks and fund managers.

It is now very much on the radar of the financial director rather than the social responsibility department. If most of these reserves are unburnable, they are asking, then what does that say about the true value of carbon-dependent companies? It is a question of fiduciary responsibility as much as a moral imperative.

We will look at who is getting the subsidies and who is doing the lobbying. We will name the worst polluters and find out who still funds them. We will urge enlightened trusts, investment specialists, universities, pension funds and businesses to take their money away from the companies posing the biggest risk to us. And, because people are rightly bound to ask, we will report on how the Guardian Media Group itself is getting to grips with the issues.

In addition to words, images and films, we will be podcasting the series as we go along, to give some insight and transparency about our reporting and how we are framing and developing it.

We begin on Friday and on Monday with two extracts from the introduction to Naomi Klein’s recent book, This Changes Everything. This has been chosen because it combines sweep, science, politics, economics, urgency and humanity. Antony Gormley, who has taken a deep interest in the climate threat, has contributed two artworks from his collection that have not been exhibited before – the first of many artists with whom we hope to collaborate over coming weeks.

Where does this leave you? I hope not feeling impotent and fearful.

Some of you may be marching in London on Saturday 7 March. As McKibben will argue next week, the fight for change is also full of opportunity and optimism. And we hope that many readers will find inspiration in our series to make their own contribution by applying pressure on their workplace, or pension fund, to move.

But, most of all, please read what we write. Real change can only follow from citizens informing themselves and applying pressure. To quote McKibben: “This fight, as it took me too long to figure out, was never going to be settled on the grounds of justice or reason. We won the argument, but that didn’t matter: like most fights it was, and is, about power.”"

Vatican 'may' consider divestment from fossil fuels, despite pope's call to arms
The Vatican may consider, but is not committed to, divesting its holdings in fossil fuels, a Catholic church official has said, despite Pope Francis’s call for bold action to fight climate change and global warming.

The statement – made at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the pope’s recently released encyclical on the environment – is likely to disappoint climate activists, who have praised Pope Francis’s essay stressing that climate change is mostly a man-made problem.

Related: The pope's encyclical on climate change – as it happened

“I think that the Vatican bank may think of initiatives which are at the core of this change. So we will see in the future... it [divestment] may be considered by the Vatican,” said Flaminia Giovanelli, a lay woman who serves on the Vatican’s Pontifical Council for Peace and Justice.

The hesitancy to act may reflect internal divisions about whether investment decisions by the Institute for Religious Works (IOR)– the official name of the Vatican bank – which has about €6bn (?4.25bn) under management, ought to reflect Pope Francis’s values, particularly ones that might still be considered contentious within the church’s hierarchy.

George Pell, the Australian cardinal who serves as the pope’s chief economic minister, is known to be a climate-change denier. In a speech in 2011, he said that “evidence” that had led the scientific community to conclude that the earth is warming was “insufficient to achieve practical certainty on many of these scientific issues”.

Naomi Klein, the Canadian climate activist and author who recently joined forces with the Vatican on the issue of climate change and is in Rome for a two-day conference on the encyclical, said she believed that a possible divestment policy was under discussion.

Related: Pope Francis recruits Naomi Klein in climate change battle

“It is my understanding that this is an issue that is being internally debated and that a lot of issues are up for review and this is being raised,” Klein told the Guardian.

A spokesman for the Vatican bank, Max Hohenberg, claimed the issue was largely irrelevant because “there really isn’t much to divest”. He said about 95% of the bank’s assets were invested in government bonds, and the rest was invested in stocks held in investment funds, and that he had no knowledge of what specific stocks were held.

“If you look at divestment and look at the profile of the institute, you will come to the conclusion as an objective observer that it really does not have much relevance at the IOR,” Hohenberg said.

He added that the bank did not have any social investment policies in place, and that establishing one meant that it would likely be seen as a “model” within the church, “which is obviously quite a big issue”.

But Klein told the Guardian that she did not believe that the divestment issue was a “linear market argument”, but rather a moral argument about the “immorality” of investing in fossil fuels.

“The encyclical amplifies the moral argument that is a tremendous tool for the divestment movement, no matter what happens at the Vatican,” she said.

While some critics argue that divestment policies alone have little to no impact on corporate profits of major polluters, Klein said she believed that divestment in fossil-fuel companies would “set the political stage” for regulatory actions to recapture some of their profits, though a carbon tax or increased royalty payments on extraction.

“Once you have said those profits are immoral, then the public has a right to those profits,” she said.

Klein, who is known as a fierce critic of globalisation, acknowledged in a public statement that she was entering an “unlikely alliance” with the Vatican on the climate change issue, but said that the scale of the problem required all sorts of unique pairings.

“Inside these coalitions, we don’t agree on everything – not by a long shot. But we understand that the stakes are so high, time is so short and the task is so large that we cannot afford to allow those differences to divide us,” she said.

Klein said any deal arranged in a critical December summit in Paris that failed to immediately reduce emissions and provide “real and substantive” support for poor countries would be deemed a “failure” by activists.

“To our so-called leaders preparing their pledges for... Paris, getting out the lipstick and heels to dress up another lousy deal, I have to say this: read the actual encyclical – not the summaries, the whole thing,” Klein said. She called the document “courageous” and said it was making Pope Francis some “powerful enemies”.

Klein took a swipe at Barack Obama in her interview with the Guardian, saying that although the US president had made some “great speeches” and introduced some good proposals recently on climate change, his decision to open up the Arctic to drilling by Shell was “wholly incompatible with climate leadership”.

She also said she had no “high hopes” for Hillary Clinton, the leading Democratic contender in the 2016 race for the White House. “When she was secretary of state she rarely talked about climate change and it was her State Department that was set to rubber stamp Keystone,” she said, referring to the controversial trans-American pipeline.

“So, just judging her on her record, I don’t think there is any reason for optimism about Hillary on climate change,” she said.

Klein added that she was looking forward to seeing how leading Catholic Republicans who are running for the White House, especially Jeb Bush, would grapple with the climate issue while seeking to appeal to Hispanic voters, who see Pope Francis as a “rock star”.

“Watching how Republican candidates navigate seeing a significant and really critical part of their base greet this pope – and how important he is to them – and how they will maintain their position on climate change... I mean, I’m looking forward to seeing how they dance,” she said.

While Catholic politicians in the US – on the left and the right – have comfortably held positions that oppose the church, on issues ranging from abortion to capital punishment and gay rights, Klein said she believed that Republicans could no longer be as dismissive of the climate change issue as they were in previous elections.

“You are already seeing a slightly more serious tone, at least from Jeb Bush,” she said."

The eco guide to plastic bags
The disposable shopping bag’s moment has come – 5 October marks the introduction of a long-awaited bag tax in England, which should put a massive dent in the 8bn plastic bags a year dispensed by supermarkets. In Wales and Scotland, people have been living (in most cases very happily) without free plastic bags for some time.

To carry on polluting, it’ll cost you 5p per new bag, while online grocery delivery services will continue to infuriate by using loads of plastic bags and charging a flat fee.

If you want control, carry your own reusable bag and visit a bricks-and-mortar store. My advice is to invest in a designated “bag for life” or two. They are designed to last, are lower impact in terms of materials and will be your firm friends during the transition period.

I’m fond of jute as a fibre. It is fast growing, hardwearing and biodegradable. The more products we buy that are made from it, the more jute producers have an income (there are now Fairtrade standards for jute). It is estimated that there’s enough of this fibre to provide every person with two jute bags a year, so there’s no availability problem. The website Jutexpo.co.uk supplies the big retailers and claims you’ll get three to four years’ service out of one of their bags.

The manufacturers of Onyabags.co.uk claim that each of their bags, made from a silk constructed from recycled plastic bottles, displaces 1,000 plastic bags. I can’t verify the statistic, but I can vouch for the fact that they fit into a purse.

And the upscale Ohyo bag, designed by Felix Conran (from ?50), grows with your day. It starts off accommodating your tablet and then extends for groceries ( ohyo.me ).

At the moment, flexible packaging, including plastic bags, frozen-food bags and pouches, makes up 556,000 tonnes of rubbish. Almost all of it ends up in landfill. This is our chance to eliminate some of that waste. The best plastic bag is the one that’s never made.

The big picture: remembering the Rena oil spill

In 2011 the container ship MV Rena sailed on to a reef just off New Zealand’s east coast. It began to leak 1,700 tonnes of oil, creating New Zealand’s worst environmental maritime disaster and killing more than 20,000 seabirds. Four years on, an international report confirms it as one of the worst sea disasters ever. It also notes that people power, in the form of a huge volunteer clean-up, averted long-term environmental disaster.

Well dressed: carbon-tracking wristband

2015 is the year wearable tech went mainstream, and esigner Benjamin Hubert now wants us to use it to tackle climate change. His Worldbeing wristband is an easy-to-use carbon tracker with which you can monitor your weekly carbon target or current levels. The accessory takes complex data from the Carbon Trust on carbon budgets and makes it easy to understand. It is made from recycled electronics, with an e-ink screen. Hubert says it’s deliberately a “second-look” rather than “first-look” accessory – a subtle way of wearing your carbon-light lifestyle on your sleeve, that allows you to get on with the business of taking responsibility. It’s certainly more appealing than a T-shirt that screams “Climate justice”. Show your support at thunderclap.it/projects/31409- a-wearable-for- the-world

Arnold Schwarzenegger: climate change is not science fiction
Arnold Schwarzenegger has been chosen by the French government to join Nobel prizewinners, philosophers, UN secretary generals, spiritual leaders and theologians to make the moral case for the world to act urgently on climate change.

Talking at the world’s first summit of conscience for the climate on Tuesday – ahead of the crucial UN climate change meeting in the city in December – the Terminator star and former California governor declared the science debate over, saying planetary catastrophe could only be avoided with ethical action:

“I’ve starred in a lot of science fiction movies and, let me tell you something, climate change is not science fiction, this is a battle in the real world, it is impacting us right now.

“I believe the science is in. The debate is over and the time for action is now,” he told an invited audience of intellectuals and spiritual leaders from all faiths. “This is bigger than any movie, this is the challenge of our time. And it is our responsibility to leave this world a better place than we found it, but right now we are failing future generations.”

“This year alone we will dump 40bn tonnes of carbon emissions into our atmosphere. The World Health Organization says that air pollution causes over 7 million premature deaths every year and all over the world we can see flooding, monster storms, droughts and wild-fires that are completely out of control.”

The meeting, called by French president Francois Hollande ahead of the Paris political summit, was intended to put pressure on governments to act by mobilising millions of people to declare publicly that they “cared” for earth.

Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, chair of the Elders group of former world leaders, echoed a phrase attributed to Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev talking about nuclear war in 1979, saying “climate change would leave the living envying the dead”.

“If action is not taken immediately my grandson will live in a world suffering heat waves, severe droughts and floods. Cities like new York and Venice will drown. We are on the brink of catastrophe but the solution to the climate crisis cannot be left to governments alone... People are taking the lead and demanding change. We must not fail them.”

Irish president Michael Higgins called for moral courage. “Our current malaise is grounded in a cynicism we must confront. We need to confront the cult of the individual and insatiable consumption and replace it with a new thinking. We must reconcile science with ethics.”

Cardinal Peter Turkson, Ghanaian president of the Vatican’s Pontifical council for justice and peace, who helped Pope Francis write the encyclical on human ecology published last month, said that the climate is a common good. “It is a global common meant for all but the costs are being borne by those who have least contributed to it.

“At stake now is the wellbeing of the earth, our common hope. What we need is care. When we care for something it is with passion and commitment of the heart. That’s why Pope Francis called for care of the earth. A sense of passion is needed.”

Muslim theologians, Christians and Hindus said they saw climate change both as an existential threat and as an opportunity for renewal. Sheikh Bentounes, leader of the Sufi brotherhood Alawiya, urged mankind to carry “a hope of a future”.

“The prophet Mohammed called on man to plant and sow seeds. He said ‘Even at the end of times continue to plant and sow.’ We have responsibility to carry this hope to the end. This tiny vessel in infinite space that we call earth is unique.”

Daoists, Confucians, shamans, Jesuits, Bhuddists and others called for politicians to act on behalf of humankind at Paris. Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of 300 million Orthodox Christians, despaired at humanity’s blindness, but quoted writer Fyodor Dostoevsky saying that “beauty would save the earth”.

“Scientists and theologians agree that humanity depends on nature. We must accept the moral imperative for action. Religion must also be involved in the crucial question of climate change”, said Bartholomew.

David Rosen, director of inter-religious affairs at the American Jewish Committee, said: “Climate change takes place where there is unbridled avarice. It is a symptom of the disease and cry for us to respond. It is the opportunity for humans to rediscover the higher values than materialism and indulgence.”

Hindu leader Nandita Krishna, who has restored 50 sacred forests, feared that insatiable greed had gripped everyone on earth and this had led to climate change. “We cannot replicate the environment or create it. Unless we see the divine in creation we will not understand our role and duty as humans,” she said.

Nobel prizewinning economist Mohemed Yunus, founder of the Grameen bank in Bangladesh, said technology could help achieve zero poverty and zero carbon emissions. “[But] technology today is in the hands of the money makers and the war-makers. They are not directing it to solve the problems of the world.”

It was left to 86-year-old Benin writer and politician Albert Teveodjre to represent the views of secular thinkers. “Nature was loaned to us as a place to live. I witness a world of profit at all costs which will ruin the envronment and devastate everything. I am very worried. I think I will leave the world with many worries.”"

Islamic leaders issue bold call for rapid phase out of fossil fuels
Islamic leaders have issued a clarion call to 1.6bn Muslims around the world to work towards phasing out greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and a 100% renewable energy strategy.

The grand mufti’s of Lebanon and Uganda endorsed the Islamic declaration on climate change, along with prominent Islamic scholars and teachers from 20 countries, at a symposium in Istanbul.

Their collective statement makes several detailed political demands likely to increase pressure on Gulf states ahead of the Paris climate summit in December.

“We particularly call on the well-off nations and oil-producing states to lead the way in phasing out their greenhouse gas emissions as early as possible and no later than the middle of the century,” it says.

Clear emissions reductions targets and monitoring systems should be agreed in Paris, the statement says, along with “generous financial and technical support” for poorer countries to help wean them off fossil fuels.

So far, Morocco is the only Middle Eastern country to present an emissions-cutting climate pledge ahead of the summit. But Hakima el-Haite, the country’s environment minister said that the declaration could help to change mindsets and behaviours around climate change in some Gulf states.

“It is an emotive call for a spiritual fight against climate change that will be very important for Muslims,” she told the Guardian. “It speaks to issues of fairness, accountability, differentiation and adaptation in the Paris agreement. I think that the right way to make this sort of call is through the Qur’an.”

El-Haite predicted that Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries would sign up to a climate agreement in Paris but said that international support would first be needed to address the “financial gap” involved in transiting from fossil fuels to renewables-based economies.

The Istanbul declaration was made by Islamic figures from Bosnia to Indonesia and follows a ground-breaking Papal encyclical last month. Heads of state, corporations, and all peoples are addressed in the Istanbul call, which carries a universal and startlingly bleak message.

“We are in danger of ending life as we know it on our planet,” the statement says. “This current rate of climate change cannot be sustained, and the earth’s fine equilibrium ( mizan ) may soon be lost.”

“What will future generations say of us, who leave them a degraded planet as our legacy?” the religious leaders ask. “How will we face our Lord and Creator?”

Din Syamsuddin, the chairman of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) which represents 210 million Muslims welcomed the statement, saying: “we are committed to to implementing all [its] recommendations. The climate crisis needs to be tackled through collaborative efforts.”

The MUI has already issued one environmental fatwa against rogue mining operations and Syamsuddin reportedly consulted with Indonesia’s environment minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar over the weekend, before attending the symposium.

Unlike the Catholic church, Islam is a decentralised religion with no unitary authority, and the final statement addressed a range of secular concerns with calls for divestment, a circular economy, and tempered growth rates.

“To chase after unlimited economic growth in a planet that is finite and already overloaded is not viable. Growth must be pursued wisely and in moderation,” one passage reads.

Another calls for corporations and the business sector to “shoulder the consequences of their profit-making activities and to take a visibly more active role in reducing their carbon footprint and other forms of impact upon the natural environment”.

The United Nations’ climate chief, Christiana Figueres said that overall, the declaration showed how a clean energy future rested on a shift in the value attached to the world’s environment and people. “Islam’s teachings, which emphasize the duty of humans as stewards of the Earth and the teacher’s role as an appointed guide, illuminate pathways to take the right action on climate change,” she said.

The declaration on climate change was also welcomed by Cardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, “with great joy, and in a spirit of solidarity”. Turkson pledged that the Catholic Church would work with the declaration’s authors to protect their common earthly home.

Organisers say that one religious scholar from Saudi Arabia was among the 60 participants at the meeting but that none of the invited Shia leaders attended."

Coalition Britain: has the ‘greenest ever’ government lived up to its promise?
Anne Perkins
It was on a broiling summer’s day last August that Hoovergate broke. Brussels bureaucrats were about to ban high-powered vacuum cleaners, and every Tory criticism of the green agenda collided in one nightmarish Daily Mail headline.

After protests over onshore windfarms and outrage over higher energy bills because of the levy for renewable investments, the EU was even going to make housework tougher for hard-pressed voters.

A few days later, Douglas Carswell became the first Tory backbencher to resign from the party to defect to Ukip. Carswell’s concerns went much wider than the wattage of vacuum cleaners, but his decision propelled a party that questions the very existence of climate change into the mainstream debate. The Conservatives, who pledged in 2010 that the coalition would be the “greenest government ever”, now faced a triple threat to that promise: the recession, Ukip and a politically toxic EU.

“Don’t expect climate change to feature in the election campaign,” said one of the greener Tory MPs.

It had all been so different for David Cameron back in 2005. He’d recognised that the message of social justice implicit in the green agenda could be an important way of making people see Conservativism differently. Most people remember the Arctic trip with the huskies. The pledge to rule out a third runway at Heathrow was more significant.

After the inconclusive election in 2010, the coalition’s programme for government had more about climate change than about cutting the deficit. On 14 May, three days after becoming prime minister, Cameron went to the Department of Energy and Climate Change (Decc) to declare his would be “the greenest government ever”. He even appointed himself the department’s “fourth minister”.

Decc officials talk of the “energy trilemma” that faces every secretary of state: keeping the lights on, holding down electricity bills and decarbonising supply. The department must control the source of the problem and devise solutions for it.

The “greenest ever” pledge was repeated in the coalition’s first Queen’s speech. In the first budget, before a year of eye-watering cuts, Decc got one of the best settlements. Yet within a year, the rhetoric had changed completely.

There was a reason why there was so much detail on climate change in the coalition agreement. The Liberal Democrats, always an environmentalist party, were there as a counterweight for the sceptical Tory right. Chris Huhne, the first secretary of state, who had made his pitch for the 2006 and 2007 party leadership contests on a green agenda, was up for the fight.

“His approach to the Treasury was that you can’t negotiate with terrorists,” one ally said later. It was an approach that produced impressive policy gains, most notably in 2011, with the Fourth Carbon budget, which set emissions reduction targets for 2023-27, the next stepping stone to the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions (using 1990 as a baseline).

In the end, the Treasury, long the enemy of all things green, particularly where it means subcontracting revenue raising powers, conceded a deal on the condition that it would be reviewed in 2014. Huhne’s successor, Ed Davey, managed to protect the targets, but only by trading concessions on fracking.

“Chris Huhne was knowledgeable and effective,” said Tim Yeo, the Conservative chair of the cross-party energy and climate change committee of MPs, “but politically it is not smart to upset the Treasury. Decc is a small, junior department. It’s always a first cabinet job for its secretary of state. Any Whitehall negotiation is always an away match.”

Huhne fought to a score draw on the Green Investment Bank, bidding the Treasury up to a capital allocation of ?3bn for hard-to-finance green projects, but conceding the battle over borrowing powers. But it was also on his watch that the disastrous Green Deal was devised.

The deal was at the centre of Huhne’s energy bill in 2011. It was supposed to be a way of encouraging home owners to invest in energy-saving improvements with loans advanced through their energy bills. Overly complex and badly structured, it was a policy that sank, taking with it a great chunk of the coalition’s reputation for being able to make a difference in an area that is increasingly contested.

As the oil price crossed the $100 (?65) a barrel mark, energy bills became the battleground for a wider fight about the value of green policies. In rightwing newspapers, Huhne was accused of masterminding untested initiatives that were hitting families already struggling through a recession.

A planned duty rise on petrol was abandoned in the face of ever increasing prices at the pumps. George Osborne told the Tory party conference in 2011: “We’re not going to save the planet by putting our country out of business.”

The green lobbyist Alastair Harper said: “David Cameron took a deliberate decision to tone the rhetoric down. He decided he didn’t want to talk about [environmental issues] because he didn’t want to make it a cultural issue within the party. The tone changed, but the policy didn’t.”

Rather than blame the real problems of rising fuel prices, an uncompetitive market and a weak regulator, it was the energy companies’ obligation (ECO) – levied on customers to pay for investment in renewables, the Green Deal and to help fuel-poor households – that was accused of over burdening the consumer.

The collateral damage was investor confidence. The more the government’s commitment to long-term decarbonisation of the energy supply was challenged within its own ranks, the less willing the investors were to take the plunge.

When Huhne was forced to resign in 2012 to fight (unsuccessfully) a charge of perverting the course of justice over a speeding penalty, Davey inherited a legacy that was a substantial structure still only half-built. Key projects such as the Green Deal were only just being implemented. To complicate matters, Decc suffers like many other Whitehall departments from a high staff turnover, partly as a result of a deliberate strategy. One of Yeo’s biggest criticisms of the department is the lack of continuity.

“Just when they were most needed, the team of officials that worked on the Energy Act in 2011 was broken up,” he said. The appointment of a new permanent secretary was delayed for months after the prime minister intervened to stop a candidate considered “too green”.

But that wasn’t the only reason why the Green Deal flopped. Environmental campaigners such as Harper bemoan the failure of successive ministers to make energy efficiency a priority in a cool country with a large proportion of old, inefficient housing stock. “We need an efficiency sector in the same way that policy has been directed into building a renewable sector.”

The Green Deal and its new successor, the Green Deal home improvement fund, are both in effect middle-class subsidies, aimed at home owners with enough savings to put cash up front. Poorer families get help with their bills and with efficiency measures through the Affordable Warmth Scheme. Many young families fall between the two extremes and get no incentive at all.

Davey, parachuted into a department that was simultaneously developing complex domestic policies and playing a leading role in multi-player global and EU negotiations, then lost the reliable and experienced minister Charles Hendry. His replacement, a sop to the restive right, was the anti-wind turbine campaigner John Hayes. One ex-cabinet minister, Peter Lilley, was secretly recorded claiming Hayes’s job was to “duff up” Davey.

Davey only managed to see off Hayes by warning Cameron that the outspoken minister was destroying investor confidence. It was a sign Davey was in control. He won an important battle with the Treasury on the Levy Control Framework, getting approval for a peak of ?7.6bn of funding to be available for investment in the renewable sector by 2020. But alongside the efforts to raise investment in renewables, there are the more contentious failures. Davey spent a year playing catch-up on electricity market reform. He lost the fight to get a decarbonisation target into the 2013 Energy Act.

Early on, the Lib Dems were forced to drop their opposition to new nuclear power stations and negotiate what critics regard as the extortionately expensive deal for the new nuclear plant at Hinkley Point C. Carbon capture and storage technology has made no progress, and the new capacity contracts – the guarantee that the lights will stay on – have disappointed campaigners because of the reliance on fossil fuel.

The good news comes from the international successes. Davey loyalists trumpet his role in getting an EU deal on a 40% cut in greenhouse gases by 2030, and praise the part he played in the last-minute deal at Lima that was a step towards success in the forthcoming UN climate change summit in Paris.

And if the transformed global environment, with both China and the US now playing a serious part, is what really makes a difference, then at least the EU is not being left behind. “Ed Davey’s real regret,” said one of his closest allies, “is that he won’t be in Paris in December.”"

We live in a world of growing resource scarcity. The oft-quoted statistic is that by 2050 two thirds of the world’s population will live in areas of water stress or scarcity.

Currently, agriculture is the largest user of water, but as the World Bank’s Thirsty Energy initiative points out, increasing demands for energy will also require increasing use of freshwater. And as populations rise, so will the need for more water and energy for food production. 

Many say we need greater efficiency in order to help manage some of these difficult trade-offs between water, energy and food. Much of this debate is focused on macro-level solutions. However, the International Energy Agency has calculated that 55% of all new electricity supply will need to come from decentralised systems if we are to reach the goal of universal energy access by 2030.

So could decentralised, off-grid solutions hold the key? For many years, influencers have debated whether community-based, off-grid schemes can deliver energy sustainably. But this battle has not yet been won. Recently new lines have been drawn by Bill Gates, who called for centralised, fossil-fuel based electrification to solve energy poverty and SunEdison founder Jigar Shah who responded by putting forward the case for distributed renewable solutions.

While this debates goes on at the policy level, what do experiences on the ground tell us? At Practical Action, we have found that micro hydropower (or microhydro) systems, which produce power from streams and small rivers, provide huge potential for sustainable energy.

For example in Peru, microhydro systems installed in the mid- to late-1990s are still running today. Not only do they provide electricity for light bulbs and other small appliances, they can also supply continuous power for local clinics, allow people to use fridges and run small businesses. We found they reduced household energy expenditure by more than half, and 60% of families said their incomes had increased.



However, there is still unexplored potential for decentralised hydropower. In both Peru and Nepal (where micro-hydro schemes are widespread), there was rarely any deliberate attempt to connect the electricity generated to agricultural systems, or to make use of the channelled water for irrigation. This means missing out on a set of potentially transformational opportunities. Decentralised energy systems can not only improve energy access, but also help to maximise the relationships between water, energy and food, both now and in the future.

More recently, and learning from our experiences, we have been making the connection between agriculture and energy more directly. Together with Oxfam we have been working in Zimbabwe, for example in the Himalaya scheme which uses the electricity generated by the microhydro plant, as well as the channelled water, for much-needed irrigation.

The approach does of course have it’s challenges. Across the schemes we’ve developed in Zimbabwe familiar challenges and trade-offs emerge, particularly with a recent severe two-year drought followed by heavy rains. For example, in Chipendeke in Zimbabwe, initial planning for hydropower failed to fully accommodate existing irrigation needs. As a result during the dry season, there was insufficient water to run both the irrigation and the hydro simultaneously. Eventually the villagers reached a compromise where the microhydro plant was switched off for short periods to allow more water for irrigation.

In Ngarura, there were delays in construction of the microhydro project and farmers lost trust. They continued cultivating the steep river banks, and when the rains came there was heavy siltation of the system. The lesson there was that farmers have to be convinced of the benefit of the scheme in order to preserve the river banks.

Despite these problems, in both cases solutions were reached through dialogue and the community balancing their priorities. It is important not only to focus on the infrastructure for hydropower but also the institutions to support it and that is as much part of increasing resilience as the energy or water itself.

Development organisations can sometimes be rightly accused of being starry-eyed about the potential of community ownership and management. In the case of a microhydro plant this can impose unrealistic burdens, and in the absence of support structures from local technicians, spare parts, and a clear sense of ownership infrastructure can quickly fall into disuse. But the sector has been learning, as research shows. The right systems for decentralised energy production can be created and it can provide a sustainable solution to energy poverty. "

Theresa May to discuss Paris accord with Donald Trump at G20
Anushka Asthana and Peter Walker
Theresa May will raise the issue of climate change with Donald Trump this weekend when the pair meet for the first time since she lost her majority in the general election. They will talk at the G20 summit in Hamburg, which runs on Friday and Saturday.

The two leaders will hold a formal bilateral meeting, at which the prime minister plans to tell the US president she does not believe the Paris climate change agreement needs to be renegotiated.

Trump caused consternation worldwide last month when he confirmed that he wanted to withdraw from the pact.

May was criticised at the time for not signing a letter sent by several European governments condemning the move – though she insisted she had discussed it with him directly.

But a senior government official said the prime minister would be “stressing that the UK remains fully committed to the Paris agreement. She will say that we don’t see any need for renegotiation – we support the Paris agreement because it delivers.”

Related: Hopes of mild climate change dashed by new research

May and Trump are also expected to discuss this week’s North Korean missile test, with the prime minister stressing that it is essential the international community is united in condemnation of North Korea’s actions.

Barry Gardiner, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister dealing with climate change, called for a more robust approach on climate, saying the prime minister should “take President Trump to task” for his announcement that the US will quit the international accord to address dangerous global warming.

Gardiner said: “A Labour prime minister would make clear that the UK stands by the Paris agreement and that America is diminished by the president’s foolish and shortsighted decision to withdraw.”

May and Trump’s last face-to-face meeting was at the G7 in Sicily, in an unscheduled “pull aside” in which Downing street said they “reaffirmed their commitment to increasing trade between the UK and the US, including a post-Brexit trade deal”.

The prime minister was later criticised for failing to sign up to a joined up statement from the G7’s EU leaders – Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Paolo Gentiloni – saying the Paris accord could not be renegotiated.

The trio said: “We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies.”

Downing Street stressed that the UK had responded in a normal way to the situation, and that the other G7 countries, Canada and Japan, had not signed up to the statement either.

Since May’s last meeting with Trump the US president caused anger in the UK by misquoting the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, following the London bridge terror attack last month.

Trump castigated Khan on Twitter, saying the mayor had said there was “no reason to be alarmed” by the attack. Khan had in fact said this about the increased and armed police presence in London after the attack.

Trump had been due to hold a state visit to the UK over the summer, which was set to be dogged by mass protests. However, this appears to have been indefinitely put back, with Trump reportedly telling May he did not want to make the trip if the British public did not support him.

While Downing Street has insisted the plans have not changed, Trump’s arrival was not mentioned in last month’s Queen’s speech, as is normal for state visits, indicating has not been fixed for the two-year period covered by the address."

Angela Merkel and Donald Trump head for clash at G20 summit
Patrick Wintour Diplomatic Editor
A clash between Angela Merkel and Donald Trump appears unavoidable after Germany signalled that it will make climate change, free trade and the management of forced mass global migration the key themes of the G20 summit in Hamburg next week.

The G20 summit brings together the world’s biggest economies, representing 85% of global gross domestic product (GDP), and Merkel’s chosen agenda looks likely to maximise American isolation while attempting to minimise disunity amongst others.

The meeting, which is set to be the scene of large-scale street protests, will also mark the first meeting between Trump and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as world leaders.

Trump has already rowed with Europe once over climate change and refugees at the G7 summit in Italy, and now looks set to repeat the experience in Hamburg but on a bigger stage, as India and China join in the criticism of Washington.

Last week, the new UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, warned the Trump team if the US disengages from too many issues confronting the international community it will be replaced as world leader.

On climate change, Merkel has prepared the ground carefully, hosting in Berlin the two allies she most needs – the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang.

China is the single largest emitter of carbon, and India the third. If they followed America in rejecting the Paris agreement, the whole process would unravel. Both countries have said they will not pull out of the treaty, and will beat their Paris commitments.

Germany insists it is not seeking confrontation at the summit. Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, points out there will be many far more rightwing governments present in Hamburg than Trump, and they will receive far less obloquy from the expected tens of thousands of street protesters.

Nor does he pretend his country wishes to set itself up as a rival to America, saying Germany has got enough responsibilities already. “As German foreign minister, you wake up in the morning with a demand for leadership, and in the evening you go to bed with it,” Gabriel said.

Merkel is reluctant to be cast in the role of leader of western liberal vales, although a poll published last week by Pew Research found Merkel’s favourability ratings on the rise, especially on the left, with an impressive 52% of all Europeans surveyed confident she would “do the right thing in world affairs”.

But the G7, and Trump’s subsequent decision to shun the Paris climate change treaty, clearly left a permanent mark on her, leading to her famous declaration of independence four days later at a Christian Social Union (CSU) rally in a Bavarian beer tent. In remarks seen in the US as marking a new chapter in the trans-European alliance, she said: “The times in which we could completely rely on others are over to a certain extent. That is what I experienced in the last few days. That is why I can only say: We Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands.”

European voters’ decisions to give a commanding parliamentary majority to Emmanuel Macron, and not to provide the same to Theresa May, will have confirmed Merkel’s belief that Europe once again can be master of its own fate.

The fact that the only country Trump will visit in Europe before the G20 is Poland – the bad boy of Europe and its greatest carbon emitter –is symbolic of a president uneasy with Europe’s new confidence. Poland and Trump also both oppose Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline, due to double the amount of gas being sent from Russia to Germany.

On protectionism, Merkel was blunt in speaking to German business this week about her belief in open markets. “We’ll do all we can to get as broad an agreement on this as possible in Hamburg. Given the new American administration that’s not easy, but nonetheless we need to make the effort.”

But Europe’s leaders are not the only ones re-evaluating their relationship with the US. The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, told her parliament last week the fact that the US, under its new administration, “has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership”, means Canada, like other countries, must “set our own clear and sovereign course”.

Australia’s foreign minister, Julie Bishop, in March claimed many regional partners were locked in a “strategic holding pattern”, waiting to see where Trump will go.

Argentina, the next host of the G20, has also told Trump that it has tried isolation and it does not work.

So at the broadest level, the G20 summit will be a first test of whether other leaders can, or indeed want to, escape from America’s shadow.

But it is Merkel’s compact for Africa that most animates her, according to foreign ministers that have seen her recently.

Merkel fears that long term demographic trends mean 100 m Africans could come to Europe driven by climate change, poverty, and Europe is wholly unprepared.

Combating poverty upstream in Africa as a way to stem the mass migrant flow to Europe downstream is her guiding idea. Her specific initiative is to team up African nations which have committed to economic reforms with private investors who would then bring jobs and businesses."

Recalling Michael Gove is an act of environmental vandalism
Ed Davey
Perhaps Theresa May has a sense of mischief after all. Putting Michael Gove in charge of the Department of the Environment is much like putting a wolf in charge of the chicken coop. To say that the Gove pulse is unlikely to race too much faster over environmental concerns would, from my experience of working with him, be an understatement. He probably regards global warming as an excuse to reduce winter fuel payments.

May bringing in her old enemy demonstrates her crippling weakness. This desperate attempt to buy off those who might bring her down may help her own survival for another few months. Sadly, it will do nothing to help the survival of the planet. As an act of environmental vandalism, it sure beats the mischief of her youthful run through a wheat field.

Gove’s appointment is a threat to the British fight against climate change. Uniquely for a cabinet minister, Gove turned the word “expert” into a snarling insult. Truly, Donald Trump would have been proud. The public outcry over the US president’s rejection of the Paris agreement shows us that people have little time for politicians refusing to listen to expert scientists on such a vital issue.

When I was energy and climate change secretary I sat around a cabinet table with Gove, and he couldn’t help playing to the Tory climate-sceptic audience. As education secretary, he tried to ban climate change from the geography curriculum. After an angry exchange of letters with me, he eventually backed down.

On another occasion, he stopped Amber Rudd – my then junior minister – from attending a critical climate change conference under the pretence of needing her for a vote in parliament. The Lima conference Rudd missed laid the groundwork for the Paris agreement, and I attended as secretary of state. However, given the significance of these annual UN talks, the minister for climate change had always attended in the past. For Gove, as chief whip, to hold her back prevented the UK reaching out to many more nations, and shocked everyone involved with the UK delegation. The move was as petty as it was cynical.

Thankfully, Gove will not have primary responsibility for Britain’s climate change efforts, which fall mainly to the energy department. But he will take charge of our environmental and land management policies – including designing a British replacement for farming subsidies – and drawing these up without a genuine commitment to tackling climate change would be a huge mistake. After his promise for ?350m a week extra for the NHS, we wait to see whether he seeks to keep EU farming subsidies.

He could also be a danger on transposing EU environmental regulations into British law. We know he has a natural inclination to reduce regulation. This could endanger efforts to reduce air pollution or protect habitats if he fails to keep the protections on which we rely.

Climate change remains the biggest threat to our civilisation, economy and security – even bigger than Brexit. While it’s Brexit that will be the main focus of all our parliamentary activity over the next few years, this must not come at the cost of our environment.

If the government has any sense, it will see that economic prosperity and jobs flow from investing in the clean economy, and act accordingly. When Brexit bites (costing the Treasury ?59bn), which it certainly will, the public will not be forgiving if an unholy Conservative-DUP alliance has not done everything to boost British jobs and stimulate growth at home.

The appointment of a man who could teach Machiavelli, or even Mandelson, a few tricks reflects badly on May, who has sacrificed the green agenda for her own blue agenda.

I call on Gove to release a clear statement acknowledging climate change is real; that he’ll do everything he can to tackle environmental problems, such as air pollution and flooding; and that, on this at least, he might humbly listen to experts."

The Guardian view on Trump and climate change: galvanising the globe
Editorial
The Paris climate change agreement will survive Donald Trump’s decision to pull out. It was not a surprise, but it is a shock to the deal so painstakingly woven together after years of effort only 18 months ago. It is another indication of US readiness to abandon global leadership, and it is a gift to China, ambitious to be seen as a mature and reliable global player, and already a world leader in renewable energy technology. There will not be immediate consequences for the planet, but the time available for effective action is already perilously short; even the threat of a backward step by the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases could carry serious consequences. Yet it is now clear how soundly the Paris agreement has been built: nearly 150 of the 197 signatories have ratified the deal. Pulling out even as big a part of the edifice as the US will not destroy it. The reaction to President Trump’s decision suggests that just as Brexit has made the rest of the EU come together, so support for the Paris agreement will be reinvigorated. From the immediate public condemnation of the move by Germany, France, Italy and China, and India’s reaffirmation of its commitment, to the Vatican’s description of it as a slap in the face for the pope, it may be that this will galvanise the rest of the world.

There is still a chance that the US will not, in the end, withdraw. The agreement’s built-in time delay means it cannot happen until the next presidential election year, 2020. There are echoes here of an earlier attempt by Republicans to stymie a climate deal. In 2005, George W Bush’s White House refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, and then insisted on a twin-track approach which allowed it to appear concerned while blocking every possible deal. Finally, in Bali in 2007, a Papua New Guinea delegate bellowed at a procrastinating American representative: “If you’re not willing to lead, get out of the way!” Over the next eight years, under pressure of the evidence, the tireless and creative efforts of UN negotiators like Christiana Figueres and the leadership of Barack Obama, who wanted it to be part of his legacy, a deal was devised. The Paris agreement is not perfect, but it is intended to ratchet up slowly to achieve the target of holding global warming to 2C. It establishes a fund to help the countries most affected by climate change and created the confidence that has rapidly accelerated the development of renewable energy sources. No investor would take seriously the risks of restarting US coalmines. The secretary of state and former Exxon boss Rex Tillerson, who barely a fortnight ago signed the Fairbank agreement stressing the threat of global warming to the Arctic, knows that. Ivanka Trump was said to be lobbying business to buy advertising space demanding that her father, the president, change his mind. There has been a furious response from Republicans as well as Democrats, and high-profile resignations by people like the Tesla car developer Elon Musk from presidential advisory councils. One World Trade Center, along with other iconic buildings around the world, has been lit up in green. Michael Bloomberg has said he will personally compensate the UN for the $15m it will lose.

All of that makes Theresa May’s response even more of a disgrace. In this election week, it is worth remembering that she put her relationship with Mr Trump ahead of solidarity with European leaders. That suggests there is a further lesson from the different responses to Mr Trump’s zero-sum view of global affairs. It comes as no surprise to find that the Trump White House is casual with the international organisations that have contributed so much to the west’s peace and prosperity. While no one doubts Mrs May’s commitment to Nato or her desire to stay in as many common European organisations as Brexit allows, she is showing some of the instincts of an isolationist. Like much of her sceptical party, she appears uninterested in climate change. The Tories’ hug-a-husky days are truly over.

?Hopes of EU-US trade agreement put on ice, say Brussels sources
Daniel Boffey in Brussels
The prospect of a revived EU-US trade deal is in “deep freeze”, according to Brussels sources, undermining reports that the EU has been inching ahead of the UK in the race for an arrangement with Washington.

Neither Donald Trump nor European officials raised the possible resumption of talks during the US president’s visit to Brussels last month, EU sources said. Documents relating to the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, known as TTIP, had now been locked in a filing cabinet and the code to open it had been lost, one diplomat joked.

It was reported in April that the UK had fallen behind in the queue to strike a trade deal with Trump’s administration. According to the Times, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, had convinced Trump that talks on a US-EU agreement would be simpler than he thought.

This had led to a “realisation” that a trade deal with the EU – allowing the tariff-free exchange of services and goods – would be more important to US interests than a post-Brexit deal with Theresa May, it was reported.

Talks over TTIP stalled last year amid opposition from within the EU, including sceptical comments from France’s then trade minister and the German vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel.

However, a meeting between Trump the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, two weeks ago offered the EU scant evidence of any such willingness, according to EU sources.

“It didn’t come up,” one EU diplomat said. “It’s maybe not entirely dead but it is in deep freeze”. The source said that the completion of an EU-Japan trade deal was nevertheless imminent, and would provide significant economic gains.

The development may offer Downing Street some fresh hope that the UK stands a better chance of engaging with Washington than Brussels does.

May has appeared less inclined to criticise the White House for its recent policy tacks – including leaving the Paris climate agreement – suggesting that the prime minister believes the UK stands a chance of forging an accord with the US administration if it avoids upsetting the president.

In Brussels, though, there is a high degree of scepticism about the UK’s chances of getting a deal. “Trump would have to be taught what trade means first,” one EU diplomat said.

The source added that it was questionable whether the UK had the expertise to engage with the US administration on a trade deal. “A UK-US trade deal would probably take 10 to 15 years anyway”, the diplomat said.

The UK’s attitude to the coming Brexit negotiations had given EU diplomats little evidence of such a capacity, the source added. “Theresa May keeps saying she the chief negotiator. Is she really going to spend six days a week in Brussels negotiating?

“If it is David Davis, fine. If it is Olly Robins [permanent secretary of the Department for Exiting the European Union] then fine, he knows the files, although maybe less the economic ones. We need to know who we are negotiating with... I don’t think they have a plan.”

The warnings of a freeze in trade talks come despite upbeat comments in April from the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. He said before Trump’s first foreign tour that the US was “open” to resuming negotiations with Brussels.

“Clearly at some point we need to do something with Europe,” Ross said in an interview with the Financial Times. “It seems a little weird that a car being shipped from Mexico to Europe pays no tariff as they have a bilateral [agreement with the EU] and a car being shipped from the US pays the full tariff.”"

Green business needs strong and stable support from the next UK government
Letters
Despite the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement on climate change ( Anger at US as Trump rejects climate accord, 2 June), the global market for low-carbon goods and services is rapidly growing and the UK must make the most of this opportunity. Spurred in particular by major investments in low-carbon technologies by countries such as China, India, Mexico and South Africa, the Paris agreement could open up $23tn (?18tn) worth of opportunities for low-carbon investments in emerging markets between 2016 and 2030. The commitments made by six world leaders at the recent G7 summit and the decision by China and the EU to collaborate more closely on climate change support this trend.

Related: UK needs government backing to unlock billions in green business, says industry

The UK is well placed to benefit. Its low-carbon sector employed 432,000 people and produced a turnover in excess of ?77bn in 2015. The UK’s strengths include manufacturing ultra-low emission vehicles and offshore wind turbines, piloting innovative ideas in energy, water and resource efficiency and providing financial and legal services for clean energy projects worldwide. The focus on developing low-cost, low-carbon infrastructure is gaining momentum across all key economic sectors.

The low-carbon economy could grow from 2% of UK GDP today to 13% by 2050. However, stable policies to grow the UK’s low-carbon market will be essential to turn this potential into reality and ensure our economy remains competitive on the global stage. We therefore call on the new government to put in place ambitious and long-term policies to tackle climate change and improve the state of the environment at the heart of its industrial strategy and vision for the UK."

Abandoning Paris climate deal marks Trump's return to angry populism
Julian Borger in Washington
Donald Trump’s rejection of the Paris climate change treaty is the most emphatic answer to date the question the rest of the world has been asking since January: What does “America First” mean?

“I am elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” the president declared in the Rose Garden, after a jazz group had entertained the invited audience.

Related: Donald Trump confirms US will quit Paris climate agreement

With those words, the US joined Nicaragua and Syria in rejection of an accord signed by 195 states which was voluntary and open to amendment from within.

The UN climate change envoy, Ireland’s former president, Mary Robinson, declared the decision made the US “a rogue state on the international stage”.

To US allies, Trump’s departure is an entirely needless piece of diplomatic and environmental vandalism, performed on live television for ratings.

For Trump’s embattled administration, however, ratings are now all-important to stave off disillusion among his core voters, who needed to hear to more of the combative populist they had warmed to on the campaign trail.

But emphatic does not necessarily mean coherent. On a string of issues, Trump has pulled back from delivering some of the bold unilateralist policies he had used to stir up crowds during the campaign.

He has not dismantled the nuclear deal with Iran, nor has walked out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), and he has opted against moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which would have been seen as a provocation in the Islamic world and beyond.

But Thursday’s climate announcement marked a return to angry populism. It was Trump’s darkest speech since his “American carnage” inaugural address, once more portraying a nation in crisis and facing a global conspiracy against its people. The world was presented as something to fear rather than to aspire to lead.

The battle between continuity and radical departure swings back and forth each day between the self-style populist “disruptors” led by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, and the “traditionalists” brought on since the election to lend gravitas to the presidency, like Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, the national security advisor, HR McMaster and the the defence secretary, James Mattis.

Between these two camps and somewhat above them is the family, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. But their influence is clearly not decisive. On the Paris accord, they leaned heavily towards the traditionalists, and lost.

The perpetual tussle has led to unpredictability. In the run-up to Trump’s turbulent trip to Brussels last week, reporters and diplomats were told by White House officials that he would explicitly re-commit the US to the mutual defence clause of the alliance, article 5. On the day, however, he opted not to, and instead harangued his fellow leaders for not spending enough on enough.

Defence expenditure has been a longstanding irritant in the North Atlantic alliance, but it was the vituperative nature of Trump’s deliver, combined with his petulant body language that convinced the allies they had better look to each other if they wanted a sense of direction.

McMaster and Trump’s economic advisor, Gary Cohn, wrote a commentary earlier this week seeking to sketch out an overarching rationale for Trump foreign policy.

“The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a “global community” but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,” McMaster and Cohn wrote, pointing out that in such an arena, the US had a decisive edge, in “unmatched military, political, economic, cultural and moral strength”.

“Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,” McMaster and Cohn wrote. But in the same piece, they also imply almost the exact opposite: “America First does not mean America alone. It is a commitment to protecting and advancing our vital interests while also fostering cooperation and strengthening relationships with our allies and partners.”

Missing from the argument is an explanation of how those very different ideas can be reconciled. It does not make clear how US show moral strength and foster cooperation, when it approaches foreign policy as ruthless struggle for national supremacy?

There is nothing new in these dilemmas. They have swung the US from engagement to isolation and back for more than a century. The America First slogan was used by isolationists in the run-up to World War II, led by Charles Lindbergh, who present in bluntly racial tones.

The George W Bush administration started out in 2001 by declaring the Kyoto Protocol, the forerunner of the Paris Accord, dead, and by “unsigning” the Rome Statute establishing the international criminal court the following year. It was deeply sceptical of any multilateral endeavour, at least until it became hopelessly mired in Afghanistan and Iraq.

What is new about the Trump administration is its chaotic nature and the undisciplined character of its chief executive. For US allies, trying to follow Washington’s lead over the past four months has been akin to trying to drive in convoy behind a car swerving violently at high speed, as the competing factions inside lunge for the steering wheel.

One by one, Washington’s friends are making the decision to stop trying and chart their own course."

Trump urged to make America great again by embracing green tech
Damian Carrington and Juliette Jowit in London Arthur Neslen in Brussels andTom Phillips in Beijing
Leading climate change experts have urged Donald Trump not to turn his back on the biggest global challenge facing mankind, arguing that he can make America great again – and the world safer – by standing up to global warming and embracing the trillion-dollar green tech revolution.

As new data showed that 2016 was the hottest year on record, scientists, government advisers and people closely involved with global climate talks said it would be self-defeating for Trump to pull the US out of the global Paris climate change deal as he has threatened.

Reversing action on climate change would mean the US gets left behind in the fast-growing, trillion-dollar market for clean energy, transport and infrastructure, experts told the Guardian, with one warning that this course of action would instead “make China great again”.

“The best way to make America great again is by owning the clean technologies of the future,” said Michael Liebreich, who has advised the UN and World Economic Forum on energy. “Not only will this create countless well-paid, fulfilling jobs for Americans, but it will also lock in the US’s geopolitical leadership for another generation.”

“I would say to [Trump], if you want to make China great again, you have to stay the course you have promised,” said John Schellnhuber, a climate expert who has advised Angela Merkel, the pope and the EU.

Lord Stern, a former UK government adviser, added: “If you want to make America great again, building modern, clean and smart infrastructure makes tremendous commercial and national sense. In the longer term, the low-carbon growth story is the only growth story on offer. There is no long-term, high-carbon growth story, because destruction of the environment would reverse growth.”

The Guardian interviewed more than a dozen leading global voices on climate change in the run-up to 24 hours of live, uninterrupted digital coverage, which runs from Thursday morning through to Trump’s inauguration on Friday.

Reporters have investigated countless examples of climate change utterly transforming lives and livelihoods, from Bangladesh to Egypt, west Africa to the south Pacific, even Europe and the United States itself, despite Trump’s repeated claims that it is all a hoax.

The 2016 data released on Wednesday showed that global temperatures have already soared more than 1C since pre-industrial times – halfway to the 2C considered a crucial ceiling under the Paris deal. UN officials said a redoubling of efforts was required, and hoped Trump would be part of that.

“It will be a long journey and only a sense of urgency will get us to the ‘well below 2C target’,” said Patricia Espinosa, head of the United Nations framework convention on climate change, adding she was looking forward to working with Trump “to make the world a better place for the people of the US and for peoples everywhere”.

Trump, who once called global warming “ bullshit ”, appears to have softened his stance a little since his election win, saying there is “some connectivity” between human activity and climate change. However, he also claimed climate action was making US companies uncompetitive.

Key global players have scrambled to shore up the Paris deal before Trump’s inauguration, with China and India both indicating they have no plans to renege on the pact if Trump tries to unravel it. Barack Obama sought to leave a stake in the ground with a $500m payment to a global green fund designed to underpin the Paris agreement.

Along with the US and Russia, the EU, China and India are the leading emitters of greenhouse gases – but they also sense the opportunity of stepping up if America falters.

China is already acknowledged to be leading the world in renewable energy and its president, Xi Jinping, firmly asserted his country’s commitment to climate action at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and said the nation’s green investments were already “paying off”.

China served notice of its ambitious intent earlier this month with an eye-watering $360bn investment earmarked for renewable energy over the next four years. Chinese insiders told the Guardian that a combination of flourishing businesses and terrible smog made climate change a critical issue for Xi.

Zhang Haibin, a professor at Peking University’s school of international studies, said: “President Xi Jinping considers this [a question of] political security.”

The EU environment commissioner, Miguel Arias Canete, said that climate change was “bigger than any one country” and that the EU and China would be at the forefront regardless of what happens in Washington.

“China is demonstrating a strong commitment to implementing the Paris agreement,” he told the Guardian. “EU-China cooperation is therefore needed for a strong political leadership in global climate action.”

In a sign of the centre of international gravity on climate action shifting east, Canete described cooperation with China as “fundamental” to the climate process, and said that bilateral cooperation with China would be strengthened in the next two years.

Later this year, China is planning to open the world’s largest carbon market to enable full-scale national emissions trading by 2020.

Canete said that the EU would co-organise a global conference in 2017 with China and other countries and regions operating carbon pricing schemes – which could collectively cover a quarter of the world’s carbon emissions.

“We will stand by Paris, we will defend Paris, and we will implement Paris,” he said. “The global clean energy transition is here to stay.”

The commission expects a very different type of engagement with Washington after 20 January. Trump has repeatedly called for more fossil fuel exploration and exploitation, and the dismantling of key parts of Obama’s climate legacy.

Obama’s clean power plan may be first in the firing line, but energy-efficient building codes, appliance standards, federal procurement policies and even renewable energy tax credits could also find themselves in the new administration’s crosshairs.

EU officials could at least point to the qualified support for remaining “at the table” of the Paris climate talks, expressed by Trump’s secretary of state pick, Rex Tillerson, in senate hearings last week.

“It is relatively reassuring in the sense that we’re not facing an immediate apocalypse,” one EU source said. “The signals so far are that they won’t be actively destructive.

“But if the US is making every effort to dismantle its climate policy, it is going to set completely the wrong tone for [future] negotiations, and it will take the wind out of the sails of momentum generally.”

Laurence Tubiana, the French climate envoy during the Paris talks, said that distributed leadership had been vital to the deal’s success but that the EU and China would now be first among equals.

“There is no other option, so it has to happen,” she told the Guardian. “The EU and China can count on many actors – cities, companies, regions, even in the US – who are pushing in the same direction, so their leadership will not be lonely.”

Tubiana said Trump would be able to create far more jobs in the buoyant renewable sector than in the moribund coal industry. Others concurred.

“If President Trump wants to deliver greater job security for Americans, he should focus on clean and sustainable industries where the US has a competitive advantage,” said Dame Julia King, an eminent engineer and one of the UK government’s official advisers at the Committee on Climate Change. “Those are the sectors that are set to prosper. He needs to build an economy for 2050, not one for 1950.”

Jim Hansen, the scientist whose 1988 testimony to Congress arguably kick-started the entire movement to combat climate change, said there were grounds for optimism, particularly if a carbon tax emerges as a preferred option for the Trump administration.

“If [Trump] wants to achieve the things that he claimed he would – improving the situation of the common man – the best way he could do this would be a programme of a rising carbon fee with the money distributed to the public.”

Zhang Junjie, an environmental expert from Duke Kunshan University in eastern China, said it was too soon to assess how Trump’s administration might treat climate change even if it appeared that the issue appeared not to be “such a top priority on his agenda”.

“We can’t read his Twitter literally. His policy might be different,” Zhang said."

Donald Trump’s mission? To keep the US in the fossil age
George Monbiot
Make America Wait Again. That is what Donald Trump’s energy policy amounts to. Stop all the clocks, put the technological revolution on hold, ensure that the transition from fossil fuels to clean power is delayed for as long as possible.

Trump is the president that corporate luddites have dreamed of: the man who will let them squeeze every last cent from their oil and coal reserves before they become worthless. They need him because science, technology and people’s demands for a safe and stable world have left them stranded. There is no fair fight that they can win, so their last hope lies with a government that will rig the competition.

To this end, Trump has appointed to his cabinet some of those responsible for a universal crime: inflicted not on particular nations or groups, but on everyone.

Recent research suggests that – if drastic action of the kind envisaged by the Paris agreement on climate change is not taken – ice loss in Antarctica alone could raise sea levels by a metre this century, and by 15 metres in subsequent centuries. Combine this with the melting in Greenland and the thermal expansion of sea water, and you discover that many of the world’s great cities are at existential risk.

The climatic disruption of crucial agricultural zones – in North and Central America, the Middle East, Africa and much of Asia – presents a security threat that could dwarf all others. The civil war in Syria, unless resolute policies are adopted , looks like a glimpse of a possible global future.

Related: 2016 hottest year ever recorded – and scientists say human activity to blame

These are not, if the risks materialise, shifts to which we can adapt. These crises will be bigger than our capacity to respond to them. They could lead to the rapid and radical simplification of society, which means, to put it brutally, the end of civilisations and many of the people they support. If this happens, it will amount to the greatest crime ever committed. And members of Trump’s proposed cabinet are among the leading perpetrators.

In their careers so far, they have championed the fossil fuel industry while contesting the measures intended to prevent climate breakdown. They appear to have considered the need of a few exceedingly rich people to protect their foolish investments for a few more years, weighed it against the benign climatic conditions that have allowed humanity to flourish, and decided that the foolish investments are more important.

By appointing Rex Tillerson, chief executive of the oil company ExxonMobil, as secretary of state, Trump not only assures the fossil economy that it sits next to his heart, he also provides comfort to another supporter: Vladimir Putin. It was Tillerson who brokered the $500bn (?407bn) deal between Exxon and the state-owned Russian company Rosneft to exploit oil reserves in the Arctic. As a result he was presented with the Russian Order of Friendship by Putin.

The deal was stopped under the sanctions the US imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. The probability of these sanctions in their current form surviving a Trump government is, to the nearest decimal place, a snowball’s chance in hell. If Russia did interfere in the US election, it will be handsomely rewarded when the deal goes ahead.

Trump’s nominations for energy secretary and interior secretary are both climate change deniers, who – quite coincidentally – have a long history of sponsorship by the fossil fuel industry. His proposed attorney general, Senator Jeff Sessions, allegedly failed to disclose in his declaration of interests that he leases land to an oil company.

The man nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, has spent much of his working life campaigning against … the Environmental Protection Agency. As the attorney general in Oklahoma, he launched 14 lawsuits against the EPA, seeking, among other aims, to strike down its Clean Power Plan, its limits on the mercury and other heavy metals released by coal plants and its protection of drinking water supplies and wildlife. Thirteen of these suits were said to include as co-parties companies that had contributed to his campaign funds or to political campaign committees affiliated to him.

Trump’s appointments reflect what I call the Pollution Paradox. The more polluting a company is, the more money it must spend on politics to ensure it is not regulated out of existence. Campaign finance therefore comes to be dominated by dirty companies, ensuring that they wield the greatest influence, crowding out their cleaner rivals. Trump’s cabinet is stuffed with people who owe their political careers to filth.

It was once possible to argue, rightly or wrongly, that the human benefits of developing fossil fuel reserves might outweigh the harm. But a combination of more refined climate science, which now presents the risks in stark terms, and the plummeting costs of clean technologies renders this argument as obsolete as a coal-fired power station.

As the US burrows into the past, China is investing massively in renewable energy, electric cars and new battery technologies. The Chinese government claims that this new industrial revolution will generate 13m jobs. This, by contrast to Trump’s promise to create millions of jobs through reanimating coal, at least has a chance of materialising. It is not just that returning to an old technology when better ones are available is difficult; it is also that coal mining has been automated to the extent that it now supports few jobs. Trump’s attempt to revive the fossil era will serve no one but the coal barons.

Understandably, commentators have been seeking glimpses of light in Trump’s position. But there are none. He could not have made it clearer, through his public statements, the Republican platform and his appointments, that he intends to the greatest extent possible to shut down funding for both climate science and clean energy, rip up the Paris agreement, sustain fossil fuel subsidies and annul the laws that protect people and the rest of the world from the impacts of dirty energy.

His candidacy was represented as an insurgency, challenging established power. But his position on climate change reveals what should have been obvious from the beginning: he and his team represent the incumbents, fighting off insurgent technologies and political challenges to moribund business models. They will hold back the tide of change for as long as they can. And then the barrier will burst."

Fossil-fuel CO2 emissions nearly stable for third year in row
Arthur Neslen
Global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels have seen “almost no growth” for a third consecutive year, according to figures released as world leaders begin to arrive in Marrakech for a UN climate summit.

Related: Donald Trump presidency a 'disaster for the planet', warn climate scientists

After zero growth in emissions last year, researchers at the University of East Anglia (UEA) have forecast a rise of just 0.2% for 2016, signalling a break from the average 2.3% year-on-year increases in CO2 output from fossil fuels until 2013. The rise in 2014 was 0.7%.

Growth in emissions has stalled despite global economic growth exceeding 3% a year, and is mainly down to China burning less coal, according to a study in the journal Earth System Science Data.

“This third year of almost no growth in emissions is unprecedented at a time of strong economic growth,” said Professor Corinne Le Quere, the director of UEA’s Tyndall Centre and lead on the global carbon budget analysis. “This is a great help for tackling climate change but it is not enough. Global emissions now need to decrease rapidly, not just stop growing.”

The levelling of fossil-fuel emissions dovetails with the government pledges made at the Paris climate summit last year to limit global temperature rises, but still falls short of the actions needed to contain global warming to the UN target of “well below 2C”.

“If climate negotiators in Marrakech can build momentum for further cuts in emissions, we could be making a serious start to addressing climate change,” Le Quere said.

Several countries are expected to announce new emissions curbs at the Marrakech summit, although off-floor discussion will be dominated by last week’s US election, won by climate-change sceptic Donald Trump.

Trump has disparaged global warming as a Chinese hoax and promised to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement, although that pledge was removed from his official website on Thursday.

The US is the world’s second biggest emitter, responsible for around 16% of the greenhouse gases pumped into the world’s atmosphere.

Climate funding will certainly be another. The US has so far only delivered $500m of a promised $3bn contribution to the Green Climate Fund, which aims to disburse $100bn a year to help poorer countries deal with global warming by 2020.

The EU is the largest contributor to the fund, donating €17.6bn last year, but it is unclear whether it will move to fill any funding shortfall. “It is far too early to say whether there is a possibility, a capacity or the will to step up our climate finance commitment as the ministers have not yet had the chance to discuss this following the US election,” an EU source said.

Much of the official COP22 agenda will be focused on agreeing a rule book to implement the Paris deal. This will have to deal with technical issues such as setting common baselines and methodologies to measure emissions cuts.

Despite the tailing off of emissions growth in polluting industries, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 hit a record high in 2015 and are on track to continue doing so every year until emissions hit near zero.

The Paris agreement itself puts the world on track for a potentially disastrous 3C of global warming, but it also offers hope that this course can be changed by a series of reviews beginning in 2018.

Under the Paris agreement, all governments that have ratified the accord, which includes the US, China, India and the EU, carry an obligation to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That is what scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

Stock-takes based on the latest scientific assessments should follow every five years – with the first scheduled for 2023 – offering a chance for the world to adjust its trajectory towards the agreement’s 1.5C goal.

Liz Gallagher, a senior associate at an environmental thinktank, E3G, said: “The best thing that can come out of this summit would be making 2018 a moment on the map. We need to start the next round of ‘ratcheting up’ and we need to come out of this COP with a demonstration that the process is inevitable and unstoppable and that we are winning, as a message to the likes of Trump.”

Bob Ward, a director at the Economic and Social Research Council’s centre for climate change economics and policy said that while global fossil fuel emissions appeared to have peaked “Donald Trump as president could undermine this achievement if he carries through with his threat to scrap the Obama administration’s clean power plan, and encourages an increase in the use of coal for electricity generation”.

According to the UAE research, China, which is the world’s biggest polluter, accounting for 29% of global carbon dioxide output, saw emissions fall 0.7% in 2015 and they are projected to drop another 0.5% in 2016, though the scientists warn of large uncertainties in the figures.

In the US emissions fell 2.6% in 2015 as the country reduced its coal use while increasing gas and oil consumption, and carbon dioxide is expected to fall 1.7% this year.

But the European Union’s emissions rose 1.4% in 2015, against a backdrop of long term declines in pollution, while another major emitter, India, saw emissions rise 5.2%."

For a man who has only recently started his job, international development minister Nick Hurd seems sure of his priorities.

“Energy Africa makes perfect sense to me,” he says. “In the next few weeks and months we’re going to be shaping what DfID [the Department for International Development] does in the next five, arguably 10 years. But improving access to energy in Africa is my particular focus at the moment.”

After spending four years as minister for civil society under the coalition government, Hurd has been parachuted into the job at DfID to replace Grant Shapps, who resigned in the midst of allegations that bullying in the Tory party had led to the death of one of its activists.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the number of people lacking access to electricity is set to rise
Although his new portfolio covers a range of issues including water, climate change, sanitation, education and health, his immediate priority is to “keep up the momentum” of the Energy Africa campaign launched by Shapps in October.

Hurd has his sights set on the seventh sustainable development goal: universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030. But sub-Saharan Africa is currently 50 years behind, the only region in the world where the number of people denied access to modern forms of energy is set to rise and, based on current trends, predicted to hit the goal by 2080.

Inspired by Barack Obama’s flagship Power Africa programme, Hurd hopes that Energy Africa can make a key difference. Last month the US and UK projects came together to create a new partnership to address specific issues such as the need for shared power across borders, resources for geothermal power, and to boost the number of women participating in Africa’s solar industry.

But unlike Power Africa, which has been catalysing a wide range of renewable energy projects that will connect to the national grid – from a vast solar farm in Rwanda to the first wind power project in Senegal – Energy Africa has a very specific objective: to accelerate off-grid solar power for households using private investment.

Grid investment will only reach 40% of the population and leave more than 500 million people still without electricity access in 2030, according to the Overseas Development Institute. Critics say that the impact of DfID’s campaign will be only “incremental” because the continent needs large-scale infrastructure and while NGOs push decentralisation, Africans want a grid connection.

But it is well known that these incremental changes can create significant new possibilities in the lives of individuals and communities, from lanterns that enable pupils to study at night, to mobile phone chargers, to lights for huts that keep animals safe from predators.

Hurd is adamant about the need and value of off-grid investment. “The question is: what can we do for the 60% now?” he asks. “It strikes a chord with ministers wrestling with energy access in their countries. On-grid is massively important but most of the projections suggest that’s going to take a long time and won’t reach all the population. That’s why Energy Africa is focused on household solar energy. We think there is huge potential in off-grid particularly, because we see this market developing which we think we, with partners, can turbo charge.”

A host of factors have coalesced to create what Hurd describes as a “pivotal moment” for household solar in Africa. In the past six years, the price of panels has dropped by around 70%, making it as cheap as fossil fuels in some areas. The price and quality of battery technologies is also improving fast while the spread of mobile money systems on the continent is making solar an increasingly feasible prospect for the individual householder.

Six countries have signed up to DfID’s Energy Africa campaign. Ministers from Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Somalia were the first to complete an agreement, followed by Ghana, Malawi and Rwanda. Eight other countries have been identified as potential targets, including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Uganda.

The countries were chosen because they were “biting our hand off” says Hurd. “We are responding to demand.”

Working in fragile states is one of DfID’s explicit objectives, partly driven by national security interests. More than half its budget is committed to work in such regions, but implementing clean energy is a challenge in states grappling with terrorism and conflict, such as Nigeria and Somalia.

Problems vary from country to country, but the industry has been held back by a lack of legal and tax structures. The International Finance Corporation is currently working to establish a new set of product standards. DfID say it is its role to work out how to streamline the bureaucracy, and the specific challenges in each country are still being identified.

It’s a different model. It’s not about a huge chunk of public money. It’s a private-sector solution to this challenge
Nick Hurd
Providing electricity at the household level comes with additional challenges. For rural communities miles from a grid connection, energy poverty is entrenched by lack of access to financial systems. Pay-as-you-go schemes offered by mobile phones are changing this, but penetration fluctuates from country to country. DfID hopes that the campaign will be able to support non-bank financial providers to create mobile payment systems. In places where regulation makes it unfeasible, alternatives such as scratch cards will make up the difference.

The campaign is not a “traditional aid programme” says Hurd. Its aim is to galvanise private investment in countries where DfID has formed a partnership with the government. “It’s a different model,” he says. “It’s not about a huge chunk of public money; it’s not a DfID programme as such. It’s a private-sector solution to this challenge.”

But in a debate where creating clean energy is often pitted against economic development, it does not yet seem to be clear how foreign investment galvanised by the campaign will provide substantial jobs for Africans on the ground.

Although DfID has previously given seed funding to mobile money solar companies in the UK and Africa – such as Azuri Technologies and Persistent Energy Ghana – the majority of investors involved in the campaign will be foreign, with many British companies involved.

“We’re not nationalistic about this. We know it’s going to be private-sector led and we want to support entrepreneurs. At the moment most of the businesses are foreign, but over time my hope and expectation is that this will evolve. There is a hell of a lot going on in trying to increase energy access in Africa. My overriding instinct is to keep asking the question: how does this join up?”"

The climate crisis is already here – but no one’s telling us
What is salient is not important. What is important is not salient. The media turns us away from the issues that will determine the course of our lives, and towards topics of brain-melting irrelevance.

This, on current trends, will be the hottest year ever measured. The previous record was set in 2015; the one before in 2014. Fifteen of the 16 warmest years have occurred in the 21st century. Each of the past 14 months has beaten the global monthly temperature record. But you can still hear people repeating the old claim, first proposed by fossil fuel lobbyists, that global warming stopped in 1998.

Arctic sea ice covered a smaller area last winter than in any winter since records began. In Siberia, an anthrax outbreak is raging through the human and reindeer populations because infected corpses locked in permafrost since the last epidemic in 1941 have thawed. India has been hammered by cycles of drought and flood, as withering heat parches the soil and torches glaciers in the Himalayas. Southern and eastern Africa have been pitched into humanitarian emergencies by drought. Wildfires storm across America; coral reefs around the world are bleaching and dying.

Throughout the media, these tragedies are reported as impacts of El Nino: a natural weather oscillation caused by blocks of warm water forming in the Pacific. But the figures show that it accounts for only one-fifth of the global temperature rise. The El Nino phase has now passed, but still the records fall.

Eight months ago in Paris, 177 nations promised to try to ensure the world’s average temperature did not rise by more than 1.5C above the pre-industrial level. Already it has climbed by 1.3C – faster and further than almost anyone predicted. In one respect, the scientists were wrong. They told us to expect a climate crisis in the second half of this century. But it’s already here.

If you blinked you would have missed the reports, but perhaps the most striking aspect of the Democratic platform (the party’s manifesto) approved in Philadelphia last week was its position on climate change. Hillary Clinton’s campaign now promises a national and global mobilisation “ on a scale not seen since World War II ”. She will seek to renegotiate trade deals to protect the living world, to stop oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic, and to ensure the US is “running entirely on clean energy by mid-century”.

Though boasting of his wealth and power, Trump poses as the friend of the common citizen and enemy of corporate capital

There are some crashing contradictions in the platform. To judge by one bizarre paragraph, the Democrats believe they can solve climate change by expanding roads and airports. It boasts about record sales in the car industry and promises to cut “red tape”, which is the term used by corporate lobbyists for the public protections they hate. But where it is good it is very good, reflecting the influence of Bernie Sanders and the nominees he proposed to the drafting committee.

Donald Trump, on the other hand – well, what did you expect? Climate change is a “con-job” and a “hoax” that was “ created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive ”. His manifesto reads like a love letter to the coal industry. Coal, it says, “is an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource”. He will defend the industry by rejecting the Paris agreement, stopping funds for the UN’s climate change work, ditching President Obama’s clean power plan and forbidding the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide.

What’s most alarming about the platform is that Trump didn’t write it: the deranged and contradictory bluster of the Republican party leadership is a collective effort. But at least it clears something up. Though boasting of his great wealth and power, he poses as the friend of the common citizen and the enemy of corporate capital. On every significant issue in the manifesto, corporate capital wins. To read it is to discover how the land lies and where the lies land.

Incidentally, Trump’s executives don’t share his belief that climate change is a hoax. His golf resort in Ireland is seeking permission to build a wall – not to keep out Mexicans, but to defend his business from rising sea levels, erosion and storm surges caused, the application says, by global warming. If you can buy your way out of trouble, who cares about the other 7 billion?

It’s not that the media failed to mention what the two platforms said about humanity’s existential crisis. But the coverage was, for the most part, relegated to footnotes, while the evanescent trivia of the conventions led the bulletins and filled the front pages. There are many levels of bias in the media, but the most important is the bias against relevance.

In Britain, the media largely failed to hold David Cameron to account for his extravagant green promises and shocking record as prime minister. His successor, Theresa May, has made some terrible appointments, but the new climate change minister, Nick Hurd, an adult among her pet buffoons, is an interesting choice as he seems to understand the subject. The basic problem, however, is that the political costs of failure are so low.

To pretend that newspapers and television channels are neutral arbiters of such matters is to ignore their place at the corrupt heart of the establishment. At the US conventions, to give one small example, the Washington Post, the Atlantic and Politico were paid by the American Petroleum Institute to host a series of discussions, at which climate science deniers were represented. The pen might be mightier than the sword, but the purse is mightier than the pen.

Why should we trust multinational corporations to tell us the truth about multinational corporations? And if they cannot properly inform us about the power in which they are embedded, how can they properly inform us about anything?

If humanity fails to prevent climate breakdown, the industry that bears the greatest responsibility is not transport, farming, gas, oil or even coal. All of them can behave as they do, shunting us towards systemic collapse, only with a social licence to operate. The problem begins with the industry that, wittingly or otherwise, grants them this licence: the one for which I work."

Dozens arrested as anti-fossil fuel protesters join Australian coal blockade
Police have arrested 66 people in anti-fossil fuel protests in the Newcastle, home to Australia’s biggest coal export port.

Hundreds of kayaks and boats blocked the entrance to Newcastle harbour in an attempt to stop coal ships from leaving or entering. Another group blocked train tracks used to transport coal on the Sandgate Bridge in the city’s north west.

The protests are part of several anti-fossil fuel actions happening across 12 countries.

Organisers estimate more than 1,000 people attended the protest in Newcastle, which lies approximately 160km north of Sydney, on Sunday, calling for the government to take action on climate change and wind down the use of fossil fuels.

The Break Free From Fossil Fuels group said it was targeting “some of the most iconic and dangerous fossil fuel projects on the face of the planet”.

Newcastle is also one of the world’s biggest coal export ports.

In the early hours of Sunday protesters hung banners from coal ships docked in Newcastle harbour, organisers said.

New South Wales police confirmed 66 arrests, of which 57 were people removed from the train lines over Sandgate bridge, where they had staged a blockade until police broke it up in the early afternoon.

Among the others arrested – who were aged from 22 to 50 – was one woman who locked herself on to a mooring line of a coal carrier, and three women who abseiled from the Stockton bridge.

“Also arrested was a male master of a rigid-hull inflatable boat, used to transport them to the location and a male passenger,” a spokeswoman said.

“The boat has been seized by police. A fourth person has been arrested for operating a drone near a populated area.”

All people arrested were released on bail and will face local court next month.

“On a day when the election is going to be called, it’s sending a signal to our elected leaders that climate change is an election issue,” said 350.org spokesman Campbell Klose.

One protestor, Jesse Kalic, said there were about 70 people taking part in the protest action on the rail track.

“The risk we face by not taking action on climate change is far greater than the risk of sitting on train tracks,” she said.

“I’m a masters student, studying climate change at the University of Melbourne. Everything I’ve learned tells me we need to keep fossil fuels in the ground, to avoid... 2C of global warming.”

Several hundred kayaks and other vessels also took to the water in the shipping channel, blocking access for any coal ships going in or out of Newcastle harbour.

One of the protestors, Nicola Bowskill, said she wanted to see the government act on the commitments made in the Paris agreement: “I’m really worried about climate change and I believe we’ve got to break free … and move towards 100% renewable energy”.

Bowskill is a Newcastle resident and said she would like to see the city become an industry hub for renewable energy.

“Newcastle is built on coal but it doesn’t mean that our future has to be built on coal,” she said. “There is huge potential here.”

Protesters reported a strong police presence, including on the water, but it had remained calm.

The flotilla is an annual event, and “gets bigger every year” Bowskill said.

In 2014 it was joined by a large contingent of people from the Pacific Islands, who sought to draw attention to the impact climate change was already having on their countries.

The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, who attended the Sunday protest, and said the Coalition government was holding Australia back from making the transition to “a new 21st century clean economy”.

“We stand as Greens with the community on the first day of an election campaign, where you’ll see the two old parties, standing with vested interests saying let’s continue to dig coal out of the ground, to pollute the atmosphere, to make dangerous global warming worse, to lose the Great Barrier Reef, to lose that precious wilderness we all so dearly love, and to hold us back from making that transition that we as a country so desperately need to make.”

Di Natale said the Greens had never been in better shape for an election campaign."

UK support for fracking hits new low
Public support for fracking in the UK has fallen to a new low, according to government polling, at the same time as backing for renewable energy has hit a record high.

The survey, which is repeated every few months, shows that public enthusiasm for the controversial energy extraction method has fallen steadily in the past two years while opposition to it has risen dramatically.

The government has consistently advocated shale gas as a future home grown energy source – no commercial fracking wells are currently operating in the UK – while at the same time cutting subsidies for solar and wind power.

Just 19% of people back exploration for shale gas in t he latest edition of the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s long-running public attitudes tracker, down from a high of 29% two years ago. The percentage against has risen to a new high of 31%, while the proportion neither for or against has remained largely stable, at 46%.

The Decc polling, published on Thursday, showed a jump in support for renewable power to a new high of 81%, with only 4% opposing it. Backing for renewables has remained steadily high at 75-80% in recent years.

The news follows a protest by actor and anti-fracking campaigner Emma Thompson who broke an injunction to film a mock Great British Bake-Off film with Greenpeace on shale gas explorer Cuadrilla’s site in Lancashire. The stunt prompted the farmer who owned the land to drive-by in his tractor spreading slurry close to the filming.

The next big planning decision on fracking comes on 20 May, when North Yorkshire county council will decide whether to approve an application by Third Energy to frack at Kirby Misperton. Cuadrilla meanwhile is appealing against a rejection by Lancashire county council last summer.

A Decc spokesman said: “These findings show that half of the people asked still don’t have a view on fracking, but more importantly that the vast majority (88%) said that they do not know a lot about it. This is exactly why we want people to have access to all the facts so they can see past the myths and understand the benefits which include greater energy security, more jobs and growth.”

Ken Cronin, chief executive of Ukoog, the trade body that represents the shale industry, said: “This research shows that two thirds of people are concerned that we cannot heat ourselves and keep the lights on, and nearly half are worried that we are too dependent on gas imports from abroad.

“The solution is to source energy from the ground beneath our feet and the industry must continue its efforts to ensure that factual evidence based information is provided to the public rather than scaremongering and myths.”

Statistics published by the government today also show that there is now 9.5GW of solar power installed in the UK, up by nearly a fifth on last year. Around half is in the form of big solar farms (greater than 5MW) which ministers such as environment secretary, Liz Truss, have attacked and undercut with subsidy changes.

Juliet Davenport OBE, chief executive of green energy company Good Energy said: “The message from the British public is loud and clear. 81% of us back renewables for our energy – people want to see a transition to a renewable future here in the UK.”

Last year’s historic climate agreement in Paris – and the recent signing of the deal – may also have given a small fillip to public concern on climate change, which was up slightly on earlier polling, from 66% previously to 70% now."

Climate change politics is blinding us to the devastating effects of dirty air
John Vidal
It is the greatest environmental hazard of the age. Nothing focuses our concern for the future more, divides rich and poor, exercises science, business, politicians, old and young. It is an existential threat, a generational battle. All political and financial resources must be concentrated on stopping climate change.

But now that governments have signed up to the unambitious Paris climate agreement and pledged to try to limit greenhouse gas emissions, we must ask whether we have lost sight of everything else. Is the environment just about carbon and parts per million of gases in the atmosphere? What about the environment that we can smell, see and touch today?

For 20 years or more concerns about nuclear waste, food production, the quality of river water, the health of our soils and seas, the fate of our forests, the impact of road-building and many other important ecological issues have been steadily marginalised, starved of resources or pushed off the agenda by climate change.

Climate has become for government an excuse to build nuclear power and ditch other green policies. Money for biodiversity has been slashed, planning laws revoked, pollution and waste controls weakened and sustainable development policies rejected. Most popular and ministerial attention has been focused on energy companies and big carbon polluters, and the wider environment has visibly deteriorated. Seeing trees as sticks of carbon, air as gas, or forests as sinks is abstract, esoteric and emotionally stultifying.

Related: Scientists: air pollution led to more than 5.5 million premature deaths in 2013

Most heinous of all the sins of emissions is what has happened to our air quality since climate change climbed the political agenda 20 years ago. No government wants us to know that far more people will suffer grievous illnesses and will die from the filthy air shrouding our cities than from any warming of the atmosphere in the next 30 years. Climate change may give us a glimpse of the terrifying future we are heading towards if we don’t change our ways, but toxic air is already here, and killing us in ever greater numbers.

New estimates from the Global Burden of Disease project and the World Health Organisation state that between 5.5 and 7 million people die from air pollution every year. That’s more than die from malaria and HIV/Aids put together; more than the population of Scotland. In the next 10 years we can expect as many people to die from breathing poisonous air as were killed in the second world war.

Most of those deaths will be in China and India which, in the name of extreme poverty eradication, have been transforming their cities and are now having to pay for a health crisis of their own making. But we in rich countries do not have the same excuses. Our industries and governments have known for well over a century the health effects of polluted air. Yet they have fought in Europe to be allowed to continue polluting, and people have been encouraged to switch to diesel and more polluting fuels because they emit less CO 2.

In Britain, 29,000 people die a year from breathing in particles of unburned carbon and construction dust, and an estimated 23,500 more as a result of nitrogen dioxide. To condone these deaths is unforgivable; to actively seek to carry on polluting is like declaring war on the public. It’s saying, “We know that the whole of Christchurch or half the city of Worcester will be asphyxiated next year, but there is nothing we think we should do about it.”

It’s a case of looking after the green pennies while the green pounds take care of themselves

But those 50,000 or more deaths a year are just the tip of the iceberg, hiding hospital wards full of people with heart disease, cancers and respiratory and lung problems caused by lifetimes spent breathing toxic air. No one counts the heartbreak when parents die young, or when children are unable to breathe properly or when Granny develops dementia – which is now linked to air pollution too.

Nor does government want us to tell us how much air pollution really costs. This is reckoned by the European environment agency to be over ?10bn a year in damage to people’s health, buildings, soil and water. That is dozens of new hospitals and schools, thousands of extra nurses and teachers, and enough left over to protect most of Britain’s premier conservation sites.

After 20 years of battling to get government to take the climate seriously, we must wake up to the fact that the very air we breathe is killing us and making us bankrupt, yet governments are deliberately making the situation worse. Despite the Volkswagen scandal – the German car giant admitted that it cheated emissions tests in the US – new pollution limits for diesel cars have been delayed until 2019.

Related: Air pollution: a dark cloud of filth poisons the world’s cities

On the drawing board in Britain are a new runway and hundreds of thousands more planes every year in the southeast, a massive national road-building programme, several new road crossings for east London taking air pollution into the heart of some of the poorest areas, the ?50bn HS2 rail line, fracking, giant infrastructure projects from nuclear power stations and new ports. All will add to air pollution and to climate emissions.

The government has developed tunnel vision. Because it sees environmental problems as many separate issues, it does not understand the links between them and the benefits of addressing them together. Yet the science shows that if air pollution is addressed, there will be a significant decrease in climate emissions. Restoring peat bogs and investing in conservation will not only improve biodiversity, reduce flooding and make for a healthier environment, it will also reduce greenhouse gases.

We have been distracted by climate change and have let governments dictate the agenda. Now we must return to basics, and address all those issues that have been conveniently dropped. Who will get angry about the degradation of water quality, the plague of plastic in our seas? Mining? What about computer and smart phone waste? Litter? Population control? Endangered species? Unless we address mass consumption – the root of our environmental crisis – climate change will not only worsen, we will be left with a degraded world.

Rather than solely trying to tackle the vast problem of climate change, we must address all the many factors which make it worse. It’s a case of looking after the green pennies and letting the green pounds take care of themselves."

In numbers: UK opposition set to scupper EU renewable energy target
Fiona Harvey
Negotiations over landmark targets for greenhouse gas emissions in Europe were continuing last night, hours before their planned publication today. At stake is whether the EU opts for a 35% or 40% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 1990 levels, and whether a firm target is set for renewable energy.

The UK government strongly opposes a target for renewable energy generation, and its opposition has led to the impasse.

The European commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, is now poised to intervene in the row, potentially ditching plans for a renewable energy target in order to seal a deal on emissions.

The plan for a 40% cut in emissions has been in the works for two years. Studies have shown the EU could meet the target without economic difficulties.

At least five commissioners are still in favour of an emissions reduction of only 35%. But as the biggest economies in the EU - including Germany, France and the UK - are all agreed that the 40% target should be accepted, the likelihood is it will go ahead. The bloc is on track to exceed its current target of cutting emissions by 20% on 1990 levels, by 2020, and will have probably cut emissions by 25% by then.

The main row is now over the renewables part of the deal - backed by larger member states like Germany and France but which could be watered down or dropped by Barroso to broker a compromise.

Governments have committed to publish pledges within the next year on their greenhouse gas emissions cuts beyond 2020, in preparation for a global conference on climate change in Paris in 2015. In Paris governments are expected to forge a fresh global agreement, binding developed and developing countries.

The commission plans have hit a stalemate in part through the UK's insistence of no renewable energy target for 2030.

The current EU targets include a goal of producing a fifth of energy from renewable sources by 2020, an aim credited with assisting the substantial growth in clean energy across the bloc. Many countries want a similar - but more stringent - goal for the 2030 climate and energy package.

Ed Davey, the energy secretary, has claimed that his opposition to a 2030 renewables goal was ""getting traction"" among other member states, although he could only name Spain.

Green MEPs and environmental campaigners are arguing for a much stronger target on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a strong renewable energy goal.

Extreme weather, human error and why the world floods
Hein Thi Tran’s house in southern Vietnam floods several times a year. When she and her husband built it 15 years ago in Number 1 Village, Khanh Hoi, it was protected from the sea by a low dyke. But the land is slowly tilting, the storms in the gulf of Thailand seem to get stronger, and the village’s concrete and rock barrier is now regularly topped by waves. She is helpless, she says.

Number 1 village is a slow-motion crash. The seawater that intrudes on the community’s paddy fields from the tidal surges makes it impossible to grow rice, water supplies are becoming saltier and, little by little, the village is becoming uninhabitable. Hein Thi Tran can just about live with the waves and erosion now, but in a generation or two, scientists say, much of this part of the Mekong delta may have returned to the sea.

The village is being killed by one sort of flood but, paradoxically, it and thousands of others in the Mekong delta have always survived because of another. The summer monsoon sees south-east Asia’s rivers carry fine silt and nutrients down from the Himalayas to be deposited on their fields. The pattern of planting after flooding is as old as farming itself, and without benign annual floods, millions of the world’s small farmers, who cannot use irrigation, would go hungry.

Like Hein Thi Tran, much of the world is witnessing unusual flooding. Flash floods, rising fast after heavy rains, have this year torn through parts of Israel, the French Riviera and Hawaii. River flooding has inundated great areas of cities, including Saigon, Sochi, Tbilisi, Accra and Manila, that never used to flood. Heatwaves and droughts in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Africa have been followed by unusually intense rains, swamping vast areas. Many, such as those that inundated northern Chile in March and that devastated Malawi in January, forcing 150,000 people to move, were seen as one in 100- or even 500-year events.

Gideon Mendel, the South African photographer who has taken these pictures, started documenting floods in 2007, when a series of summer downpours led to much of mid- and northern Britain being under water. Within weeks, 30 million people in India, Bangladesh and Nepal had to escape floods that were much deeper than usual. The two were not comparable, but the idea of making portraits of flood-affected people returning home was born. Since then, Mendel has taken his waders to Haiti, Pakistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, South Carolina and Kashmir.

Mendel, whose work crosses documentary and art, says he makes no distinction between people caught in “normal” or unusual floods, but is aware that extreme weather has become more common. Wherever he goes, people tell him the rivers have reached their highest ever levels.

Mendel says he was struck by the “shared vulnerability” of flood victims. “Life is suddenly turned upside down and normality is suspended. I often follow my subjects as they return home through deep waters, and work with them to create an intimate image there. Though their poses may be conventional, their environment is disconcertingly altered. Often, they’re angry about their circumstances or the inadequate response from the authorities. Many want the world to know what has happened to them.” Floods, Mendel says, are now universal, affecting rich and poor, high and low land, cities and countryside.

But Mendel works on other levels, too. The flood is an ancient myth in hundreds of cultures: similar stories of a destructive force of nature that renders humans powerless have been passed down among Indigenous Australians, Inuits, Cheyennes, Lithuanians, Celts, Assyrians, Zoroastrians, Egyptians, Christians, Chinese and others. Most cultures have a deep sense that they once were, or will be, drowned; the theme of waters rising and endless rains leading to disaster is widespread.

These days, man is more likely to blame man than the gods, and much of the damage done is clearly a consequence of foolish human actions. Coastlines naturally erode and rivers have always flooded, so if you build houses on a cliff or flood plain, you can expect them one day to end up in the drink. If you strip the hillsides of forests, water will run off faster and lead to flash floods. If you do not dredge rivers, silt will build up and water may break the banks. Damming rivers, meddling with natural drainage systems and paving over land all increase the risk of local flood damage.

But the sense of global forces at work is also a powerful story for today. The consensus of science is that, as greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase, so will temperatures and sea levels, and extreme floods will become more likely and more frequent. We do not know if there are more floods today, or if more rain falls than before, but there is evidence that some rains are heavier than they were and more people are being affected by floods.

Looking ahead just 50 years, scientists expect low-lying Pacific islands and atolls to become uninhabitable. It will be harder to grow food on the great, populous flood plains of countries such as Egypt and Vietnam. Vast coastal cities such as Lagos will be at greater risk of major flooding; millions of people in Bangladesh will have to move.

Much of that is in the future, but for the next 12 months the risk of flooding is greater than ever, as the naturally occurring phenomenon known as El Nino gathers pace. This sees equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures rise and extreme storms, droughts and floods occur around the world. Already it is being blamed for a drought in Somalia and the Horn of Africa, and for vast fires in Brazilian and Indonesian forests. Pacific nations are expecting their most extreme weather in decades, while California could see its long drought end in violent rainstorms and floods.

In two weeks, diplomats from 195 countries will meet in Paris to negotiate a new global agreement to reduce climate emissions, and so reduce the risk of unusual flooding. Unless temperatures are held to a 1.5-2C increase worldwide, scientists warn, the waters will inevitably rise. In which case, Mendel may have to keep putting on his waders."

Yes, the Paris climate change conference can save the planet
“The deal’s dead.” These were the words of my chief negotiator, approximately six years ago, in the middle of the night in the final hours of the sleep-deprived Copenhagen summit. I was standing in my bedroom as I took his call, about to go to bed for the first time in 36 hours. Thanks to the efforts of a number of countries into the night and the next day, it turned out the deal wasn’t quite dead, and something did survive.

Related: Ed Miliband urges UK to enshrine zero carbon emissions target in law

But in truth, it is what has happened in the years after Copenhagen that made it not quite the disaster it appeared at the time. Slowly, steadily, the unwieldy, spatchcock UN process has rumbled on. Lessons have been learned from that chaotic episode. The idea that we should build an agreement bottom-up with countries making individual pledges, first conceived at Copenhagen, has become more serious, and every big emitter has put one forward.

And now we approach next week’s Paris climate talks, the most important summit since Copenhagen, in a significantly better place than we feared back in 2009. However, we are not where we need to be.

The science is even more unequivocal than it was six years ago. Just to take one example, 2015 looks like being the hottest year on record by some distance. We sometimes talk about the need to avoid dangerous warming of the planet as if it is a theoretical idea, but its effects are already here, with approaching 1 degree of warming so far.

On the other side of the ledger, technology has thrown us a lifeline. The costs of wind and solar energy have come down far quicker than anyone dreamed of. The constructive side of human ingenuity is holding its own in the fight against its destructive side. And it is now demonstrably the case that the fight against climate change can be job-creating, not destroying, according to the Confederation of British Industry and many others.



And what about political will? Climate change seems less politically fashionable as an issue. But China and the United States have moved forward a long way from where they were at Copenhagen.

We have moved from a world where everyone said it was someone else’s problem, to one where everyone knows this can be only be solved collectively. We are not in a world of business as usual.

That’s the good news. And in many senses the Paris summit looks set to represent success: every major country taking real action to reduce emissions, a substantially different path from where we would be without that action. Paris will also repeat the international commitment made at Copenhagen to limit warming to 2 degrees.

But the bad news is that the pledges will still be short of what is needed. In reality, the commitments for 2030 would take us towards something like a 3-degree world. That would mean higher temperatures than at any time in the last three million years, with potentially dramatic effects of intense heatwaves, flooding and climate refugees across the world.

So what can be done? Just like at Copenhagen, what matters as much as Paris is what happens afterwards. That is why countries are rightly seeking to build an upwards ratchet mechanism into the agreement. If these pledges are the start, not the final word – a prelude to greater ambition – then we can still avoid the most dangerous effects of global warming.

What does this mean for Britain? The last Labour government introduced the Climate Change Act, with all-party support for an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 – the first country in the world to legislate for such deep, long-term cuts. It is essential we remain on track for this goal, including making the right decisions about the period to 2030 which will face the government in the coming months.

But what the science now tells us is that we will need to go further and see a complete end to the accumulation of additional greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The world will need to move to zero emissions at some time in the second half of the century, as President Obama and the other G7 leaders, including David Cameron, have rightly acknowledged. A point will come when the total carbon budget for the world will simply be used up.

Paris must be the start of a journey of the whole world towards this goal

And here is the relevance as far as Paris is concerned: every excess tonne of carbon we emit between now and 2030 brings the date when we need to get to “net zero” emissions forward – the point at which any remaining emissions are balanced out by the capturing of carbon.

Is zero emissions even practical, and can it be done without closing down our economy? The answer to both questions is a strong yes. Indeed, top business leaders such as Ratan Tata as well as Paul Polman of Unilever have recently called on world leaders to adopt a zero emissions goal in Paris.

So how can it be done in the UK? It is about a 100% clean energy supply. It is about making our energy system more efficient and productive. It is about the right infrastructure. And, to cancel out residual emissions from agriculture and industry, it is about capturing carbon from the atmosphere, for example through reforestation and by the use of carbon capture and storage technology.

Already cities and companies are adopting the zero emissions goal. The right step now would be for Britain to become the first major country to enshrine net zero emissions in law, with the date determined by advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change.

This would be consistent with the government’s support for zero emissions at G7 level and would show our determination to face up to this existential challenge. It will provide an essential framework for business and government so that we make the right decisions now on key energy and infrastructure issues. And it will inspire the inventors, engineers and businesses that can deliver on this challenge.

From my conversations with people across the House of Commons, including the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, Caroline Lucas of the Greens and Conservatives such as Nick Hurd and Graham Stuart (chair of Globe, the international parliamentarians group on climate change), it is clear there is cross-party support.

Paris must be the start of a journey of the whole world towards this goal. And far from this commitment holding Britain back, we can be a leader again on climate change. Leadership which does not mean harm to our economy, but will put us ahead in the race for the new jobs, businesses and advantages of this new world.

I hope the government will support this initiative. We can build an alliance, put aside our party differences as we have before, and seize this moment.

Guardian-167.txt,"Leading Article: Climate change: Smell the coffee while you can
The members of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are purveyors of doom. Their report, looking at the impact on the global way of life of increases in average temperatures of 2C or more over the pre-industrial average, is no easy read. But after the past few months of weather - floods in the UK, drought in California and extreme blizzards in New York - its message will only be disregarded by the most sceptical of sceptics (stand up Tony Abbott, prime minister of Australia). Climate change, the panel warns, will bring at the very least many more extreme weather events. It will probably threaten food security and it will certainly influence what can be grown where. It is a careful, nuanced attempt to wake people up to the news that quite soon they won't be able to smell the coffee because it will have become a rare and costly luxury.

In our interview this weekend, Ed Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, insisted that the coalition's climate activists had won the day. Whatever David Cameron was reported as saying about green crap, regardless of chancellor George Osborne's reluctance for Britain to stick its neck out, the 2008 Climate Change Act's ambitious targets were on course. It is, however, very much easier to will the ends than it is to accept the means. That political truism was illustrated recently in an innovative series of day-long sessions run by the DECC which challenged a self-selected audience to consider emissions-cutting options available in their own city. The results confirmed that, even though it was the most effective answer, there was a definite aversion to risking economic growth. Even allowing for some forceful criticisms of the options available (not enough nuclear, for example) in the design of the model - it is open for anyone to try online - it was unmistakable evidence of the political challenge ahead.

Successive governments have demonstrated some ways of trying to influence behaviour that hardly help at all. The least difficult way of reducing emissions is cutting demand, and the best way of doing that is to improve insulation so that homes can be heated for less. But the green deal that the coalition introduced has in practice proved so complex to understand, and carries the risk of becoming so burdensome, that take-up has barely reached the hundreds. The other leg of the policy, the potentially transformative energy companies obligation, a mix of green and social levies, had after a year significantly increased the number of homes with wall and roof insulation, but then in December the government rowed back on the obligation so that energy companies could be persuaded to ease up on price increases. Meanwhile, incentives designed to encourage the use of renewables like solar panels came and went with disincentivising unpredictability, damaging confidence among both suppliers and consumers.

Next month the IPCC, having reassessed the science and evaluated impacts, will publish the third and final part of its septennial review, the actions it believes are necessary to adapt to and, as far as possible, to avert climate change. UK politicians will have to consider what and how to implement them in the context of a shaky economic recovery and - because of the confused and uncertain message from governments over the past 20 years - a serious challenge to energy security. Perhaps the big lesson of recent months is that increasing the price of all forms of energy as a matter of policy to reduce demand is not a sustainable option. In some parts of the country, driving is unavoidable. For too many households, the amount of energy they consume is already at the barest minimum and price rises are simply unaffordable. Automatic price escalation is not an appropriate part of the mix of strategies for any government. On the other hand, some unpalatable interim measures may have to be accepted. They definitely include nuclear, and they may have to include fracking too. That will be much easier if there is both some consensus about objectives and a genuinely open debate about how to achieve them.

As far as I can establish, she's the first sitting MP to be prosecuted over a matter of principle since a Labour member refused to pay the poll tax 25 years ago - and she hasn't even been in the Commons for a full term yet. But her reason for risking arrest is exactly the same as the reason she ran for election: she is frightened that we're heading for environmental Armageddon. It's not exactly a reason to be cheerful - and we meet in her Brighton constituency this week just as air pollution began swaddling the country, only hours after the latestÊIPCCÊreport warned that climate change is already wreaking havoc on the planet, causing heatwaves and floods. But if she was relentlessly cheerful last time round, this time she's practically Pollyannaish.
Lucas must wait until 17 April for her trial to conclude, when she will discover whether magistrates find her guilty or not of causing an obstruction during an anti-fracking protest last summer in Balcombe - so there are some legal constraints on what she can say now.
But the more striking constraints are political, and she's stuck with them, regardless of the verdict. As the country's first Green party MP, Lucas cannot afford to say that voters will have to forego some luxuries to combat climate change, because turkeys don't vote for Christmas. She can't acknowledge that Brighton's Green-led council may well have muffed up her re-election chances by making some howlingly unpopular mistakes. ""Um, it's maybe made it a bit more challenging."" She can't risk telling us bluntly that we're losing the fight against climate change, because then everyone would give up trying. And for obvious reasons, she can't say she was glad that so many of us spent the winter under water. ""But I can say that I hope it will have been a wake-up call."" What Lucas has to be is resolutely optimistic - and she is, doggedly, with a sort of heroic determination.
Why she is on trial is still a puzzle to Lucas. She and other protesters had been sitting on a small off-road driveway in Balcombe for five hours last August, and were talking about leaving, when the police decided to arrest them. ""Another 15 minutes and we'd probably all have been gone."" So she is angry about that, but glad to be on trial, ""to the extent that the coverage can be about fracking. I was pleased about the protest overall, in the sense that it did put the spotlight again on fracking. If you look at opinion polls before and after that summer of protest, the numbers against fracking were much higher by the end, so I think it really raised awareness."" A local councillor told her that when the planning permission for Cuadrilla first went through in Balcombe, they didn't really know what fracking was, ""And it felt really important to make sure that could never be a reason again.""
For Lucas, the big problem with fracking has nothing to do with the risk that it will cause earthquakes, contaminate the water table or pollute the soil. In fact, she thinks it possible that stringent regulations could minimise those risks. ""It's not that fracking itself is necessarily worse than ordinary gas extraction. It's the fact that we're just about to put into place a whole new infrastructure for a whole new fossil-fuel industry, at exactly the time when we need to be reducing our emissions."" The problem, in other words, is climate change.
Some environmentalists argue that shale gas is the obvious answer to our energy needs, until we've worked out how to power the country with renewables. Lucas accepts that we do need gas to tide us over, ""but I would prefer to keep importing it from Norway, for example, because it will be easier to turn that tap off than it would be to dismantle an entire new industry that we had deliberately incentivised. That's why Balcombe felt so important, because it is literally on the frontline.""
It is a total myth, she insists, that fracking shale gas would bring down our energy prices. It has in the US, but she says any shale gas fracked in the UK would have no impact on our heating bills, and wouldn't even be used in this country, because we are locked into European energy prices. ""What will reduce prices is a significant investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency. Just exactly as the price of gas is going up, the price of renewables is coming down, and that's why there is such a fierce battle going on in places like the department of energy. I don't think we should be naive about this. There is a massive battle of vested interests going on, because the fossil fuel companies can see the writing on the wall - they can see that quite soon those renewable sources are going to be cheaper, and that is why we've had such a fightback from the nuclear industry, and such a fightback from companies like Cuadrilla, who absolutely don't want to see that.""
When anyone talks about renewable energy I confess my spirits sag. The government's much-hyped Green Deal has been a disappointment for most homeowners, who did the sums and decided they couldn't afford to make their homes more environmentally friendly after all. I'm one of them, and had got the impression that renewables were proving trickier to develop than hoped. This week it emerged that David Cameron wants to stop any more onshore wind farms being built, and may even pledge to dismantle some in next year's manifesto. Many Tory voters may conclude that if even a government this committed to renewable energy can't make it work, then clearly it's just not possible?
""There is just such a cognitive dissonance - I suppose hypocrisy is a better way of putting it - between what the government says, and what it does. What evidence do you have, beyond the rhetoric, that David Cameron is remotely interested in the green agenda? He's got Owen Paterson as his environment secretary, for heavens' sake, who doesn't even think that climate change is a problem! Everyone can look back on David Cameron hugging a husky and see it for the photo opportunity that it was. It was a very clever way of detoxifying the Tory brand at the time. To talk about closing wind farms in this of all weeks, the very week of the IPPC report, I think shows the Tories in their true colours, and just shows that 'Vote blue, get green' meant nothing. The government seems to have an ideological opposition to renewable energy.""
Even more revealing, Lucas thinks, is the news this week that the government intends to alter the law of trespass, to allow shale gas to be fracked underneath private land even without the owner's permission. ""The government obviously feels that it is not going to be able to win the argument, so it's going to take away people's right to decide what happens under their own homes. And this was a government that came to power championing localism!""
How does she explain it? ""The only answer I have is that the fossil fuel companies have a direct line to government."" More than 50 energy company employees have been seconded to the government free of charge, and dozens of them to the department of energy and climate change. ""They're not doing that out of the goodness of their hearts. They're doing it because they want to shape the kind of policy that comes out of it - and frankly they're doing a rather good job. I cannot come up with another answer for why government would look evidence in the face and turn its back on it.""
When the evidence on climate change is as bleak as it looks in the latestÊIPCCÊreport, Lucas doesn't blame the public for wanting to look away in despair. We've been readingÊIPCCÊreports for quarter of a century - and she admits that ""essentially it's been the same story for 25 years. Increasingly, we are recognising that the science is not what's going to move this. To me the really interesting thing about climate change right now is less about the science and much more about psychology. I think the green movement has learned the hard way that handing out small print leaflets saying 'If we don't change soon then we're all doomed' is not an effective way of getting people to change. So I think there's a much greater emphasis now within the Green party and the green movement about talking about the positives.""
Her favourite cartoon shows a lecturer giving a presentation about what a low-emissions society would look like - sustainability, more livable cities, cleaner air, healthier kids etc - and an audience member asking, 'But what if climate change is a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?' ""I'm a great believer in needing things that give us some hope,"" Lucas smiles. ""With a positive vision of the benefits then I think we'll have a much better chance of bringing people with us.""
She is probably right. But the imperative of positivity makes it hard to know exactly what she thinks. She smiles an awful lot, but would have to be a saint to feel this permanently cheerful in private, so I try to guess how she really feels by timing the pauses that often preface her smiley answers. After four years in parliament, I ask if she feels more or less optimistic that politicians will do what is necessary to combat climate change - and I count more than six seconds of silence before her reply.
""I suppose I get a sense that we can build coalitions, and that with enough political will, things can change. That's been quite interesting to see up-front."" There has been some great collaborative work between her party and the trade unions, she goes on hopefully. But when pressed, it transpires that Ed Miliband has had a grand total of two meetings with Lucas since she was elected - and Cameron has not spoken to her once. She has been staggered by the lack of legislative scrutiny in Westminster, and by the stunning inefficiency of the entire system. ""Parliamentary reform has gone right up my list of priorities,"" she grins. For 12 years before her election to the Commons, Lucas was an MEP, ""and I never thought I would say this, but in some respects the European parliament is more efficient than Westminster"".
She must have had moments when she's questioned the point of her being there at all. ""Um . . . No, I haven't thought that, because it's so important that the Greens have a place. We've had much more coverage, it's been an amplifier. And I can take a position that helps shift the other parties. I see my role very much as being there to hold their feet to the fire. It feels important, and that matters. I didn't do this because I thought it was fun,"" she smiles, ""but because I thought it was important.""
The funny thing is, Lucas reflects, smiling again, that she has been trying for years to work out where the real power lies: ""And it always seems to be where I'm not."" She didn't find it on Oxfordshire county council in the 90s, nor in Strasbourg, nor now in Westminster. She feels hopeful about her party's prospects in next month's European elections, and urges any supporters worried about wasting their vote in next year's election to remember that if everyone in Brighton had done the same, her party still wouldn't have a single MP. But she also recalls something Miliband said when he was climate change minister. ""There he was, the minister - which you would have thought made him influential - appealing for NGOs to organise a campaign that would give him permission to mobilise in government.""
Does she mean she might well have been more powerful sitting down on the pathway in Balcombe than she can be on the House of Commons benches? Sometimes I wish Lucas would be a bit less cautiously cheerful, and just let rip about what's wrong with our political system. But after a few seconds' pause she says. ""No, no, I think the two are complementary.""

Storm and drought: what Europe has to fear fromÊclimateÊchange
For most Europeans, the climate change threat is elsewhere: the rising sea levels in south Asia; crop failures in Africa; mightier storms in the tropics, drought in the developing world.
But asÊFranois HollandeÊprepares to host a crucial UN climate summit at the end of this month, his fellow Europeans are already facing subtle harbingers of global warming. Seas, mountains, forests, plains, towns and cities Ð the risks within Europe itself are many, varied and increasingly difficult to ignore.
Spain
Forty per cent of the worldÕs olive oil production comes from Andaluca, which boasts a 1,000-year history of cultivation. Today, 1.5m hectares are dedicated to the crop. But climate change could transform this landscape and erase the cultivation of Andalucan olives.
ÒThe commodities most harmed by climate change will be those which cannot adapt, like the olive grove or the vineyard,Ó said Ana Iglesias, agronomist engineer at the Technical University of Madrid and one of the Spanish researchers who contributed to the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) report.
Furthermore, olive groves and vineyards do not offer a quick turnaround, with the plants taking decades to reach full maturity. ÒNow tremendous investments are being made in vineyards and other locations, based on current climate conditions,Ó she said. ÒSome areas in Spain will not be cultivated, wonÕt have any human presence, and will turn into deserts.Ó
Adding to the problem of the rise in temperature is the increase in severe weather phenomena such as hail and droughts, which hit farmers directly. ÒI predict a productivity reduction of the extensive and intense cultivations,Ó said Marta Rivera, an expert in food security at the University of Vic in Catalonia and also a member of theÊIPCC. ÒIt is not so much a problem affecting a specific cultivation, but rather a conflict of food security.Ó
Citrus crops have already been hit by the heat this year, with production of some types of mandarins and clementines forecast to be down by as much as 25%.
Manuel Planelles, El Pas
Italy
Above woods filled with chestnut trees is a fir-covered hill with three ski runs. The highest point reaches 1,600 metres; the lowest is close to 1,000 metres. The resort is called Viola Saint Gre, in ItalyÕs Maritime Alps, on the border of Piedmont and Liguria. The three lifts, one chairlift and two conveyor belts, look a little forlorn. There has been no shortage of investment here Ð but there is a shortage of snow.
Saint Gre is the picture of abandonment, an ex-resort. It sprang up like a mushroom in the 1970s, after Ligurian entrepreneurs saw a great opportunity for tourism in an area where the humid air of the sea brought abundant snowfall.
Then the snow dried up. Bankruptcy ensued and bailouts were made, including a Û700,000 injection this year. But the snow never came back, and climate forecasts suggesting average temperatures will have risen by 2C by 2100 will doom Viola Saint Gre to a ski-less future.
It is one of 50 minor resorts in the Alps that have no place in the economic development of skiing, according to Laurent Vanat, one of the worldÕs leading ski tourism experts. The highest point of the Viola skiing area is 400 metres below the level guaranteed to have natural snow.
The forecast from the Fondazione Montagna Sicura, an Alpine research centre in Courmayeur, is grim: ÒThe western Alps will have to deal with average annual temperature increases of 2-3C by the end of the century. As a result the limit of the rain/snow line will rise by 500 metres, and the duration of snow on the ground will drop by 20%.Ó
Vanat said: ÒThe big ski resorts have grasped the significance of the climate risk in the past decade and have taken countermeasures, including the production of artificial snow. The Alps are a unique area for attracting skiers Ð of whom 30% are foreign Ð but the expansion in the skiing market is elsewhere, in Russia, China and central Asia.Ó
Enrico Martinet, La Stampa
Poland
Poland has already spent Û13bn trying to mitigate the climate change threat, ploughing most of it into efforts to protect cities from the heatwaves and downpours that are becoming more common.
But the biggest risk could be the Baltic Sea. ÒMost of the shoreline is already retreating, and the coastal communities are pillaging their own natural resources,Ó said Tomasz Labuz from Szczecin University, who has studied the Polish coast for years.
In the past 100 years the Baltic Sea has risen by 20cm, which is not yet a threat but is ominous given the proliferation of hotels and apartment buildings being built right on the coastline.
ÒWeÕre not only throwing millions of zloty into the sea, but weÕre also creating a dangerous precedent,Ó said Pawel Sredzinski of WWF Poland. ÒSoon youÕll see investors trying to develop the wild parts of the shoreline.Ó
According to a survey conducted by TNS Poland for the environment ministry last year, some 86% of Poles believe climate change is an important issue. ÒNobody is questioning whether global warming is actually happening,Ó said the environment minister, Maciej Grabowski.
Yet in an essay published recently on a climate science website, Szymon Malinowski, an atmospheric physicist from Warsaw University, complained about the low level of knowledge of MPs on parliamentary environmental committees as well as the poor condition of Polish climatology: there are just a handful of scientists carrying out internationally recognised studies on the climate in Poland. In this case, the scientist observed, it seemed that Òparliament is sometimes quite a good reflection of the state of societyÓ.
Tomasz Ulanowski, Gazeta Wyborcza
United Kingdom
Severe floods across the UK last year may be a sign of what is to come if climate change is not curtailed. The winter of 2013-2014 was the wettest on record for the country, with severe storms starting in October. By the end of February, more than 7,800 homes and 3,000 businesses had been flooded.
ÒFlooding is the greatest threat to the UK from climate change,Ó said Daniel Johns, head of adaptation at the Committee on Climate Change (CCC). ÒThe basic physics say there is an increased chance of flooding due to climate change. The hot air can contain more moisture so you get more evaporation from the ocean taken into the atmosphere and warm, moist air is like rocket fuel for storms.Ó
Warm, moist air is like rocket fuel for storms
Johns said the UK had already observed about one degree of warming since the 1970s; sea levels around the UK coast have risen 15cm since the beginning of the 20th century.
While there are planning policies in place around the UK to try to prevent homes being built on floodplains, theÊCCCÊsays 1,500 are nevertheless constructed each year in areas of high flood risk. TheÊCCCÊsuggests that the number of homes in England where there is at least a one in 30 chance of flooding will increase from 150,000 to 190,000 in 10 years.
Johns does not foresee a need to relocate entire communities from the floodplains this century, but says it is imperative that rising temperatures are halted.
ÒThis is why itÕs so important that the Paris conference succeeds. It will be much easier and cheaper for the UK to adapt to a two degree scenario [limiting warming to two degrees above pre-industrial levels] rather than a four degree scenario.Ó
Kate Lyons, the Guardian
Germany
Perhaps the biggest threat that Germany faces is the slow degradation of its forests, with heat and drought affecting the northern lowlands.
Christopher Reyer, forest ecologist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the beech was in danger because it did not sit well in sandy ground. Rising temperatures could encourage the growth of trees on higher plains that were once far too cold. ÒBut the consensus is that most of the effects of climate change will be negative,Ó said Reyer.
The majority of Germany should be covered by deciduous trees Ð beech and oak in particular. But there are almost no more natural forests left. Instead, what is growing is what was planted: in the north, mainly pines; in the south, spruce. But spruce could also be a big loser from climate change because it cannot handle drought and its shallow roots are easily damaged in storms. The tree is also at risk from pests, such as pine moths, which feed on its needles as caterpillar larvae.
Other insects become stronger as the temperature rises by a few degrees, with bark beetlesÕ reproductive cycle increasing to three or even four times a year (they currently have a maximum of two). New pests could be attracted by the warmer weather. Forest fires are also expected to increase, although it is still unknown whether climate change will lead to heavier storms in the south-west of Germany.
Some experts say mixed forests are important, comparing them to an equity portfolio that reduces the risk through mixture. Some are calling for the spread of species such as theÊDouglasÊfir or red oak, which do not grow naturally in Germany but can survive drought and pests. However, others swear by a ÒnaturalÓ forest in which only a regionÕs native plants grow.

France
An excavator was busy in the Fangassier pond in Camargue, which had been drained for the duration of work to create a refuge where flamingos could stay safe from the foxes lurking around the old swamps.
Something had to be done: their old island nest is now under water.
The Camargue, a natural park on the Mediterranean coast in south-east France, is famed for numerous plant and animal species as well as its rice and salt marshes Ð but it is in danger. The sea will eventually end up covering much of a 6,500-hectare area of the park recently acquired by the French coastal protection agency in the department of Bouches-du-Rhne.
The group that owned the Salins du Midi salt marshes started selling them in 2008 because the rising water meant the coastal ponds were becoming harder and harder to operate, despite the use of electric pumps and embankments.
The new owners have given up fighting the waters head-on. ÒWe estimate that 2,000 hectares will end up becoming salt marshes again, where bulls and horses traditionally roam in the region, whilst the lower parts will be submerged Ð although we donÕt exactly know how far,Ó said Gal Hemery, who helps look after the Camargue park.
Hemery looked over at a part of the seawall now reduced to almost nothing. Fifty years ago, 300 metres of beach stretched out in front of the wall. The sea has proved stronger.ÊMartine Valo,ÊLe Monde
Mediterannean Sea
The Mediterranean is a different sea to the one that lapped EuropeÕs shores 50 years ago. ItÕs two or three degrees warmer on average. The layer of warm water is deeper than before, and the period of the year during which the water stays warm is longer.
As a result, marine biologists say that as many as 700 species not detected in the sea before have arrived. All are tropical, and many have come in from the Red Sea via the Suez canal. ItÕs not just fish such as the cornetfish, but species of jellyfish and algae that are enjoying their new Mediterranean homes. The warmer waters are encouraging species of wrasse and parrotfish to move further north.
We have badly managed a resource believing it is everlasting - it isnÕt
It is bad news for some types of coral that donÕt like the heat, and that used to thrive below the warmer layer of water. Traditional Mediterranean fish populations have suffered as well.
We have badly managed a resource believing it is everlasting. It isnÕt. The presence of traditional fishermen is a barometer of a seaÕs health. A sea will be healthy while theyÕre at sea. They too are disappearing, and we should worry greatly.

When Bill de Blasio took the oath of office as mayor of New York City on 1 January, his inauguration address focused heavily on inequality. In a speech four weeks earlier, President Obama made reducing economic inequality a core mission, saying: ""For the rest of my presidency, that's where you should expect my administration to focus all our efforts."" Inequality is a critical issue globally. A society where the gains of economic growth go only to the already wealthy is not stable. That said, I believe that when we look back on the priorities set by presidents and mayors at this time in history, people will be astonished at what our leaders didn't prioritise. We should focus our energies on building general societal resilience (of which efforts to address inequality are a part), but more specifically, the first priority needs to be fighting and preparing for climate change.

The latest analyses on the likely outcomes of our continuing use of the atmosphere as a carbon dumping ground are not optimistic. A study published in Nature has suggested we're heading towards a 4C (7.2F) increase by 2100. This would not just be inconvenient: it could make the world uninhabitable for humans. The majority of scientists are not painting a picture this extreme, but the message is clear from those the Nation calls ""thoughtful outliers"".

Imagine a probability curve of possible outcomes from our planet-baking experiment. According to some sane, smart people, now showing up a few standard deviations out on the curve is the possibility of humanity's demise.

I know the doom-and-gloom approach doesn't work well. But this isn't really about extreme scenarios and fear, but about logic and prudence. You can treat something as if it's serious and stay calm, and even remain optimistic. We buy insurance on our homes and our lives, even though the odds of the worst-case scenarios happening are low.

And yet, when it comes to making the pitch for action on climate, particularly with the business community, we tend to focus on the upside. It's good for business, we say. Or we point out that there are trillion-dollar markets in play for the companies that can help the world make the transition.



All true, but it's absurd to completely avoid the subject of how serious the situation is, or how fast we need to go to deal with it. It's like convincing people to join a bucket brigade to put out the fire consuming your house by telling them how much exercise they'll get. Can't something be good for you and also be an emergency? When people have near-fatal heart attacks, they often stop smoking, change their diet, and exercise more. Those actions make their lives richer and more resilient and tackle a life-threatening problem.

But to be clear on one thing: climate and all ""green"" priorities do not need to trump all social issues. I care deeply about inequality and many topics on the social sustainability agenda, for example supply-chain conditions – it should be a moral absolute that nobody ever dies making a T-shirt. But two points matter on this question of priorities.

First, the divide between environmental and social is mostly artificial, and that's especially true with climate change. Our changing planet is the ultimate social issue, since those with the fewest resources are least able to adapt. Remember the Titanic? When the ship went down, the people in steerage were hit hardest. In climate terms, the increase in flooding and sea-level rise will have the greatest impact on many of the poorest regions, such as Bangladesh. And the outcomes from a changing climate, including droughts that destroy crops and raise food prices, are hardest on those who can least afford it.

Second, we need to walk and chew gum. We can pivot and make operating in a way that drastically reduces carbon, which mitigates and prepares for climate change, the core focus of our institutions and address critical issues like income inequality. Many of the things we need to do address both issues anyway.

On the demand side, energy and resource efficiency saves money. And those who spend a high percentage of their income on energy will benefit the most. Huge public-private investments in clean technologies, which raise production levels dramatically and bring down costs, make clean energy cheaper. That helps the developed world make the transition and helps solve energy poverty around the world.

OK, so I've reverted back to ""it's good for you"" to make the argument. I can't help it – it does pay. But that doesn't make the situation any less serious. Nor does it make it any less pressing to put climate change at the top of our personal, business and societal priorities."

Journal: Editorial: Climate change: Two cheers for the first deal struck between China and the US
Editorial
The unexpected climate change agreement reached between Barack Obama and Xi Jinping in Beijing transforms the prospects for global agreement at the climate summit in Paris next year. Is it enough to save the world from the consequences of global warming of 4 degrees or more? Probably not. But to have the two biggest polluters in the world reach any agreement is, as the US secretary of state John Kerry pointed out, a good place to start.

Until now, China's leaders, reluctant to constrict economic growth, have refused to set any target for peak carbon emissions. But growth is now slowing, and although the peak year for pollution has been set at 2030, the agreement holds out the promise that it may be reached earlier. Just as important is that the target now has the imprimatur of President Xi Jinping, who saw an opportunity to showcase some cooperation with the US after years of heightened tensions over Chinese regional expansionism. The Chinese leadership is also aware that it has to respond to increasing protests over the appalling air quality - they call it airpocalypse - that now causes illness and hundreds of premature deaths in many Chinese cities.

President Obama's commitment to fighting climate change has not been in doubt. It is his ability to deliver that is less certain. Republican victories in last week's mid-term elections leave him isolated but not necessarily powerless to introduce his pledge to cut US emissions to between 26 and 28% below the 2005 level, by 2025. It has already been rejected by the Senate republican leader Mitch McConnell. Anything agreed at the Paris climate change conference next year - which might not include a treaty, but a series of globally agreed national objectives - could be undone by Obama's successor.

But good signals, however symbolic, are too rare to discard. European countries last month agreed to cutting emissions by 40% below the 1990 level, by 2030. For nearly a quarter of a century, China and the US have been the two road blocks to global agreement. There is a long, long way to go. Neither commitment is yet ambitious enough. But at least they have made a start."

Cameron, Clegg and Miliband sign joint climate pledge
Damian Carrington
David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have signed a joint pledge to tackle climate change, which they say will protect the UK’s national security and economic prosperity.

The agreement of the three party leaders is highly unusual and comes amid a general election campaign that is becoming increasingly bitter.

The prime minister, deputy prime minister and leader of the opposition have all clashed over green issues, but the joint declaration states: “Climate change is one of the most serious threats facing the world today. It is not just a threat to the environment, but also to our national and global security, to poverty eradication and economic prosperity.”

“Acting on climate change is also an opportunity for the UK to grow a stronger economy, which is more efficient and more resilient to the risks ahead,” the joint statement says. “It is in our national interest to act and ensure others act with us.” A senior UK military commander has warned previously that climate change poses as grave a threat to the UK’s security and economic resilience as terrorism.

The declaration was hailed as “inspiring leadership” by Al Gore, former US vice president and by multinational business leaders as a clear message that the UK is a good place for climate-friendly investment. The cross-party agreement in the UK contrasts sharply with the US, Australia and Canada, where right-of-centre politicians argue against the need to act on global warming.

The world’s governments have pledged to tackle climate change and have set a UN summit in Paris in December as the deadline for a global deal. The Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour leaders have pledged “to seek a fair, strong, legally binding, global climate deal which limits temperature rises to below 2C”, the level seen as the threshold of dangerous global warming.

The leaders have also pledged “to work together, across party lines, to agree [UK] carbon budgets”, which are required by law but which caused serious cabinet clashes in 2011.

The leaders’ third pledge is “to accelerate the transition to a competitive, energy-efficient low-carbon economy and to end the use of unabated coal for power generation.” The UK green economy has grown strongly, even during the years after the global economic crisis in 2008, and employs about a million people, but has been hit by political uncertainty due to rows over wind farms and solar power.

“This agreement represents inspiring leadership and true statesmanship by all three men,” said Gore. “The political courage it represents on all sides is exactly what our world most needs in order to solve the climate crisis.”

Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever, said: “The importance of this pledge cannot be overstated. In this critical year, this sets a terrific example for other countries to follow.” Polman warned in an article for the Guardian this week that “powerful vested interests in high-carbon businesses are desperately opposing these changes”.

Juergen Maier, CEO of Siemens, which started building on a ?310m wind turbine factory in Hull in January, said: “The low-carbon transition represents a major economic opportunity and this demonstration of cross-party support sends a clear message that the UK remains a good place for global companies to do low-carbon business.”

The joint statement, brokered by the Green Alliance and other NGOs, was released on Saturday, the same day that the Go Fossil Free movement persuading investors to dump their fossil fuel stocks is holding a global day of action, with events in over 50 countries. The fast-growing divestment campaign has already seen 180 institutions worth a combined $50bn get rid of their fossil fuel investments, including local governments, universities, churches and health-care providers.

A series of analyses have shown that the coal, oil and gas industry already have three times more fossil fuels ready to be extracted than can be burned, if the pledge by the world’s governments to keep global warming under 2C is to be kept. The campaigners argue that the fossil fuel industry is therefore not just a threat to the climate, but also to investors’ money, as trillions of dollars is being spent exploring for fossil fuels that will be worthless if climate change is tackled. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, told the Guardian in 2014: “We need an apartheid-style boycott to save the planet.”

Banks that fund fossil fuel investments are also being targeted on the day of action in the UK, South Africa and Australia. In the UK, at least 1,400 people will switch their accounts away from the big five banking groups in protest at the ?66bn they invested in fossil fuel extraction in 2012 alone."

Barack Obama: parts of Paris climate deal must carry legal force
Barack Obama declared on Tuesday that some components to a global climate change agreement must carry legal force, easing one obstacle to a successful outcome at negotiations in Paris.

In an apparent compromise, Obama said the US would push for certain aspects of a climate change agreement to be legally binding – going some distance to meeting a key demand of the European Union and some developing countries.

However, Obama offered no change in the US position on the overall nature of the agreement sought at Paris.

The US has been clear from the outset that it will not sign on to a full-fledged climate change treaty because it would have virtually no chance of passage through a Republican-controlled Congress.



The US has also insisted that countries come up with their own targets for cutting emissions – and that these remain entirely voluntary.

On Tuesday, however, Obama said the US wanted one major component of the deal – the periodic review of emissions reductions targets – to be legally binding.

Such reviews are deemed necessary if countries are to achieve their agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C (3.6F).

The pledges so far would at best hold warming to 2.7 C – which would still unleash catastrophic climate impacts on low-lying islands and poor countries.

“Although the targets themselves may not have the force of treaties, the process, the procedures that ensure transparency and periodic reviews, that needs to be legally binding. And that’s going to be critical in us having high ambitions and holding each other accountable,” Obama told reporters in Paris.

The US had earlier proposed a hybrid formula of a climate change agreement with some legally enforceable elements to try to overcome divisions about the nature of the climate change agreement being negotiated in Paris.

The European Union and developing countries have pushed for a legally binding agreement, such as the Kyoto protocol.

However, the US argues a legal treaty would be a no-go because of its domestic political circumstances. Congress failed to ratify the Kyoto protocol in the 1990s, and George W Bush eventually repudiated the agreement.

Republicans in Congress have stepped up their rhetoric against what they called Obama’s “suspect climate agenda”.

Lamar Smith, the chair of the house science, space and technology committee, told a hearing Obama and US government scientific agencies were misleading the American public and overstating the dangers of climate change. He also accused Obama of improperly avoiding congressional oversight of his policies.

“The American people should be suspicious of this administration when it continually impedes congressional oversight of its extreme climate agenda,” Smith said.

Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, also lashed out at Obama. “The president simply went around Congress to impose similarly regressive – and likely illegal – ‘power plan’ energy regulations anyway,” McConnell told reporters on Monday. “He’s currently trying to sell that power plan to world leaders in Paris as proof of the American government’s commitment to his energy priorities.”

Hillary Clinton, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, hit back in an article for Time. She wrote: “The Republican deniers, defeatists and obstructionists should know – their cynical efforts will fail. Not only are they on the wrong side of science and of history, they are increasingly on the wrong side of their own voters, as a majority of Republicans accept the science of climate change, and support solutions like clean energy.

“We must reject the false choice between combating climate change and fostering strong economic growth.”

Obama’s statement in Paris came as the House science, space and technology committee heard from the controversial Danish economist, Bjorn Lomborg, who claimed that a climate deal at Paris would reduce warming by only fractions of a degree and would cost close to $2tn a year by 2030.

His conclusions run counter to those of most economists and major international financial institutions such as the World Bank.

Campaign groups meanwhile welcomed Obama’s remarks, especially his optimism that the international community would succeed in meeting its climate goals through technological advances in green energy.

“It’s good to see the president support a long-term goal, but calling for the global economy to become low carbon over the course of the century falls short of what we need,” said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace. “To remain credible, he needs to support the vulnerable countries who have just called for all energy to be renewable energy by 2050.”

According to a New York Times/CBS News poll published on Monday 63% of Americans support the US signing up to a binding international agreement to curb the growth in carbon emissions.

But a majority of Republicans in Congress deny the existence of climate change or oppose action on it. In the run-up to Paris, and while Obama has been at the summit, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to block climate aid to developing countries.

Obama at his press conference on Tuesday dismissed such threats, saying the funds were already in the process of being allocated.

He also said that his climate legacy would survive after he leaves the White House at the end of his presidency next year. “Whoever is the next president of the United States if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus – not just 99.5% of scientists and experts but 99.5% of world leaders – think this is really important I think the president of the United States is going to think this is really important.”

Obama spoke only hours before the House of Representatives was due to vote to repeal the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants that are the linchpin of the president’s climate plan. The White House has said it will veto any measure blocking the power plant rules, and Congress does not have the votes to overcome a veto. The Senate has already voted to repeal the climate rules.

The hybrid nature of a deal is critical to US thinking about how to counter domestic political pressure against signing on to a global climate deal.

With that in mind, the Obama administration moved years ago to circumvent Congress by pressing for an agreement that would fall short of a legal treaty.

The strategy mirrors Obama’s efforts on the domestic political front, where – facing a wall of opposition in Congress – he has used his existing authority to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The US was a major force behind the thinking underpinning the deal being negotiated in Paris, of a cut-what-you-can strategy, where countries volunteer their own emissions reductions targets.

So far, more than 180 countries have come out with climate plans ahead of the Paris meeting, which the US claims as a vindication of the voluntary strategy."

Environment: UK to reveal strategy for climate change talks
Fiona Harvey
World governments are facing a ""pivotal moment"" on dealing with climate change, the UK's energy secretary will say today, before a meeting of heads of state and government in New York this month.

The UN secretary general, Ban Kimoon, has called the meeting of world leaders on the back of the UN's annual general assembly as a prelude to crunch talks in Paris next year at which a new global agreement on the climate is supposed to be signed.

Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, will today unveil the UK government's strategy for the negotiations. Although the current talks are ""not the last hope"" of tackling climate change, he will say: ""I judge the prospects of a comprehensive climate change deal to be the best since we first began this journey many decades ago.""

He also called on the G7 and the G20 groups of industrialised nations to show commitments to emissions cuts, but did not set out what targets from those nations would be acceptable to the UK.

The Guardian view on the Paris climate change summit: reasons to be cheerful
Reliable weather forecasting is notoriously difficult. But with two months to go, it looks as if the sun may shine on the Paris climate change summit in December. This is the 21st meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the climate change agreement. The first was opened in Berlin in 1995 by Germany’s environment minister, a young Angela Merkel, and that the political and economic landscape looks so favourable owes something to her lasting commitment.

Agreement is not a done deal, but countries responsible for 75% of the world’s carbon emissions have now set targets for cuts in carbon emissions. On Friday, India, which is now the third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, became the last of the major economies to file its pledge. It has promised to source 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. When the targets put forward by all the major polluters are assessed, it is reckoned that as long as they are honoured, these levels of emissions would hold global warming at 2.7C above the pre-industrial era. That is still too far above the 2C considered the limit to prevent dangerous climate change; but it is much lower than feared.

Part of the reason for the more benign political climate is that negotiators have learned from past failures; the strategy now is to devolve some of the hard choices to national governments themselves through intended nationally determined contributions or INDCs. That takes some of the pressure off the negotiators; but there are two other outstanding obstacles to a deal. One is agreeing the question of how, and how often, to monitor the progress of individual countries towards the targets they have themselves set, all the more difficult after the VW emissions scandal knocked the shine off public confidence in self-regulation. The other, even more important for the countries most threatened by higher sea levels and extreme weather events, is agreeing who will pay what into the $100bn fund set up to help countries mitigate the effects of climate change and help them to adapt their energy supplies to green technology.

It is the transformation in the cost and efficiency of renewables that holds out the greatest hope. ,Now the Guardian is launching the second phase of our Keep it in the ground campaign. Six months ago, we kicked off a debate about the importance of leaving most of the world’s fossil fuel reserves where they were, unexploited, in order to meet the 2C of warming target. Now we are reporting on how rapidly technology has changed to make the target achievable. Limiting global warming can sound like a message of self-denial and gloom, yet it is becoming a story of hope. As the pace of change in the economies of the world speeds up, the cost of renewables – in particular, solar – has tumbled faster than anyone predicted. From Burundi to Bangladesh, solar power is becoming the fastest-growing source of energy. In the US, where economists anticipated the price of solar falling to $0.30 a watt by 2030, the wholesale spot price is already there. In both the US and the EU, new regulation has hastened the phasing out of fossil fuels and accelerated the development of renewables.

President Barack Obama has made climate change a legacy issue, and wins converts by describing it as a matter of national security. China has become the biggest global solar market, deploying feed-in tariffs and tax breaks. Only in the UK, for years a pioneer, have subsidies and incentives been axed, yet even here the chancellor George Osborne’s excuse is that they are generating far more energy than expected. The Guardian’s Keep it in the ground campaign may still be far short of victory, but with every month that passes it becomes more feasible.

Backed by a parallel call for divestment from fossil fuels, the call to keep it in the ground is has become a powerful rallying cry. A week ago, Shell announced it was abandoning its efforts to find oil off Alaska; its new chief executive Ben van Beurden was increasingly concerned about the reputational damage to his business. A day later, Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned that investors in fossil fuels were facing a real risk of finding their assets stranded as new tough limits on carbon emissions made extracting them financially unviable. And a fortnight ago, the pope, during a visit to the US that may have reset political debate, spoke of the moral imperative of tackling climate change. The battle is far from won, but there are reasons to hope that victory is possible.

The Guardian view on climate change: Obama’s plan is overdue but welcome all the same
President Obama on Monday set out a plan to reduce US greenhouse gas emissions. His proposals are neither new nor radical, but deserve to be strongly supported, both in America and across the globe. Explicitly, the statement was a challenge to state governors, to Republican senators and congressmen, to fossil-fuel barons, to entrepreneurs who want to invest in renewable sources of energy, and to citizens who want to hang on to their homes and their jobs.

Implicitly, it was assurance to the rest of the world that there could be real agreement at the next United Nations climate conference in Paris in December. And if there is real agreement, based on binding promises and targets that can be measured, then it might after all be possible to contain global warming to a maximum of 2C and to limit catastrophic climate change. To cut greenhouse gas emissions by 32% from levels surpassed 10 years ago and to do it all by 2030 sounds pretty radical: hundreds of coal-fired power stations could close, mines could shut down. There will be legal and administrative challenges, from at least a dozen states, maybe two dozen. Americans who do not believe that climate change is a real hazard, and those who accept the science but not the solutions, are hardly likely to change their minds because of yet another fiat from the White House.

But that may not be the point. The logic of free-market capitalism has always meant that whatever lawfully makes the most money in the shortest time is a good thing, which is why oilmen pump crude from the ground and the gas companies invest in hydraulic fracture techniques: it makes money for the shareholders. Government legislation that arbitrarily limits fossil-fuel use is likely to send the investors looking for something else that will deliver value, and if that turns out to be energy-saving technologies, or renewable energy, or just better batteries, that’s fine too, in the long run. In the short run, however, Obama’s announcement was a promise to the rest of the world. Americans per head are the greatest generators of the greenhouse gases that are slowly but inexorably turning up the planetary thermostat. President Obama last year signed a pact with President Xi Jinping of China, the country that now leads the world in overall carbon dioxide emissions.

If the world’s two leading polluters are determined to reduce fossil-fuel use, and to do so within a realistic timetable, then other rich and fast-developing nations are more likely to sign up. And they are not likely to meet much opposition from the world’s poorest nations, because these have most to fear from climate change. Small island states are at palpable risk from sea-level rise, impoverished nations in arid zones are in no position to withstand ever higher temperatures and more devastating droughts, and coastal nations that are already sporadically laid waste by tropical cyclones have no wish to see more frequent or more intense windstorms.

But the Obama initiative does not mean that action is guaranteed: political leaders, ever looking to the next hustings, tend to take decisions that offer short-term solutions, and it is always possible to argue that there are more urgent issues to be dealt with: terrorism, or illegal immigration, or famine, or civil war. And here is where the disconnect between politics and climate science has become most obvious. In the years of inaction, or insufficient action, or outright denial, scientists have repeatedly underlined the reality of climate change, and its potentially catastrophic consequences. A recent communique from 24 of Britain’s learned societies, all innately conservative and business-friendly, spelled it out again: “Climate change poses risks to people and ecosystems by exacerbating existing economic, environmental, geopolitical, health and societal threats, and generating new ones. These risks increase disproportionately as the temperature increases.”

Neither the murderous conflict in Iraq and Syria, nor the desperate behaviour of migrants in Calais, are entirely separable from the spectre of climate change. President Obama’s initiative may seem extreme to some Americans, but not to the Royal Meteorological Society, nor the Geological Society of London, nor the Royal Society of Chemistry. These all want to see an end to all emissions by 2050, a world in which carbon dioxide levels stabilise, and perhaps begin to fall. President Obama’s step is therefore very welcome. But it is just a step. There is still a long way to go, and not much time left."

No plan B if Paris climate summit ends in failure, says EU climate chief
There is “no plan B” if the Paris climate conference ends in failure, Europe’s climate chief has warned, urging world leaders to intervene to force their ministers to agree a landmark deal this December.

In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Miguel Cañete, commissioner for climate action, said he was very concerned about the lack of negotiating time remaining before the conference.

Cañete, who will lead the EU’s 28 member states in the talks, said that if governments did not reach agreement, there was “no plan B – nothing to follow. This is not just ongoing UN discussions. Paris is final.”

For it to be a success, he said, heads of government – most of whom are not expected to attend the talks in person – must urgently instruct their negotiating ministers to come forward with plans for a deal that would involve cutting emissions, rich countries providing the poor with financial assistance, and putting in place sweeping new measures to help poor nations adapt to the ravages of global warming.

Cañete said the EU would reject any deal he thought was not ambitious enough in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, a key sticking point in the talks. “For us, it’s very important to have a deal – but not any kind of deal.”

The commissioner’s tough talking marks a new line from the EU, which has previously been seen as dovish, trying to smooth over differences among developing and developed countries. Cañete is embarking on an exhausting round of visits to developing country capitals, from Latin America to Papua New Guinea, to try to garner support for a Paris agreement.

In December, world governments will meet in the French capital under the auspices of the UN to forge a new global agreement on emissions, which would kick in from 2020 when current commitments run out. It is seen as the last chance to put the world on track to meet scientific advice on carbon reductions and avoid dangerous levels of climate change.

Developing countries form a crucial bloc in the talks, where any agreement can only be formalised by a consensus of all 196 governments. Poor nations are demanding financial assistance to help them cut emissions and deal with the effects of climate change.

Cañete promised that the financial assistance on offer would be twofold: first, the EU and other countries will clearly demonstrate how they will honour their existing pledge to provide $100bn (£64bn) a year by 2020 to the developing world in “climate finance”; and second, the Paris talks will agree on a system for providing such finance, in increasing quantities, beyond 2020.

He has also added a further strand to the talks: he wants a new agreement on measures to provide developing countries with the means to adapt to the likely ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. He believes this adaptation strategy, which will focus on protecting key infrastructure, will be crucial to encourage poor countries to make a deal, as they are most at risk of damage from global warming. “We have to put adaptation at the centre of the negotiations, for the developing countries,” he said.

Despite his reservations, Cañete said he was “85% confident” that a historic deal on global warming would be agreed in Paris. “There is political goodwill – there is commitment at a high level.”

What is needed now, in his view, is to turn that commitment into a strong push by heads of state and government to give their foreign and environment ministers – who are the main delegates at the talks – explicit permission to be flexible on their negotiating positions. Without that permission, many negotiators feel bound to stick to their old lines, which will make agreement hard to reach. “Make compromises if needed,” he urged. “If there is a clear political indication [from heads of government] then ministers can come with more ambition.”

Related: Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure

The EU’s tougher line on the talks follows the hard-won experience of negotiating on climate at the Copenhagen summit in 2009, which ended in scenes of chaos, with Europe in the final hours frozen out of negotiations, as the US, China, Brazil, India and South Africa announced their own deal in a separate room.

With only 10 official negotiating days to go before the opening of the Paris conference, officials were hoping to have a key text of a possible agreement in good form by now. Negotiating days have to be settled long in advance, and only at these occasions can key changes be accepted under the UN’s procedures.

But talks have progressed slowly, and the text of a potential Paris agreement is still scores of pages long, with many items still under question. Officials from the conference are working on slimming it down, but their draft text is not scheduled to be completed until 24 July, days after ministers are meeting in Paris to discuss progress on a deal.

“I am concerned,” said Cañete. “We are lacking the days to negotiate.”"

Journal: Editorial: Climate change: The world inched closer to a deal on carbon emissions at Lima. Now the real battle begins
Editorial
Another round in the UN climate change negotiations ended in Lima early on Sunday morning. It took a fortnight plus 36 extra hours of intense negotiation to achieve one small step towards the outline of an agreement for next year's all-important Paris talks. That is where, if catastrophic global warming is to be averted, a new generation of emissions targets must be agreed.

The Peru gathering was the 20th meeting of the parties to the UN climate change convention, or Cop 20 in the UN's tiresomely obfuscating language. Its ambition was deceptively modest: to start to pick a route through the jungle of conflicting interests towards perhaps the most intractable problem of global climate equity - a transparent system of measuring emissions. It followed a now familiar trajectory: optimism, then stalemate, then overrun, and, at the end, a frantic last-minute scramble before, finally, a deal. The relief on the faces of the delegates indicated how close they had come to deadlock. If they are to succeed in a year's time, there must be a revival of the old sense of urgency that delivered the flawed but ground-breaking Kyoto treaty in 1997.

The prospects for Lima looked particularly bright in the wake of the agreement between the US and China on carbon emissions that was announced by Presidents Obama and Xi in November. The reluctance of China - now the world's biggest polluter - to accept emissions targets had once given Congress an excuse not to sign up to Kyoto, and it was clear that without both powers engaged, there could never be a lasting global agreement. So it was a cause for optimism that, in the November deal, China abandoned its argument that emissions should be related to GDP - a measure that favoured developing countries - and accepted it should be on the basis of national aggregates. It also pledged to convert 20% of its energy supply to renewable sources. In turn, President Obama committed the US to doubling its rate of cuts in emissions. Neither obligation was a huge advance. China expected emissions to peak around 2030 anyway, and faces growing domestic protests about pollution. US emissions had fallen sharply with the recession. Now they are on the increase, and a Republican Congress may yet block the Obama pledge. Nonetheless the joint declaration was a recognition of their role in making the Paris negotiations a success.

So much for the optimism. In Lima, it was detail that counted. Trying to convert headline objectives into a practical plan of action soon undid any sense that victory was at hand. Yet in the end, there was progress on them all. In the context of the complexity of negotiations involving more than 190 countries, the relatively easy bit was boosting the value of the adaptation fund for small island states facing existential threat from rising sea levels and extreme weather events. Less successful was the attempt to prepare the ground for some kind of continuing ""climate aid"" levy on rich countries. Perhaps the most significant progress for the developed world was the acceptance by the developing countries of their responsibility for limiting future emissions. There are no longer two categories of nations, the developed countries, which must cut emissions, and the developing countries, which need not. What the negotiators called the firewall between the two has been breached. But the biggest, most difficult and ultimately most important challenge is devising an acceptable, transparent route to measuring emissions, in order to facilitate some kind of global monitoring of targets. And that remains a work in progress.

These negotiations will only get more demanding in the coming year. Europe and the US continue to wrestle with troubled economies, reluctant to risk recovery by increasing costs for business and industry, or to burden consumers by demanding more for adaptation. The fall in the price of oil removes one big incentive for the developed world to invest in renewables and greater energy efficiency.

Yet, in its latest synthesis of climate change science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found the evidence of human influence on the climate system is clear and that warming is increasingly likely to be irreversible. It is not too late to make a difference, and this is no time to lose heart."

The Guardian view on the Paris summit: outlook fair, but storms still possible
The chances of a deal at the Paris climate change summit that starts on 30 November look better than anyone might have thought possible even a year ago. But if success seems more likely than failure, failure – as President Francois Hollande warned last week – is still possible. The negotiations on the text that have been going on in Bonn were supposed to be nearly complete, but progress has been slow and possibly insufficient. Only this morning the UN’s climate chief, Christiana Figueres, warned that the targets for carbon emission reduction that 62 nations which account for 70% of emissions have so far submitted for agreement in Paris are not good enough to keep global warming below 2C.

All the same, the mere fact of nationally rather than globally agreed targets marks an important innovation. In total, targets covering 85% of emissions are expected. That would be enough to prevent global warming reaching catastrophic levels. It is the start of a process, and that is one of the things that makes the framework for a deal very different from the failed attempts at Copenhagen six years ago. Then, the developed world was being asked to bear the costs both of moving to a low-carbon economy and of mitigating the impacts of climate change; the US still lacked a climate change policy; and the fastest-growing polluters, China and India, did not take part.

But the ragged nature of progress is writ large in the UK’s own uncertain steps towards a green economy. Under Lib Dem influence in the coalition years, a raft of measures, from subsidies for wind and solar energy to improvements in domestic insulation and a green investment bank, were pushed through, while the Lib Dem energy secretary, Ed Davey, played a big part in securing an EU climate deal at the end of last year. Since the election, nine different policies, from onshore wind subsidies to incentives for greener motoring, have been axed or weakened. Even the eye-catching pre-election promise for funding for Swansea’s power-generating tidal lagoon has yet to be realised. Defenders of these changes argue that this is a new and fast-changing environment and, because renewables have been more efficient than anyone anticipated, the subsidies have become victims of their own success. But in the latest quarterly rankings from Ernst & Young, published on Wednesday, the UK has fallen out of the international top 10 of countries for investment in renewables for the first time in more than a decade. According to an EY analyst, investors are scratching their heads about the government’s direction of travel. This cooling attitude to green investment may encourage resistance to carbon reduction in Poland, the last country in the EU to depend heavily on coal-fired energy. It was a reluctant signatory to the EU deal to cut emissions by 40% over 1990 levels, and the details have still to be finalised. It could still unravel.

Yet there are good reasons to be cheerful. The political support for a deal is broader and deeper than ever before. It embraces President Barack Obama, who has made action on climate change a legacy issue, and as importantly China’s President Xi Jinping. Aware that the cost of not getting an agreement by making its own contribution to carbon reduction would be greater than the cost of greening its economy, China is now fully engaged in the process. Angela Merkel, who was Germany’s environment minister when the first climate change conference was held in Berlin in 1995, has been playing a critical role in bilateral negotiations off stage. The two unknowns are Russia and India. They are both countries with huge fossil fuel reserves that have been slow to invest in carbon reduction, but hopes are high for India, whose prime minister, Narendra Modi, is keen to be seen as a moderniser and without China as an ally is surrounded by countries that all want action on global warming.

Next week, the UN general assembly gathers in New York. The pope will be there to deliver his message about the moral necessity of tackling climate change. There will be a dinner, and no doubt bilaterals to tackle outstanding problems. The sustainable development goals, which could be part of the underpinning of the Paris deal, are due to be considered. But the real crunch comes in October, when the IMF and the World Bank Group meet in Peru to assess progress towards the $100bn of climate aid. This is the money that will grease the wheels of the deal. It sounds like an unfathomably large amount. But compared with the cost of not reaching a deal, to rich and poor country alike, it is cheap at the price."

‘A cat in hell’s chance’ – why we’re losing the battle to keep global warming below 2C
Andrew Simms
It all seemed so simple in 2008. All we had was financial collapse, a cripplingly high oil price and global crop failures due to extreme weather events. In addition, my climate scientist colleague Dr Viki Johnson and I worked out that we had about 100 months before it would no longer be “likely” that global average surface temperatures could be held below a 2C rise, compared with pre-industrial times.

What’s so special about 2C? The simple answer is that it is a target that could be politically agreed on the international stage. It was first suggested in 1975 by the environmental economist William Nordhaus as an upper threshold beyond which we would arrive at a climate unrecognisable to humans. In 1990, the Stockholm Environment Institute recommended 2C as the maximum that should be tolerated, but noted: “Temperature increases beyond 1C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damage.”

To date, temperatures have risen by almost 1C since 1880. The effects of this warming are already being observed in melting ice, ocean levels rising, worse heat waves and other extreme weather events. There are negative impacts on farming, the disruption of plant and animal species on land and in the sea, extinctions, the disturbance of water supplies and food production and increased vulnerability, especially among people in poverty in low-income countries. But effects are global. So 2C was never seen as necessarily safe, just a guardrail between dangerous and very dangerous change.

To get a sense of what a 2C shift can do, just look in Earth’s rear-view mirror. When the planet was 2C colder than during the industrial revolution, we were in the grip of an ice age and a mile-thick North American ice sheet reached as far south as New York. The same warming again will intensify and accelerate human-driven changes already under way and has been described by James Hansen, one of the first scientists to call global attention to climate change, as a “prescription for long-term disaster”, including an ice-free Arctic.

Nevertheless, in 1996, a European Council of environment ministers, that included a young Angela Merkel, adopted 2C as a target for the EU. International negotiators agreed the same in 2010 in Cancun. It was a commitment repeated in the Paris Climate Accord of 2015 where, pushed by a new group of countries called the Climate Vulnerable Forum, ambitions went one step further, agreeing to hold temperature rises to “well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C”.

Is it still likely that we will stay below even 2C? In the 100 months since August 2008, I have been writing a climate-change diary for the Guardian to raise questions and monitor progress, or the lack of it, on climate action. To see how well we have fared, I asked a number of leading climate scientists and analysts for their views. The responses were as bracing as a bath in a pool of glacial meltwater.

Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies has an important place in the history of climate-change research. Hansen was its director from 1981 until 2013. Donald Trump is set to strip the institute of funding for climate research. Its current director, Dr Gavin Schmidt, is categoric that we are no longer likely to stay below 2C. “The inertia in the system (oceans, economies, technologies, people) is substantial and … so far the efforts are not commensurate with the goal,” he says.

Sabine Fuss, of Germany’s Mercator Research Institute, on Global Commons and Climate Change says emissions are currently “not aligned” with the 2C target and will need to “come down more quickly”. Joanna Haigh, co-director of the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and Environment, thinks there is “no chance whatsoever at current levels of carbon emissions”, and her Grantham Institute colleague, Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, is not “confident” that temperature rises can be held below 2C.

Prof Andrew Watkinson of the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia thinks it “unlikely” and Prof John Shepherd, a physicist at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, calls it “not very likely at all”. Stuart Haszeldine of the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh says we have “very little chance”, and Prof Piers Forster, director of the Priestly International Centre for Climate at the University of Leeds calls it, “on the fanciful edge of plausible”. Glen Peters, senior researcher at Norway’s leading climate change centre, Cicero, is unambiguous, saying: “We have emitted too much already.” And these sentiments are echoed by Prof Alice Larkin, of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, and Dr Chris Vernon, a glaciologist and former scientist at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for Climate Science. Only one influential scientist preferred their comments to remain anonymous, but they too said we were off-target, because the “international negotiating process is disconnected from national policymaking”.

In short, not a single one of the scientists polled thought the 2C target likely to be met. Bill McGuire, professor emeritus of geophysical and climate hazards at University College London, is most emphatic. “My personal view,” he says, “is that there is not a cat in hell’s chance.”

The most positive response came in the guarded words of Chris Jones, head of the Earth system and mitigation science team at the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, who says that current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere “don’t preclude” successfully achieving the target. Prof Joachim Schellnhuber, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, would “only confirm that it is still possible to keep global warming below 2C”. The last point, however, is contentious, for precisely the reason the target exists. Namely, to prevent global warming from feeding off itself by triggering long-term, potentially irreversible environmental domino effects, such as ice loss and forest die-back, and the weakening ability of things such as our oceans to absorb carbon. “The open question for me is not whether we will breach the 2C target,” says Prof Barry McMullin of Dublin City University, “but how soon.”

In addition, the temperature target is a global average, and local variations matter. In November 2016, the Arctic was already experiencing extraordinary anomalies. Temperatures were 20C above normal. A global average rise of 2C implies higher temperatures still for the Arctic, sufficient to push long-term ice loss and trigger other potentially uncontrollable climate changes. At the other end of the world, a development more bizarre than extraordinary is touching the Antarctic. Gambling with our future used to be largely a metaphor, but it is now possible to place bets on when the next giant iceberg will detach itself from the Larsen C ice shelf. At the time of writing, betting company PaddyPower is offering odds of 7/2 in February 2017 or 12/1 in August.

Hoskins says: “We have no evidence that a 1.9C rise is something we can easily cope with, and 2.1 is a disaster.” But Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, one of the countries most vulnerable to warming, warns in stark terms of the failure to stick to a much lower target: “The consequences of failing to keep the temperature below 1.5C will be to wilfully condemn hundreds of millions of the poorest citizens of Earth to certain deaths from the severe impacts of climate change.”

“I think we actively chose to forgo the carbon budgets for a likely chance of 2C many years ago,” says Kevin Anderson, currently professor of climate change at Uppsala University in Sweden. “Judging that rate at which our emissions would need to be reduced was too politically challenging to contemplate.”

The one thing agreed by all the climate scientists was the need for immediate and dramatic transition to a low-carbon economy, at a scale and speed we have not yet remotely approached. And the truly striking thing is that a huge number of the actions we need to take are things that bring enormous economic, social and environmental benefits. Rationally, we would be choosing to do them anyway. Where there are challenging shifts in behaviour required, they mostly affect only a small, wealthy proportion of society. Take flying, for example: 70% of all flights by UK residents are accounted for by just 15% of the population.

So, what scale of change are we looking at to stay below 2C? Being optimistic about what might be achieved in terms of saving forests from being cut down and cleaning up industry, especially the production of steel and cement, Anderson estimates globally we can afford to emit around 650bn tonnes of carbon dioxide in total from energy systems. Currently, the world pumps out about 36bn tonnes every year alone. Starting from today, and assuming that poorer and industrialising nations see a peak in the emissions from energy use by 2025 and go zero carbon by 2050, Anderson calculates that this leaves a rich country such as the UK with the challenge of cutting its emissions by around 13% per year.

Chris Goodall charts the remarkable rise of renewable energy and its equally dramatic falling costs. But renewables have to substitute for fossil fuels, not merely add to overall energy supply. In the meantime, it matters as much that we reduce our total energy use. You will hear a lot of talk about technologies to capture carbon from the burning of fuel and prevent it entering the atmosphere. Most of the climate models used to project what will happen to our atmosphere rely heavily on the assumption that they will be used at large scale. While most climate scientists see these so-called “negative emissions technologies” for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as essential parts of the toolkit to tackle climate change, many are sceptical of hope being placed in them. It is easier not to burn the carbon in the first place.

“There is no guarantee that CCS will work at a sufficiently global scale,” says Dr Hugh Hunt, a Cambridge specialist on climate engineering. “These technologies will take decades to reach any meaningful scale.” Tellingly, as an engineer, he argues that our top priorities are to stop burning fossil fuels and for the biggest consumers to live less extravagantly. And, it seems, moderate shifts by the most profligate could yield huge climate dividends. Currently about half of all global emissions are the responsibility of just of just one in 10 of the global population.

If just this group reduced their carbon footprints to that of the average, barely impoverished European, argues Anderson, global emissions would be cut by around one-third.

There are many ways to reach a 2C world, according to Prof Diana Urge-Vorsatz, of the Central European University. “Their common characteristic is that they all require rapid and transformational action,” she says. Small, incremental changes won’t do it.

Retrofitting existing buildings in rich countries can save 70-90% of the energy used to heat and cool them, she adds. And such a move also tackles fuel poverty, creates local jobs and reduces deaths from cold. Switching transport from fossil fuels to electricity power by renewables cuts emissions but also removes the air pollution that is responsible for an epidemic of lethal respiratory disease. In Europe alone, about half a million people suffer premature deaths each year due to air pollution.

In November 2016, many, mostly low-income countries, from Bangladesh to Tanzania and Guatemala, committed to switching entirely to renewable energy by 2030-50 at the latest. Costa Rica, aided by favourable geography, has already managed to power itself for extended periods, relying just on renewables. Portugal has managed the same for shorter periods. But great leaps forward are happening elsewhere, too. China is installing more new wind energy capacity in a single year than the UK has in total.

So, adding to the prevailing global strangeness, the edifice of international climate policy rests on a target that no one believes it is likely can be met. And some think even that insufficiently ambitious. Yet, among climate scientists, there is a consensus that swift action is vital, and with it the target remains, at least, possible.

With the amount of carbon burned by humans, we have now created a climate not experienced on Earth since the Pliocene era, 2m-5m years ago. We are daily rolling the climate dice with the odds stacked against us. But we are also clever, quick and innovative when we want to be. Now that we understand the game better, the question we face is whether we will choose to change it, fast and enough, so that we can all have better lives.

The screen legend and activist Jane Fonda said she’s prepared to do “whatever I need to do” to counter a Donald Trump administration, and called the president-elect a sexist “boy in a bully pulpit” who is missing an opportunity to be an eco-hero.

The actor let loose on Trump’s choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, the global-warming skeptic Scott Pruitt, and called the pick her “greatest fear” about the incoming administration.

A self-confessed late bloomer as a feminist, Fonda also predicted that women’s rights “are going to come under incredible attack” at the federal and state level in the aftermath of the Trump election victory.

But she chose the environment when asked to name her biggest worry about a Trump White House in an interview with the Guardian.

“We are confronted by someone who is against the very existence of the agency he’s being put in charge of. There are many dangers with Trump but the difference here is that we have no time. The tipping point for climate change is looming,” Fonda said.

Experts are warning that Pruitt will be an “unprecedented disaster” for the environment, not just in the US but the world if he leads the charge to unwind Barack Obama’s push against carbon emissions and pollution and his commitment to the global agreement signed in Paris to combat soaring atmospheric and ocean temperatures.

“That’s what scares me the most. I will not be around to see the ultimate fallout from climate change, but it’s coming. I hoped the fact that he was meeting with Al Gore meant that he was open to seeing the light, but then he appointed Pruitt,” she said.



Gore, a Nobel prize-winning environment campaigner and Bill Clinton’s vice-president, met with Donald Trump in New York last Monday and declared afterward that it was a “productive session” and they expected to talk further.

Three days later Trump announced his new head of the EPA would be Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma who has been one of the chief architects of state-led legal challenges to Obama’s environmental agenda.

Unlike Gore and his fellow eco-campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio, who met Trump last Wednesday, Fonda has failed in apparent attempts to connect with the president-elect to argue the case for action on climate change.

Her voice heavy with sarcastic humor, Fonda described her unorthodox efforts to win an audience with Trump prior to his naming Pruitt.

“I was hoping there was some way I could reach Trump. He knows my favorite ex-husband, Ted Turner, who’s a staunch environmentalist; he knows me. I thought if I come with Ted and some gorgeous women and explain to him that he is in a position where he can save the world ... but it’s too late now because of his appointment of Pruitt,” she said.

Fonda said she had hoped to visit the president-elect’s Trump Tower residence and offices in New York with the actors Pamela Anderson and Rachel McAdams, who had agreed to lobby with her, she said.

“I wanted to have beautiful celebrities who are very smart and passionate – to get his attention - and I would have said: ‘You can turn the rust belt into the green belt and save the environment and jobs,’” she said.

Fonda indicated that she wanted Trump to develop an economic strategy that would create jobs developing clean energy equipment in areas where traditional industry is in decline and frustrated voters had turned to the real estate magnate as a savior.

“The people who voted him in in the rust belt, most are not gloating, they are not thrilled with him, and they are going to be hurt and disappointed under his administration,” she said.

Fonda, 78, is currently starring in the TV series Grace and Frankie, with Lily Tomlin, and remains a vigorous political activist.

In 1972, the year she won her first best actress Oscar, she also became known worldwide for her activism when she traveled to Hanoi to protest US bombing damage during the Vietnam war.

She spoke to the Guardian last Thursday at an event for Donor Direct Action, a New York-based non-profit she is involved with that supports women’s causes around the world and is campaigning with the Nigerian women’s organization WRAPA to rescue almost 200 girls still being held by the extremist rebel group Boko Haram after a mass abduction in 2014.

Fonda called the women standing up for feminist rights in countries like Nigeria “fierce” and said that women and other activists in the US must be ready to counterattack expected threats to their freedom in a Trump administration.



“In Trump we have a boy in the bully pulpit. He is sexist and his whole sense of self is based around dominating women,” said Fonda.

“He does not like a free press and wants to shrink government, and people are going to be really badly hurt by that, so they will start protesting and there will be a further militarization of the police in response.”

She intends to continue with her activism and said she would do “whatever it takes” to make her voice heard in resistance to Trump.

She declined to be specific about what that could include but hinted at direct action.

Wales may keep fossil fuels in the ground, but will India and China?
Tomorrow, on 22 April, members of the Welsh assembly will have the opportunity to vote for a moratorium on opencast coal mining in Wales. With the existing moratorium on fracking and the demise of the deep coalmining industry, this means that Wales has the possibility of opening a new chapter in its history.

It means that Wales could become the first country in the world with substantial fossil fuel reserves to put them beyond use. It’s a moment of global and intergenerational significance, because Wales was the source of much of the coal that fuelled the industrial revolution. Fossil fuels have huge political and psychological significance in Wales.

At a time when the world is crying out for leadership, this is something within the gift of assembly members. In decades and centuries to come, when their children and grandchildren, and their grandchildren, are living in a world changed by climate change, they will owe these legislators a debt of gratitude. Their stance will mean that the world they inherit is so much better than it might have been. It could begin a worldwide movement of countries embracing a new, clean future free of the shackles of fossil fuels.

This is their chance. Their chance to make the name of their country – Wales – echo through the centuries.

• On 20 November 2012 the Guardian reported that 1,200 new coal-fired power stations were being planned around the world, including 455 in India, and 363 in China. Little wonder, because on 19 June 2009 you recorded that both countries had two centuries of coal reserves. So, no surprise that on 31 October 2014 you described India’s “dash for coal”, with new prime minister Narendra Modi promising electricity to 400 million within five years. Yet last week, from the comfort of the US, Al Gore called providing the poor with coal-generated electricity “cynical” ( Stand up to the fossil fuel fightback – cheap coal is a lie, 17 April). It looks positively different in India. Which is why on 29 October 2012 you observed a “resurgence”, a “renaissance”, a “bonanza”, in coal, with consumption up 8.4% in developing countries. That will continue, not just through new power plants, but because, as you reported on 28 July 2014, “the largest coalmine in Australia” is being developed to export coal to India for the next 60 years.

Now the Guardian calls on the world to “keep it in the ground”. That may seem sensible in the west. But China and India, both striving to develop their economies rapidly, aren’t going to forgo such a cheap and accessible energy resource. Similarly, the Guardian supports divestment of energy company shares. That might work on the west’s stock exchanges, but in Asia they run their economies differently.

It is time for the Guardian to take off its western blinkers and see fossil fuels as others see them. It will not be pleasant. Coal is driving the world to a climate catastrophe. But it is no use the Guardian preaching renunciation. You would do a better service to humankind by advising the world how to prepare for and adapt to the extreme changes that are certain to hit soon.

• While Felix Salmon ( Keep it in the ground: Why this is a matter of basic ethics, 13 April) concludes that your campaign remains valid despite concerns about its “idealism”, he struggles to make the investment case for divestment.

For many of the investors we represent, the moral case would be justification enough. However, is the investment argument really so strongly stacked against divestment?

As managers specialising in ethical and sustainable investment, we have been directly engaged in the issues around fossil fuel investment for almost two decades. With over ?700m in funds under management – a significant proportion of which is invested for charitable trusts – we have seen a gradual convergence of the moral and investment arguments in favour of divestment.

Salmon notes that fossil fuel investment has not provided attractive returns relative to the market over a variety of periods and highlights this as evidence that the sector is not necessarily a home for “avaricious” investors.

While not all investors are necessarily avaricious, many invested because they expected more positive financial returns than have been realised. But is it fair to say that renewables cannot provide the same level of financial returns as the oil and gas sector during “normal” periods of oil price performance?

Although at a much earlier stage in its development, there are growing opportunities in renewables to benefit from the positive returns now being achieved not only by manufacturers of renewable energy equipment but also renewable energy generators. Such returns include rising levels of income.

The arguments in favour of divestment should consider risk and reward as well as moral judgments. The risks of not being invested are clear: if the oil and gas sector performs well, portfolios without exposure may suffer. However, as noted, positive returns are not guaranteed at a sector level. At a company level, too, expansion into more extreme areas of production is not without risk – as was amply illustrated by BP’s Gulf of Mexico disaster. Should drilling in the Arctic be considered less risky than generating power from wind or solar energy?

For investors such as charitable foundations with very long-term time horizons, being late could be just as inexcusable as being early. So perhaps for some investors this is an example of when doing the right thing morally is also the right thing financially.

• Your article ( World Bank ‘increased finance for fossil fuels’, 18 April) was misleading. Here are the facts. World Bank Group fossil fuel financing fell from $2.2bn in 2013 to $1.3bn in 2014 – around a third of which went to relatively low-carbon natural gas projects. There has been zero World Bank Group financing for greenfield coal power for the past four years and that trend is likely to continue.

Our financing for renewable energy projects (which includes solar, wind, large- and small-scale hydro, geothermal, and biomass) more than doubled from $1.6bn to $3.59bn from 2013 to 2014. Two-thirds of this energy financing was used to provide affordable and sustainable energy for some of the world’s poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia – home to most of the 1.2 billion people without access to energy.

The Oil Change International (OCI) report upon which your article was based, apparently without question, uses a flawed methodology for classifying energy projects that is neither recognised by industry nor by the World Bank Group. OCI categorises as fossil fuel financing all hydropower projects, whether small or large, as well as all electricity grid and transmission projects. Our support for grid upgrading and transmission projects is designed to improve the efficiency of developing country power systems and help deliver a range of sources of energy – including renewables. These projects, for example, help expand access to energy to the two out of three Africans who currently have no electricity.

• The Guardian must be congratulated on its informative climate change articles. But what about the rest of the paper? Why devote a whole page to California’s drought ( In parched California, there’s still plenty of water for nut trees – and for Nestle’s bottles, 20 April) without questioning why this is happening? California depends on melting snow from the Sierra Nevadas for much of its water in summer and autumn.

Group headed by Kofi Annan urges west to help Africa fund solar panels
A high-level international body headed by the former UN secretary general Kofi Annan has urged the west to help Africa finance a new $20bn (?13bn) fund to provide low-cost solar panels for the two thirds of the continent’s population that lacks access to energy.

The annual Africa Progress report says there is an opportunity for Africa to bypass fossil fuels and move straight to low-carbon sources of power if aid is combined with higher taxes, an elimination of subsidies and a crackdown on illicit transfers to tax havens.

Noting that electricity consumption in Spain exceeds that of sub-Saharan Africa, the report says 600,000 deaths a year – almost half of them children – are being caused by household air pollution caused by the burning of charcoal and firewood for cooking.

Bob Geldof, one of the 10 members of the Africa progress panel, said in an interview with the Guardian: “The lack of energy is crippling. Without power there is no development, economic or intellectual.”

The rock musician added: “Energy is the single most important key to eliminating poverty. It takes in everything. Without power, you don’t have the agriculture that’s required. You don’t have the economic development that’s required. You don’t have the education or the health that you need.”

The report says Kenya has piloted a scheme that provides solar power to villages not connected to the grid. A solar panel costs $200, with customers paying for it in small instalments through their mobile phones.

Geldof said: “Home solar kits cost $200. The price is crashing through the floor. The average poor family on less than $2.50 a day could pay 25 cents a day through their mobile phone.”

Annan’s report calls for a global connectivity fund that would provide the $20bn a year annually that would ensure universal access to electricity by 2030. Half the money would come from Africa itself, with the other $10bn coming from aid and low-cost finance.

Kevin Watkins, the director of the UK Overseas Development Institute and lead author of the report, said Africa accounts for only 1% of global carbon emissions but is rich in reserves of fossil fuels. Africa had to be helped to deliver low carbon energy or it would inevitably turn to coal, oil and gas instead.

The report says that access to electricity in Africa is limited and expensive. About 621 million people have no access to electricity and four out of five rely on solid biomass for cooking.

“Africa’s poorest households are the unwitting victims of one of the world’s starkest market failures. We estimate that the 138 million households comprising people living on less than $2.50 a day are spending $10bn annually on energy-related products, such as charcoal, candles, kerosene and firewood.

“Translated into equivalent cost terms, these households spend $10 per kilowatt hour on lighting, which is about 20 times the amount spent by high income households with a connection to the grid for their lighting. The average cost for electricity per kWh in the US is $0.12 and in the UK is $0.15.”

According to the report, current investment in Africa’s energy sector stands at just $8bn, or 0.4% of gross domestic product. The panel estimates that the financing gap for meeting demand and achieving universal access is around $55bn, including the $20bn connectivity fund.

The report adds that almost half of the gap could be covered by increasing sub-Saharan Africa’s tax-to-GDP ratio by 1% of GDP. “Additional revenues could be mobilised by halting the wasteful subsidies now transferred to loss-making utilities, stemming the finance lost as a result of illicit financial transfers, and cautious recourse to bond markets.”

Noting that Africa will pay the highest price for failure to avert a “global climate catastrophe” while making the smallest contribution to climate change, the report says: “For too long, Africa’s leaders have been content to oversee highly centralised energy systems designed to benefit the rich and bypass the poor. Power utilities have been centres of political patronage and corruption.

“The time has come to revamp Africa’s creaking energy infrastructure, while riding the wave of low carbon innovation that is transforming energy systems around the world.

“Millions of Africa’s poorest people are paying among the world’s highest prices for energy because of the cost barriers separating them from affordable, efficient and accessible renewable technologies.”"

85% of British power can be via renewables by 2030, says Greenpeace
Britain can produce 85% of its power via renewable energy by 2030 provided it undergoes significant changes in energy production and use, according to a new study by Greenpeace.

The study attempts to counter the argument that only fossil fuels and nuclear power can keep the lights on for the next few decades. It foresees wind leaping from today’s level of 13 gigawatts (GW) of wind farms in operation – enough to power around 10 million homes – to a level of 77GW in 2030, with solar rising from just more than 5GW to 28GW.

However, the renewables drive would need to be accompanied by a 60% reduction in demand for domestic heating through a home insulation programme and other initiatives, according to the report by energy system analysts, Demand Energy Equality.

“For a long time the government and the fossil fuel industry have peddled the argument that renewables can’t keep the lights on if the wind’s not blowing. This hasn’t been based on evidence, but out of date instincts seemingly from staring out the window to see how windy it is,” said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace .

“For the first time, we have the evidence showing it is possible to keep the power system working and decarbonise the electricity system. We need to go for renewable energy with the help of new smart technology and reducing demand for power too.

“It is hugely ambitious but definitely doable, and it will take the same kind of enthusiasm and financial support from government, normally the sole preserve of the nuclear and fossil fuel industries.”

The plan, which would require a major change in government policies, envisages fossil fuels playing a role via combined gas-fired heat and power projects. Many homes and buildings would also need to move away from gas-fired boilers to their own ground source heat pumps or an electricity source.

The report is published in the run up to the UN-sponsored climate change talks in Paris and at a time when the Conservative government has axed a series of green subsidy schemes to wind and solar on the grounds of cost.

The feasability of decarbonising the UK’s power generation system, which was dependent for a long time on carbon-heavy coal, has long been argued over. Few believe that carbon dioxide can be eliminated entirely from energy production, or at least in the short term.

In 2014, around 30% of UK electricity was generated by coal-fired power plants, 30% by gas, 19% by nuclear and around the same amount by renewables, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.

The new analysis shows a low-carbon energy sector is possible but only if our relationship with energy changes at the national, household and personal level.

There would have to be a huge increase in building efficiency and in the use of smart meters, so that demand could be dialled down when needed.

The cost of the transformation programme is not spelled out, but the Greenpeace report notes that a similar study done in 2011 by Poyry consultants for the parliamentary climate change committee produced a price tag of between ?126bn and ?227bn to achieve 65% renewable penetration by 2030.

Wind would play the greatest role in energy production in the new low carbon world envisaged by Greenpeace. The 55GW of offshore wind and 22GW of onshore wind would require a significant increase in investment.

The wind lobby group RenewableUK said there was no reason why more wind farms should not be built. “There is no technical or logistical barrier to the UK installing up to 55GW by 2030, but it needs political will – a supportive policy framework from government, especially sufficient financial support allocated in the offshore wind pot,” said a spokesman.

David Infield, a professor of electrical engineering at University of Strathclyde, who had read the Greenpeace report, said it was a serious document that deserved attention.

“This is a useful report dealing with the complex issue of absorbing high penetrations of renewable power generation in line with achieving challenging reductions in carbon emissions,” he said.

The big difference is that the energy department’s forecasts are based on what it believes is feasible under certain circumstances by 2050, rather than the 2030 time period used by Greenpeace. This makes a huge difference in mobilising capital and undertaking the work necessary.

The Greenpeace study has ruled out nuclear because of the financial and environmental cost of building new plants, such as Hinkley Point C, and dealing with the legacy of their waste. Equally, carbon capture technology – where carbon dioxide is stored underground as soon as it is emitted – has been excluded as it is deemed an unproven method."

UK green bank seeks pounds 1bn to invest in windfarms
Sean Farrell
The government's Green Investment Bank (Gib) has announced plans to raise pounds 1bn to encourage new investors to put money into offshore windfarms.

Unveiling its first results, the bank said it was looking for long-term investors for a fund managed by a subsidiary that would buy equity stakes in windfarms already in operation. Investors are likely to be pension and sovereign wealth funds. The fund is a new development because it raises private money up front for an industry instead of investing project by project.

Vince Cable, the business secretary, launched the bank in 2012 to invest in wind, biomass and other green schemes that would otherwise lack funding because they are considered too risky or take too long to repay private investment.

In the year to March, the Edinburgh-based bank pledged pounds 668m to 18 projects. Its pre-tax loss for the first full year was pounds 5.75m but it expects to make a profit for the government as investments pay off.

Shaun Kingsbury, chief executive, said: ""We plan to extend our reach into new markets like community-scale renewables. And we plan to raise new capital for the first time through . . . a new pounds 1bn fund for operating offshore wind assets.""

Last week he said the bank could make a far bigger contribution to the UK's green infrastructure needs if the government allowed it to borrow. It has brought in private-sector money alongside its own funds, but by tapping the capital markets it could raise up to pounds 60bn, Kingsbury said.

The bank will present its results in London today and in Edinburgh tomorrow, attended by investors and environmental groups. It will face protests over its funding of biomass and waste-incineration projects. The campaign group Biofuelwatch claims almost pounds 200m of Gib's investments went to these industries and they damage the environment.

Biomass plants burn wood pellets to generate energy. In 2012 the bank agreed to lend pounds 100m to Drax, the power group, to fund conversion of Britain's biggest power station to biomass. Oliver Munnion, of Biofuelwatch, said: ""It is unacceptable that dirty energy is being financed in the name of reducing carbon emissions.""

A Drax spokesman said: ""Drax uses the by-products of existing forest industries such as residues, thinnings and other low-value fibre, which often has no other commercial use."""

Desperate exodus of the climate refugees
Letters
In the last six years, some 140 million people have been forced to move because of climate-related disasters ( Mongolian herders fly steppe blighted by climate extremes and social change, 5 January). Climate change is driving long-term environmental damage and sudden catastrophes, presenting a global long-term threat to human security. According to the UN, by mid-century, one in 30 people could be displaced, many as a result of climate change. Existing global inequalities are exacerbated by the injustice of climate change which severely affects the poorest and most vulnerable, those who have contributed least to the climate crisis. Although climate change and enforced migration are increasingly linked, those displaced have no legal standing under existing international refugee and asylum law.

Record-breaking increases in global temperature mask the unequal impact of planetary warming. Temperature increases in Mongolia have risen by more than double the global average over the past century. Elsewhere, in Somalia, Darfur, Syria and across sub-Saharan Africa, the chronic effects of drought, water scarcity and agricultural crises in rural areas no longer able to sustain their peoples have driven hundreds of thousands of migrants into cities and across borders. Safe haven is provided overwhelmingly by other poor countries, whilst richer countries respond by building walls and fences and a political debate that is toxic and often racist.

In response, our respective organisations, with wide support across civil society and trade unions, are organising Europe’s first national conference on climate refugees in London on 11 February. Our conference will discuss the need for urgent international protection for climate refugees and migrants, and for far stronger public awareness and government leadership to tackle this fundamental issue.

Greek island refugee crisis: local people and tourists rally round migrants
 Read more
The whole world, it seems, is on the move and heading Europe’s way. According to the UNHCR, 137,000 people arrived on Mediterranean shores between January and June this year – almost double the previous year’s figures. Tragically, 1,867 perished trying to make the crossing, most in a spate of shocking mass drownings that has catapulted the migration crisis to the top of the agenda.

For the most part, this catastrophe has been framed as a purely political issue. It has exposed the indecision and weakness of Brussels and petty squabbling among EU member states. Commentators have offered mostly simplistic, sticking-plaster solutions, from destroying traffickers’ boats to internment camps and repatriation for the refugees themselves.

Much less has been said about the macroeconomic push factors compelling migrants and refugees to leave their homelands and what we might do to address them.

Business interests
Around 60 million people have been displaced by war, violence or persecution. Most refugees hail from just a handful of countries riven by strife – Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Pakistan and Afghanistan between them providing more than 25 million displaced people.

These conflicts are influenced by geopolitics, climate change and global inequalities. If we trace these factors back to the start, it’s an uncomfortable truth that many are either caused or exacerbated by business interests. It’s acknowledged, for instance, that this played a big part in the backroom machinations that led to the Iraq war – with Saddam Hussein’s ousting seen by Washington hawks as a first step to securing not just energy supplies but billions of dollars for associated industries from privatisation and reconstruction. Ten years after the 2003 invasion, one estimate put the value of contracts awarded to US and allied companies in the aftermath at $138bn.

 Why Europe's 'opt in' rules on conflict minerals could fail to spark change
Nick Murry

Similarly, the perpetual state of conflict in parts of the DRC is sustained by the illicit trade in conflict minerals that the various state-backed rebel factions seek to profit from. The market for these minerals – not least coltan, a major component of mobile phones – is vast, with European and Asian companies accused of sourcing metals through agents with links to rebel groups.

Recently, Syria has become the focus of geopolitical power play. While Islamic State (IS) and other regional groups must take responsibility for the sickening atrocities we are now witnessing, the continuing destabilisation of Syria appears to have a lot more to do with western-backed strategic gas pipelines in the region than any concern for democracy.

Climate change


What’s less well understood is the role climate change is playing in fuelling conflict. Recent research has suggested a causal link between the prolonged droughts that ravaged Syria’s farmland from 2007 to 2010 with mass internal migration – adding to tensions which contributed to the explosion of violence from 2011 onwards. This in turn has led to one of the biggest displacements of people of modern times.

Climate change has been identified as one of the most significant drivers of human migration. The Environmental Justice Foundation has estimated that there will be 150 million climate refugees worldwide by 2050. It’s already happening – rising sea levels threaten the existence of island states in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, while desertification is driving farmers and pastoralists off the land from the Sahel to Mongolia.

World governments are now preparing their positions ahead of the United Nations climate change conference in Paris this November, which aims to set binding global targets for emissions reduction as well as individual national goals. If past climate summits are anything to go by, we may be disappointed when it comes to the crunch.

But as governments prepare to jockey over targets, business is starting to show leadership. Recently, a seemingly unlikely petition from fossil fuel giants BP, Shell, Total and Statoil, amongst others, demanded a global price on carbon in a letter to the UN’s top climate official, Christiana Figueres.

Critics might well question the motives behind this apparent concern, especially when these firms and a small group of others have been blamed by researchers for producing two-thirds of all carbon emissions since the dawn of the industrial age. But business’ role in stemming the flow of migration around the world can of course be much more tangible and immediate than carbon pricing.

Foreign direct investment (FDI) can be a major driver of economic growth in developing nations – as long as it seeks to grow human potential and eschews extractive practices which deplete resources, damage local environments and offshore any profits. Google’s investment in tech hubs across Africa from Nairobi to Accra points the way to the kind of partnership that can stimulate new high-value industries that take on a life of their own.

We are entering a new phase of realisation that business involvement – and FDI in particular – is about more than just supplying jobs, vital thought that is. It should also fulfil aspirations for social and self-development, and provide sustainable futures, in partnership with people in different parts of the world.

In this context, business becomes the vital component in creating prosperous societies worldwide – societies that people don’t feel they need to escape from in order to find the personal security and opportunities that everyone should have the right to expect."

Today it is accepted, but 20-30 years ago campaigners were struggling to even get an acknowledgement that climate change was happening, let alone that it was manmade. It would have been hard to imagine that one day we might hold the developed nations responsible and start talking about redress for victims of climate change, as we did in 2000.

The nub of ""climate justice"" is the idea that the developed world made the mess and therefore the developed world should pay the price for fixing the problem.

The first climate justice summit was organised to coincide with Cop 6 – the sixth session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference at the Hague in 2000. It was put together by the Rising Tide network as a radical alternative to the official talks.



After the civil war that claimed 250,000 lives ended with last year’s accord, Lucy Lamble investigates how Colombia’s communities plan to build lasting peace

Roger Geffen was at the summit as a civil society activist. He says: ""the message we wanted put out was that what's going on at [Cop6] was the wrong ideas being discussed by the wrong people.

""There were all these people in the developing world who were the real victims of climate change who had not got a voice in the process.""

Ivonne Yanez from Oilwatch International in Ecuador co-ordinated one of the panels at the summit. Her organisation helped to bring representatives from grassroots organisations to the Hague to tell their stories.

She remembers very clearly the experience of meeting Columbian grassroots representative Roberto Afanador Cobaria from the U'wa people. At the time the U'wa people were in the midst of a bitter battle with the oil giants Oxy, who wanted to drill on their sacred land. The U'was believe that the world will end if their lands are disturbed, and they threatened to commit mass suicide if drilling began by jumping from their sacred Cliff of Death. They believed it would be better to die together than to see the end of the world. The U'was eventually won their battle in 2002, and Oxy left their lands.


She adds: ""I remember it was the first time Oilwatch really started to argue that we must 'leave the oil in the soil' to address climate change.""

Kevin Smith now works for the campaign group Platform but at the time of the summit he was living in Amsterdam and working for European Youth for Action, which was part of the Rising Tide network.

He says: ""we were inspired by the incredible resistance that was going on in the global south – the people who were on the frontline – the actions of the Ogoni people, who had been led by Ken Saro Wiwa, in resisting Shell in Nigeria was a huge inspiration for me. Those were the people who were preventing climate change – preventing climate change wasn't about a bunch of northern bureaucrats being lobbied by fuel companies in a conference centre, it was about groups like the Ogoni people who were preventing Shell from operating in the Niger Delta.

""These are UK companies, so I got involved because I wanted to take some responsibility for the actions of UK oil companies abroad.""

Fake conference passes enabled activists to get in and disrupt the COP talks. Someone put a cream pie in the face of the lead US negotiator Frank Loy during a press conference, activists got on the roof beams and showered the delegates with fake carbon credits. All the protestors' activities were published in a fanzine that was distributed after the event.

Yanez thinks that coming together to share ideas is always a useful process. She lists the battles that grassroots organisations have won since that first climate justice summit in 2000: the U'was battle to rid themselves of oil giant Oxy; the achievements of the Ogoni people against Shell; Costa Rica's decision to declare the country an oil-free zone and the Bolivian government's decision to give greater rights to its indigenous peoples.

But she also warns that there are many battles left to fight: ""Just yesterday we presented the Ecuadorian government with a petition signed by 750,000 people calling for a referendum on drilling for oil in the Yasuni national park. We are in a race now to save the Yasuni.""


The battles are the same as they ever were: people trying to minimise the effects of fossil fuel use. The difference is that after the first climate justice summit the language changed: it became more focused.

Campaigners started pointing to the countless examples of people whose lives have been ruined by climate change – the subsistence farmers whose lands have been plagued by droughts and desertification – and asking very specifically: where is the justice in this?

Organisations such as the the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance today links hundreds of church groups with development and humanitarian aid organisations who are working together to exert pressure on western governments to pay their dues.

Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, from the alliance, told the Guardian's John Vidal: ""An international mechanism to address loss and damage from climate change is a clear demand of people in developing countries. Our governments cannot back down from our demand for compensation for the harm caused by the climate change locked-in by the pollution of the rich.""

While it may be hard to pin down the exact origins of the idea of climate justice, it is clear that the summit in 2000 was a turning point for its prominence in the climate change movement. Today we see the language of justice in the campaigns not only of grassroots organisations but that of international campaigners such as Oxfam."

With the release of the fifth report by the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change, calls for the international community to once and for all transcend its divisions and get serious at last about climate change have multiplied. The content of the report is nothing less than frightful: global warming has been occurring since the middle of the 20th century at an unprecedented rate, already engendering all sorts of disasters. No doubt is permitted as to the principal cause of the phenomenon: mankind. This changes everything, to quote the title of Naomi Klein's forthcoming book. Because climate change will affect all of humanity, it renders past conflicts and traditional political categories – left and right among them – obsolete.

Well, this widespread ecological consensus isn't getting us anywhere, and it will certainly not help us fight climate change effectively. The environmental crisis is not brought about by an endless proclivity of mankind to destroy its environment and deplete natural resources, as Jared Diamond, among others, would make us believe in his neo-Malthusian bestsellers. It finds its origin in the logic of a quite recent system, one that was born in the 19th century: industrial capitalism.

Capitalism is productivist, ie it seeks to increase productivity indefinitely (it has no embedded self-limiting mechanism). Moreover, it is predatory, programmed to exploit and exhaust natural resources and biodiversity. Finally, it is irreparably tied to a carbon – coal, oil and gas – energy system. To use the words of German Marxist Elmar Altvater, industrial capitalism is necessarily fossil capitalism. All three features combine to give way to the dreadful situation described by the IPCC report.

This is exactly why the environmental crisis doesn't render past conflicts and divisions obsolete, but on the contrary reinforces them. Climate change doesn't change anything, it rather worsens existing problems. To paraphrase a famous dictum by Lenin, it is the highest stage of capitalism.



With climate change, a long-standing form of inequality is becoming more and more visible: environmental inequalities. These refer to inequalities that different segments of the population – class, gender, racial groups – experience in their relationship with nature, and more specifically with regard to the effects of climate change. They have existed since the dawn of capitalism. Yet they haven't been as much advertised as other forms of inequalities, especially by the workers' movement. The environmental crisis, as the IPCC report recognises, is rapidly worsening them.

Environmental inequalities are manifold: your chances of being exposed to pollutions or toxic waste, for example, are much greater if you belong to the working class, or to a racial minority, whatever the country you live in. Similarly, natural or industrial risks are unequally distributed among the population, since flood-prone areas or neighbourhoods adjacent to chemical plants will typically be cheaper, and hence attract poorer families. Of course, there are exceptions, but the overall picture is clear.

Energy poverty is a classic example of environmental inequality. In Greece, for instance, to heat an average-sized apartment with fuel will cost around €1,000 a year. With wood, this figure falls to €250. The devastating economic crisis that began in 2008 led many Greeks to choose the latter solution.

This, however, has caused a steep increase in illegal cutting of wood, which has accelerated deforestation. At the same time, austerity measures imposed on the country by the European Union forced the government to sack many forest rangers, which facilitated illegal cutting, and hence deforestation. As a consequence of the increase in wood-heating, air pollution in Athens has risen more than 15% since the beginning of the crisis. As is clear from this example, the economic and the environmental crisis are in fact one and the same crisis.

Environmental inequalities not only exist inside countries, but between countries or regions of the world. ""Ecological debt"" is a notion social movements from the global south have put forward in the past years. By exploiting their natural resources, and hence by durably damaging their environment, industrialised countries owe a huge debt to countries of the south. This ecological debt is much bigger than the financial debt the south supposedly owes the north. Taking it into account would completely transform the way we think about the global economy.



In sum, if capital is a social relation, as Karl Marx wrote, we should conceive of nature as part of this relation. In addition to class, gender and racial inequalities capitalism generates environmental inequalities. The relationship between these forms of inequalities is complex. Sometimes, two (or more) of them will combine to give way to a particular outcome, say environmental racism, ie the combination of environmental and racial inequality. Environmental racism was denounced by the environmental justice movement in the US at the beginning of the 1980s.

In other cases, one sort of inequality will mask another, as in the conflict in Darfur, which is often presented as an ethnic conflict, but is in fact caused – at least in good part – by climate change, as UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon has recognised. Under capitalism, inequalities have a cumulative dimension: the more you suffer from one sort of inequality, the greater the chances are you will suffer from another one.

Intersectionality has been a major theme in contemporary critical theory. It refers to the fact that some individuals or groups, say black women or poor homosexuals, experience multiple forms of domination at once. To the intersection of race, class and gender inequalities, we should now add a fourth dimension: the environment. The climate crisis, no doubt, will increase the weight of this factor in the decades to come.

What does this tell us about the fight against climate change? If the IPCC report admits that the environmental crisis will not be felt equally across the population, it didn't push the argument until its logical political conclusion. Because they are concretely experienced in the daily lives of individuals, environmental inequalities represent a powerful lever of mobilisation against climate change. Instead of abstract calls for the international community to act, what should be stressed is the differential impact of the climate crisis on populations.

Hence division, not unity, is the key to winning this battle. Using environmental inequalities as a mobilising lever presents the further advantage of bringing the discussion directly to the core of the matter: the productivist, predatory and fossil logic of capitalism."

Comment: Let the money talk: Disinvesting in firms that don't curb emissions shows the way forward for climate campaigners
Mary Robinson
The recent extreme flooding in the UK and Ireland has highlighted the devastating effect our changing climate can have; but if we do not take action fast, future generations will experience weather shocks on a far greater scale. Our planet is warming to a catastrophic extent, and the human race must step up.
The divestment campaign - which originated in the United States and is now making its way across the Atlantic - is one shining example of what is needed to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Transforming our economic system to one based on low-carbon production and consumption can create inclusive sustainable development and reduce inequality. To achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy, it is crucial that we invest in social protection, enhance workers' skills for redeployment in a low-carbon economy, and promote access to sustainable development for all.
The premise of the divestment campaign is simple: non-profit organisations must move their investments away from fossil fuels, reducing the power and influence this industry has on society. Initially focusing on universities - in the UK alone, their endowment funds have invested pounds 5bn in coal, oil and gas - the campaign's message has since had an influence on other organisations, such as the Church of England, which this month said it would pull its investment in companies that didn't do enough to fight climate change.
The reality of climate change, of which Britons have had all too much experience recently, may be the catalyst for even more ambitious action.
We already have the scientific knowledge available to us. Among members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations climate panel, there is a 97% consensus that humans are causing global warming. They know that the majority of the world's fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground.
The active role of young people is worth noting. As with the anti-apartheid campaign in the 1980s, students today are taking action that can determine their futures - and the futures of generations to come - for the better. They are showing the world that, once again, a transformation in how we grow our economies is essential. This is how inter-generational equity can be achieved: promoting a new investment model that responds to the risks posed by climate change. By avoiding investment in high-carbon assets that become obsolete, and by prioritising sustainable alternatives, we build capacity and resilience, particularly for more vulnerable people - while lowering carbon emissions.
We do not have much time. Global investment in clean technologies is now at about $300bn (pounds 180bn) a year, but according to the International Energy Agency, this would need to reach $1tn by 2030 to keep within a 2C warmer world, the threshold above which climate change would become catastrophic.
Meanwhile, the temptation to invest in coal, oil and gas is heightened by countries' fossil fuel subsidies that, worldwide, amount to $1.9tn a year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Such subsidies enable the fossil fuel industry to perpetuate the notion that renewable energy is more expensive. Of course, in withdrawing any fossil fuel subsidies, absolute consideration has to be given to accessing energy for the poorest, therefore investment has to be made in sustainable energy alternatives.
National leaders have an important role to play, and with their electorate behind them, they will be far more willing to act.

Comment: Prophetic visions can help to save the planet: Comment & Debate: Obstacles to climate action are crumbling. 0ur leaders now have an opportunity to marry the moral and economic case
Rowan Williams
The past year has seen the obstacles blocking action on climate change beginning to crumble. Opposition on scientific grounds looks pretty unpersuasive in the light of what has come from the experts on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Their seven-year study states that they are now 95% certain that human activity is a significant and avoidable element in driving climate change around the world. Predicted changes in the climate are now being observed in the most vulnerable countries, confirming the predictive models that have been used.
The suggestion that action on this would have too great an economic cost is likewise looking increasingly shaky. This month the New Climate Economy report will be published by a global commission, including Felipe Calderon, the former president of Mexico; Paul Polman, the chief executive of Unilever; the economist Nicholas Stern; and Chad Holloway, the chairman of the Bank of America - as well as a substantial number of finance ministers from around the world. This report will show that action on climate change is entirely compatible with economic growth in almost all countries and that the economic benefits, both short and long term, will outweigh the costs.
It will reinforce the findings of a report published last October by a group of financial heavyweights outlining the threat to US businesses of doing nothing in the face of climate change. Risky Business - by former US treasury secretaries Hank Paulson, Robert Rubin and George Schultz; Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York; and the billionaire investor Thomas Steyer - argued, purely on economic grounds, that ignoring the challenge is folly.
Another stumbling block that is also beginning to disappear is political inertia. Politicians, working with short-term election cycles, have constantly been tempted to kick this particular can down the road. But President Obama, having spoken powerfully about the need for action, is now backing up his rhetoric with legislation limiting carbon emissions from US power plants. There are similarly encouraging signs in China, where lethal levels of atmospheric pollution, especially in cities, have at last goaded the government to start to move in the right direction.
With actors who have traditionally dragged their feet taking the lead, and with the urgency for action in developing nations beyond any serious doubt, it is now those who have traditionally been more proactive - European nations in particular - who need to step up to the mark.
The hope is that the New York summit of world leaders on 23 September, at which climate change will take centre stage, will be the next major prompt to agreed action. Hosted by the UN secretary general, this meeting will show the real leaders in responding to climate change, and should kick-start negotiations ahead of the crucial UN climate summit in Paris in December next year which must decide on limiting greenhouse gas emissions. David Cameron became prime minister on the promise of ""Vote blue, go green"". He promised to lead the ""greenest government ever"". His presence and actions at this month's summit will be a significant test of these commitments and aspirations.
The moral case for action is clear. It is those suffering the most who carry the least historic responsibility for our situation. The wealthier industrialised nations have the power to act and secure a safe world for today's poorest and tomorrow's children. Christian Aid is soon to publish a report by Susan Durber examining the links between theology and climate change, in which it will be made very plain that the call forÊclimateÊjusticeÊis something that echoes clearly the challenges found in the biblical prophets to a complacent and short-sighted society. As Durber says: ""Prophets are sometimes unpopular and can be ridiculed by those who have much to lose if people really were to open their eyes. But they are those who consistently, and without fear, speak what they believe to be the truth.""
What is needed from our politicians is leadership that takes the long view and breaks free of the tight cycle of calculated electoral advantage - a calculation that often misses the issues that most directly affect everyone's wellbeing. We're starting to see this with the publication of a paper from the Department of Energy and Climate Change which outlines the need for, and the benefit of, an ambitious climate deal at the Paris meeting. But as Christiana Figueres, the leading UN spokesperson on climate change, said in a speech in St Paul's Cathedral last May, we need to see action already in place this year if the deal in 2015 is to be strong enough: we need the groundwork laid, and we need clear signs that the political will is there.
The climate summit in New York offers the perfect opportunity for our leaders to show that there is indeed a sensitivity to the kind of prophetic vision that rouses us from complacency, and a will to secure the future of our children and grandchildren.

Protesters gather around the world for a strong climate change deal
Hundreds of thousands of people around the world, from Sydney to New York, marched on Sunday to call on world leaders meeting in Paris to agree a strong climate change deal.
In Paris, pairs of shoes given by Pope Francis and Ban Ki-moon were among a collection set out in the Place de la Rpublique to represent those who were unable to march due to a ban by the French authorities in the aftermath of 13 November terror attacks. People lit candles, sang songs and wandered around the shoes, many of which were later given to a charity for distributing to homeless people.
ÒItÕs an incredible monument to the voices that have been silenced but also to that hope for action that comes out of this city,Ó said Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director at Avaaz, which helped organise the shoe campaign.
A peaceful Òhuman chainÓ formed in central Paris from thousands of people including children holding placards reading ÒclimatejusticeÓ and Òkeep it [fossil fuels] in the groundÓ.
The atmosphere turned ugly when a group of anti-capitalists and anarchists began throwing shoes and letting off loud bangs thought to be fireworks, leading to clashes with police. Riot police were deployed and teargas was used to disperse the unauthorised protest, which resulted in some 200 arrests.
ÒIt is more against capitalism [than a call for climate action],Ó said one of the protesters, who appeared to have hijacked the peaceful event by climate activists.
In London, an audience of thousands braved 40mph gusts, dressed as polar bears, holding aloft solar panels and lying on the ground in Òdie-insÓ to highlight the impact of global warming in the developing world. Organisers said more than 50,000 people had turned out.
The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, addressed the march, accompanied by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, and two other shadow ministers.
ÒThose who are sitting around the tables in Paris have an enormous opportunity in front of them. Do not let them flake it or fool us,Ó Corbyn told an audience of thousands on Park Lane.
The Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said: ÒDavid CameronÊis taking a wrecking ball to environmental policy.Ó
A group of Smi, an indigenous people of Sweden who say their way of life is threatened by climate change, sang on stage in London, in between a series of speeches by environmentalists.
Craig Bennett, chief executive of Friends of the Earth, told the marchers: ÒThis is a fantastic display of people power with thousands taking to the streets to demand urgent action on climate change.Ó
More than 2,200 marches were scheduled around the world, with events in locations ranging from Madrid and Rome, which saw 20,000 people each on their streets, to Benin and SanaÕa in Yemen, where about 70 people gathered and held up a banner despite air raids, nearby.
In Copenhagen, where the last UN climate summit ended in failure in 2009, people marched saying they hoped for Òbetter resultsÓ in Paris.
Organisers in Australia and New Zealand said that marches there broke records, with more than 40,000 sweltering in SydneyÕs heat and at least 3,000 people gathering in Canberra. Marches also took place in Melbourne and other cities.
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who has previously called for companies to divest from fossil fuels, said that if the world carried on as usual after the Paris talks, it might not get another opportunity to stave off dangerous global warming.
ÒShould they develop a legally binding treaty, it will signal the end of the age of reckless consumption, exploitation and greed.Ó

Coalition of business leaders challenges 2C climate change target
A group of high-profile business leaders has challenged governments to set strong targets and not slam the door on limiting warming to 1.5C.
On Monday, a Paris meeting aimed at reaching a global deal to fight climate change kicks up to a gear, with government ministers taking charge of negotiations.
As ministers arrived in Paris, the chief executives of companies such as Virgin, Marks & Spencer, LÕOreal and Unilever said it was critical for governments to reach for stronger targets that would free the worldÕs economy from carbon emissions by 2050 and avoid dangerous warming.
The corporate leaders, members and supporters of the B Team, a coalition of chief executives for climate action, said governments should aim for a stronger target than the agreed goal of 2C and aim for actions that would eventually limit warming to 1.5C.
The support for a 1.5C goal puts some of the worldÕs most powerful corporate leaders in sync with small islands and poor countries that are most vulnerable to climate change Ð as well as campaign groups which have been pressing rich countries to up their ambition.
ÒWe believe that net zero by 2050 would at least get us to 2 degrees, leaving the door open for further reduction to 1.5, which should be something we should be looking at in the future,Ó said Jochen Zeitz, the former chief executive of Puma and founder with Richard Branson of the B Team. ÒWe believe the business case for net zero in 2050 is irrefutable,Ó Zeitz told a seminar on Sunday.
Related: Eco audit: Should we be aiming to keep global warming to 1.5C, not 2C?
Branson, a long-time supporter of action on climate change, said companies were looking to the talks to provide a clear signal Ð and would be able to get to carbon neutrality by mid-century.
ÒWe just need governments to set some rules,Ó he said. ÒCarbon neutral by 2050, we will have 35 years to get there. ItÕs actually just not that big a deal, but we need clear long-term goals set by governments this week. Give us that goal and we will make it happen.Ó
The 1.5C goal is seen as a matter of life and death for some of the worldÕs poorest countries, and has been a key issue in climate negotiations.
Vulnerable countries argue that the 2C goal backed by the US, China and Europe would seal the fate of hundreds of millions of people in low-lying countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines.
The business leaders said they were framing their demand on governments in terms of emissions reductions, with a goal of net zero by 2050, because those were targets companies could set for themselves.
Privately, however, some of the leaders said they were concerned about the politics of coming out explicitly for 1.5C now, instead of 2C. But they acknowledged that was indeed their goal.
ÒYes, we are for 1.5 degrees,Ó Mo Ibrahim, the founder of Celtel International, one of AfricaÕs leading mobile phone companies, told the seminar.
The companies which signed on to the B Team argue that their support for a strong emissions reductions goal helps to keep pressure on governments to reach for a strong deal.
The corporate leaders suggested their support for a strong agreement provides an important counterweight to the fossil fuel industry, especially in the US, which has blocked action on climate change. But they said they believed that the economy had reached a tipping point in terms of moving towards greener sources of energy.
The French hosts of the climate talks on Sunday said they had recruited a team of ministers and officials from 14 countries to help put together a deal. The leaders immediately convened a series of small working groups that will meet to home in on elements of a deal.

Negotiators said they felt reasonably optimistic for a strong outcome at the Paris meeting. In contrast to previous climate meetings Ð which deadlocked early Ð officials managed to pare down a draft text on schedule, leaving a full week for ministers to reach agreement.
Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and now head of the Foundation forÊClimateÊJustice, said she believed the draft released on Saturday had kept prospects alive for a 1.5C goal.
ÒWe have a commitment to stay below 2 degrees and keep open the prospect of 1.5C,Ó Robinson said. ÒKeeping that window of 1.5, which I think will happen in this agreement, is extremely important.Ó
The prospects for achieving that goal are extremely daunting. Scientists estimate the world has already warmed by 1C since the industrial revolution.
More than 100 of the 196 countries at the Paris meeting want a 1.5C goal. But until recently the 1.5C goal was dismissed as a pipe dream by rich countries and the bigger developing countries.
Now, however, there is greater recognition of 1.5C as a threshold for dangerous climate change.
With current warming of 1C, low-lying states in Africa and Asia and island countries were already exposed to extreme storms and weather phenomena such as this yearÕs strong El Nino.
Last week, a group of countries most at risk broke away from the big developing country bloc and signed a declaration urging a 1.5C target.

WhatÕs really at stake at the Paris climate conference now marches are banned
Whose security gets protected by any means necessary? Whose security is casually sacrificed, despite the means to do so much better? Those are the questions at the heart of the climate crisis, and the answers are the reason climate summits so often end in acrimony and tears.
The French governmentÕs decision to ban protests, marches and other Òoutdoor activitiesÓ during the Paris climate summit is disturbing on many levels. The one that preoccupies me most has to do with the way it reflects the fundamental inequity of the climate crisis itself Ð and that core question of whose security is ultimately valued in our lopsided world.
Related: Organisers of cancelled Paris climate march urge global show of support
Here is the first thing to understand. The people facing the worst impacts of climate change have virtually no voice in western debates about whether to do anything serious to prevent catastrophic global warming. Huge climate summits like the one coming up in Paris are rare exceptions. For just two weeks every few years, the voices of the people who are getting hit first and worst get a little bit of space to be heard at the place where fateful decisions are made. ThatÕs why Pacific islanders and Inuit hunters and low-income people of colour from places like New Orleans travel for thousands of miles to attend. The expense is enormous, in both dollars and carbon, but being at the summit is a precious chance to speak about climate change in moral terms and to put a human face to this unfolding catastrophe.
The next thing to understand is that even in these rare moments, frontline voices do not have enough of a platform in the official climate meetings, in which the microphone is dominated by governments and large, well-funded green groups. The voices of ordinary people are primarily heard in grassroots gatherings parallel to the summit, as well as in marches and protests, which in turn attract media coverage. Now the French government has decided to take away the loudest of these megaphones, claiming that securing marches would compromise its ability to secure the official summit zone where politicians will meet.
Once again, the message is: our security is non-negotiable, yours is up for grabs
Some say this is all fair game against the backdrop of terror. But a UN climate summit is not like a meeting of the G8 or the World Trade Organisation, where the powerful meet and the powerless try to crash their party. Parallel Òcivil societyÓ events are not an addendum to, or distractions from, the main event. They are integral to the process. Which is why the French government should never have been allowed to decide which parts of the summit it would cancel and which it would still hold.
Rather, after the horrific attacks of 13 November, it needed to determine whether it had the will and capacity to host the whole summit Ð with full participation from civil society, including in the streets. If it could not, it should have delayed and asked another country to step in. Instead the Hollande government has made a series of decisions that reflect a very particular set of values and priorities about who and what will get the full security protection of the state. Yes to world leaders, football matches and Christmas markets; no to climate marches and protests pointing out that the negotiations, with the current level of emission targets, endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions if not billions of people.
And who knows where this will end? Should we expect the UN to arbitrarily revoke the credentials of half the civil society participants? Those most likely to make trouble inside the fortressed summit? I would not be at all surprised.
Related: Call climate change what it is: violence | Rebecca Solnit
It is worth thinking about what the decision to cancel marches and protests means in real, as well as symbolic, terms. Climate change is a moral crisis because every time governments of wealthy nations fail to act, it sends a message that we in the global north are putting our immediate comfort and economic security ahead of the suffering and survival of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on Earth. The decision to ban the most important spaces where the voices of climate-impacted people would have been heard is a dramatic expression of this profoundly unethical abuse of power: once again, a wealthy western country is putting security for elites ahead of the interests of those fighting for survival. Once again, the message is: our security is non-negotiable, yours is up for grabs.
One further thought. I write these words from Stockholm, where I have been doing a series of climate-related public events. When I arrived, the press was having a field day with a tweet sent by SwedenÕs environment minister, sa Romson. Shortly after news broke of the attacks in Paris, she tweeted her outrage and sadness at the loss of life. Then she tweeted that she thought it would be bad news for the climate summit, a thought that occurred to everyone I know who is in any way connected to this environmental moment. Yet she was pilloried for her supposed insensitivity Ð how could she be thinking about climate change at a time of such carnage?
The reaction was revealing, since it took for granted the notion that climate change is a minor issue, a cause without real casualties, frivolous even. Especially when serious issues like war and terrorism are taking centre stage. It made me think about something the writer Rebecca Solnit wrote not long ago: Òclimate change is violence.Ó
Related: 'Our melting, shifting, liquid world': celebrities read poems on climate change
It is. Some of the violence is grindingly slow: rising seas that gradually erase whole nations, and droughts that kill many thousands. Some of the violence is terrifyingly fast: storms with names such as Katrina and Haiyan that steal thousands of lives in a single roiling event. When governments and corporations knowingly fail to act to prevent catastrophic warming, that is an act of violence. It is a violence so large, so global and inflicted against so many temporalities simultaneously (ancient cultures, present lives, future potential) that there is not yet a word capable of containing its monstrousness. And using acts of violence to silence the voices of those who are most vulnerable to climate violence is yet more violence.
In explaining why forthcoming football matches would go on as scheduled, FranceÕs secretary of state for sport said: Ò Life must go on.Ó Indeed it must. ThatÕs why I joined theÊclimateÊjusticeÊmovement. Because when governments and corporations fail to act in a way that reflects the value of all of life on Earth, they must be protested.

Why theÊUniversity of EdinburghÊmust divest from all fossil fuels now
It was wrong for American Energy Alliance and ExxonMobil to claim that the oil and coal industries are helping people living in poverty in the global south, and it is wrong for Professor Charlie Jeffery to do so too ( Why theÊUniversity of EdinburghÊwill not divest from all fossil fuels, theguardian.com, 12 May). The worldÕs poorest people are already facing hardship from climate-related effects on food supply and water.
Pitting fossil fuel divestment against the worldÕs poor is a cynical move which ignores the fact that the worldÕs poorest people are being impacted most severely by the effects of global warming, and will continue to suffer its worst impacts over the coming years, while many of the governments in the global south are the most vociferous opponents of the fossil fuel industry, and the strongest advocates for binding reductions targets.
Professor Jeffery rightly identifies coal and tar sands as two of the worst polluting forms of fossil fuel energy. To avoid catastrophic climate change by keeping the global temperature rise below 2C, the fossil fuel industry needs to leave 82% of todayÕs coal reserves in the ground and CanadaÕs tar sands must go almost untouched. TheÊUniversity of EdinburghÕs decision to continue investment is indicative of its failure to recognise both these stark facts and the urgency of the issue. Professor JefferyÕs statement also makes no mention of the human rights, increasing poverty or ill-health of communities on the frontline of fossil fuel extraction. Will the university continue to invest in fossil fuel companies whose ongoing activities devastate communities such as those in Niger delta and Alberta, Canada ?
In particular, Professor Jeffery states that continued investment is justified where companies are investing in technology that helps address the effects of climate change and reduce carbon emissions. This condition is vague, weak and ineffective given the energy mix present in most fossil fuel companiesÕ portfolios. Will Edinburgh continue to invest in companies spending a small fraction of their wealth on reducing emissions, while currently spending billions on exploiting tar sands and coal in new projects with shelf-lives of decades? Does investing in research into renewable energy that then sits unused in a closed archive meet this condition?
As part of theÊclimateÊjusticeÊmovement, we absolutely agree that it is rich countries that have both the responsibility and the capacity to phase out fossil fuels first and fastest. But the interests of poorer countries are best served by keeping global temperature increases below 2C, and that means fossil fuels must remain in the ground. Poorer countries need to be supported in their efforts to leapfrog the fossil-fuel-driven development model that created wealth in the global north, but which also caused the climate crisis we now face. ThatÕs why it is so essential that funds currently invested in destructive fossil fuel projects be urgently diverted to developing renewable energy systems that can provide safe, sustainable energy for people everywhere, and as part of a Just Transition into dignified, well-paying alternative work for those currently employed in fossil fuel industries.

It is now harder for UK citizens to hold government and polluters accountable for damaging the environment than it is for people in China, the head of a leading environmental law firm has told the Guardian.
Changes to the costs and administration of environmental legal challenges in the UK could potentially Òchill the ability of citizens to bring casesÓ to protect the environment, said James Thornton, chief executive of NGO ClientEarth, ahead of delivering the annual Garner lecture to a host of environmental leaders on Wednesday.
In the lecture, Thornton will criticise government proposals to dramatically increase the amount for which charities and individuals are liable if they lose an environmental case deemed to be in the public interest.
The costs system is currently Òthe most punitive in the EU and is moving in the wrong directionÓ, discouraging citizens from challenging government actions that affect the environment, he will say.
In April his firm won a legal battle at the supreme court in which the government was found to be breaching EU limits on air pollution Ð linked to thousands of premature deaths every year Ð and ordered to produce a clean-up plan by the end of the year.

In China and the US, citizens can bring an environmental legal challenge in the public interest Ð a case where they stand to gain no more than any other member of the public Ð without fear of incurring costs should they lose.
But in the UK charities and individuals launching environmental challenges face paying initial costs to the other side of up to £5,000 and £10,000 if they lose, while the defendant Ð in most cases the government Ð stands to pay £35,000.
The government is now proposing to reduce the initial cost caps for defendants to £25,000 while doubling the cost caps for charities and individuals, with the risk of these limits being removed altogether by a judge.
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ÒThese proposals are designed to make sure challenges can still be brought without encouraging meritless claims which cause unreasonable costs and delays.Ó

China has introduced measures to empower citizens to use the law as a tool to protect the environment, according to Thornton. In January, a new environmental protection law was introduced which allows NGOs to launch legal challenges against polluters for the first time.
There have been 25 such legal challenges launched since the enaction of the law in China, Thornton will say. His firm is now helping the Chinese authorities to draft improved laws and regulations. But others have questioned whether the crackdown on polluters will be enforced in China, where it is believed that 4,000 are dying prematurely every day as a result of air pollution.
ÒThis is a real gamechanger where citizens can sue companies in Chinese court. It is an amazing change and in their attitude we have much to learn,Ó Thornton will say.
Thornton also said it is not possible under UK law to hold fossil fuel companies adequately to account for emitting more pollution than their permits allow because unlike in other countries, you must be able to prove they have undertaken criminal activity or that the claimant has suffered personal damage.
ÒYou canÕt really challenge a polluter here. You can do it in China, you can do it in France, you can do it in America, but not here. The law doesnÕt allow it,Ó he said.

His intervention comes less than three weeks before the start of a landmark climate change conference in Paris where world leaders will meet to negotiate a new deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
ÒItÕs a sad demonstration of a country going retrograde at a time when they should be saying publicly in every possible way that we need to protect the environment and if we get it wrong citizens should have the right to come and talk to judges in a way thatÕs effective,Ó he told the Guardian.
ÒWe are entering a new era in which governments are going to have to work harder, be more transparent and bring citizens along if weÕre going to solve climate change for example. These [proposed changes] are ways of trying to remove yourself from being challenged by citizens when you act illegally. ItÕs terrifying.Ó

In 2012 protests erupted in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina over the demolition of a much beloved local park to build a business complex. A movement under the slogan ÒThis Park is OursÓ aimed originally at protecting the green space soon broadened into a collective movement aimed against corruption, lack of transparency, economic inequality and dwindling social services. Hundreds of protesters from all social classes and religions gathered daily in the endangered park, becoming part of a Bosnian spring that came to represent a struggle for human dignity and accountability under most articulated civic movement since the 1992-1995 war.
From Banja Luka to Gezi Park, Turkey to Rosia Montana, Romania to the land wars across India, social conflicts are increasingly playing out through battles around environmental resources and in defence of common land.
These struggles have sometimes toppled governments, such as the coup in Madagascar in 2008 that brought Òland-grabbingÓ to global attention when Daewoo was given a lease to grow food and biofuels for export on half the countryÕs land. But most of the time, the evictions, forced relocations and the violent repression of those impacted by contamination from gold mines, oil extraction, plantations and agribusiness operations are rarely covered in the press. Ecological violence inflicted upon the poor is often not news but simply considered to be part of the costs of Òbusiness as usualÓ.
While statistics on strike action have been collected since the late 19th century for many countries and now globally by the International Labour Organisation, there is no one body that tracks the occurrence and frequency of mobilisations and protests related to the environment. It was this need to better understand and to track such contentious activity that motivated the Atlas of Environmental Justice project, an online interactive map that catalogues localised stories of resistance against damaging projects: from toxic waste sites to oil refining operations to areas of deforestation. 
EJatlas aims to make ecological conflicts more visible and to highlight the structural impacts of economic activities on the most vulnerable populations. It serves as a reference for scientists, journalists, teachers and a virtual space for information, networking and knowledge sharing among activists, communities and concerned citizens. 
The EJatlas was inspired by the work of participating Environmental Justice Organisations, such as Grain, the World Rainforest Movement and Oilwatch International, OCMAL, the Latin American Observatory of Mining Conflicts, whose work fighting and supporting impacted communities for 20-30 years now has helped articulate a global movement for environmental justice. The global atlas of environmental justice is an initiative of Ejolt, a European supported research project that brings together 23 organisations to catalogue and analyse ecological conflicts. The conflicts are entered by collaborating activists and researchers and moderated by a team at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. 
At the moment the atlas documents 1,400 conflicts, with the ability to filter across over 100 fields describing the actors, the forms of mobilisation from blockades to referendums, impacts and outcomes. It resembles in many ways a medieval world map Ð while some regions have been mapped, others remain Òblank spotsÓ still to be filled. While much work remains to be done, the work so far offers several insights into the nature and shape of environmental resistance today.

Many believe the fight to combat climate change hinges on the aligned interests of capital and state. Give the Elon Musks of the world enough time and resources and they will innovate us out of impending climate catastrophe. Get the G20 in a room and they will hammer out a deal and create regulations to enforce it. Or so the thinking in some circles goes.

Yet throughout history, the interests of the state have slid into alignment with big oil and big profits rather than lining up with our rivers, our air, our wildlife and our people. 

On Friday, men who disavow climate change and profit mightily from fossil fuels will take charge. In a global race to the bottom, there’s no telling how far downriver these shortsighted profiteers will sell our future generations.

Capital may flow soullessly to the highest return, and for now, the state at all levels may be in the hands of reactionaries. But the first people of this land, who often live on the frontlines of our metastasizing climate disaster, remain resolute.

It is our sacred responsibility to protect and preserve this planet for future generations. Where governments barter away the health of our planet and the wellbeing of our people, making bargain after Faustian bargain with investors and developers reaching for short-term wealth, indigenous movements and their allies are asserting their rights and sovereignties to protect land, water and people for future generations.

In their words and actions, they are advancing a powerful vision for indigenous governance and stewardship of the planet’s lands, waters and resources as a viable alternative to the truncated vision and broken systems that threaten our collective future. With decades and even centuries of struggle as their anchor and Standing Rock as their lodestar, they are pointing the way forward.

But if recent and longstanding history of state repression and colonization is any indication, the road ahead will bring indigenous nations into head-on conflict with capital and state. If their communities and our environment are to prevail, people of conscience must stand with them.



On 20 November, in below freezing temperatures, the Morton County sheriff’s department turned fire hoses, teargas, rubber bullets and concussion grenades on unarmed water protectors just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. The protesters were part of an indigenous-led coalition camped near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers on lands promised to the Oceti Sakowin, or Great Sioux Nation, in the long-broken Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851.

On lands unlawfully taken from Oceti Sakowin ancestors, the water protectors stood strong as the environment’s last line of defense against the proposed Dakota Access pipeline – a nearly 1,200 mile $3.7bn pipe built to carry Bakken crude from North Dakota’s fracking fields to Illinois. That night, hundreds were injured. Hundreds more were arrested. Environmental activist Sophia Wilansky was maimed by a concussion grenade.

On 5 December, just a few short weeks after the showdown, the Army Corps of Engineers denied Dakota Access a key permit, suspending all drilling under the Missouri river until an environmental review is completed. It was a remarkable and historic triumph.

Indigenous Americans – the poorest of the poor and the most likely to be killed by law enforcement – won a monumental victory for the planet, indigenous rights and the forces of conscience against capital. Their rallying cry, “Water is Life!” echoed around the world.

To win, leaders at Standing Rock marshaled thousands – even millions – of allies. They paired indigenous and treaty rights, recognized, affirmed and protected in various ways by the United States and the United Nations, with a moving, spiritual narrative and on-the-ground direct actions. Their message was simple, their aims clearly defined, their strategies and tactics inclusive and their voices authentic.

While lighting the seven council fires of the Oceti Sakowin and reasserting abrogated treaty rights, indigenous leaders simultaneously articulated a radical indigenous vision for a more just and harmonious relationship between land, water and people.



Before the frightening might of an ascendant right wing, which aligns capital and state against people and planet, many are ripe for despair and poised for retreat. But the indigenous movement is pointing the way forward.

That way consists of forming alliances, building community and taking direct action. It is rooted in recognition of indigenous rights and sovereignties. It is initiated by people on the ground where the environment is under threat, and it builds into a global call to action.

Standing Rock is not fully behind us, and much organizing and action lies ahead. But as organizing against the pipeline has shown, the cornerstone of any climate justice coalition is indigenous rights and sovereignty.

Where capital and state fail, the first people of this land lead the way forward to what is right for the planet and its inhabitants. People of conscience must follow."

BarclaysÊends financing of controversial mountaintop removal mining
Karl Mathiesen
BarclaysÊhas ended its financing of a controversial coal mining method known as mountaintop removal and said time is running out for the practice.
The bank was the worldÕs biggest financier of mountain top removal (MTR) in 2013, when it loaned MTR companies $550m, according to one analysis.
But in a policy document, released without publicity during March,ÊBarclaysÊreversed its position. Companies that engage in MTR coal mining will no longer receive support from the bank unless they commit to moving out of MTR Òwithin a reasonable timeframeÓ.
MTR is widely used in the Appalachian mountains in the eastern US. It involves blasting and shifting the tops of hills and mountains to expose the coal beneath. The rubble and spoil is dumped in the valleys below.
In the US states of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia the method has been vehemently opposed by climate campaigners and local activists for its environmental impacts, including deforestation and the pollution of watercourses, and climate change impact.
MTR has also been linked to severe health impacts. Last year a team of scientists fromÊWest Virginia UniversityÊlinked the dust created by the strip mining to lung cancer in nearby communities.
Mining using MTR has been economically marginalised by falling US shale gas prices and increasingly stringent legislation on the coal industry.ÊBarclaysÊsaid it expected the practice to wind down in the coming years.
ÒDue to a confluence of market forces and regulatory scrutiny in recent years, we believe that MTR is a mining method that will be phased out in the near to intermediate term,Ó said the policy.
ÒBarclaysÊhas never funded any MTR projects or developments directly,Ó said aÊBarclaysÊspokeswoman. She said the announcement on MTR was Òan additional explicit policy position on MTR coal miningÓ to go with its Òlongstanding and stringent environmental risk policies and practices covering transactions with environmentally sensitive sectors such as miningÓ.
In March, financial analysts at Carbon Tracker said the US coal industry had entered a structural decline, which would see many companies and mines close.
According to a BankTrack analyst,ÊBarclaysÊhelped to raise finance for Alpha Natural Resources during 2013. At the time Alpha was the worldÕs largest MTR miner. Alpha said it has now discontinued the practice.
The decision byÊBarclaysÊfollows similar policy changes by PNC Bank, JPÊMorgan,ÊWells Fargo,ÊBNP Paribas, RBS andÊUBS. But campaigners said theÊBarclaysÊdecision was the most significant yet.
Rainforest Action Network senior climate and energy campaigner Ben Collins said: ÒTo go from being the number one banker of mountaintop removal coal mining in 2013 to exiting MTR finance entirely is a clear indication thatÊBarclaysÊunderstands the devastating environmental and health consequences of this toxic practice.Ó
BarclaysÊsaid the company recognised that coal mining in the Appalachian region was managed by robust regulation. But that it was Òsubject to intense political, judicial and regulatory debate over the last decade due to negative environmental and social impacts on the one hand, and positive economic impacts on the localities in which it is employed, on the otherÓ.
Sam Lund-Harket,ÊenergyÊjusticeÊcampaigner at Global Justice Now said theÊBarclaysÕ decision was important in the winding down of mountaintop coal mining.
ÒBut MTR is just one aspect of the bankÕs appalling record in fossil fuel finance. Research last year showed thatÊBarclaysÊwas the fourth largest financier internationally of the coal sector as a whole. ThereÕs an urgent need forÊBarclaysÊand other banks to turn off the finance flows that are enabling the expansion of the fossil fuel industry and exacerbating the climate crisis.Ó
¥ This article was amended on 8 April 2015. An earlier version said Alpha Natural Resources was the worldÕs largest mountaintop removal miner. It did not conduct any MTR mining in 2014, and has no plans for any in 2015.

Leading scientists urge May to pressureÊTrumpÊoverÊclimateÊchange
Ian Sample Science editor
Leading scientists have asked the prime minister to urge president-electÊDonald TrumpÊto acknowledge the risks ofÊclimateÊchange and declare his support for international efforts to combat global warming.
One hundred researchers, including many of the most prominentÊclimateÊscientists in Britain, have written toÊTheresa MayÊto warn her of the potential threats posed byÊDonald Trump, who has made clear he does not accept the scientific consensus on warming driven by human activities.
The letter warns thatÊTrumpÕs administration may severely weakenÊclimateÊchange research and the collection of data such as Earth temperature records, which are used by scientists and policymakers in the UK and around the world. If the world classÊclimateÊscience now performed in the US is wound down underÊTrump, the UK must be ready to respond decisively, the letter states. One response would be to rapidly expand BritishÊclimateÊscience by offering jobs to disaffected US researchers.
TrumpÊhas called global warming a hoax and may scrapÊNasaÕs invaluableÊclimateÊresearch program. He threatened to withdraw from the Paris agreement, which aims to avoid the most dire consequences ofÊclimateÊchange, though recently he said he had an open mind on US involvement in the plan. He appointed Scott Pruitt, aÊclimateÊsceptic, to run theÊEnvironmental Protection AgencyÊ(EPA), and Rex Tillerson, the CEO ofÊExxon, to be secretary of state.
ÒWe donÕt know how bad it will be, and it seems thatÊTrumpÊhas slightly gone back on some of the rhetoric, but there are still worrying concerns,Ó said Prof Piers Forster, a signatory of the letter and director of the Priestley International Centre forÊClimateÊat Leeds University. ÒWhat concerns me is that if we donÕt have good scientific data and observations coming from America, weÕll be flying blind.Ó
The letter urges the PM to pressÊDonald TrumpÊdirectly and through international forums such as the G7 and G20 to accept the reality ofÊclimateÊchange and restate a commitment to the Paris agreement. In rejecting the scientific evidence aroundÊclimate change,ÊTrumpÊis disregarding the findings and advice from expert bodies around the world, including the US National Academy of Sciences and theÊIntergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChangeÊ(IPCC), the letter states. It adds that the UK science community stands ready to back US researchers in Òresisting any political attempts to prevent, hamper, or interfere with vital research onÊclimateÊchange.Ó
The scientists behind the letter, which was sent on Friday, want any weakening in USÊclimateÊchange to be met by an expansion of research in Britain. That could see the UK substantially bolster its expertise in the area by offering jobs to top US researchers whose work is shut down, or who simply become disillusioned under theÊTrumpÊadministration.
ÒThere are opportunities for UK universities to make some fantastic appointments. IÕm the director of a brand new institute and we are interested in giving these people jobs,Ó Forster said. Other signatories to the letter include Prof Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, Prof Corinne Le Qur, director of the Tyndall Centre forÊClimateÊChange Research, and Prof Jim Hall, director of the Environmental Change Institute atÊOxford University.
ÒWe have to be prepared as a country because things could change quite rapidly,Ó Forster said. ÒIfÊclimateÊscientists in the US start to lose their jobs, we have to be ready to take up the slack.Ó
The last Republican president, George W Bush, was roundly criticised byÊclimateÊscientists for interfering with research and public messages around global warming research. During his administration, a report from the EPA was edited by White House officials to reduce a long section on the risks of rising temperatures to a handful of vague paragraphs. In one email exchange that came to light, White House officials sought help from the conservative lobby group, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which received more than $1m (£820,000) in donations fromÊExxon, to play down a report in which the US admitted for the first time that humans contributed to global warming.
Within days of President BushÕs inauguration, Randy Randol, an ExxonMobil lobbyist, sent a memo to the White House asking if Bob Watson, the former head of theÊWorld BankÕs environment department and then-chair of theÊIPCC, could be replaced at the request of the US. Watson, who was knighted in 2012 and had long warned about the impact of burning fossil fuels and the need to change to prevent environmental harm, was duly unseated and replaced.
The foreign secretary,ÊBoris Johnson, has told MPs that the UK will stress the importance ofÊclimateÊchange to the Americans, but there is an acceptance among ministers that USÊclimateÊpolicy is a matter for the US to decide.
A government spokesperson said the UKÕs commitment to tacklingÊclimateÊchange was Òas strong as ever and we are clear that there will be no attempts to go back on what was agreed during negotiations in Paris and Marrakesh.ÓÊTheresa MayÊclosed the governmentÕs dedicatedÊclimateÊchange department last year. Work in the area now falls to the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
ÒWe know the UK and US face very similar energy challenges. WeÕve had great experience working together on all kinds of energy andÊclimateÊchange issues and look forward to this collaboration continuing,Ó the spokesperson added.

Heroes and villains in the fight againstÊclimateÊchange
Aubrey Meyer (@aubreygci)
The NewÊClimateÊEconomy report from Nicholas Stern et al at the Global Commission on the Economy andÊClimateÊ(Cutting emissions can boost growth, say economists, 16 September) says ""Good economic actions can take us most of the way to a 2C path"". This is from the economist who had the grace to admit he got it so wrong before. However, the emissions context in which this new claim is made is a little heroic. It is based onÊclimateÊmodelling in theÊIPCCÊfifth assessment report, which, as Nicholas Stern himself observed from the IMF last May, omitted significant feedback effects.
We seem now to be entering an era of carefully scripted half-truths, where the glass half full is a different glass from the one that is half empty. The half-truths that nudge this ""NewÊClimateÊEconomy"" still do not observe the limits that make it a wholly owned subsidiary of the global environment. Sadly, one is inclined to take these half-truths with the salt in the seawater that's coming our way.

In 1946 an American commodore gathered Lirok Joash and her people together and asked them to temporarily leave their homes on Bikini Atoll. The US needed somewhere to test its atomic bombs. It would be, said the navy man, Òfor the good of mankind and to end all world warsÓ.
Eight years later US scientists detonated Castle Bravo, the massive, bungled hydrogen bomb that would gouge a crater more than half a mile wide and make Bikini uninhabitable for decades, perhaps centuries. A calculating error created a blast equivalent to detonating 15 megatonnes of TNT, the bomb was the largest ever detonated by the United States Ð about 1,000 times larger than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war.
Joash was 20-years-old when she left Bikini. She has been forced to relocate by radiation or unsuitable living conditions five times Ð including a brief and disastrous return to a still radioactive Bikini in the 1970s. Now, at 89, she is the oldest of the Bikini population forced to move by the nuclear tests. Her memories of the atoll have now grown dim.
ÒI donÕt think sheÕll make it until the next return,Ó says JoashÕs grandson Alson Kelen, a former mayor of the Bikinian council-in-exile. ÒI donÕt think IÕll make it. I donÕt think my children or my grandchildren will make it. The dream that we would return already faded away a few years ago.Ó
The Bikinians, most of whom will never see Bikini, live scattered across the Marshall Islands, a collection of 24 atolls in the Western Pacific. Joash, Kelen and 200 of their people now live on Ejit, a tiny low-lying islet set aside for the Bikinians near the Marshall IslandsÕ capital atoll Majuro.
ÒWeÕve been kicked around for a while, for the last almost 70 years,Ó says Kelen. ÒAnd until now living in these tight communities here is the best we can get. And itÕs so sad. ItÕs so sad. Because every time we look at this we feel like weÕre sailors on a voyage, weÕre still right in the middle of the ocean.Ó
And the ocean, driven byÊclimateÊchange, is rising.
Across the Pacific, the subtle, unremitting first impacts of theÊclimateÊcrisis are already strangling lives. Later this year in Paris, the worldÕs leaders will attempt to produce an agreement that will secure the globalÊclimate. But secure for whom?
Floods washed over Ejit three times in 2014. Kelen fears that before long, his people will be moving again.
ÒItÕs the same story. Nuclear time, we were relocated.ÊClimateÊchange, we will be relocated. ItÕs the same harshness affecting us,Ó he says.
In the Marshall Islands almost everyone lives within a few hundred metres of the sea and less than three metres above it. Inundations have destroyed homes and crops. Droughts of extraordinary intensity and length have necessitated food and water drops. Fresh water grows scarcer.
People are trying to defend their land by planting mangroves, and Sisyphean sea walls are built and rebuilt. But peopleÕs thoughts are turning from adaptation and resilience toward aÊclimateÊexodus. Scientists predict that in 30 years, life here will be so uncomfortable most people will leave. A notion the Marshallese abhor. The Bikinian calamity serves as a national warning that homelands, once lost, cannot be replaced.
ÒIf the land doesnÕt exist, what happens to these people for whom the land is the most integral thing? For the answer, just look at the Bikinians,Ó says Jack Niedenthal, the liason officer for the Bikini Trust.
Marshallese foreign minister Tony de Brum, who has emerged as a champion of the globalÊclimateÊmovement, says: ÒDisplacement is not an option we relish or cherish and we will not operate on that basis. We will operate on the basis that we can in fact help to prevent this from happening.Ó
But politics and atmospheric physics are running away from the Marshallese. In March 2014 almost 100 homes on the capital atoll Majuro were destroyed by a combination of high tide and big swell. More than 900 people were placed in shelters. Families have since returned to live in homes half collapsed into the sea.
ÒI can tell you right now that all of those [inundation] events that have occurred in the Marshall Islands can be attributed to sea level rise,Ó says Reginald White, the director of the Marshall Islands National Weather Service. On the pancake flat atolls, three centimetres of sea level rise will cause a flood to spread inland a further 30 metres.
The higher sea level combines with seasonal high tides (known as king tides), large swells and high winds to push water on to the land. During La Nia years (part of the couple of ocean-atmosphere phenomenon that affects weather globally and includes El Nio) the seas can rise up to 30cm above normal. The last decade of predominantly La Nia conditions has offered a bleak curtain raiser for things to come.
ÒWe are seeing more extreme events today than we used to see in the 60s, 70s and 80s. Even without La Nia we still receive inundations,Ó says White.
Some scientists predictÊclimateÊchange will cause more intense and more frequent El Nio and La Nia events Ð although this is less certain than sea level rise. El Nio events are typically followed by dry periods in the Marshall Islands. During 2013, after a very weak El Nio, the northern atolls were hit by a severe drought. Food and water were delivered to desperate communities. Production of coconut oil, one of the countries only exports, fell by almost a third, a loss of close to US$2.5m (£1.6m) or 1.5% of GDP.
ÒIf there is another drought then the industry will be gone. That will really effect everything here,Ó says Mison Levai, the marketing manager of the national coconut oil producer Tobolar. This will not only be bad news for the 70 employees of TobolarÕs refinery in Majuro. For the 20,000 people who live on the rural coconut-growing Ôouter atollsÕ the equation is simple. No coconuts, no income.
On the outer atoll of Arno, families work together every day, six days a week, collecting fallen drupes, removing the husks, skilfully shucking the flesh (called copra) and drying it in makeshift ovens. It is then shipped to Majuro to be turned into oil and exported.
Torrak Anton, a copra farmer, uses a stick to scratch the arithmetic of his poverty in the dirt of the road. After food, rent and contributions to the copra dealer and island chief, he is left with $34 a week for the seven people in his household. During times of drought the coconuts shrink and the money for clothing, housing and education disappears.
Without copra, outer islanders will be reduced to a subsistence survival, eked from the land, supplemented by fishing and likely made impossible by tidal inundations. Already 1,200-1,400 people are reported to have moved from rural atolls to district centres Ð exacerbating overcrowding and making flooding in the capital Majuro more damaging.
Depending on how sharply the world cuts carbon emissions, the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (ÊIPCCÊ) predicts the global mean sea level will rise by 26-82cm between now and 2100. TheÊIPCCÊconcluded in 2013 that even if the increasingly quixotic-looking ÒsafeÓ limit of 2C of global warming were somehow achieved by the Paris talks, the sea would continue to wash over Kiribati and the Marshall Islands. What the rest of the world considers acceptableÊclimateÊchange is, quite simply, a disaster for atoll dwellers.
In spite of De BrumÕs refusal to countenance a national evacuation, White says the Marshall Islands are likely to become unliveable for all but a hardy few before the midway point of this century.
ÒWhat is the exact definition of habitable? It gets to a point where the extreme events become so frequent that it becomes very uncomfortable to make a good living,Ó he says.
The people of Kiribati (pronounced Ki-ri-bas) are the Marshall IslandsÕ fellows on the low road toÊclimateÊoblivion. The capital atoll Tarawa is overcrowded and underdeveloped, even compared to Majuro. Rita Kaimwata, a 27-year-old mother of two (soon to be three), lives in a typical Kiribati home of driftwood, salvaged timber and palm thatching. Her tiny block of land in the village of Temwaiku is separated from the Pacific Ocean by a thin dirt road and a hump of sand less than a metre high.
Like many Tarawans, the KaimwataÕs access to food and fresh water is tenuous. Their diet of rice and fish is supplemented by whatever vegetables they can grow. Every second day, for one hour, the government pumps treated drinking water and the family fill up a small tank. This precious water must be kept for keeping hydrated in the punishing equatorial heat.
For bathing, dishes, clothes and watering vegetables there is a well that taps the thin layer of fresh water (called a lens) a couple of metres below the ground. But last year (and again a few months ago) the sea swept over the road, through the KaimwataÕs home, across their cabbages and into the well. Now nothing grows.
Set against scientific warnings of a future of catastrophicÊclimateÊchange events (such as typhoon Haiyan and hurricane Sandy ) the loss of a vegetable patch seems insignificant. But for KaimwataÕs children the link between food, water and rising sea levels is profound and the margin between life and death could be as fine as the ability to grow a few cabbages.
Kaimwata, like many residents (called i-Kiribati), giggles to hide distress. ÒI laugh because sometimes we believe that in 20 or 30 years our country will be gone forever. But itÕs not funny.Ó Devoid of rock and substantial natural defences, this is among the most marginal of all regular human habitats.
Nearly a decade of regular inundations has caused parts of TarawaÕs already thin and polluted water lens to turn salty. Clean water is almost non-existent. Crops have died. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of malnourished multiplied eight times. In September, an outbreak of rotavirus from bad water infected 2,513 children under five years old. Seven were killed.
Kaimwata looks around at her children and her neighboursÕ children: ÒOnly the children get sick. Many children die in Kiribati when they get the diarrhoea.Ó More than a third of i-Kiribati are under 15.
The water situation is desperate. Water is being drawn from the freshwater lens 20% faster than rain replaces it. Bacteria from open defecation (there are few toilets), industrial and domestic chemicals and seawater contaminate all water sources Ð including the government supply. Only 60% of the atollÕs population receive rations of ÔcleanÕ government water. The other 23,000 rely solely on well water that TarawaÕs director of public health Patrick Timeon describes as Ògrossly unsafeÓ.
ÒThe enormity of water-associated disease and death has not been fully assessed,Ó says Timeon, but the direct and indirect impacts are ÒcolossalÓ. He begs for assistance to raise just £70,000 for two desalination plants that could provide safe water to the entire population.
KiribatiÕs president Anote Tong is frank. Years of failed talks and prevarication by industrialised countries have shaken his belief in the UN process. The land, homes and futures of his people (like the Bikinians before them) have been deemed the price of doing business, the acceptable cost of delaying the end of the carbon economy. In contrast to De Brum, he is already working on encouraging his people to leave.
ÒIf what will happen in Paris will deal with the case of the most vulnerable countries like us, then maybe we have some guarantee that we will be able to stay. But if we donÕt, IÕm not going to put the future of my country on the outcome and the whims and wishes of those countries to decide. WeÕve got to plan ahead. The old saying wish for the best but plan for the worst,Ó he says.
The countriesÕ contrary rhetoric onÊclimateÊchange is partly informed by their differing migration opportunities. The Marshallese have a compact of free association with the US, meaning they can resettle as they wish. But the i-Kiribati have few avenues of emigration. TongÕs despairing statements are partly designed to goad KiribatiÕs major donor countries Australia and New Zealand to open their borders to his people.
His plan for the worst, encourages young people to learn a profession and Ômigrate with dignityÕ. ÒWe have to relocate people because the landmass is going to decline. ThatÕs common sense. Simple common sense É I can say that I refuse to move, but thatÕs being stupid isnÕt it? Because it will not be me that will be affected. It will be my grandchildren,Ó he says.
Even now, it is not difficult to find the suffering grandchildren of Kiribati. Between TongÕs modest parliament and KaimwataÕs home is TarawaÕs hospital. The overloaded facility desperately needs modernisation and expansion. People sleep on the floor or outside on the ground. Cats roam the wards and ants swarm around dripping taps. In a corner of the paediatrics wing, panting slowly in the heat, lies one-year-old Atanimatang Atanimatang.
He fell sick during the rotavirus outbreak in September and his little body has wrestled against the diarrhoea and fever caused by the virus for four months. He shows signs of kwashiorkor, a type of malnutrition commonly found in regions hit by famine. His mother Katewea Atanimatang watches her sonÕs febrile sleep. They receive government water, she says, but when it is not available they are forced to drink from the well. She looks exhausted and sad.
When I contacted one of his nurses in the days before publication, Atanimatang had recovered slightly. He may yet live long enough to go to school, attend church, marry and have children - like most other i-Kiribati and Marshallese. But if he does, itÕs likely heÕll also live to see his homeland evacuated.
The elders are distraught that this loss is being committed to their young. The Reverend Eria Maerierie is an old man. He wonÕt live to see his countryÕs loss. But he has a long enough memory to know that things have changed. If the tide is high on a Sunday he now conducts services in a church surrounded by water. And he rages against the apathy behind the rising sea.
ÒWe are suffering in this part of the world from what those people in the rich world are working with gases. And its consequences fell on us in the Pacific. They have been selfish, thinking of what they can achieve with gas. What can we do? We just live with that dying feeling in our hearts. Our voice is nothing to them.Ó
Will the atolls disappear?
The most widely-reported and possibly most misleading Ôeffect ofÊclimateÊchangeÕ in atoll nations is erosion. ItÕs a striking, media-friendly narrative,ÊclimateÊchange we can see. Homes undermined by rising seas, beaches scoured back to the coral shelf and coconut trees felled by salt poisoning. But the evidence showing a clear link between the last century of sea level rise and erosion is far from conclusive.
Research on the erosion of atolls really only began in 2011. The University of AuklandÕs Murray Ford has compared aerial photography from the second world war with current satellite images and the results may surprise some. Despite a small but significant sea level rise of 20cm last century, Ford found that the last half of the century saw a general (although not uniform) trend of accretion across 100 Pacific atolls. The islands are getting bigger.
ÒAll the research thatÕs come out in the last few years has shown that the islands arenÕt eroding away. ItÕs kind of counter intuitive,Ó says Ford. ÒThe conventional models show that they should be eroding, but the current observations show that they arenÕt.Ó
Rather than being the indisputable first effects ofÊclimateÊchange, all the photos of dead palms and disappearing beaches attest to the extreme fragility of these landforms to change.

It is likely that on densely-populated Tarawa and Majuro, causeways, shoreline developments and dredging have much more influence on local erosion than sea level. Confirmation bias also plays a part in both the islandersÕ perceptions and the reporting from these islands. The eye isnÕt drawn so easily to the places where the sand is piling up. Any erosion is accepted as proof of theÊclimateÊchange narrative.
But just because the islands are growing now, doesnÕt mean they wonÕt suddenly begin eroding when the sea reaches a certain height. At the moment though, the disappearance of land is less of a threat than the loss ofÊhabitableÊland, says Ford.
ÒThe inundation risk continues to rise and itÕs highly likely that theyÕll be frequently inundated well before they are eroded away,Ó he says.

Extreme weather a new norm - UN expert
John Vidal
The wettest winter in 200 years, and the floods and gales experienced across Britain are a foretaste of what is to occur in a warming world, the head of the UN'sÊclimateÊscience panel has told the Guardian.
Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, said: ""Each of the last three decades has been warmer than the last. Extreme events are on the increase. Even if what we have just had [this winter] was not caused by anthropogenicÊclimateÊchange, events of this nature are increasing, both in intensity and frequency.""
Pachauri was speaking before the publication next month of a global assessment of the impact ofÊclimateÊchange on the world's food supplies, human health, cities and rural areas. Leaked copies seen by the Guardian warn of crop yields falling 2% a decade even as the demand from a rapidly growing population increases by 14% a decade.
""Due to sea level rise, coastal and low-lying areas will experience adverse impacts such as coastal erosion and flooding. Without adaptation, hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and will be displaced due to land loss,"" says the draft copy of the report, prepared by theÊIPCC.
Negotiators from 193 countries resume the UN'sÊclimateÊtalks in Bonn on Monday. UNÊclimateÊchief Christiana Figueres, told the Guardian that the ""very strange"" weather experienced across the world recently was a sign that we are already experiencingÊclimateÊchange.
""If you take them individually you can say maybe it's a fluke. The problem is you can't take them individually,"" she said. ""What it's doing is giving us a pattern of abnormality that's becoming the norm. We are experiencingÊclimateÊchange.""
""ClimateÊchange is now built into the system,"" said Pachauri. ""The Mediterranean will have severe problems with water scarcity which will impact on food. Some parts of Africa could have declines of 50% [in crop yields] as soon as 2020.""
He added that the world did not have much time. ""There is a very short window of opportunity to cut emissions enough to hold temperatures to an increase of 2C.""
Pachauri's warnings came as a new paper in the journal Nature suggests that even a 1C rise in temperatures could lead to an extra 3m malaria cases a year in children under 15 years of age.

Comment: Why the US gas sector is licking its lips over Ukraine: Comment & Debate: FromÊclimateÊchange to Crimea, the fracking industry is supreme at exploiting crisis - what I call the shock doctrine
Naomi Klein
The way to beat Vladimir Putin is to flood the European market with fracked-in-the-USA natural gas, or so the industry would have us believe. As part of escalating anti-Russian hysteria, two bills have been introduced into the US Congress that attempt to fast-track liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, all in the name of helping Europe to wean itself from Putin's fossil fuels, and enhancing US national security.
According to Cory Gardner, the Republican congressman who introduced the House of Representatives bill, ""opposing this legislation is like hanging up on a 911 call from our friends and allies"". And that might be true - as long as your friends and allies work at Chevron and Shell, and the emergency is the need to keep profits up amid dwindling supplies of conventional oil and gas.
For this ploy to work, it's important not to look too closely at details. Like the fact that much of the gas probably won't make it to Europe - because what the bills allow is for gas to be sold on the world market to any country belonging to the World Trade Organisation.
Or the fact that for years the industry has been selling the message that Americans must accept the risks to their land, water and air that come with hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in order to help their country achieve ""energy independence"". And now, suddenly and slyly, the goal has been switched to ""energy security"", which apparently means selling a temporary glut of fracked gas on the world market, thereby creating energy dependencies abroad.
And most of all, it's important not to notice that building the infrastructure necessary to export gas on this scale would take many years in permitting and construction. By the time these massive industrial projects are up and running, Germany and Russia may well be fast friends. But by then few will remember that the crisis in Crimea was the excuse seized upon by the gas industry to make its longstanding export dreams come true, regardless of the consequences to the communities getting fracked or to the planet getting cooked.
I call this knack for exploiting crisis for private gain the shock doctrine, and it shows no signs of retreating: during times of crisis, whether real or manufactured, our elites are able to ram through unpopular policies that are detrimental to the majority under cover of emergency. Plenty of industries are good at this ploy, but none is more adept at exploiting the rationality-arresting properties of crisis than the global gas sector.
For the past four years the gas lobby has used the economic crisis in Europe to tell countries like Greece that the way out of debt and desperation is to open their beautiful and fragile seas to drilling. And it has employed similar arguments to rationalise fracking across North America and the United Kingdom.
Now the crisis du jour is conflict in Ukraine, being used as a battering ram to knock down sensible restrictions on natural gas exports and push through a controversial free-trade deal with Europe. It's quite a deal: more corporate free-trade polluting economies and more heat-trapping gases polluting the atmosphere - all as a response to an energy crisis that is largely manufactured.
And it's worth remembering - irony of ironies - that the crisis the natural gas industry has been most adept at exploiting isÊ  itself.
Never mind that the industry's singular solution to theÊclimateÊcrisis is to dramatically expand an extraction process in fracking that releases massive amounts ofÊclimate-destabilising methane into our atmosphere. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases - 34 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the latest estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange. And that is over a 100-year period, with methane's power dwindling over time.
It's far more relevant, argues the Cornell University biochemist Robert Howarth, to look at the 15- to 20-year range, when methane has a global-warming potential that is a staggering 86-100 times greater than carbon dioxide. And remember: you don't build multibillion-dollar pieces of infrastructure unless you plan on using them for at least 40 years. So we are responding to our warming planet by constructing a network of ultra-powerful atmospheric ovens. Are we mad?
Not that we know how much methane is actually released by drilling and fracking and all their infrastructure. Even while the natural gas industry touts its ""lower than coal!"" carbon dioxide emissions, it has never systematically measured its fugitive methane leaks. The gas industry itself, in 1981, came up with the clever pitch that natural gas was a ""bridge"" to a clean energy future. That was 33 years ago.
And in 1988 - the year that the climatologist James Hansen warned Congress, in historic testimony, about the urgent problem of global warming - the American Gas Association began to explicitly frame its product as a response to the ""greenhouse effect"".
The industry's use of Ukraine to expand its global market under the banner of ""energy security"" must be seen in the context of this uninterrupted record of crisis opportunism. Only this time many more of us know where true energy security lies. Thanks to the work of top researchers such as Mark Jacobson and his Stanford team, we know that the world can, by 2030, power itself entirely with renewables. And thanks to the latest, alarming reports from theÊIPCC, we know that doing so is now an existential imperative.
It's up to Europeans to turn their desire for emancipation from Russian gas into a demand for an accelerated transition to renewables. Such a transition - to which European nations are committed under the Kyoto protocol - can easily be sabotaged if the world is flooded with cheap fossil fuels fracked from the US bedrock. Responding to the threat of catastrophic warming is our most pressing energy imperative. And we simply can't afford to be distracted by the natural gas industry's latest crisis-fuelled marketing ploy.

Collapse of ice sheet could cause devastation to global food supply
Suzanne Goldenberg
The current collapse of a large part of the Antarctic ice sheet could devastate global food supply, drowning vast areas of crop lands across the Middle East and Asia, according to research.
The report, Advancing Global Food Supply in the Face of a ChangingÊClimate, urges the Obama administration to step up research funding - especially in developing countries - to help make up a projected gap in future food supply.
It also warns America's corn belt could face yield declines of more than 25% by mid-century unless there are new advances in agriculture to compensate for higher temperatures, changing rainfall and more aggressive weeds and pests underÊclimateÊchange.
The report, due to be released in Washington, is the first to factor in the effects of the slow-motion collapse of the Western Antarctic ice sheet on future food security.
Two independent studies last week warned the retreat of the Western Antarctic ice sheet was unstoppable and could lead to a sea-level rise of up to four metres over the coming centuries.
Those rising seas would displace millions of people from low-lying coastal areas and wipe out rice-growing areas across Asia, Gerald Nelson, a University of Illinois economist and author of the report, said.
""That sea-level rise would take out half of Bangladesh and mostly wipe out productive rice regions in Vietnam,"" Nelson told the Guardian. ""It would have a major effect on Egyptian agricultural areas.""
The projected degree of sea-level rise poses a far greater threat to future food supply even than that envisaged in the United Nations'ÊIPCCÊreport in March, Nelson said.
""A sea level rise of three metres over the next 100 years is much more likely than theÊIPCCÊthought possible,"" the report said.
In terms of absolute land loss, China would be at risk of losing more than 3 million hectares. Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar could lose more than 1 million hectares, the report said.
The potential loss of viable crop land underscores the urgent need for new technologies to increase agricultural productivity to keep pace with a growing world population, the report said.
""Agriculture is a huge worldwide industry that requires stable weather 'or else', and we might just be entering the 'or else' period,"" said Dan Glickman, agriculture secretary under Bill Clinton.
""The question is, are we doing the right kind of research at our universities, at the department of agriculture, or in the private sector to deal with those changes? That is the real challenge for scientists.""

Analysis All aboard theÊclimateÊchange express
If you are embarking on a long and essential journey, it pays to book early: that is the take-away message from Sunday's UN report setting out how to avert catastrophicÊclimateÊchange.
By starting right now to end the era of dirty fossil fuels, not only do you ensure you arrive at your destination - a safer world - but you also get the cheapest ticket.
The chair of he Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, drew on his early years as a railway engineer to drive the point home.
""The high speed [carbon-cutting] train will leave very soon and all of the global community will have to be on board,"" he said.
But hisÊIPCCÊcolleague, Youba Sokona, a scientist from Mali and one of the trio who led on the new report, was clear about the limits of the plan: ""We are the map-makers: the [powerful] are the navigators."" He said the report is ""telling truth to power"". The question now is whether the powerful want to listen.
TheÊIPCCÊreport sets out multiple possible solutions. Some, based on renewable energy and cutting energy waste, are low-risk and comfortable, rather like a fast electric train.
Others, such as delaying action and then being forced to suck carbon out of the air later, look more like a four-wheeled drive over a mountain range.
TheÊIPCCÊhas put a definitive map on the table and shown that the price of action onÊclimateÊchange is affordable.
But the hardest choices remain in the hands of the powerful: which route to take and, even more difficult, who pays for the ticket.
Statements deleted from the final report summary, which is aimed directly at policymakers, reveal the political battles ahead.
All mentions of transferring hundreds of billions of dollars a year from rich to poor nations to pay for going green were removed.
Even the simple statement that 70% of all emissions come from just 10 big nations was deemed too much like naming and shaming.
Nonetheless, many stark messages remain: all dirty fossil fuel use will have to end in the coming decades; huge stocks of coal, oil and gas will have to remain in the ground; countries and companies relying on fossil fuels may suffer big financial losses.
Choosing the route that heads away from civilisation's loomingÊclimateÊcatastrophe falls to the world's leaders, with a deadline of December 2015 in Paris for a global deal.
But they can no longer claim they do not know the way or cannot afford the fare. As the US secretary of state, John Kerry, put it yesterday: ""This report makes very clear we face an issue of global willpower, not capacity.""

'Science has spoken': UN call for action onÊclimate: UN calls for urgent action onÊclimate
Damian Carrington Copenhagen
ClimateÊchange is set to inflict ""severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts"" on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly, according to the most important assessment of global warming yet published.
The stark report saysÊclimateÊchange has already increased the risk of severe heatwaves and other extreme weather and warns of worse to come, including food shortages and violent conflicts. But it also found that ways to avoid dangerous global warming are both available and affordable.
""Science has spoken. There is no ambiguity in the message,"" said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, attending what he described as the ""historic"" report launch. ""Leaders must act. Time is not on our side."" He said quick, decisive action would build a better and more sustainable future, while inaction would be very costly.
He added a message to investors, such as pension fund managers: ""Please reduce your investments in the coal and fossil-fuel based economy and [move] to renewable energy.""
The report, which the UN Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange released in Copenhagen yesterday, is the work of thousands of scientists and was agreed after negotiations by all the world's governments.
It is the firstÊIPCCÊreport since 2007 to bring together all aspects of tacklingÊclimateÊchange, and for the first time the report states: that tacklingÊclimateÊchange is economically affordable; that carbon emissions will ultimately have to fall to zero; and that global poverty can only be reduced by halting global warming.
The report also makes clear that carbon emissions, mainly from burning coal, oil and gas, are currently rising to record levels, not falling.
International action onÊclimateÊchange faces a critical time, with the deadline for a global deal just over a year away. In September, 120 national leaders met at the United Nations in New York to addressÊclimateÊchange, and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators around the world demanded action.
""We have the means to limitÊclimateÊchange,"" said Rajendra Pachauri, the chair of theÊIPCC. ""The solutions are many and allow for continued economic and human development. All we need is the will to change.""
Nicholas Stern, a professor at the London School of Economics and the author of an influential earlier study, said the newÊIPCCreport was the ""most important assessment ofÊclimateÊchange ever prepared"" and that it made plain that ""further delays in tacklingÊclimateÊchange would be dangerous and profoundly irrational"".
""The reality ofÊclimateÊchange is undeniable, and cannot be simply wished away by politicians who lack the courage to confront the scientific evidence,"" he said, adding that the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions were at risk.
Ed Davey, the UK energy andÊclimateÊchange secretary, said: ""This is the most comprehensive and robust assessment ever produced. It sends a clear message - we must act onÊclimateÊchange now.""
John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said: ""This is another canary in the coal mine. We can't prevent a large scale disaster if we don't heed this kind of hard science.""
Bill McKibben, a high-profileÊclimateÊcampaigner with 350.org, said: ""For scientists, conservative by nature, to use 'serious, pervasive, and irreversible' to describe the effects ofÊclimateÊfalls just short of announcing thatÊclimateÊchange will produce a zombie apocalypse plus random beheadings plus Ebola.""
Breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry would not be easy, McKibben said. ""But, thanks to theÊIPCC, no one will ever be able to say they weren't warned.""
The new report, which builds on previous reports on the science, impacts and solutions forÊclimateÊchange, concludes that global warming is ""unequivocal"", that humanity's role in causing it is ""clear"" and that many effects will last for hundreds to thousands of years even if the rise in temperature is halted.
In terms of impacts, such as heatwaves and extreme rain storms causing floods, the report concludes that the effects are already being felt: ""In recent decades, changes inÊclimateÊhave caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.""
Droughts, coastal storm surges from the rising oceans and wildlife extinctions on land and in the seas will all worsen unless emissions are cut, the report states. This will have knock-on effects. ""ClimateÊchange is projected to undermine food security,"" theÊIPCCÊsaid. The report also found the risk of wars may increase: ""ClimateÊchange can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks.""
Two-thirds of all emissions permissible if dangerousÊclimateÊchange is to be avoided have already been pumped into the atmosphere, theÊIPCCÊfound.
The cheapest route to stopping dangerous warming, it says, would be for emissions to peak by 2020 - an extremely challenging goal - and then fall to zero later this century.
The report calculates that to prevent dangerousÊclimateÊchange, investment in low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency will have to rise by several hundred billion dollars a year before 2030. But it also found that delaying significant emissions cuts to 2030 puts up the cost of reducing carbon dioxide by almost 50%, partly because dirty power stations would have to be closed early.
""If you wait, you also have to do more difficult and expensive things,"" said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and vice chairman of anÊIPCCÊworking group.
TacklingÊclimateÊchange need only trim economic growth rates by a tiny fraction, the report says, and may actually improve growth by providing other benefits, such as cutting health-damaging air pollution.
TheÊIPCCÊconsiders carbon capture and storage (CCS) - the nascent technology that aims to bury CO2 - extremely important. It estimates that the cost of the big emissions cuts required would more than double without CCS. Pachauri said: ""With CCS it is entirely possible for fossil fuels to continue to be used on a large scale.""
Linking CCS to the burning of wood and other plant fuels would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels because the carbon they contain is sucked from the air as they grow. But Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, the vice-chair of theÊIPCC, said the report also states ""very honestly and fairly"" that there are risks to this approach, such as conflicts with food security.
Abandoning nuclear power or deploying only limited wind or solar power, by contrast, increases the cost of emission cuts by just 6%-7%, and the report finds behavioural changes, such as eating less meat, can have a role in cutting emissions.
Setting out how countries can cut emissions effectively, theÊIPCCÊreport gives prominence to ethical considerations. ""The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective [international] cooperation.""
These issues are central to the globalÊclimateÊchange negotiations and campaigners welcomed their inclusion in the report, as well as its statement that adapting coastlines to cope with global warming cannot by itself avert serious impacts.
""Rich governments must stop making empty promises and come up with the cash so the poorest do not have to foot the bill for the lifestyles of the wealthy,"" said Harjeet Singh, of ActionAid.
The statement that carbon emissions must fall to zero was ""game changing"", according to Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace. ""We can still limit warming to 2C, or even 1.5C or less even, [but] we need to phase out emissions,"" she said.
Sam Smith, from WWF, said: ""The big change in this report is that it shows fightingÊclimateÊchange is not going to cripple economies and that it is essential to bringing people out of poverty. What is needed now is concerted political action.""
Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation, said the much greater certainty expressed in the newÊIPCCÊreport would give the internationalÊclimateÊnegotiations a better chance than those which failed in 2009 ""Ignorance can no longer be an excuse for no action,"" he said.
Observers played down moves by some countries with large fossil fuel reserves to weaken the language of the draftÊIPCCÊreport, seen by the Guardian, saying the final report was conservative but strong.
However, the statement that ""climateÊchange is expected to lead to increases in ill-health"" was deleted in the final report, along with criticism that politicians sometimes ""engage in short-term thinking and are biased toward the status quo"".

G7 leaders agree to phase out fossil fuel use by end of century
The G7 leading industrial nations have agreed to cut greenhouse gases by phasing out the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century, the German chancellor,ÊAngela Merkel, has announced, in a move hailed as historic by some environmental campaigners.
Related: G7 fossil fuel pledge is a diplomatic coup for Germany's 'climateÊchancellor'
On the final day of talks in a Bavarian castle, Merkel said the leaders had committed themselves to the need to Òdecarbonise the global economy in the course of this centuryÓ. They also agreed on a global target for limiting the rise in average global temperatures to a maximum of 2C over pre-industrial levels.
Environmental lobbyists described the announcement as a hopeful sign that plans for complete decarbonisation could be decided on in ParisÊclimateÊtalks later this year. But they criticised the fact that leaders had baulked at MerkelÕs proposal that they should agree to immediate binding emission targets.
As host of the summit, which took place in the foothills of GermanyÕs largest mountain, the Zugspitze, Merkel said the leading industrialised countries were committed to raising $100bn (£65bn) in annualÊclimateÊfinancing by 2020 from public and private sources.
In a 17-page communique issued after the summit at Schloss Elmau under the slogan ÒThink Ahead, Act TogetherÓ, the G7 leaders agreed to back the recommendations of theÊIPCC, theÊUnited NationsÕÊclimateÊchange panel, to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at the upper end of a range of 40% to 70% by 2050, using 2010 as the baseline.
Merkel also announced that G7 governments had signed up to initiatives to work for an end to extreme poverty and hunger, reducing by 2030 the number of people living in hunger and malnutrition by 500 million, as well as improving the global response to epidemics in the light of the Ebola crisis.
Poverty campaigners reacted with cautious optimism to the news.
The participant countries Ð Germany, Britain, France, the US, Canada, Japan and Italy Ð would work on initiatives to combat disease and help countries around the world react to epidemics, including a fund within theÊWorld BankÊdedicated to tackling health emergencies, Merkel announced at a press conference after the summit formally ended on Monday afternoon.
Reacting to the summitÕs final declaration, the EuropeanÊClimateÊFoundation described the G7 leadersÕ announcement as historic, saying it signalled Òthe end of the fossil fuel ageÓ and was an Òimportant milestone on the road to a newÊclimateÊdeal in ParisÓ.
Samantha Smith, aÊclimateÊcampaigner for theÊWorld Wildlife Fund, said: ÒThere is only one way to meet the goals they agreed: get out of fossil fuels as soon as possible.Ó
The 350.org campaign group put out a direct challenge to Barack Obama to shut down long-term infrastructure projects linked to the fossil fuel industry. ÒIfÊPresident ObamaÊwants to live up to the rhetoric weÕre seeing out of Germany, heÕll need to start doing everything in his power to keep fossil fuels in the ground. He can begin by rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline and ending coal, oil and gas development on public lands,Ó said May Boeve, the groupÕs director.
Others called on negotiators seeking an internationalÊclimateÊdeal at Paris later this year to make total decarbonisation of the global economy the official goal.
ÒA clear long-term decarbonisation objective in the Paris agreement, such as net zero greenhouse gas emissions well before the end of the century, will shift this towards low-carbon investment and avoid unmanageableÊclimateÊrisk,Ó said Nigel Topping, the chief executive of the We Mean Business coalition.
Merkel won praise for succeeding in her ambition to ensureÊclimateÊwas not squeezed off the agenda by other pressing issues. Some environmental groups said she had established herself as a ÒclimateÊheroÓ.
Observers said she had succeeded where sceptics thought she would not, in winning over Canada and Japan, the most reluctant G7 partners ahead of negotiations, to sign up to her targets onÊclimate, health and poverty.
Iain Keith, campaign director of the online activist network Avaaz, said: ÒAngela MerkelÊfaced down Canada and Japan to say ÔAuf WiedersehenÕ to carbon pollution and become theÊclimateÊhero the world needs.Ó
The One campaigning and advocacy organisation called the leadersÕ pledge to end extreme poverty a Òhistoric ambitionÓ. Adrian Lovett, its Europe executive director, said: ÒThese G7 leaders have signed up... to be part of the generation that ends extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.Ó But he warned: ÒSchloss ElmauÕs legacy must be more than a castle in the air.
But the Christian relief organisation World Vision accused the leaders of failing to deliver on their ambitious agenda, arguing they had been too distracted by immediate crises, such as Russia and Greece. ÒDespite addressing issues like hunger and immunisation, it was nowhere as near as ambitious as we would have hoped for,Ó a spokeswoman said.
Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust said the proposals would Òtransform the resilience of global health systemsÓ. But he said the success of the measures would depend on the effectiveness with which they could be coordinated on a global scale and that required fundamental reform of theÊWorld Health Organisation, something the leaders stopped short of deciding on.
ÒWe urge world leaders to consider establishing an independent body within the WHO with the authority and responsibility to deliver this,Ó he said.
Merkel, who called the talks Òvery work-intensive and productiveÓ and defended the format of a summit that cost an estimated Û300m (£220m), said that the participants had agreed to sharpen existing sanctions against Russia if the crisis in Ukraine were to escalate.
She also said Òthere isnÕt much time leftÓ to find a solution to the Greek global debt crisis but that participants were unanimous in wanting Greece to stay in the eurozone.
Demonstrators, about 3,000 of whom had packed a protest camp in the nearby village of Garmisch Partenkirchen, cancelled the final action that had been planned to coincide with the close of the summit.
At a meeting in the local railway station, the head of Stop G7 Elmau, Ingrid Scherf announced that the final rally would not go ahead Òbecause weÕre already walked off our feetÓ. She denied the claims of local politicians that the groupÕs demonstrations had been a flop. ÒIÕm not at all disappointed, the turnout was super,Ó she said. ÒAnd we also had the support of lots of locals.Ó

Those of us from low-income communities of color are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. US cities and towns that are predominantly made up of people of color are also home to a disproportionate share of the environmental burdens that are fueling the climate crisis and shortening our lives. One has only to recall the gut-wrenching images of Hurricane Katrina’s aftermath to confirm this.

At a time when police abuse is more visible than ever thanks to technology, and our communities continue to get hit time and time again by climate catastrophe, we can’t afford to choose between a Black Lives Matter protest and a climate justice forum, because our survival depends on both of them.

As a young woman, I started organizing against racial violence and police misconduct. For the last 20 years, I have been struggling for environmental and climate justice. As descendants of slavery and colonization, our communities have lived and continue to live at the intersection of all these challenges. Both have a long history rooted in the extraction and abuse of our labor and later the extraction and abuse of our resources. Both involve people who are the descendants of historical trauma and are now faced with the catastrophe of a changing climate.

Over the years, as we were fighting for housing, jobs and better schools, decisions were being made to site some of the most toxic industries in communities with a large proportion of people of color: power plants, waste transfer stations, landfills, refineries and incinerators. As a result, communities of color have become cancer clusters and have the highest rates of asthma. In response, we in the environmental justice movement have said there is not anything more fundamental than the right to breathe – and that includes the right to clean air.

The environmental justice and Black Lives Matter movements are complementary. Black lives matter in the Gulf, where most of the fatalities resulting from Hurricane Katrina were black people, and which was home to the largest marine oil spill in history five years later. Black lives matter in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where hundreds of black families waited for weeks for electricity, heat and in some cases, running water, to be turned back on after Superstorm Sandy. Black lives matter in Richmond, California, home to the largest oil refinery on the West Coast. Black lives matter in Detroit, home to the largest solid waste incinerator in the US. The list goes on of cities and towns that are predominantly made up of people of color and are also home to a disproportionate share of this nation’s environmental burdens.



We as people of color people now face the effects of a changing climate neither our ancestors nor we are responsible for creating. Climate change demands another rhythm. The current dig, burn and dump economy is no longer acceptable. Similarly, a climate movement led by people of traditional power and privilege will not relieve the crises we face. Our communities know another way. As people of African and Indigenous ancestry, we come from societies and ways of life that protect and nurture Mother Earth. Now is the time to reconnect with our old ways. The knowledge is there – it is in our historical memory, and we are doing this work. Environmental and climate justice activists are working at the grassroots level to develop indigenous leadership around local climate solutions. 

This redefines the face of the climate movement and provides a just and necessary alternative to the racial and ecological structures that have led us to where we are. It will be through this process of living and working and struggling with one another that we guarantee our children and grandchildren the right to breathe free."

Why India is captured by carbon
Beneath a sky made opaque by billowing dust, a mechanised shovel driver steered his vehicle toward the vast wall of an open coal mine. It was the middle of a central Indian summer afternoon, and outside, the temperature had hit 45C. Up in the cab, 15 metres above the black, shiny ground, it was comfortable, air-conditioned.
The driver tipped the steel-toothed rim of the shovelÕs bucket downwards, then slammed it into the coal seam wall in front of him. A few hours earlier, a drilling rig mounted on caterpillar tracks had drilled deep holes into the coal from the flat ground above, and filled them with explosives. Their detonation broke the coal into diggable chunks, some of them pebbles, others a metre across.
The seam being worked was 20 metres thick, and lay some 300 metres beneath what was once the groundÕs surface Ð the deeper of two black stripes of coal. Overlying the seams, until it was blasted and dug away, were much larger quantities of grey-brown shale, what miners call ÒoverburdenÓ. Having been stripped from the coal, it lay stacked up in mountainous piles on either side of the mine, the walls of an artificial Grand Canyon. The surface area of this mine, Dudhichua, is 16 squareÊkilometres.
In the year ending March 2015, Dudhichua produced 15m tonnes of coal Ð more than the UKÕs entire remaining production. But it is only one of 16 mines in the Singrauli coalfield, which spans parts of two districts in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. All but one are owned by the state-run Northern Coalfields Ltd, a subsidiary of Coal India, one of the countryÕs biggest firms. As is the case with other Indian coalfields, Singrauli is home to numerous coal-fired thermal electricity plants, some almost on the doorstep of the mines. Their current aggregate capacity is about 20 gigawatts, nearly 10% of IndiaÕs total national generating capacity. (By comparison, peak electricity demand for the entire UK is only 57GW.)
Singrauli may be one of IndiaÕs biggest energy hubs, but it is also isolated. Apart from the mines and power stations, the coalfield is home to a handful of towns, poverty-stricken villages and some prosperous corporate ÒcoloniesÓ, with their own schools, sports fields and clinics. To visit the area involves a 220km drive from the nearest airport at Varanasi, on a chaotic road that often lacks a proper surface: the journeyÊcan easily take eight hours. Phone signals and internetÊare intermittent. The only communications that really work are the high-voltage power lines that carry SingrauliÕs output to the teeming cities of northern IndiaÕs plains. Last year, the coalfieldÕs total production was about 87m tonnes. (When the British coal industry began to decline with the outbreak of the 1984 minersÕ strike, it was producing about 130m tonnes annually.)
SingrauliÕs significance Ð and that of the subcontinentÕs many other coalfields, which span the length and breadth ofÊIndia, with further large reserves in Pakistan Ð extends globally. In 2013, the UN Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) reported that in order to restrict the increase of world average temperatures to 2C above pre-industrial times, the world must adopt a strict Òcarbon budgetÓ for emissions. According to theÊIPCC, the current rate of fossil fuel burning will exhaust this within 25 years, after which fuels must either be left unexploited, or have their emissions kept from the atmosphere by carbon capture and storage.
India has the worldÕs fifth-largest coal reserves ÐÊand very few cleaner fossil fuels, such as natural gas. Its leaders are also determined to spread the benefits of economicÊdevelopment more widely among its population of almost 1.3bn people ÐÊone third of whom still have no access toÊelectricity.
Anil Swarup, the permanent secretary at the coal ministry in Delhi, said in an interview that last year Indian production from both private and state-owned mines was 620m tonnes, more than 85% of it from open-cast workings. A further 400m tonnes were imported. At Singrauli and elsewhere, he added, production is set to increase rapidly, with strong encouragement from the rightwing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which swept to power last year. Modi is determined to restore the sustained GDP growth rate of 8-10% that India enjoyed for a decade until 2011.
ÒWe are looking to double Indian coal production by 2020,Ó Swarup said, Òand to reduce reliance on imports.Ó Beyond that date, he said production would continue to rise to 1.5bn tonnes a year, with most of this being burnt in coal-fired power plants. In the past six months, the government has given environmental clearance to 41 new mining projects. The consequence, Swarup said, is that from now until 2020, Òa new mine will be opened every month. You have to work on the assumption of requirement, and in India, there is a need for power.Ó
Last August, the Indian supreme court ruled that more than 200 mining licences awarded by governments before 2010 were illegal, forcing the cancellation of numerous planned projects. The system that its judgment set aside had already been shown to be rife with corruption. The most prominent casualty of IndiaÕs ÒCoalgateÓ scandal was the former Congress prime minister Manmohan Singh, who last month came close to criminal indictment.
Enshrined in a law enacted by ModiÕs government is a new scheme under which coal blocks are auctioned to the highest bidder. It hugely incentivises state governments to foster new mines. According to Swarup, the auctions of the 209 blocks that have been sold off to date have raised about £17bn Ð money that will swell state coffers for the next 30 years: ÒThis will change the statesÕ economies. They were really strapped for money. Now they will get it.Ó
Many of the richest untapped reserves lie in heavily forested areas, some near Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh, but mainly in Chattisgarh and Jharkand in central India. There, those whose land will be subject to ÒacquisitionÓ are some of IndiaÕs poorest inhabitants, many of them Adivasis ÐÊmembers of indigenous tribes.
Swarup insisted that preserving the environment was a high priority for those overseeing IndiaÕs new coal boom. ÒSeeing how the environment can be maintained is a crucial part of this. Whenever I talk to my officers, I say the environment is non-negotiable. But there is no viable alternative to developing more coal. Energy requirements have to be met.Ó
* * *
To many western environmentalists,Êwho are determined to see a binding global deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the UNÊclimateÊchange conference in Paris later this year, IndiaÕs rising coal use is anathema. However, across a broad range of Delhi politicians and policymakers there is near unanimity. There is, they say, simply no possibility that at this stage in its development India will agree to any form of emissions cap, let alone a cut. Even a pledge of the kind made by ChinaÕs leader Xi Jinping after talks with US presidentÊBarack Obama last year, that Chinese emissions would rise to a peak in 2030 and thereafter decline, would be out of the question.
This issue Ð the balance between the environment and growth Ð arises in every developing country. But IndiaÕs sheer size means that its resolution is of exceptional significance.
Modi has spoken repeatedly of IndiaÕs Òright to growthÓ. Prakash Javadekar, the cabinet minister responsible for the environment, forests andÊclimateÊchange, enlarged on this in blunt terms, speaking in his office at the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of IndiaÕs parliament: ÒOur emissions will grow because we are not developed and we have a right, every person on this Earth has a right, to develop. If today the world is 0.8C warmer [than it was in pre-industrial times], it is not my fault. It is the historical responsibility of those who started emitting with the industrial revolution.Ó (However, largely because of its sheer size and population, India is one of the ten biggest historical emitters, having contributed around 7% to the warming the world has seen so far, compared to 20% for the US and 5% for the UK.)
He cited a Hindi political slogan, taken up by the BJP in its struggle to eclipse the once-impregnable Congress Party: ÒÊSinghasan khali karo ki janata aati haiÊ,Ó which roughly means ÒVacate the throne, the people are coming.Ó In JavadekarÕs view, for now and for years to come, responsibility for reducing global emissions must be borne by the west: ÒThey must vacate the carbon space because we are coming. We are developing.Ó
Underlying that insistence are some brutal facts. India is famously the worldÕs largest democracy, and is often said to possess the worldÕs biggest Òmiddle classÓ. But in India this term has a meaning very different to its usage in the west. Navroz Dubash, the head of theÊclimateÊinitiative at DelhiÕs Centre for Policy Research, pointed out that among the richest 10% of Indians, a third live in households which have no refrigerators. In the next richest 10%, only 45% have refrigerators, and in the 10% after that, only 28%. At the mid-point of IndiaÕs income distribution, the proportion of fridge owners is just 10%.
Among the richest 10% of Indians, a third live in households which have no refrigerators
Dubash, a lead author of theÊIPCCÕs reports, is personally in no doubt as to the need to reduce global emissions. But he said that the limited reach of refrigerators Ð which IndiaÕsÊclimateÊwould seem to make indispensable Ð Òtells you scary things. If you ask people with that level of access to energy to tighten their belts, thatÕs a very big ask. It means that emissions inevitably have to grow.Ó In India, he added, the number of people who consume as much energy as anyone deemed to be above the official poverty line in the developed world is, at most, a few tens of millions. Everyone else consumes less. ÒFrom a global perspective, you have to give India carbon headroom.Ó
Dubash is the principal author of a recent report that examines seven separate projections of IndiaÕs future energy needs and likely emissions. All of them Ð from institutions including government departments, the World Bank and TERI, the Energy and Resources Institute headed until recently by Raj Pachauri, the formerÊIPCCÊchairman Ð state that both coal-fired power and Indian greenhouse gas emissions are set to increase substantially.
ÒBy 2030, coal use is projected É to be 2.5-three times current levels,Ó the report says. Even with stringent policy action to increase the deployment of renewables and increase energy efficiency, Òcoal use is projected by all but one study to be more than two times current levelsÓ. (Although India has a small nuclear industry Ð which provides less than 5% of its electricity Ð attempts to expand it have met strong political resistance. Any new nuclear capacity would take years to build and bring online, so it cannot be expected to fill the countryÕs energy needs any time soon.)
The consequence is that if, as the projections suggest, IndiaÕs emissions grow between two and three times by 2030, ÒIndia could be the second largest global emitter within the next decade.Ó Its projected outputÊÐ between 4bn and 5.7bn tonnes of carbon dioxide each year ÐÊwill surpass that of the US, which in 2011 was 5.3bn tonnes and falling, and be smaller only than ChinaÕs.
IndiaÕs population is set to outstrip ChinaÕs by 2028. But while its total emissions will be high, they will be nowhere near as great, on a per capita basis, as those of more developed countries. The XiÐObama deal was based on the notion that by 2030, the two nations will reach per capita emissions ÒconvergenceÓ, with each person responsible for producing 14 tonnes of carbon each year. By that date, Prakash Javadekar said, the figure for the average Indian will be just 4 tonnes, a little over twice as much as today: ÒIndia will never reach the Chinese-American convergence point. EveryÊclimateÊaction has a cost, but I canÕt tax my poor.Ó Even in 2030, Indian per capita emissions are expected to remain below the current world average.
DubashÕs report regards all the projections as flawed: they tend to assume sustained high GDP growth, which may not be achievable, and there is a wide divergence between them. ÒWe donÕt have a very solid set of analytical inputs, and the projections are not robust,Ó Dubash said. For that reason alone, Òstringent pledges would be unwise, because there is too much uncertaintyÓ.
Similar opinions can be found in Delhi among people of very different political stripes. There are a few dissenters, such as Greenpeace India ÐÊwhich led a campaign by local people to resist the development of a new mine in Singrauli that was finally cancelled last year. Since then, the government has taken steps to curb its activities, freezing all its bank accounts on the grounds that it received donations from abroad. But Greenpeace remains on the margins of IndiaÕs debate.
According to Barun Mitra, the director of the Liberty Institute, a free-market think tank, Òin a country where a third of the population doesnÕt have electricity, binding emissions limits are a fairy taleÓ.
Nitin Desai is a retired UN diplomat, who organised the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and later represented the UN secretary-general at internationalÊclimateÊconferences. He is now a member of a small expert panel advising Modi in the lead-up to Paris. ÒIn a country with blackouts and so many people without access to electricity, can I really manage without developing more coal?Ó he asked. ÒWhy should we be accountable? The pressure should be on the countries whose per capita emissions are much higher. If you try to force India to adopt emissions targets, you will fail.Ó
The last time US and European leaders made a serious push for a binding global deal, at the 2009ÊclimateÊconference in Copenhagen, IndiaÕs delegation was led by Jairam Ramesh, who did JavedekarÕs job in the then-Congress-led government. As a minister, he was mercilessly attacked for holding up development on environmental grounds. He said: ÒThe idea that India can set targets in Paris is completely ridiculous and unrealistic. It will not happen. This is a difficult concept for eco-fundamentalists, and I say this as a guy who is considered in India to be very green.Ó
Copenhagen, he said, failed because of what he termed ÒclimateÊevangelism. I was sitting for days with Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband, Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and Sarkozy. It was absolutely bizarre. It failed because of an excess of evangelical zeal, of which Brown was the chief proponent. It should not happen again.Ó
He added: ÒEven with the most aggressive strategy on nuclear, wind, hydro and solar, coal will still provide 55% of electricity consumption by 2030, which means coal consumption will be 2.5 or three times higher than at present. Mining and burning coal imposes huge environmental burdens. ItÕs a double whammy: the more coal we extract, the more forest we lose, and that too will add to global warming.Ó
Nevertheless, he concluded, ÒI donÕt see any alternative other than at least to double IndiaÕs coal consumption in the next 15 years.Ó
* * *
In Singrauli, the Òenvironmental burdensÓ imposedÊby mining and burning coal are not difficult to spot.
Some of the areaÕs power stations date back to the 1970s, and their chimneys, which are almost 300m high, belch great plumes of thick, oily smoke. Coal power station chimneys are supposed to be fitted with electrostatic precipitators, devices to stop ash being emitted into the atmosphere. But Singrauli coalÕs ash content is high, up to 40%, and the people who live in the shadow of the older plants say houses, vehicles and other exposed surfaces will often be coated in a thick, grey film.
ÒNo one dries their washing outside round here,Ó said Dr KK Aggarwal, who runs a clinic in the town of Anpara, the site of four big plants, two of them old and two extremely new Ð the newest, Anpara D, began to come on stream this month. ÒMany of my patients suffer from respiratory problems, such as asthma, nasal conditions, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are also skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.Ó He is convinced the incidence of such conditions is higher than it should be because of the mines and power plants. ÒPollution is everywhere.Ó
Some of SingrauliÕs mine and power plant operators have already taken elaborate steps to reduce discharges into the air and water. Gigantic water sprayers and closed conveyor belts carrying coal from mine to power station keep dust to a minimum. The chimneys at the newest stations, Anpara C and D, and the nearby Òsuper criticalÓ plant run by the private firm Reliance, IndiaÕs biggest company, emit no visible smoke at all Ð and use only three-quarters as much coal as older stations.
Elsewhere, however, the noxious odour of coal dust hangs in the air, and after a few minutes outside, one senses gritty particles in the recesses of oneÕs mouth and throat. Some of the mines still ship their coal in open trucks, coating roadside trees, ground and buildings in layers of black grime. One of the worst places is the huge yard on the outskirts of Singrauli town, where loads are transferred from the trucks to railway wagons. At the yard entrance thereÕs a mini-roundabout, adorned with a seven-metre sculpture of a clenched fist, a monument to IndiaÕs trade unions. The fist, once red, is stained the deepest black.
Since 2010, the Indian government has designated Singrauli a Òcritically polluted areaÓ. In 2012, DelhiÕs prestigious Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) tested SingrauliÕs water supplies, along with fish from local reservoirs, human blood and hair samples. In all, the study found high levels of mercury: in one village, water from pumps contained 26 timesÊthe maximum safe limit laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards. Some of the hair samples had five times the ÒsafeÓ concentration, while the fish contained twice the recommended level.
The CSE study also found high incidences of vitiligo, shivers, impaired vision, and burning sensation in the limbs, all recognised effects of mercury. Continued exposure, the study reported, might lead to depression, memory loss, and kidney damage. Chandra Bushan, the CSEÕs deputy director and one of the studyÕs authors, told me the source of the mercury was evident: Òfly ashÓ from SingrauliÕs power plants.
Fly ash has its uses Ð for example, in making cement. But for decades, untold thousands of tonnes have been collected from the chimneys, mixed with water and then discharged into the Singrauli environment in the form of grey slurry, left to dry and blow about in vast, open air Òash decksÓ.
Filthiest of all is the treatment of ash from Anpara A, commissioned in 1987, and Anpara B, which began to generate power seven years later. From the plants, a row of pipes carries the slurry to a series of huge ponds, where the ash is supposed to settle out. But the system does not work. From the third and final pond, the milky, polluted liquid tumbles over a grey cascade into the Rihand reservoir, the source of drinking water for the entire Singrauli region. Where the slurry meets the blue reservoir waters, there is a clear and visible boundary. Once the ash is in the reservoir, there is no way to get rid of it.
In one of the ponds, Ram Pri, a landless Adivasi, was up to his waist in liquid muck, sieving out the ash in order to decant it into 33kg bags, which are used to make cement. He said he gets paid Rs50 Ð about 50p Ð per bag, and by this perilous, toxic labour, can make Rs200Ð300 a day. His wife used to help him, Òbut she canÕt any longer: her feet, her knees and ankles are all swollen. SheÕs not able to walk. Maybe thatÕs because of whatÕs in the water.Ó
His is not the only local family to have derived little benefit from the Singrauli coal and power boom. For more than 20 years, several thousand mainly Adivasi people have been living in Simplex, a concrete shanty town adjoining the perimeter wall of the 4.7GW Vindhyachal power plant Ð one of the biggest in India. The colony was built to house workers who built the plantÕs early phases, and its high-voltage output lines run directly overhead.
Astonishingly, Simplex is still not connected to the electricity grid. Its first Òreverse osmosisÓ water treatment unit opened only eight months ago. Until then, said Anjani Kumar Chaubey, a local activist, Òwe used to get severe gastric problems. The water we took from our handpumps made your skin sting, and in the monsoon, it contained worms. The whole of India gets electricity from this plant, but we are like the darkness around a candle. How can our children study? Sometimes, when there is a lot of wind, the whole area gets covered with ash. A lot of our people get sick.Ó
In Chilkantanbasti, where 7,000 people live close to a 35-year old coal plant at Shaktinagar, run by the state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation, there is electricity. But the air is some of the regionÕs dirtiest: ÒA man gets up here in the morning and he eats coal dust,Ó said Umar Kand, 19. ÒHe goes to bed at night, and heÕs eating coal dust still. If you put anything out anything out round here, it will have a film of ash within an hour.Ó The streets stink also of sewage: there is no sanitation, and despite a promise by NTPC two years ago, no water treatment unit. There are three public toilets, but none of them work. Kand shrugged: ÒWe go in the forest.Ó
Chilkatanbasti is exposed to another hazard. There are now strict rules governing the landscaping and afforestation of mine overburden piles, which must be split into tiers and divided by broad, flat ÒbenchesÓ, with no slope steeper than 37 degrees. When a giant pile from the Kharia mine that looms over the village was created, these rules did not exist, and the result is a tottering brown mountain, its slopes strewn with boulders the size of cars, its surface deeply etched by the water channels that form each monsoon.
ÒWhen it rains, material comes down towards us,Ó said Renu, a local woman who preferred not to give her surname. ÒThe police have even come to tell us we should evacuate our houses in case it slips. IÕve seen the rocks falling down the slopes. If it ever went altogether, it would be like a tsunami. But how can we leave our homes?Ó

Speaking to Time magazine earlier this month,ÊPrime Minister Modi failed to answer a question as to whether India would agree any binding emissions curb in Paris. Instead, he waxed lyrical about IndiansÕ love for nature, a theme echoed by environment minister Javadekar, who insisted: ÒGrowth and environmental protection are not against each other. We want a clean India, a green India. Clean air is our birthrightÓ Ð a statement that any visitor to Delhi, which currently endures the worldÕs worst particulate air pollution, will appreciate.
Yet these may not be empty words. For among the BJP governmentÕs most ambitious acts has been to quintuple the 2022 targets set for non-fossil energy by the previous regime, to 175GW Ð almost six times its current level. The most ambitious target of all is that for solar energy, which is meant to rise from just 3GW now to 100GW, in only seven years. No country has ever built solar at anything approaching this pace, and it would leave India with three times as much solar capacity as Germany Ð which over the course of decades, has deployed 38.5GW, much more than anywhere else in Europe, and more than twice as much as the United States. Many people, Dubash said, regard the target as ÒaspirationalÓ: the sheer manufacturing requirement, likely to come at first mainly from China, is huge.
On the other hand, for very obvious reasons, photovoltaic solar energy is a much more viable proposition in India than it is in northern European countries such as Germany, or for that matter, Britain. A well-sited solar panel in India will produce energy up to 22% of the time, as against perhaps 8% in the UK.
Ratul Puri, chairman of Hindustan Powerprojects Ltd, a multibillion-pound company that has invested heavily in both coal and solar, pointed out that solar has a further local advantage: ÒSolar generation perfectly overlays the demand cycle.Ó In other words, the hot, dry and sunny months will see solar output peak, just as the demand for irrigation pumps, fans and air conditioning is also at its greatest. During the cooling monsoon, solar output plummets, but so does demand: there is no need for irrigation when itÕs pouring with rain.
ÒCan we have 100% of energy in India from solar?Ó Puri asked. ÒNo, because I still want to be able to turn on my lights at 9pm at night, when solar is generating nothing. But 15, 20% of our energy coming from solar: we can easily do this in the very near future.Ó
Even in fertile, intensely farmed states such as Punjab, 15% of the land is arid, and unsuitable for irrigation Ð but ideal for solar panels. Meanwhile, in distinct contrast to Germany or Britain, the levelised cost of solar energy per 1KW/hr unit, averaged out over 25 years, is already close to Ògrid parityÓ, simply because Indian solar panels are so much more productive. Government subsidies have in the past been provided for small-scale users ÐÊthough these were recently cut, from 30% to 15% of installation costs, while only 15% those who deployed solar panels ever claimed them anyway. In India, even without subsidy, solar is becoming competitive with electricity from coal.
According to Puri, the price of solar electricity has fallen from Rs13 to Rs6.5 per 1KW/hr unit over the past five years Ð very close to the Rs6 cost of thermal power from coal. However, recent reforms to the finance of long-term infrastructure debt are reducing the gap still further. Puri added: ÒEveryone expects interest rates [currently a ruinous 10- 12%] to come down. If that happens, solar is going to hit grid parity, irrespective of any technical discoveries, within the next two years.Ó
A well-sited solar panel in India will produce energy up to 22% of the time, as against perhaps 8% in the UK
In the past five years, PuriÕs balance sheet has been split, two to one, in favour of coal over renewables. He said that over the next five years, he intends to reverse that balance, with £1bn going to coal and close to £3bn to solar Ð making Hindustan Powerprojects easily IndiaÕs biggest renewables investor.
Behind that decision is the fact that during the growth slowdown after 2011, very few new coal power plants were commissioned, while most of the private power firms which have come to dominate the industry are financially ÒdistressedÓ.
The reasons are complex. They partly stem from the chaotic and indebted state of the ÒdiscomsÓ, or distribution companies, the middlemen in IndiaÕs electricity industry, which buy power from generators and sell it to consumers. Artificially low tariffs imposed by state governments mean that discoms deliberately restrict supply, preferring to make power cuts than to increase their losses by selling power at prices below its purchase cost. There has also been a widespread failure to take action against rampant electricity theft in informal urban settlements. The upshot is that most coal plants are operating at only 60% capacity Ð for the time being, there is a surprising degree of slack in the system.
But Puri said that if the economy Òdoes start to roar againÓ in the way that Modi intends, the country will face a serious power shortfall by 2017. Even if new coal plants started to be planned today, they would not avert this problem: it usually takes seven-to-10 years for a freshly conceived coal plant to become operational.
On the other hand, solar projects can typically be realised within 12 to 18 months. ÒThe inactivity in commissioning new thermal plants over the last three years leaves India no choice but to go out and build solar capacity. That means India can overcome the crisis of electricity shortages, have cleaner air, have a more stable grid and go say nice things at theÊclimateÊchange negotiations in Paris.Ó
Without storage technology far in advance of what exists today, coal will still have to provide IndiaÕs ÒbaseloadÓ: lights and air conditioning at night; power for the factories Modi wants to see built. But beyond 2030, anything is possible. ÒI think the entire energy landscape is going to change in the next 30 years,Ó Puri said. ÒStorage is going to revolutionise it. I also think solar energy will become much cheaper than coal. So why would you build a coal thermal plant?Ó
There are other solar niches. The unreliability of IndiaÕs grid power means the country possesses a staggering 80GW of expensive, off-grid, liquid-fuel generating capacity, most from highly polluting diesel generators. Typically, consumers pay about Rs18 per unit for it when their grid power goes off Ð three times the usual price.
In Noida, a burgeoning satellite city on the outskirts of the Delhi megalopolis, Kushagara Nandan runs Sunsource Energy, a solar start-up. Educated in the US, he cut his teeth on a similar outfit based in New Jersey. Last year, Sunsource revenues quintupled, to £6m.
Part of his business is supplying rooftop units which, when the sun is shining, can fill the gap caused by grid outages far more cheaply than diesel: ÒWe synchronise grid, diesel and solar together. In Delhi alone, the potential for rooftop solar is at least 1.5GW.Ó One of his projects, rated at 250KW, adorns the Habitat Centre, a complex that includes conference venues, auditoria, restaurants and art galleries. Another 500KW array has allowed a school to save 20% on its power bills.
Cheap, off-grid solar also has great potential in IndiaÕs vast rural hinterland. Last year, a solar project to desalinate briny ground water from wells and power irrigation pumps at a village in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, which Sunsource helped develop with an Indian NGO, was given a Google Global Impact Challenge award. It worked so well that it has now been rolled out in five different villages.
* * *
Like Ratul Puri, NandanÊis a businessman. He is in solar primarily to make money. He urged caution: ÒUnrealistic expectations must not be raised. ItÕs crucial to realise that solar must be part of the mix Ð it cannot substitute for other sources. For the foreseeable future, India doesnÕt have a choice between coal and solar. It needs both.Ó
Pragmatism of this kind of now characterises other parts of Indian discourse over energy and the environment. There is, for example, little dispute that the pollution caused in earlier phases of mining and power generation at Singrauli is unacceptable. ÒThereÕs about 80GW Ð 40% of IndiaÕs capacity Ð that is either in such disrepair or so dirty that it needs to be replaced,Ó said Puri. ÒThe open trucks transporting coal and so on are a short-term phenomenon. No one in their right mind would transport coal by truck.Ó
For the past two years, Ashwani Dubey, a Delhi lawyer who was brought up in Singrauli, has been fighting a case to force the mine and power plant operators to clean up their act in the National Green Tribunal, a powerful judicial body that rules on environmental matters. In written evidence to the court issued in March, IndiaÕs Central Pollution Control Board recommended stringent measures, including the end of ash discharge into the Rihand reservoir by 31 July, and much stricter monitoring of air and water quality. Where necessary, remedial measures should be taken within six months Ð to be funded on the Òpolluter pays principleÓ. Within a few months, the open coal trucks are supposed to be gone Ð replaced by a closed Òmerry-go-roundÓ railway linking mines to power plants.
Northern Coalfields now has an environmental team in Singrauli, led by BK Sharma. As parts of the mines are worked out, it Òback-fillsÓ the overburden in an effort restore the landscape, and replants native species: ÒWe are trying to recreate the forest, so that when we leave, it will merge into the ecology of the area,Ó Sharma said.
It sounds utopian. But trees in central India grow fast, and on a visit to what was a part of the Nigahi mine, it was hard to distinguish between remediated pit and original forest. Meanwhile, following a Green Tribunal order, nine village water treatment units have been installed this year. By the end of June, a further 15 are meant to be operational.
There are further developments at the national level. Under the new mining law, a third of the money raised by the mining royalty Ð a 15% levy on all mine revenue, payable to state governments Ð must be given to communities in mine-affected areas, to be spent as they determine. The details have yet to be worked out. But according to Chandra Bushan of the Centre for Science and Environment, Òthis is a revolutionary development with huge implications for the entire developing worldÓ.
It is to be applied immediately, to old mines and new, and should mean the Òdarkness around the candleÓ seen in places such as Simplex will end. ÒSingrauli could become one of the richest districts in the country,Ó said Bushan. ÒNow we must make sure the money is spent on the right things.Ó
Meanwhile, the government has just introduced new pollution standards for coal plant technology Ð as strict as any in the world. ÒYou will no longer be able to burn coal cheaply and pollute,Ó said Bushan. Under these rules, old plants such as Shaktinagar and Anpara A will have to be scrapped.
Bushan warned that better regulations would not necessarily be enforced. ÒThe arm of the law is not always long in India. But there are certain trends that are positive. I am impressed quite frankly with the Modi government on these issues. TheyÕve done more than I expected.Ó
Where does all this leave India in the run-up to Paris? According to Navroz Dubash, what India and other developing countries need are not rigid emissions targets, but programmes designed to Òbend the curveÓ Ð to make emissions lower in the five years after 2020 than they would have been otherwise. The changing format of UNÊclimateÊnegotiations makes this easier to achieve. The diplomatic focus now is not on emissions targets but what are termed INDCs ÐÊeach countryÕs Òintended nationally determined contributionÓ. These, Dubash said, Òprovide an opportunity to dissolve the barrier between development andÊclimateÊneedsÓ.
Measures Dubash would like to see in IndiaÕs INDC include its targets for solar energy, better building standards, shifting freight from road to rail, low-energy ceiling fans, and widespread use of LEDs. Most are already in the pipeline: Javadekar said India is about to announce a massive plan to replace city street lights with low-energy LEDs.
That approach may allow India to plot the delicate course between environmental and developmental needs. ÒAs an old UN hand, I must tell you that we only distinguish between success and outstanding success,Ó Nitin Desai joked. Ò2015 will be a success. The issue is how great it will be.Ó

Why is a Paris suburb scrapping an urban farm to build a car park?
With less than three months to go before the UNÊclimateÊchange conference in Paris, a project at the forefront of urban sustainability in the cityÕs north-western suburb of Colombes faces impending closure Ð in favour of a car park.
Initiated in 2008 by Constantin Petcou and Doina Petrescu from Atelier dÕArchitecture Autogre (AAA), the award-winningR-Urban scheme is composed of a co-working and making space, the Recyclab, plus (just down the road) an urban agriculture facility, Agrocit, which is made up of allotments, a micro-farm whose produce is sold locally and a school providing professional training in compost-making. There is also a community space and cafe where the food grown on-site is processed and sold at affordable prices.
Petcou points out that the UNÕs intergovernmental panel onÊclimateÊchange (IPCC) acknowledges the role of individuals and local governments in tacklingÊclimateÊchange, and that R-Urban Òis doing just thatÓ.
ÒThe scheme is all about local practices,Ó Petrescu adds, Òbut itÕs also about scaling up through regional networks, and changing the way citizens in Colombes and elsewhere think about urban resilience.Ó
The project in Colombes is just gaining momentum. Shutting it down now would not make any sense
Constantin Petcou
With theÊclimateÊconference putting Paris in the global spotlight from 30 November, the decision by the City of Colombes to abandon one of EuropeÕs most ambitious urban sustainability schemes seems almost comical in its timing.
The city council argues that the replacement car park is essential to serve the regeneration of the area Ð but Benot, a long-term resident of Colombes who joined R-Urban in the projectÕs early days, points at all the spaces around the Agrocit that sit idle, ready to host the car park.
Claire, a retired nurse who lives nearby, adds that Òmost of the people around here do not have the money to pay for a parking spot anyway; the ones beneath the residential blocks are half-empty.Ó The mayor of Colombes did not respond to a request for comments.
While AAA could potentially rehouse the project and develop new schemes in other cities, Òwe donÕt want to let the people of Colombes down,Ó Petcou says. ÒItÕs great that other cities want to develop similar schemes, but the project in Colombes is just gaining momentum. Shutting it down now would not make any sense.Ó Yet the clock is ticking, with the projectÕs official funding coming to an end on 30 September.
Spending a rainy afternoon at the Agrocit, I am surprised to see so many people turning up despite the weather, checking on their allotments and spending some time chatting in the community cafe. The mix of people, from different origins and social backgrounds, exchanging gardening tips is unexpected.
The R-Urban project has provided life-changing opportunity for Benot, who made the big step to leave his job in the print industry to lead initiatives around compost and recycling. Inspired by his collection of beer labels Ð 700,000 and counting Ð he is now working with micro-breweries in Paris to recycle their waste, and is co-leading the School of Compost part of the Agrocit.
Benot is among the R-Urban residents who have launched a petition to save the project. Others, such as Claire, seem more fatalistic. She tells me she grew up on a farm in Lebanon, and was keen to take part in R-Urban as soon as it took off. ÒYou see, here my daughter and I can grow our own vegetables, and we donÕt use any pesticides. Organic fruits and vegetables are really expensive, so getting an allotment here has been nice.Ó
ÒWe learn from each other,Ó says Catherine, a long-term Colombes resident and former home carer, who had to stop working for health reasons. ÒI did not know anything about farming or gardening Ð but, for instance, there are lots of people here from the West Indies who have patches of land back home where they cultivate vegetables. Then the Portuguese know how to grow cabbage, and so on.Ó
The mix of people, from different origins and social backgrounds, exchanging gardening tips is unexpected
Catherine is busy baking cakes for the caf. ÒIt fills my free time, and you meet a lot of people. If the project moves away from here, I probably couldnÕt get involved that much, as I have difficulty walking.Ó
Related: Urban commons have radical potential Ð it's not just about community gardens
The dispute over the R-Urban project also reveals the difficulties lying ahead for the soon-to-be-created Metropolis of Greater Paris. On the 1 January 2016, its official birth date, more than 120 municipalities and their individual mayors will attempt to start building a coherent metropolitan identity, addressing issues such as strategic planning,ÊclimateÊchange and sustainable development.
The 400-or-so Colombes residents involved in the R-urban project would surely have some useful experiences to share with these mayors and town councillors about how to co-create a functional urban organisation. Showing me the luxuriant oasis of greenery that Agrocit has become over the years, Claire observes: ÒItÕd be such a shame to destroy all this, just for a boring car park.Ó

First it was glaciers, now your coffee facesÊclimateÊthreat: Coffee faces threat fromÊclimateÊchange
Damian Carrington
Rich western urbanites expecting to dodge the impacts ofÊclimateÊchange should prepare for a jolt: global warming is leading to bad, expensive coffee. Almost 2bn cups of coffee perk up its drinkers every day, but a combination of rising heat, extreme weather and ferocious pests mean the bean is running out of the cool mountainsides on which it flourishes.
""The rise in global temperature is of great concern for us in the coffee industry because it has already started putting the supply of quality coffee at great risk,"" said Dr Tim Schilling, executive director of the World Coffee Research programme, based at Texas A&M University.
""It is also obvious that increasing temperatures, as well as extreme weather events, have a very negative effect on production. Over the long term, you will definitely see coffee prices going up as a result ofÊclimateÊchange.""
Mauricio Galindo, head of operations at the intergovernmental International Coffee Organisation, is equally worried. ""  is the biggest threat to the industry. If we don't prepare ourselves we are heading for a big disaster,"" he said. Coffee drinkers may see the effect in their cups, but the 25m rural households around the globe whose livelihoods depend on coffee will be hit far harder.
The world's foremostÊclimateÊscience group, the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC), will include the effect of warming on coffee as part of a report on Monday on the global impact ofÊclimateÊchange.
The report warns that some parts of the world have gone beyond the point of no return. ""Both warm water coral reef and Arctic ecosystems are already experiencing irreversible regime shifts,"" it will say.
Food production in general is at risk, the report will say, with crop yields declining by as much as 2% a decade. Fisheries will be affected, with ocean chemistry thrown off balance byÊclimateÊchange.
TheÊIPCCÊwill report that in Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, a temperature rise of 3C would slash the area suitable for coffee production by two-thirds in the principal growing states of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo and eliminate it in others. While growing will become possible in states further south, this will not compensate for losses further north. AnÊIPCCÊreport on the science ofÊclimateÊchange published in September projected the world would warm by 2.6C-4.8C by the end of the century without deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
The dangers to coffee stem from its origins in the highlands of east Africa, where the relatively cool and stableÊclimateÊat altitudes of 1,500-2,800 metres allows the berries to thrive. But at 23C and above, the plant's metabolism starts to race, leading to lower yields and, crucially, a failure to accumulate the right mix of aromatic volatile compounds that deliver coffee's distinctive taste.
Pests like the berry borer beetle and leaf rust fungus are flourishing as the world warms. Leaf rust has savaged recent harvests in the coffee heartlands of central America, with yields down 40% in 2013-14 since 2011-12. ""The only way you can make sense of it is throughÊclimateÊchange,"" said Galindo. ""The temperature has risen and this fungus can attack with a speed and aggression we have never seen.""
At least 1.4 million people in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua depend on coffee production for their livelihoods. When coffee's susceptibility to changes inÊclimateÊhas caused crises in the last few decades, a quarter of all households have been forced to migrate.
The berry borer beetle was unknown until about 2000 in Ethopia, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda, as it preferred the warmer temperatures at lower altitudes. But warming has driven the beetle up the hillsides and into the coffee plantations and it now causes $500m damage a year. The beetle reproduces five times a year but further warming is expected to lead it to rise to 10 times. Endosulfan, the pesticide once used to control the berry borer, was banned in 2011.
ClimateÊchange is increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, as more energy is trapped in the atmosphere. According to Galindo, 2014's severe drought in Brazil has shown how sensitive prices are to such events, the price doubling to $2 per lb even before the harvest.
Assessing all the combined impacts ofÊclimateÊchange, Galindo said: ""In the worst-case scenario, we will only have a few places producing coffee."" Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia, Colombia and Ethiopia are the biggest producers and will probably have the resources to attempt to adapt. ""But central America and Laos and Peru and Burundi and Rwanda, they are gone.""
TheÊIPCCÊwill state that in some places, such as Uganda, adaptation by shifting plantations up hillsides will be impossible: they will simply reach the top and run out of land. Efforts are being made to develop new coffee varieties, to tolerate higher temperatures and resist pests. The coffee industry was worth $173bn in 2012, but Galindo said: ""You need major financial means to change all your trees.""
Researchers are working to identify the 10 or 20 most genetically diverse coffee plants from 1,000 native varieties collected in the Ethiopian forests in the 1960s. These can then be crossed and put into field trials to develop what Schilling calls ""super races"" of coffee.
The supply of coffee, on which 25m rural households depend for their livelihoods, is being put at risk byÊclimateÊchange

Desmond Tutu calls for boycott against fossil fuel industry: Archbishop calls for anti-apartheid-style campaign: Intervention days ahead of UNÊClimateÊChange report
Damian Carrington and Suzanne Goldenberg
Archbishop Desmond Tutu has called for an anti-apartheid-style boycott and disinvestment campaign against the fossil fuel industry for driving global warming, days ahead of a landmark UN report on how carbon emissions can be slashed.
In an article for the Guardian, the archbishop writes: ""We live in a world dominated by greed. We have allowed the interests of capital to outweigh the interests of human beings and our Earth. It is clear [the companies] are not going to give up; they stand to make too much money.""
Tutu, one of the most revered figures of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle, says: ""People of conscience need to break their ties with corporations financing the injustice ofÊclimateÊchange. We can, for instance, boycott events . . . sponsored by fossil-fuel energy companies.""
The Nobel peace prize winner also called for investors to dump their fossil fuel stocks: ""It makes no sense to invest in companies that undermine our future.""
The archbishop's intervention, just before the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange report, due out on Sunday, is the strongest yet in a rapidly growing global campaign against oil, gas and coal firms that is uniting anti-global warming activists with financial institutions who want to avoid a trillion-dollar crash in fossil fuel stocks.
A leaked draft of theÊIPCCÊreport states that, to avoid dangerous levels of warming, the rising investment in fossil fuel extraction and power plants needs to switch into reverse, dropping by $30bn a year until 2030, if carbon emissions are to be cut sufficiently to limitÊclimateÊchange to 2C. The draft says emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses grew nearly twice as fast over the last decade as in the previous 30 years. Emissions grew 2.2% a year on average from 2000-2010, compared to 1.3% a year over the period from 1970-2010. In 2010-2011 global emissions from burning fossil fuels grew 3%.
The report states that the rapid rate of greenhouse emissions is pushing the world closer to an era of runawayÊclimateÊchange. Tutu says, however, that a divestment campaign has begun. It started 18 months ago in the US. And it has grown faster than campaigns that targeted apartheid, tobacco and arms manufacturers, according to Oxford University research.
In the UK campaigners are targeting the pounds 5bn of fossil fuels stocks owned by UK universities and, last month, top doctors called for urgent divestment. Fossil fuel firms are also facing pressure from investors, with some large pension funds having already divested. The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, itself built on oil and gas revenues, is now formally considering dumping its fossil fuel stocks.

FightingÊclimateÊchange is affordable, says UN: Scientists' report rejects fears over economic costs Gas from fracking could have role in clean-up
Damian Carrington Berlin
CatastrophicÊclimateÊchange can be averted without sacrificing living standards according to a UN report, which concludes that the transformation required to a world of clean energy is eminently affordable.
""It doesn't cost the world to save the planet,"" said economist Professor Ottmar Edenhofer, who led the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) team.
The cheapest and least risky route to dealing with global warming is to abandon all dirty fossil fuels in coming decades, the report found. Gas - including that from the global fracking boom - could be important during the transition, Edenhofer said, but only if it replaced coal burning.
The authoritative report, produced by 1,250 international experts and approved by 194 governments, dismisses fears that slashing carbon emissions would wreck the world economy. It is the final part of a trilogy that has already shown thatÊclimateÊchange is ""unequivocally"" caused by humans and that, unchecked, it poses a grave threat to people and could lead to wars and mass migration.
Diverting hundred of billions of dollars from fossil fuels into renewable energy and cutting energy waste would shave just 0.06% off expected annual economic growth rates of 1.3%-3%, theÊIPCCÊreport concluded.
""The report is clear: the more you wait, the more it will cost [and] the more difficult it will become,"" said EU commissioner Connie Hedegaard. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: ""This report is a wake-up call about global economic opportunity we can seize today as we lead onÊclimateÊchange.""
The UK's energy andÊclimateÊsecretary, Ed Davey, said: ""The [report shows] the tools we need to tackleÊclimateÊchange are available, but international efforts need to significantly increase.""
TheÊIPCCÊeconomic analysis did not include the benefits of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, which could outweigh the costs. The benefits include reducing air pollution, which plagues China and recently hit the UK, and improved energy security, which is currently at risk in eastern Europe due to the actions of Russia - a large producer of gas - in Ukraine.
The newÊIPCCÊreport warns that carbon emissions have soared in the last decade and are now growing at almost double the previous rate. But its comprehensive analysis found rapid action can still limit global warming to 2C, the internationally agreed safe limit, if low-carbon energy triples or quadruples by 2050.
""It is actually affordable to do it and people are not going to have to sacrifice their aspirations about improved standards of living,"" said Professor Jim Skea, an energy expert at Imperial College London and co-chair of theÊIPCCÊreport team. ""It is not a hair shirt change of lifestyle at all that is being envisaged and there is space for poorer countries to develop too,"" Skea told the Guardian.
Nonetheless, to avoid the worst impacts ofÊclimateÊchange at the lowest cost, the report envisages an energy revolution ending centuries of dominance by fossil fuels - which will require significant political and commercial change. On Thursday, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called for an anti-apartheid style campaign against fossil fuel companies, which he blames for the ""injustice"" ofÊclimateÊchange.
Friends of the Earth's executive director, Andy Atkins, said: ""Rich nations must take the lead by rapidly weaning themselves off coal, gas and oil and funding low-carbon growth in poorer countries.""
Along with measures that cut energy waste, renewable energy - such as wind, hydropower and solar - is viewed most favourably by the report as a result of its falling costs and large-scale deployment in recent years.
The report includes nuclear power as a mature low-carbon option, but cautions that it has declined globally since 1993 and faces safety, financial and waste-management concerns. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - trapping the CO2 from coal or gas burning and then burying it - is also included, but the report notes it is an untested technology on a large scale and may be expensive.
Biofuels, used in cars or power stations, could play a ""critical role"" in cutting emissions, theÊIPCCÊfound, but it said the negative effects of some biofuels on food prices and wildlife remained unresolved.
The report found that current emission-cutting pledges by the world's nations make it more likely than not that the 2C limit will be broken and it warns that delaying action any further will increase the costs.

'A one-off in human history':ÊStern's warning onÊclimateÊchange battle
Europe has to step up its effort to combatÊclimateÊchange and wake up to the urgency of the situation, theÊclimateÊchange expert LordÊSternÊhas said before crunch UN talks in Paris later this month.
Europeans need to end subsidies for fossil fuels, multiply energy efficiency efforts, improve mass public transport systems and accelerate the roll-out of electric cars in order to live up to their commitments,ÊSternÊtold theÊGuardianÊin an interview.
Related: Storm and drought: what Europe has to fear fromÊclimateÊchange
Decisions taken at the Paris summit, opening on 30 November, will shape the worldÕs carbon course for the next two decades, which in turn will determine whether there is a chance of avoiding a global temperature rise of more than 2C, considered to be the threshold for dangerousÊclimateÊchange.
ÒIn human history itÕs a one-off É and what we map out in the next two decades will be absolutely critical,Ó he said. ÒWhether we can live in our cities Ð breathe in them, move in them Ð all of this will be defined by the decisions we take.
ÒI donÕt think the criticalness of these 20 years is sufficiently understood.Ó
SternÕs word were echoed by a high-ranking UN science adviser, Prof Jim Skea, who agreed that the EU needed to go beyond existing pledges of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.
Skea, from Imperial College London, said Europe needed to raise that pledge to at least 45%, and ideally to 50%. ÒIf we were in the upper end of the 40s it would be perhaps the lowest-cost way of getting to the ambitious improvement in the long term,Ó he said.
His claim will be controversial among governments and some powerful industries who are concerned that they are already at a disadvantage because restrictions on pollution are so much tougher in Europe than in other parts of the world. The UK steel industry is among the claimed casualties.
More than 140 countries have already submitted plans for cutting their emissions before the talks in Paris. On Friday the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) said the offers fell significantly short of what was needed for a 66% chance of stopping the average temperature rising by 2C or more.
TheÊEuropean UnionÕs pledge is among the most ambitious, though analysis of the policies of the 28 member states suggests they are not yet on track to fulfil it.
ÒThey [the EU] were leaders, and they vacillated,Ó saidÊStern, who is now chairman of the Grantham Research Institute onÊ  and the Environment at theÊLondon School of Economics, and a crossbench peer. ÒThey have to do better than that [40%], but I think they are rekindling.Ó
The EU were leaders, and they vacillated. They have to do better than that
LordÊStern
For the EU to increase targets and meet greater emissions cuts, governments will need to resist political pressure to prop up their coal industries, and the European commission must reduce allowances in the emissions trading system even more quickly than planned, said Skea, who was appointed co-chair of the working group on mitigation, which compiles five-yearly reports for the UNÕs Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC).
Both measures would meet opposition, including in Germany and Poland.
The Unep projection said country pledges so far would be likely to generate emissions equivalent to 54 gigatonnes of CO 2 in 2030, higher than current emissions but 11gigatonnes lower than if no action were taken.
To meet the ambition of a ÒlikelyÓ chance of avoiding more than 2C warming, the figure needs to be reduced to 42 gigatonnes by 2030, and a carbon-free world economy in the second half of this century, it said.
Related: Think you can't help the environment? These Europeans disagree
The calculation does not take account of thousands of pledges being made by companies, industry groups, cities and regions or provinces, many of which are more ambitious than the countries they operate in.
In recognition of how important those further cuts could be, organisers in France are hosting the once fringe players in prestigious central locations. Organisers are even hopeful that the planned ÒParis OutcomeÓ statement by the French foreign minister,ÊLaurent Fabius, will include these promises.
ÒThe cities and businesses are credible,Ó saidÊStern, author of a seminal report arguing that catastrophicÊclimateÊchange would cost the worldÕs economies more than trying to stop it. ÒIf you get this right it could be so attractive; if you get it wrong it will be so difficult.Ó
SternÊalso warned Europe could not be complacent about the impacts ofÊclimateÊchange.
Related: No pets, no kids, no flights: how readers are reducing their carbon footprint
ÒEurope is warming faster than many other parts of the world,Ó said the economist.
ÒSome extreme weather events have increased, with southern and central Europe seeing more frequent heat waves, forest fires and droughts. Many parts of southern Europe could face desertification if global average temperature rises by significantly more than 2 centigrade degrees.Ó
Heavier precipitation and flooding is projected in northern and north-eastern Europe, with a heightened risk of coastal flooding and erosion.
ÒThe European land temperature over the past decade has been on average 1.3¡C higher than in the pre-industrial era, compared with a global average rise of about 0.8¡C. Impacts vary across theÊEuropean UnionÊbut all Member States are exposed toÊ . The Mediterranean basin, mountain areas, densely populated floodplains, coastal zones, outermost regions and the Arctic are particularly vulnerable toÊclimateÊchange impacts.Ó

West outsourcing CO2 emissions, says UN: Goods made in China but bought in US and Europe Draft report warns exports are distorting statistics
Suzanne Goldenberg US environment correspondent
The world's richest countries, including the UK and US, are increasingly outsourcing their carbon pollution to China and other rising economies, according to a draft UN report.
Outsourcing of emissions comes in the form of electronic devices such as smartphones and cheap clothes manufactured in China and other rising economies but consumed in the US and Europe.
A draft of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, obtained by the Guardian, says emissions of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases warming the planet grew twice as fast in the first decade of the 21st century as they did during the previous three decades.
Much of that rise was due to the burning of coal, the report says. And much of that coal was used to power factories in China and other rising economies that produce goods for US and European consumers.
Since 2000, annual carbon dioxide emissions for China and the other rising economies have more than doubled to nearly 14 gigatonnes a year, according to the draft report. But about 2 GT a year of that was produced making goods for export.
The picture is similar for other rising economies producing goods for export, the report finds.
""A growing share of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion in developing countries is released in the production of goods and services exported, notably from upper-middle-income countries to high-income countries,"" the report says.
""A growing share of global emissions is released in the manufacture of products that are traded across international borders.""
The newly wealthy elites of China, India and Brazil are flying more, buying more cars and otherwise fuelling the consumption that is drivingÊclimateÊchange. But their per capita greenhouse gas emissions are still below those in America and Europe - a gap that China and India regularly cite atÊclimateÊtalks.
In addition, a large and growing share of the carbon pollution attributed to China and those rising economies was generated in the production of goods that ended up in America and Europe. The outsourcing of those emissions has skewed efforts to account for all global emissions, which were typically conducted on a national basis. Those accounting efforts are no longer accurate, according to analysts.
The 29-page draft, a summary for policymakers, was dated 17 December. An edited version is due to be published in April. The report is the third in a series by theÊIPCC, summing up the state of theÊclimateÊcrisis since 2007 and prospects for solutions. The first part was released in September. It is stark about the chances of avoiding dangerousÊclimateÊchange - especially if deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are pushed back beyond 2030.
Temperatures have already risen by 0.8C since the dawning of the industrial age, the report says. Unless there are deep cuts in emissions - up to 70% of current levels by 2050 - or a near-quadrupling of renewable energy, governments may have to fall back increasingly on experimental technologies for sucking carbon dioxide from the air to avoid dangerous warming, it warns.

Leading Article:ÊClimateÊchange: Small is also beautiful
It is easy to feel powerless in the face of global warming. Even the phrase itself is impersonal, while the science behind it is dense and its long-term implications still contentious. Now the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, which is meeting in Berlin this weekend to present its draft proposals for mitigating the impact of warming, has woken up to the need to get both more specific and more positive. Big targets on emission reductions still matter, but there are lots of smaller ones too, ideas that could improve lives now as well as save lives
in the future.
About time too. TheÊIPCCÊhad so successfully impressed us with the seriousness of the challenge and the scale of the actions required to tackle it that the default reaction is too often a helpless shrug at the futility of effort. The first two reports in the current series were in line with the past - gloom, followed by doom. Last September, the initial assessment said the evidence that some part of global warming was caused by human intervention was now
""unequivocal"". Last month, its second assessment warned of the ""catastrophic"" impact of warming on food security and biodiversity and the knock-on effects on communities competing for ever scarcer resources.
If emphasising the scale of the challenge is a disincentive, it is even harder to galvanise people and governments into action against the background noise of theÊclimateÊchange deniers who continue to be offered a voice out of all proportion to the evidence for their opinions. And perversely, the threat to energy security posed by switching to carbon-neutral electricity sources, as well as the cost to industry and individuals, present big political dilemmas - while the long-term nature of the challenge makes it all too easy to file it under ""too difficult"". Only the greenest converts clamour for higher electricity bills. So there are good reasons for making the problem feel more local.
Cities are one new focus for action. Greener cities, particularly those that are being built now to accommodate the great global migration away from the land, will make better places to live and stronger homes for the future. A billion people already live in cities that are at risk from rising sea levels and inland flooding. Insulation, solar panels and more thoughtful urban planning will increase resilience as well as reducing emissions. But old cities need greening, too. For several weeks across much of northern Europe, air quality has been so poor that vulnerable people were being warned to stay indoors. On Thursday, a report from Public Health England estimated that nearly 30,000 people a year die from the effects of traffic pollution: diesel particulates and nitrogen
dioxide that are quickly absorbed into the blood stream. Setting more stringent targets - or at least meeting all the existing ones - would save lives. One of the best ways of doing it is to make UK cities genuinely bicycle-friendly. In the world's best biking cities, at least half of all journeys are made by bike. In London, of 30m each day, it is barely one in 50.
But the big picture is also offering reasons to be cheerful. Of all the excuses for doing nothing, the argument most often trotted out is that whatever contribution Britain, or even the whole EU, made to reducing carbon emissions would be more than offset by the rapid growth of coal-fired power stations in China. That fox may now be shot. Greenpeace is reporting that China is making plans for such a steep reduction in its reliance on coal by increasing energy efficiency and rapidly expanding its use of renewable energy that its carbon emissions could peak before 2020. It is not enough on its own. But theÊIPCCÊscientists' call for a trebling of the use of renewables takes on a new force if the world's fastest-growing polluter has made such a big move. One more reason, as Desmond Tutu argued on these pages yesterday, for every one to make their own difference.

Population growth andÊclimateÊchange: fewer people does not mean more CO2
Your editorialÕs argument about a causal link between slowing population growth and increased economic growth ( Fewer people means more carbon: the population paradox, 3 August) is dangerously out of date.
In its 2014 report, theÊIntergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChangeÊshowed how the reduction through efficiency of CO 2emissions from fossil fuels was wiped out by population increase, the real paradox being why it then offered pages of energy policy advice, but not a word on population. Could it be that theÊIPCCÊÐ and you Ð are blinded by the logic that regards economic growth as more important than carbon emissions and misery for lots of women and children?
Think what you are saying to a poor woman in India or Africa, where populations are on track to double soon. ÒCarry on with your multiple unwanted pregnancies, so long as you stay poor. Your capability (information and materials) to choose when to have children must wait until Ôeconomic reformÕ brings industrialisation Ð with luck that wonÕt destroy your environment first.Ó
And you wrongly assume a perfect market for reproductive choice in rich countries, where about four in 10 pregnancies are unplanned, four children are seen as a symbol of enviable wealth (think Beckhams), and in the UK, for example, the quality of reproductive health education and provision is not very good.
The 2015 UN population statistics note that in 43 countries Ð including Russia, China and Germany Ð populations are already declining. An economic logic of fewer people consuming less stuff is beginning to emerge in practice, free of troublesome paradoxes about conserving the environment and respecting womenÕs desire to manage their own fertility. Moreover, it reduces the likelihood of social and economic meltdowns, which are certain if we carry on as we are.
Sara Parkin
Patron, Population Matters
¥ It seems obvious that the worldÕs increasing population presents serious problems in three ways, as you point out in your editorial. The number of people is increasing, people are living longer, and they expect a rising standard of living. It is too strong to say, as you do, that the linkage ofÊclimateÊchange to world population is ÒflawedÓ Ð inadequate certainly, but it is not an irrelevant parameter. In addition to the consequences of population onÊclimateÊchange, the competition for limited resources (land, minerals, energy, fresh water, fairness, etc) will surely create serious risks of conflict. Conflicts rarely solve anything, but damage resources and degrade societies. Allowing the world population to continue to rise is storing up problems. I hope such aspects will feature in the Paris meeting onÊclimateÊchange in December. We in the developed world hence have a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and make the technology available worldwide. We also need to modify our lifestyles to reduce impact on world resources Ð and find that one can still enjoy life.
John Chubb

¥ I was surprised to read your editorial claiming that Òfewer people means more carbonÓ. What absolute nonsense. This is a post hoc fallacy. Obviously increased pollution in a country is not a function of the reduction of the population of that country. What is true is that countries with richer populations tend to pollute more, generally as a result of their populations consuming more products, travelling more etc. Another by-product of the increased wealth of a country is that population growth in that country tends to slow down Ð when health improves itÕs no longer necessary to assume that only a percentage of oneÕs children will reach old age. To claim that fewer people means more carbon is akin to claiming that the rooster crows immediately before sunrise, therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.
Christopher Lascelles
London
¥ Your editorial fails to recogniseÊclimateÊchangeÕs complexity. Carbon per capita may well increase with economic prosperity, but carbon emissions are still a function of total population and are increasing fastest in underdeveloped countries. Every extra mouth has to be fed, and agriculture is one of the main producers of greenhouse gas emissions.
Furthermore it isnÕt just carbon dioxide that contributes toÊclimateÊchange. Methane, generated from raising livestock as well as rice fields, is the second most important greenhouse gas. ItÊhas risen from 500 parts per billion (ppb) to about 1,800 ppb and is currently increasing by 6 ppb per annum. This is not all due to agriculture, but to argue that population growth will not impact onÊ  is highly misleading.
Dr Robin Russell-Jones

¥ You suggest that retaining high fertility rates in the poorest countries would help preventÊclimateÊchange by slowing industrialisation. But, even if this analysis were correct, what cost would such a policy have to those living in those countries? The idea of sensible population policies is to allow the poorest to move out of poverty while minimising the effect onÊclimateÊchange.
Martin Earl
London
¥ Your conclusion that Òfocusing on population growth could actually accelerate the global environmental problems it claims to addressÓ could better include David AttenboroughÕs published view that Òthere is no major problem facing our planet that would not be easier to solve if there were fewer people and no problem that does not become harder Ð and ultimately impossible to solve Ð with ever moreÓ.

Two certainties existed entering the Paris climate talks. They hold as true coming out. The first was that the world’s heads of state were not prepared to act as is necessary. The second is that it was never going to be up to them anyway.

The richest governments – politically captured by a fossil fuel-wedded corporate class – were hobbled from the outset. It was the movement being built by activists around the globe that shaped the best of the Paris agreement. And what was worst they were unable to prevent.

These movements’ growing power at home forced a tremendous promise abroad: an aspiration to keep the world to 1.5 degrees of warming, above which spells disaster for Indigenous peoples, low-lying island nations, and the African continent. The limits of their power meant everything shoddy about this agreement: that the US and others could choose their own emissions targets; wouldn’t be legally bound or on a strict timeline; and won’t pay poorest countries, who have done practically nothing to create the problem but now suffer practically everything, what is needed to adapt to climate change. And as the world hurtles toward 3 degrees of warming, they have been stripped even of the right to legally demand compensation.

The first task is to never let the richest governments forget their rhetoric. Did you say 1.5 degrees? Repeat it back to them as they return to licensing the mines, mega-dams, and monocultures that will render even their paltry emission targets impossible - and then back it up with action. The second is already underway: the transformation of the climate movement itself. As Paris was its witness, a fledgling climate justice movement is no longer fighting merely against the carbon in the atmosphere, but the political and economic system that first emitted it there.

Which is why many of those who descended on Paris would not, until recently, have even been labelled climate activists.



Like the African and Asian peasants whose organic agriculture is feeding most of the world – and by locking carbon in the soil, cooling the planet. Or transit activists in Latin America and the United States campaigning for affordable or free public transportation – enabling travel for poor people while disabling carbon-intensive car culture. Or European trade campaigners trying to change the rules of trade pacts so that corporations can’t chase the easiest dollar – and the dirtiest energy. And refugees, displaced by war and by climate change, fighting to cross fortressed borders – ensuring that while the world gets hotter, it doesn’t also get meaner. Labour unions demanding millions of jobs that pay well and are unionized – and that don’t cook the climate. And women the world-over – the first to suffer from it, the first to fight it – demanding a place in the movement’s centre. All of these struggles thronging with vitality, with climate change like a sail at their backs.

They are being woven into a movement of movements, prompting action with the right incentive: the promise of changed lives, instead of an unchanged climate. In France, more than a hundred organizations – labour unions, faith groups, green groups – united in an unprecedented manner behind the slogan that calls for such bold integrated solutions: “system change, not climate change.” A friend returned surprised from a meeting of funders held on the sidelines of the Paris negotiations. More than half of them wanted to identify what a few years ago could scarcely be mentioned: capitalism.

That economic system’s drive for endless profits and extraction wasn’t up for debate in Paris, but it may be soon. Fossil fuels didn’t even merit a mention in the text; they might in ten years be an unmentionable crime. They’ll have to be. To say the Paris pact failed - on the grounds of science and justice – is not to be cynical. It is to be realistic. Amilcar Cabral once counselled such honesty to the anti-colonial liberation movement in Guinea-Bissau: “Tell no lies. Mask no difficulties, mistakes, failures. Claim no easy victories.” Hope falsely founded is no hope worth having. It is illusion. And it is how movements get shattered.

Such a movement went home from Copenhagen six years ago broken-hearted about about their governments’ intransigence. The movement now is different. It came to Paris with eyes wide open. It refused to be fooled by shiny and bold proclamations, refused to be scattered by a French government who exploited a State of Emergency to impose an unprecedented clamp-down on dissent.



It is not yet a movement powerful enough to shift a global summit, but it is on a winning streak: defeating pipelines, shuttering coal and nuclear plants, banning fracking, beating back Arctic drilling, delaying trade agreements, expanding agro-ecological farming and seed-saving, winning Indigenous land rights, and momentously scaling up its divestment victories.

When one assesses the terrifying physical deadlines approached by climate change, it is tempting to despair. When one sees the face of this movement, it is impossible not to feel courage. In Paris, its face was thousands marching in defiance of a protest ban, local activists enduring house arrest, Indigenous peoples paddling down the Seine, refugees on the city’s outskirts refusing to be discarded, and delegates disrupting conference proceedings utterly removed from the urgency of the science and suffering. And now it is returning home to the places where its power lies, in the fields and the forests, the city councils and the co-ops, the seas and the streets.

Even if the states and corporations of the world are not yet ready for the change ahead, a growing multitude is. Paris was a failure, but a climate justice movement is rising."

Alan Finkel’s emissions target breaks Australia’s Paris commitments
Michael Slezak
Less than two weeks ago, Alan Finkel told the Senate his landmark report would help Australia meet the commitments it made in Paris to reduce its economy-wide emissions by 28% below 2005 levels by 2030.

But his recommendations on the future of the National Electricity Market, released today, appear to fly in the face of those very commitments.

Related: Finkel review anticipates lower power prices, but weak electricity emissions target

Before Senate estimates Finkel said: “We are very cognisant of the commitment that the nation has made through the Paris accords.

“We absolutely need to deal with the issue of ensuring that the electricity sector can do its fair share in helping the nation to meet its obligations under the Paris accord – the COP21 accord.”

Now today, his landmark review of the National Electricity Market has modelled cuts to emissions of the electricity sector that are the same as what the entire economy needs to do: 28% below 2005 levels by 2050. He said anything deeper, which had been suggested in other reports, would cause problems.

Finkel suggested those cuts should be achieved with a “clean energy target” – which is equivalent to what has been called a Low Emissions Target. The result by 2030 will be one where renewables are responsible for just 42% of electricity generation.

But what is the electricity sector’s fair share?

Well it’s a lot more than that recommended by Finkel’s report.

How do we know it needs to be higher? We can look at a report from the Climate Change Authority, that Finkel himself co-wrote, that examined how much the electricity sector needed to do.

After examining several scenarios for meeting Australia’s emissions reduction targets, it concluded: “The common finding is that the electricity sector can contribute deep, cost-effective emissions reductions as part of national action to meet global temperature goals.”

The electricity sector has to do much of the heavy lifting for several reasons.

it’s the biggest source of carbon emissions – producing more than a third of the country’s total. many other industries can’t easily reduce emissions – it’s very hard to reduce the emissions from the agriculture sector, for example. decarbonising the electricity sector will help other sectors decarbonise – for example, if cars stop using petrol and shift to electricity, we will need the electricity system to be low-emissions in order to see an actual reduction in emissions.

That last point was made by the Climate Change Authority report. “Substantial decarbonisation of electricity supply can facilitate emissions reductions in other sectors, as electricity can displace their direct use of fossil fuels,” it said.

But in his report today, Finkel said any deeper cuts could be problematic. “The adoption of a more ambitious target would have larger consequences for energy security as such a target would likely see a higher level of [variable renewable energy] incentivised,” Finkel wrote.

Bill Hare, the a leading climate scientist and CEO at Climate Analytics has spent a lot of time modelling precisely this issue

“From a scientific perspective this is quite shocking because the almost universal consensus from the modelling exercises for how to achieve the Paris agreement has the power sector doing a lot more than the rest of the economy everywhere in the world,” Hare said.

This conclusion appears to have been crafted to fit with the politics of the present government.

Bill Hare, climate scientist

“I think this conclusion appears to have been crafted to fit with the politics of the present government rather than the science and understanding of these systems,” he said.

Hare said he doesn’t know of any work globally that supports Finkel’s claim that deeper cuts to emissions will put the system’s reliability or security at risk.

Dylan McConnell from Melbourne University said an additional problem with having shallow cuts in emissions in the electricity sector, was that it was the cheapest place to make the cuts – so the overall cost to the economy of meeting our Paris commitments will be more expensive.

How deep do emissions cuts need to be in the electricity sector?

Finkel’s report for the Climate Change Authority can help us answer that.

The report found the electricity sector’s emissions intensity should drop by about 69% between 2015 and 2030. (From 0.81 tonnes per megawatt hour in 2015 to 0.25 tonnes by 2030.)

According to their modelling of a Clean Energy Target making this cut, they found it would reduce total emissions from the electricity sector by more than 60% from 2015 levels.

Related: Voters care more about power prices than emissions – Guardian Essential poll

(While Paris commitments are made with reference to 2005 levels, when total national emissions were much higher, emissions from the electricity sector, were roughly similar in 2005 and 2015.)

So, far from Finkel’s recommendation actually getting the electricity sector to do it’s fair share, if implemented, it would guarantee Australia does not meet its targets made in Paris, since it is about half as demanding on the electricity sector as it needs to be.

McConnell said there is no evidence that deeper cuts will cause problems for the security or reliability of the system – and modelling from the Australian Energy Market Operator has demonstrated that.

A way forward

It seems likely that the weak recommendations made by Finkel were intended to give something palatable to a Coalition government containing a conservative rump that wants state-subsidised fossil fuel generation, seemingly just for the sake of it.

But as things stand, Australia doesn’t have an emissions reduction policy. In fact, Australia has emission growth policies, with the government’s own projections demonstrating current policies will cause carbon emissions to grow for decades.

A mechanism like the one Finkel proposed will at least cut emissions, even if by an amount that will still lead to catastrophic climate change.

But more hopefully, if it is implemented in the right way, it could be “ratcheted up” by future governments

For example, if the 28% target is not legislated, but rather left as a regulatory leaver, it is something that could be increased later. To maintain confidence among investors looking to build energy infrastructure, it would help if the legislation required the target to move in only one direction (up)."

Sky high carbon tax needed to avoid catastrophic global warming, say experts
Phillip Inman
A group of leading economists warned on Monday that the world risked catastrophic global warming in just 13 years unless countries ramped up taxes on carbon emissions to as much as $100 (?77) per metric ton.

Experts including Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern said governments needed to move quickly to tackle polluting industries with a tax on carbon dioxide at $40-$80 per ton by 2020.

A tax of $100 a ton would be needed by 2030 as one of a series of measures to prevent a rise in global temperatures of 2C.

In a report by the High Level Commission on Carbon Prices, which is backed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, they suggest poor countries could aim for a lower tax since their economies are more vulnerable.

The aim of a tax on carbon would be essential to meet the targets set by the Cop21 Paris Agreement in 2015, they said.

The call for action will sting European leaders, who have presided over a carbon trading scheme since 2005 that currently charges major polluters just €6 (?5.20) for every tonne of carbon they release into the atmosphere.

The European scheme, which issues carbon credits to firms that can be traded on a central exchange, has come under fire for allowing heavy energy users to avoid investments in new technology to cut their emissions.

Critics accuse officials of issuing too many credits and allowing the price to fall to a level that makes it cheaper to pollute than for companies to change their behaviour.

Stiglitz and Stern said prices should rise to $50-$100 by 2030 to give businesses and governments an incentive to lower emissions even when fossil fuels are cheap.

The Trump administration has rejected calls to introduce a carbon tax in the United States, saying it would cost jobs. Washington’s refusal to adopt a tax has deterred Brussels from moving to a more substantial charge on emissions, which would have the effect of increasing energy costs, at least in the short term, and imposing higher costs on European manufacturers.

The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) is the world’s biggest scheme for trading greenhouse gas emissions allowances. It covers some 11,000 power stations and industrial plants in 30 countries, whose carbon emissions make up almost 50% of Europe’s total."

Finance sector could face climate-risk testing, says Australian watchdog
Gabrielle Chan
Australia’s financial institutions could be required to test climate-risk scenarios as international regulators continue to warn of the economic dangers posed by climate change.

Geoff Summerhayes, executive board member of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra), told a Senate committee that climate scenario testing could be added to the other common scenarios Apra requires financial institutions to face to ensure their systems are robust.

It’s been more than a year since the COP21 Paris climate change conference, when the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg was appointed to head a taskforce to provide investors, insurers, banks and consumers with more information. The move was part of plans for a voluntary industry-led code announced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the G20 body that monitors and makes recommendations about the financial system.

Last month Summerhayes warned climate change posed a material risk to the entire financial system and urged companies to start adapting. Apra is the regulator that oversees the $6tn industry made up of banks, building societies, superannuation, insurance companies and other financial institutions.

Summerhayes said Apra already sent out common scenarios for institutions to test. These scenarios have an economic factor, including an asset price shock and, in the case of the insurance industry, a potential liabilities scenario as well.

“It is possible in the future that climate could be such a risk that we would want to test,” Summerhayes said. “That is not in our current plans but it is possible as other emerging risks are, that we would scenario test.”

He acknowledged the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) had been very active on climate change. The bank’s governor, Mark Carney, has warned of financial crises and falling living standards unless corporations faced up to the risks. “Apra is not first prudential regulator to make statements about climate,” he said.

Emma Herd, the chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change, told the committee the political debate in recent years had stopped companies speaking publicly about their strategic response to climate change.

“In terms of company reporting, the challenge for companies is that … any statement that is made around climate change as a financial risk is then interpreted through the prism of the political debate,” Herd said. “So companies have to be incredibly cautious about statements that they are making and constantly apply that political lens and I think that is creating a level of conservatism that is inhibiting how companies talk about their strategic response to climate change.

“Companies are often much more prepared to talk fully and frankly to investors about their view than they are to talk publicly and into the public debate because it is just seen through the prism of the debate of the last 10 years.”

Herd revealed unpublished research from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors from 1 March this year, in which an analysis of 167 ASX 200 companies found there were large gaps in corporate reporting. It found:

Only 69 companies (41%) publicly state that they acknowledge climate science or identify and assess climate risk; Only 106 companies (63%) report on their greenhouse gas emissions; Only 36 companies (22%) publicly report on climate change-related targets.

Herd said reports were very short on detail with many companies simply disclosing their emissions. Very few disclosed a strategy for dealing with the climate-related issues that might affect the businesses, or report on mitigating these risks.

Summerhayes said his climate warning last month came about due to three factors: Australia’s Paris commitments, the Bloomberg taskforce and the legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC for the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council on company directors’ duties and climate change.

Last month he said: “The opinion found that company directors who fail to properly consider and disclose foreseeable climate-related risks to their business could be held personally liable for breaching their statutory duty of due care and diligence under the Corporations Act.”

Summerhayes said climate was an active discussion in many of the institutions supervised by Apra.

“Markers that have been put down in the last year are significant and markets are already adjusting to those markers and the extent to which the draft report to FSB is adopted or not, we are of the view that a transition is under way to a lower-carbon world and that has implications on the risks that Apra-regulated entities need to oversee.

“Hence we expect them to be having a conversation about it.”

Kate O’Rourke of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the regulatory framework was flexible enough to accommodate scenario testing and companies could choose to dramatically change their information disclosures on climate risks.

Last month a coalition of business, energy, climate and welfare groups issued a joint statement warning that a decade of partisan politics and finger-pointing had destroyed investor confidence in Australia’s energy sector.

Five ways to take action on climate change
Fatih Birol
The Paris agreement has been ratified. Only one year after negotiating this historic treaty, it has come into force. This signals that the vast majority of governments around the world remain committed to fighting climate change.

Yet that was the easy part. Actually realising these commitments made at COP21 in Paris will require concerted, concrete action for many years to come. Though the vast majority of countries in the world have clear goals in the form of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), these are not action plans, nor are the NDCs strong enough to actually keep global average temperature from rising more than 2C.

The Paris agreement is a truly global commitment, spanning developed and developing countries around the world. Yet for many developing and least-developed countries, in particular, contributing to the fight against climate change requires taking targeted actions while also prioritising economic development and poverty reduction. Here are five areas in the energy sector that offer such a win-win.

1 Ensure that everyone has access to energy

While energy is the foremost contributor to carbon emissions, access to it is also a critical enabler of human and economic development. At the same time, the billions who lack access have not contributed to climate change. Any concerns that achieving energy access for all would magnify the challenges of energy security or climate change are unfounded: it would only increase global energy demand by 1% in 2030 and CO2 emissions by 0.6%.

The latest estimates show that an estimated 1.2 billion people still do not have access to electricity

The latest figures, recently published in the World Energy Outlook 2016, show that an estimated 1.2 billion people, 16% of the global population, still do not have access to electricity. Access to clean cooking receives far less attention than electrification and in many ways is more difficult to achieve. An estimated 2.7 billion people, or almost 40% of the global population who are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, still rely on the traditional use of biomass for cooking.

Despite the urgency of the problem, investment is falling far short of what the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates is needed to achieve universal access by 2030 – around $50bn (?40bn) per year. Dedicated policies to promote access are essential to break the vicious cycle of energy poverty, in which growth in incomes and living standards are severely hindered by a lack of energy services. Technology can also be a major enabler of effective policymaking and improvement on the ground: decentralised renewable energy is providing an increasingly viable way to close the access gap in rural areas, particularly for remote settlements far from the existing grid.

2 Take steps to rapidly reduce air pollution

Around 6.5 million premature deaths worldwide are attributed each year to poor air quality, making this the world’s fourth-largest threat to human health after high blood pressure, dietary risks and smoking.

This is an energy sector problem, as energy production and use, mostly from unregulated, poorly regulated or inefficient fuel combustion, are the most important sources of air pollution from human activity. The harmful effects of energy poverty are felt most heavily in developing countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Confronting the twin challenges of CO2 emissions and air pollution means dispensing with short-term thinking and stop-gap solutions. IEA analysis shows that proven energy policies and technologies can chart a development path that delivers major cuts in air pollution around the world and bring health benefits, universal access to energy and improve sustainability.

3 Make cities energy efficient

Though the Paris agreement is a global accord between countries, much of the hard work will be taken in the cities of the world. Cities dominate energy demand, and by extension are responsible for a significant share of carbon emissions. As IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives 2016 highlighted, the world’s urban areas accounted for about 64% of global primary energy use and produced 70% of the planet’s CO2 emissions in 2013.

These shares will rise as cities grow and urban economic activity expands. As the world seeks to make more efficient use of its energy resources, increase energy security and meet global climate targets, cities must take a leading role in the energy transition.

Leadership must of course start from the top; policy at the national level must encourage the deployment of clean energy technologies, and include greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, carbon pricing mechanisms, and investment in energy research, development and demonstration. But these targets must then be complemented by action at the local level through efforts including sustainable transportation planning, building codes and improved data collection.

4 Power the economy with cleaner, more efficient technologies

Unfortunately today, many of the megacities of the world, particularly those in Asia, are still powered by antiquated subcritical coal-fired power plants. These can have emissions intensities of around 1,000kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour (that is, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released for each unit of power produced). More modern, highly efficient coal-fired power plants may have an intensity of around 800, yet a natural gas turbine can reach about 350. A coal plant equipped with carbon capture and storage can release less than 150kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour. At the very end of the spectrum, renewable sources like wind and solar have zero emissions. Globally, the average intensity of power generation today is just over 500kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour.

But, to align with the 450 Scenario in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2016 – a scenario consistent with limiting the global increase in temperature to no more than 2C – the emissions intensity of power generation needs to fall much further and faster, to around 80kg of CO2 per megawatt-hour by 2040.

A path to achieving this is likely to include a combination of a more rapid shift to low-carbon technologies worldwide (especially wind, solar and hydropower), fuel switching (such as from coal to gas), efficiency improvements and in some markets, adoption of carbon capture and storage.

5 Finally, stop incentivising the wasteful use of fossil fuels

This low-carbon transition must take place on a level playing field. Fossil-fuel subsidies distort energy markets, promoting inefficient use of energy and increasing energy-related CO2 emissions. They are a roadblock on the way to a cleaner and more efficient energy future.

They have also consistently dwarfed the amounts allocated by governments to subsidise renewable energy. In 2014, for example, fossil fuel consumption subsidies of almost $500bn (?400bn) were more than three-times higher than renewables subsidies of some $140bn (?112bn). But there has been progress. World Energy Outlook 2016 reports that the value of global fossil-fuel consumption subsidies in 2015 was estimated at $325bn (?260bn), reflecting lower fossil-fuel prices but also a subsidy reform process that has gathered momentum in some countries.

In the case of renewables, rapidly falling costs in recent years have been welcome, but in many cases subsidies are still needed to level the playing field with fossil-fuel alternatives that emit CO2 and other pollutants. But as technology costs continue to come down, and hopefully the environmental impacts of fossil fuel use is better reflected in pricing, more and more new renewable energy projects will be competitive without support.

Achieving universal access to clean, modern energy services while meeting global climate targets is no easy task. But with the right policies, aimed at the right sectors, with the right technologies, the world can soon be on track for a sustainable energy future."

Greece among best performers in emission reductions
Letters
The claim that Greece may receive an unfair exemption to increase lignite use ( Report, 3 November, theguardian.com) is not justified – it is based on misinterpretations:

1) Greece is not trying to “revive its lignite-based model”. In fact, retirements of fossil fuel plants in 2014-23 amount to 4,095MW, including 2,671MW of lignite capacity.

2) The Public Power Corporatrion has reduced its lignite sales share to 35%, down from 60% a decade earlier or 75% 20 years ago – hardly proof of a regressive mindset.

3) Ptolemaida V, a unit under construction, is not funded with free allowances. Free allocation concerns new projects after 2021.

Greece is actually among the best performers in emission reductions, as confirmed in the European commission’s 2015 progress report. In 2005-15 Greece achieved a 31% emissions reduction (vs its 6.5% target), 40% reduction of lignite use, and 400% increase in RES share, to 10,000GWh.

The system operator’s 2023 projection of generation capacity mix comprises 56% renewable energy sources (RES) and a 14% lignite. The country’s energy plan for 2030 aims to reduce emissions by 55% vs 2005 (including a 62% reduction in lignite emissions).

Adequate conventional reserve capacity is necessary at the national and regional level for the safe and stable transition from lignite to RES as Greece’s basic fuel, confronting the security supply risks posed by such a transition. Any other “planning” would directly increase dependence on imported gas in the interim.

Greece has already achieved much and is showing further ambition towards meeting COP21 targets. Ensuring a level playing field in Europe for all member states in hardship is a sine qua non to enable all to contribute to climate policy.

‘Africa is tired of being in the dark’: bank chief on plans to boost energy
Celeste Hicks in Marrakech
“We lose 5% of our potential GDP every year, and African industries cannot be competitive without access to electricity,” says Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank. “I believe that’s why we can’t break away from reliance on exporting our raw materials – new industries will only go to where there’s power.”

He is speaking on the sidelines of the COP22 climate change conference in Marrakech, which ends on Friday.

Related: Morocco lights the way for Africa on renewable energy

Adesina and colleagues from the bank have been using the conference to highlight its new initiatives on energy, including the New Deal on Energy for Africa, which will see $12bn (?9.7bn) invested in the sector over the next five years. “Africa is tired of being in the dark,” he says.

The African Development Bank (AfDB) has also created the role of vice-president on power, and been a major player in setting up the African Renewable Energy Initiative, which aims to generate 10GW of power from renewable sources by 2020 and up to 300GW by 2030. “This initiative was the major outcome for Africa of the Paris COP21 meeting last year, where G7 countries contributed $10bn towards it,” says Adesina.

Adesina says he is particularly impressed by the strides Morocco has taken to develop its capacity for solar energy. The AfDB was a major investor in the 160MW Noor solar plant at Ouarzazate, which was opened this year. The complex, which uses giant mirrors to reflect the sun’s heat on to liquid that then turns turbines, is being expanded to produce more than 500MW by 2018. Morocco has also recently signed a deal to build 1720MW in new wind farm capacity.

“Africa should use what it has and not what it doesn’t have. We have limitless sunshine and great potential for wind, hydro and geothermal,” he says. However, he still believes there is a role for non-renewable sources of energy in Africa. “We need a balanced energy mix. Some African countries have gas and coal, which can be used in a clean way, and they should use it.”

Another major challenge is to increase the amount of money spent on climate change adaptation – or helping countries to rebuild systems when they are destroyed by the impacts of climate change. In Africa, for example, governments are coping with floods, extreme temperatures and major droughts in east and southern Africa and the Sahel.

Wealthy countries have committed $100bn towards helping poorer states cope with climate change, but one of the major topics on the agenda in Marrakech has been how that money should be divided between adaptation and mitigation. Until now, only 14% of climate funds have gone to adaptation, and Africa, the continent most deeply affected by climate change, has received only 4% of the total green climate funds.

“We’ve been short-changed by climate change and we should not be short-changed in financing,” says Adesina. “South Africa has spent $700m this year dealing with the impacts of the drought last year; Mozambique $200m; Namibia $13m. These emergency costs are continuously displacing public expenditure which should be going to health, education and infrastructure development, and endangering macro-economic stability. My view is that we need to increase the amount to be spent on adaptation so that we can spend money on development.”

The AfDB is trying to garner support for an African insurance fund. An initiative called the African Risk Capacity Insurance has been launched, but of 32 countries that signed up, only seven have been able to pay the premiums. Adesina says the idea for the insurance fund was welcomed on Wednesday at an African heads of state meeting chaired by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI, and that one way in which climate finance can be better targeted to help African countries is for green climate funds such as the GEF (Global Environment Facility) to start paying the premiums for the African countries. He hopes that this could pave the way for action.

“Whenever these drastic climate events like drought, flood or extreme temperature happen, the world has words of comfort for Africa,” says Adesina. “But words of comfort cannot pay the bills and rebuild when problems start.”"

Give millennials a seat at climate talks as a symbolic new country
Letters
Nasa released data earlier this year showing that global surface temperatures across land and ocean in February were a whopping 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for that same month from 1951 to 1980. As the COP22 comes to a close, it’s time we think hard, and think creatively, about the way forward and start preparing for new initiatives. Building on the impressive success of COP21 in Paris, many political and business leaders as well as representatives of civil society seem eager to engage. That is a good thing, but it is not enough.

For better and, increasingly, for worse, our global system of governance rests overwhelmingly on territorial nation-states. In this system, each country’s government represents its own national interest. No one represents humanity as a whole. Such devotion to narrow interests leads to a host of profound problems, well known to economists and students of human behaviour. In various contexts they are known as “the tragedy of the commons”, “the prisoner’s dilemma”, “exporting externalities”, and “free riding”. When asked to act for the common good, nation-states are predisposed to echo Cain’s notorious response: “Am I my brother’s keeper?”

These decision makers, mostly middle-aged and older people, need to recognise that young people have a special role in representing mankind’s interest in our collective future. Most of the people currently deciding how ambitious we should be in reducing carbon emissions and adopting other environmentally sensible measures and policies won’t be around in 30 years. It is unacceptable that those with the biggest stake in the future be marginalised. We need new blood – and we need it on the playing field, not on the sidelines. Once a welcome and effective showcase, the COYs (Conferences of Youth), sponsored by the UN one month prior to COPs (Conference of the Parties), run the risk of becoming the symbol of the patronising way young people’s views and aspirations are treated.

It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government to the exception of all others. For many years, the democracy (once removed) of nations appeared to be the best available alternative. Today, globe-spanning, individual-empowering technologies open new opportunities. Young people are ready for a global system in which democracy remains a guiding principle, but where other entities, such as a symbolic country representing global youth, join actual nation-states in the decision-making. Like the characters in the Star Wars series, this generation does not care so much about where you are from or what colour your skin is. Instead it wants to know what your values are and where you are heading.

The time has come for a symbolic new country to take part in COPs and other key international gatherings, to represent the interests of those still under 30 worldwide – just like refugees were finally, deservedly, allowed to compete under their own banner in the Rio Olympics. A mix of scientists, entrepreneurs, activists, heads of NGOs and, yes, professional politicians would form the delegation. This “country” could have the rights and responsibilities that come with the turf, and play a commensurate role in debates and negotiations. While lacking in hard power, this country could presumably make use of reserves of soft power unavailable to most nation-states.

Inertia and cynicism are powerful forces, so this idea won’t be an easy sell. Luckily, young people have some formidable allies: some enlightened governments, like that of Justin Trudeau in Canada, and some of the world’s leading corporations have convincingly expressed their deep sense of responsibility to the future.

The future is ours. All of ours. Starting next year, let’s give millennials an actual seat at the table of negotiations of our annual Conference of Parties.

Live Q&A: How can the environment and development sectors work together to achieve the SDGs?
Katherine Purvis
Traditionally, the environment and the development sectors have worked separately, but the era of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change calls for a shift in approach.

In ratifying the Paris Agreement, countries have pledged to limit the increase in average global temperature to below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Meanwhile, protection of the environment features heavily in the SDGs: countries commit to creating sustainable cities and communities, promoting responsible consumption and promotion, and taking climate action – all measures that could help fulfil the Cop21 agreement.

“What’s exciting about the SDGs is the interconnectedness,” said Archana Patkar, networking and knowledge management programme manager for WSSCC, at an event organised by the Guardian alongside the UN General Assembly in September.

So how can the development and environment sectors collaborate and align their efforts in achieving these interconnected goals? Where can parallels be found between the two sectors? How can efforts to improve economic growth be made without harming the environment? And which “dynamic new ways of working” can environment and development professionals adopt to achieve the SDGs?

Join an expert panel on Thursday 27 October, from 2pm to 3.30pm BST, to discuss these questions and more.

The live chat is not video or audio-enabled but will take place in the comments section (below). Want to recommend someone for the panel or ask a question in advance? Get in touch via globaldevpros@theguardian.com or @GuardianGDP on Twitter. Follow the discussion using the hashtag #globaldevlive.

Leaked TTIP energy proposal could 'sabotage' EU climate policy
The latest draft version of the TTIP agreement could sabotage European efforts to save energy and switch to clean power, according to MEPs.

A 14th round of the troubled negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) free trade deal between the EU and US is due to begin on Monday in Brussels.

A leak obtained by the Guardian shows that the EU will propose a rollback of mandatory energy savings measures, and major obstacles to any future pricing schemes designed to encourage the uptake of renewable energies.

Environmental protections against fossil fuel extraction, logging and mining in the developing world would also come under pressure from articles in the proposed energy chapter.

Paul de Clerck, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth Europe, said the leaked document: “is in complete contradiction with Europe’s commitments to tackle climate change. It will flood the EU market with inefficient appliances, and consumers and the climate will foot the bill. The proposal will also discourage measures to promote renewable electricity production from wind and solar.”

The European commission says that the free trade deal is intended to: “promote renewable energy and energy efficiency – areas that are crucial in terms of sustainability”.

The bloc has also promised that any agreement would support its climate targets. In the period to 2020, these are binding for clean power and partly binding for energy efficiency, in the home appliance and building standards sectors.

But the draft chapter obliges the two trade blocs to: “foster industry self-regulation of energy efficiency requirements for goods where such self-regulation is likely to deliver the policy objectives faster or in a less costly manner than mandatory requirements”.

Campaigners fear that this could tip the balance in future policy debates and setback efforts to tackle climate change.

Jack Hunter, a spokesman for the European Environmental Bureau said: “Legally-binding energy standards have done wonders to lower energy bills for homes and offices, so much so that energy use has dropped even as the British economy has grown and appliances have become more power-hungry.

“Voluntary agreements have a place, but are generally ‘business as usual’ and no substitute for the real thing. If they became the norm, it would seriously harm our fight against climate change.”

Another passage in the draft text mandates that operators of energy networks grant access to gas and electricity “on commercial terms that are reasonable, transparent and non-discriminatory, including as between types of energy”.

This could create an avenue for preventing the imposition of feed-in tariffs and other support schemes to encourage the uptake of clean energy, according to lawmakers in Brussels.

The Green MEP Claude Turmes said: “These proposals are completely unacceptable. They would sabotage EU legislators’ ability to privilege renewables and energy efficiency over unsustainable fossil fuels. This is an attempt to undermine democracy in Europe.”

The environmental law consultancy, ClientEarth, was concerned that the new proposal effectively derogated responsibility for urgent climate change actions agreed at COP21 to the business sector.

“Industry is not the right entity to lead the fight against climate change,” said ClientEarth’s lawyer, Laurens Ankersmit. “It is madness for the EU and the US to rely on it in this way.”

The energy chapter negotiations began as part of an EU push for unlimited access to exports of the US’s relatively cheap liquefied natural gas, much of it derived from shale.

The EU is committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050, as measured against 1990 levels – and pledged a 40% CO2 cut by 2030 at the Paris climate conference, last December.

But the new text says that: “the Parties must agree on a legally binding commitment to eliminate all existing restrictions on the export of natural gas in trade between them as of the date of entry into force of the Agreement”.

Other countries wanting to trade with the EU or US would also find themselves up against requirements that they remove trade barriers.

The draft says: “The Parties shall cooperate to reduce or eliminate trade and investment distorting measures in third countries affecting energy and raw materials.”

In 2013, the EU’s trade commissioner Karel de Gucht promised the multinational oil giant Exxon that the energy chapter would remove obstacles to its expansion plans in Africa and South America."

The Paris agreement on climate change enters into force on Friday, marking the first time that governments have agreed legally binding limits to global temperature rises.

The passage of the accord – the fruit of more than two decades of often tortuous international negotiations on combating climate change – was hailed by nations and observers around the world.

Under the agreement, all governments that have ratified the accord, which includes the US, China, India and the EU, now carry an obligation to hold global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. That is what scientists regard as the limit of safety, beyond which climate change is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.


Countries have put forward commitments on curbing carbon emissions under the agreement, but a report on Thursday found those pledges would see temperature rises significantly overshoot the threshold, with 3C of warming. Environmental groups urged governments to do more.

Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: “The voices of the people who will be hit hardest by the devastating impacts of climate change need to be heard. Governments must work to plan practical steps for the agreement’s implementation, and set out how climate finance can actually reach people in the poorest, most vulnerable countries.”

Harjeet Singh, global lead on climate change for the charity ActionAid, added: “The Paris agreement sends a much-needed signal to politicians and industry that we have to build a new world, and this has to start now. However, the deal is not enough to keep people and the planet safe.”

Asad Rehman, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “The Paris agreement is a major step in the right direction, but it falls a long way short of the giant leap needed to tackle climate change. Far tougher action is needed to rapidly slash emissions.” Greenpeace said that while the deal needed strengthening, it was a “momentous occasion” that it had come into force.

Next week, governments will meet in Morocco under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss how to put the Paris accord into force, and meet its aims.

Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate chief, and Salaheddine Mezouar, foreign minister of Morocco, said in a joint statement: “Humanity will look back on 4 November 2016 as the day that countries of the world shut the door on inevitable climate disaster and set off with determination towards a sustainable future.

“The Paris agreement is undoubtedly a turning point in the history of common human endeavour, capturing the combined political, economic and social will of governments, cities, regions and businesses and investors to overcome the existential threat of unchecked climate change.”

Lord Turner, former head of the UK government’s statutory advisory committee on climate change, said: “The fact that this crucial UN agreement is coming into force within a year of signing is a hugely important achievement, and the good news is that agreement to the Paris deal is being matched by real progress in many countries.”

However, fossil fuel industries see continued opportunities for development within a low-carbon world.

Benjamin Sporton, chief executive of the World Coal Association, said: “For many countries, coal will continue to play a significant role in economic development, industrialisation and urbanisation. For the Paris agreement to be realised, we need to support those countries [that are committed to lower emission coal technology, such as high-efficiency plants]. We cannot wish coal away.”"

This election year, we can't lose sight of the perils of climate change
Every election year, candidates for office engage in a perverse form of theater. Some flatter voters or try to scare them, others offer promises of a better future. Unfortunately few candidates feel an obligation to follow through on campaign promises or to grapple with serious problems confronting our country and planet.

Take Barack Obama. He has done far less on climate than his supporters might have expected. Despite claiming COP21 as a victory, Obama’s legacy will tell the story of the US surpassing all other nations in oil and gas production. Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, has called the US “a global warming machine,” adding: “At the moment when physics tell us we should be jamming on the carbon brakes, America is revving the engine”.

Today, that lack of leadership on climate change continues. Candidates running for Congress and the presidency aren’t offering real solutions, despite growing scientific alarm.

Small wonder that The Guardian’s readers, when surveyed, resoundingly proclaimed that climate change is one of the most pressing issues that are consistently neglected by our presidential candidates. The fact that many Americans feel this way speaks volumes about the fundamental rift between elected officials and their constituencies.

Related: Voices of America: why we wanted to hear from you – and still do

How many casualties, destroyed communities, flooded coastlands, diminished snow packs feeding key Asian rivers, drought-ridden agricultural belts and new disease vectors, will it take to move a more organized American public to demand a transformation of US energy policy? People care about this issue, so why don’t our elected officials seem to reflect that concern?

Special interest lobbying has a lot to answer for. Tiffany Germain, in an article for ThinkProgress.org, notes : “170 elected representatives in the 114th Congress have taken over $63.8m from the fossil fuel industry that’s driving the carbon emissions which cause climate change.” Many of those representatives deny climate change is man-made.

John Passacantando, former Executive Director of Greenpeace in the US, once reportedly told big oil and gas executives: “You’re going to wish you were the tobacco companies once this stuff hits and people realize you were the ones who blocked [action]”. His warning may eventually be proven correct if it turns out their industry lobby is to blame.

But that day might be far off. That’s why, in this election year, we cannot afford to let candidates for federal, state and local office lose sight of the perils of climate change.

There are many policies our presidential candidates could get behind now. We could outlaw the creation of new fossil-fueled electric power plants, provide federal loans for the construction of renewable energy power plants or enforce green requirements on new homes and buildings – just to list some ideas floated by S. David Freeman, an energy expert, in a recent book.

All of these are reasonable, possible and necessary steps that our elected officials could be implementing right now , were it not for the corruption that has prevailed in our politics over the last several decades.

This election, voters need to push candidates to support measures that will address the problems associated with climate change – and reporters need to cover this momentous story rigorously. It is time for citizens to organize town meetings and rallies on climate change. It is time for action."

China's plan to cut meat consumption by 50% cheered by climate campaigners
The Chinese government has outlined a plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50%, in a move that climate campaigners hope will provide major heft in the effort to avoid runaway global warming.

New dietary guidelines drawn up by China’s health ministry recommend that the nation’s 1.3 billion population should consume between 40g to 75g of meat per person each day. The measures, released once every 10 years, are designed to improve public health but could also provide a significant cut to greenhouse gas emissions.

The Chinese Communist party has found unusual allies among Hollywood celebrities, with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and director James Cameron involved in a series of new public information adverts encouraging Chinese people to consume less animal flesh to help the environment.

Should the new guidelines be followed, carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from China’s livestock industry would be reduced by 1bn tonnes by 2030, from a projected 1.8bn tonnes in that year.

Globally, 14.5% of planet-warming emissions emanate from the keeping and eating of cows, chickens, pigs and other animals – more than the emissions from the entire transport sector. Livestock emit methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, while land clearing and fertilizers release large quantities of carbon.

“Through this kind of lifestyle change, it is expected that the livestock industry will transform and carbon emissions will be reduced,” said Li Junfeng, director general of China’s National Center on Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation.

“Tackling climate change involves scientific judgement, political decisions, entrepreneurial support, but at last, it still relies on involvement of the general public to change the consumption behavior in China. Every single one of us has to believe in the low-carbon concept and slowly adapt to it.”

Related: More wealth, more meat. How China's rise spells trouble

Meat has gone from rare treat to a regular staple for many Chinese people. In 1982, the average Chinese person ate just 13kg of meat a year and beef was nicknamed “millionaire’s meat” due to its scarcity.

The emergence of China as a global economic power has radically altered the diets of a newly wealthy population. The average Chinese person now eats 63kg of meat a year, with a further 30kg of meat per person expected to be added by 2030 if nothing is done to disrupt this trend. The new guidelines would reduce this to 14kg to 27kg a year.

China now consumes 28% of the world’s meat, including half of its pork. However, China still lags behind more than a dozen other countries in per capita meat consumption, with the average American or Australian consuming twice as much meat per person compared to China.

According to a new report by WildAid, the predicted increase in China’s meat consumption would add an extra 233m tonnes of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere each year, as well as put increased strain on the country’s water supply, which is already blighted by polluted and denuded rivers and groundwater.

The report warns that unchecked Chinese meat consumption will also degrade its arable land and worsen the country’s problems with obesity and diabetes. An estimated 100 million Chinese people have diabetes, more than any other country.

Research released by the thinktank Chatham House in 2014 forecast that China alone is expected to eat 20m tonnes more of meat and dairy a year by 2020 and warned that “dietary change is essential” if global warming is to not exceed the 2C limit eventually imposed at the climate accord in Paris last year.

A separate report by scientists at the Oxford Martin School this year found that the widespread adoption of vegetarianism around the world could bring down greenhouse gas emissions by nearly two-thirds.

“China’s move to cut meat consumption in half would not only have a huge impact on public health, it is a massive leadership step towards drastically reducing carbon emissions and reaching the goals set out in the Paris agreement,” said James Cameron.

“Animal agriculture emits more than all transportation combined. Reducing demand for animal-based foods is essential if we are to limit global warming to 2C as agreed at COP21.”

Despite the Chinese government’s new commitment to reducing meat consumption, it may be difficult to convince the country’s rising middle classes to cut down. There are also strong cultural traditions attached to the eating of many animals, especially pigs. The Chinese character for “home” depicts a pig underneath the roof of a house.

Recently, Chinese companies have been buying farms in the United States and Australia to provide feed for the country’s dairy and beef industries.

In late 2013 a Chinese company, Shenghui, purchased the largest US pork producer, Smithfield Foods, to help keep up with demand.

“China’s consumption of meat is skyrocketing,” said Jeremy Haft, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University in Washington, DC and author of a 2015 book, “Unmade in China: The Hidden Truth about China’s Economic Miracle.”

“China’s demand for meat will continue to grow and support hundreds of thousands of jobs in the US meat industry,” he added. “From a climate perspective, the methane will still be created, but will be shifted to the United States.”"

Ikea vows to be net exporter of renewable energy by 2020
As December’s landmark climate change summit in Paris (COP21) approached, Ikea made a number of major announcements. It pledged to invest €600m (£471m) in renewable energy projects – in addition to an earlier €1.5bn (£1.2bn) cash injection – and a further €400m (£314m) to support communities vulnerable to climate change.

The world’s biggest furniture retailer says it’s going “all in” to have a net positive impact on the climate through renewable energy investment, energy-efficiency measures, cutting supply chain emissions, and product changes designed to achieve behaviour change. It has already helped its suppliers become 18% more energy efficient over the past four years – through the introduction of a sustainability assessment tool and by bringing suppliers together to share sustainability best practice.

Related: Can you power a business on 100% renewable energy? Ikea wants to try

At COP21, the firm lobbied for stronger action, largely through We Mean Business, a coalition of global companies and investors who are committed to the green agenda. It also co-founded RE100, a campaign that now has more than 50 of the world’s biggest companies committed to the transition to 100% renewable electricity.

Ikea plans to be a net exporter of renewable energy within four years. The retailer currently produces 53% of its energy from renewable sources: it operates 314 wind turbines and has installed 700,000 solar panels on its stores and distribution centres. In some countries – such as Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Poland – the retailer already produces energy equivalent to what it uses in its operations. In Canada, its wind farm produces more than double its consumption.

Supporting consumers to make environmental choices is another core part of Ikea’s strategy. The firm switched its entire lighting range to LED in September and estimates that by 2020 the change will have saved electricity equivalent to the annual needs of every household in London and Paris.

Australia will ratify second stage of Kyoto protocol, Malcolm Turnbull pledges
Malcolm Turnbull has pledged Australia will ratify the second stage of the Kyoto protocol – a move that underlines Australia’s change in attitude towards international climate talks but is unlikely to make any practical difference to reductions in emissions.

Experts said formal ratification of Kyoto 2 – which includes Australia’s minimum target to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020 that the government says it is already on track to meet – would have a limited real world impact.

But officials and long-term observers of the talks said the announcement sent a positive signal at the start of two weeks of talks in Paris that aim to clinch the next international climate deal, for reductions out to 2030. It was met with some applause from the conference floor.

In a day of promises designed, in the words of the French president, François Hollande, to give the conference “a drive and ambition commensurate to the challenge” Turnbull also joined at the last minute a US initiative to double public and private research and development spending on clean energy technology, which in Australia’s case means an additional $100m in government spending over five years.

And he announced that $1bn from Australia’s existing aid budget would be directed towards projects that reduce emissions or help countries adapt, including the $200m already committed by the Abbott government to the Green Climate Fund.

The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said ratifying Kyoto 2 sent a “very, very powerful symbol to the world” and also helped Australia meet its minimum 5% target by “carrying over” the amount by which it exceeded a very lenient target under the first Kyoto agreement.

Turnbull, speaking to the media after a sidelines meeting with Bill Gates, said he came to Paris “in a spirit of realistic optimism” and believed the meeting would result in a successful deal.

But he also said the government had no plans to increase its minimum 2020 target, even though it has inscribed tougher targets into the UN agreement under specific conditions that the independent Climate Change Authority says have been met.

Related: COP21: world leaders at Paris climate talks – in pictures

Turnbull was also equivocal about whether he would have to increase the longer term Abbott government target for the agreement being negotiated in Paris – to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% compared with 2005 levels by 2030, saying that would depend on the ambition of the global community.

Labor leader Bill Shorten, who is also in Paris, accused the government of coming with a message of hope but Tony Abbott’s old policies.

“Ratifying Kyoto 2 is fine as far as it goes... but it’s not exactly setting the world on fire,” he said. Labor has promised to consider a reduction of 45% by 2030, based on 2005 levels.

He accused the government of “playing accounting games” by using existing aid funding for its $1bn climate financing promise.

Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, said Australia’s promise to ratify Kyoto 2 was “largely incidental to this meeting, which is all about the next step after 2020”.

But the veteran observer of international climate talks said it would underline what negotiators had already noticed – “a quite noticeable change in attitude and demeanour from Australia” in international climate talks.

Erwin Jackson, the deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the promise could have some tangible effects, including making it easier for Australian businesses to access international climate markets if Australia tightens the requirements of its Direct Action policy, and opening Australia to world pressure to move to the higher Kyoto 2 targets it had promised if other countries also acted – up to a 25% cut in emissions.

In his allotted speaking slot Turnbull delivered an international version of his domestic message of optimism and faith in innovation and technological advances.

“From Australia we come with confidence and optimism,” he said, adding that Australia was confident the conference would “secure our future” because of our “great optimism and faith in humanity’s genius for invention”.

World leaders brought both specific promises and persuasive rhetoric to the day of speed-speeches in two simultaneous sessions – with leaders’ attendance scheduled at the start of the conference to “turbocharge” talks, rather than at the end, as it was in the disastrous Copenhagen meeting in 2009.

The recent Paris terrorist attacks were used by many as a rallying point – with the US president, Barack Obama, saying the meeting was an “act of defiance” and the attendance of so many leaders a “rejection of those who would tear down our world”.

Obama cited his new research and development initiative – “Mission Innovation” –and foreshadowed a new spending promise for least developed nations including low-lying Pacific Islands.

He told the meeting it could be the “turning point” in the world’s response to a threat that “could define the contours of this century more than any other”."

CSIRO climate cuts will breach Paris agreement and cost economy – report
Cuts to the CSIRO’s climate modelling and measuring research will breach Australia’s obligations under the recent Paris agreement and will result in huge costs to the economy, a report by Australia’s Climate Council has found.

The report adds to a chorus of eminent bodies and individuals criticising the move, which the CSIRO made after almost no consultation with its own scientists or other research institutions.

Related: CSIRO chief says row over climate science cuts 'more like religion than science'

Earlier in the month it was revealed CSIRO would be cutting up to 350 staff from climate research programs over two years. Over the following weeks, the organisation’s chief executive Larry Marshall explained that would result in a loss of about 50% of the staff working in climate modelling and measuring.

In a report titled “Flying Blind: Navigating Climate Change without the CSIRO,” the Climate Council said governments and businesses relied on the CSIRO’s climate modelling and measuring work to make billion-dollar decisions and if the cuts went ahead, would be relying on “guesswork”.

The report notes Australia and the rest of the world agreed to strengthen commitments to climate science at COP21 in Paris in December. “The recently announced cuts to climate science mean that Australia has already reneged on one of its obligations under the Paris commitments,” it concludes.

It cites a number of examples of decisions and industries that have relied on the modelling and measuring performed by the CSIRO:

Brisbane Airport’s third runway is currently being built, at a cost of $1.3bn. It is expected to eventually generate $5bn for the economy each year. But since it is located on a low-lying flood-prone area, a comprehensive climate-change risk assessment was carried out, which relied on work by the CSIRO. As a result of that assessment, the runway was built 4.1m above current sea level, to account for sea level rise and increasing storm surges. CSIRO’s research has been used to issue weather warnings and to train fire-fighters to predicting fire behaviour. CSIRO’s research has assisted farmers with technologies and tools to manage drought.

“If there’s one take-home message from the report it’s that you can’t just say ‘all right we know this, let’s cut the research and go onto something else’,” Will Steffen, a climate councillor and professor at the Australian National University told Guardian Australia. “For a problem that’s as big and complex and ongoing as climate change, that’s just crazy and makes no scientific sense at all.”

An open letter signed by more than 2800 scientists raised similar concerns. In response to the chorus of criticisms, Marshall initially said the response was more like religion than science, and compared climate scientists to oil lobbyists in the 1970s. Then chairman of the CSIRO board David Thodey released a written response, where he repeated that organisation would work to ensure these important capabilities would not be lost from Australia.

Paul Durack from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the US, who oraganised the open letter, told Guardian Australia the response was an “unfortunate dismissal of some legitimate concerns raised by the international climate community.”

“The details contained in the letter have echoed the previous announcements and have provided no further details about how they plan to ensure that some of the key aspects that are ‘committed’ to be kept will continue beyond the next round of CSIRO cutbacks in the coming years,” Durack said.

It was revealed in Senate estimates that CSIRO executives did not consult with organisations like the Bureau of Meteorology who depend on CSIRO modelling until 24 hours before the cuts were made public.

Even Ken Lee, the director of the division that would take the brunt of the cuts was only told about the cuts four days before they were announced.

The Climate Council, which produced the new report, is a crowd-funded body that seeks to provide authoritative information on climate change to the community. It was created after the Abbott government cut the Climate Commission when it took government in 2013, and seeks to perform the same job."

Climate change protests across Australia – tens of thousands march
Climate change rallies rolled on across Australia on Sunday, following well attended protests in Melbourne on Friday and Darwin and Brisbane on Saturday.

Related Global climate march 2015 tens of thousands march in Australia and Asia – live #climatemarch

On Sunday, it was the turn of Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart and Perth.

Australia’s climate-sensitive neighbours in the Pacific were a key focus for the climate change rally in Sydney, with representatives of communities from Pacific nations – including Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga – prominent at the front of the march from the Domain to Circular Quay.

Dressed in red, they carried signs that read “2C too late”, “We can’t walk on water”, and “Raise your voice, not sea levels”.

Previously, Pacific leaders such as Kiribati’s Anote Tong, and PNG’s Peter O’Neill have implored Australia to be the voice of the Pacific at climate change talks in Paris beginning Monday.

More than 40,000 people braved Sydney’s heat for the rally Sunday afternoon, calling on Australia to play a lead role in brokering binding emissions targets for the world to keep global temperature rise below 2C, and to commit to greater domestic emissions cuts than the 26% to 28% the government is currently proposing.

Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, the mood of the march was rumbustious, even festive. A salsa band played Arrow’s “Hot, Hot, Hot” all the way down Macquarie Street.

Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, told the march the COP21 meeting beginning in Paris on Monday would be “the most important meeting of our life time”.

“On it depends the future of our planet,” she said.

The prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced Australia would contribute $1m towards the establishment of a Commonwealth climate finance access hub, to help small island states access funds for climate mitigation and adaptation.

“These countries have asked for assistance in accessing the climate finance they need to effectively deal with climate change,” he said in a statement.

The deputy opposition leader and shadow foreign affairs minister, Tanya Plibersek, spoke to reporters before the Sydney rally and said Australia’s contribution to the fund was “pathetically puny” and failed to comprehend the scale or imminence of the Pacific’s climate problem.

“Climate change is not a distant future threat for our Pacific neighbours, it is happening right now. You are seeing storm surges washing away coastlines, you are seeing saltwater creeping into fresh water sources, you are seeing drought preventing crops growing properly, making it harder for communities to feed themselves.”

Unlike Sydney’s spirited march, it was a very peaceful, family-oriented affair in Canberra, as people brought their children to march with them from Parliament House to the tent embassy, near Old Parliament House.

Police estimate about 3,000 people showed up, while protesters think the number was closer to 6,000. Canberrans are fairly cautious about protesting, as many are public servants and are often reluctant to make political statements.

One of the coordinators of the event, Emma Robinson from the Conservation Council, said she was not surprised that so many showed up in the capital.

“Climate change is and has always been everyone’s business,” she said.

Related Thousands march over climate change in Brisbane and across New Zealand

The event was staffed by about 80 volunteers, most of whom were Canberra locals and part of the Conservation Council.

Former chief scientist of Australia, Penny Sackett, said that protests like Sunday’s made people feel as though they were taking action on climate change.

“People can become discouraged because it appears as though [political] change does not happen swiftly enough,” she told Guardian Australia.

She said the march was a message from voters to world leaders who are about to meet on climate change in Paris. “We’re watching.”

The Perth event started sombrely. At 3.25pm, at least 5,000 people sat in silence in Hay Street Mall to mark people who have lost their lives, homes and livelihoods to the effects of climate change. The group, in their colour blocks, had marched 2km from Wellington Square and stretched the whole 300-metre length, watched by bemused Christmas shoppers clutching plastic bags and taking photos of the crowd.

The march was led by a group from the Noongar Whadjuk nation and addressed by Christian, Islamic, Jewish, and Hindu faith leaders.

The aim, Perth assistant bishop Tom Wilmot said, was to show unity and tell political leaders that the will of the people was for change. “We can have prosperity without growth,” Wilmot said.

Related Are Australia’s bushfire seasons getting longer

Kevin Jolley, president of the firefighters union of WA, who addressed the crowd in his heavy fire gear, said WA had already seen the devastating impact of climate change in its worsening bushfire seasons.

Six people died in bushfires in November, four in fires near Esperance, WA, and two in fires in South Australia.

It’s the deadliest Australian bushfire season since 2009, when 173 people died in the Black Saturday bushfires, and, Jolly said, it was only the start of the southern fire season.

Oil firms have 10 years to change strategy or face 'short, brutish end'
International oil companies such as Shell and BP must completely change their business model or face a “nasty, brutish and short” end within 10 years, one of Britain’s most influential energy experts has warned.

Paul Stephens, a fellow at Chatham House thinktank, said in a research paper the oil “majors” were no longer fit for purpose – hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and their own wrongheaded strategies.

In the report, Stephens argues the only way forward for the companies lies in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers.

“The prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed … their old business model is dying,” said Stephens, a visiting professor at University College London.

“In this new world, the only realistic option … lies in restructuring and realising (selling) many of their current assets to provide cash for their shareholders.”

The death of these key fossil fuel providers would be an astonishing reversal in fortunes for powerful companies that have previously been accused of being climate change deniers and tools – if not makers – of foreign policy.

The companies, increasingly facing calls from many of their shareholders to take more account of the environment, have also been stalwarts of the London stock market and important providers of dividends for British pension funds.

Stephens believes the companies have spent too much time trying to maximise shareholder value by finding and proving more reserves while outsourcing key operations.

The collapse in crude to $45 per barrel has exacerbated problems for the industry, but the Chatham House expert says a major price recovery cannot be guaranteed. He says companies have 10 years to change strategy or die.

“This means inevitably, however, that they must shrink into the remaining areas, functionally and geographically, where they can earn an acceptable return.

“This requires a major change in the corporate culture of the IOCs. It remains to be seen whether their senior management can manage such a fundamental shift. If they can, then the IOCs will be able to slip into a gentle decline but ultimately survive, albeit on a much smaller scale. If they do not change their business model, what remains of their existence will be nasty, brutish and short.”

The call for a shakeup comes less than 24 hours after another thinktank, the Carbon Tracker Initiative, also called on oil companies to slim down and base their business models around global warming targets.

The big oil companies, including US firms such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have been warned that they are presiding over “stranded assets” of carbon that can never be burned if the world is determined to keep average temperatures from rising no more than 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels.

But the future of international climate change strategies, and therefore carbon emissions, will depend to a great extent on whether countries implement the necessary policies agreed at the UN talks in Paris last December.

A range of issues could influence this, not least whether America elects a president this year who is as committed to the low-carbon agenda as Barack Obama. Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, may not be.

Stephens said he had assumed the Paris agreement – known as COP21 – would be implemented, allowing the world to move slowly but surely into a new lower-carbon phase.

There are isolated signs of companies taking action to change their business model, with Shell merging with its rival BG and pulling back from high-cost and environmentally challenging drilling in the Alaskan Arctic.

The Chatham House expert notes that the influence of the international oil companies has waned since the 25 years following the second world war, when they controlled virtually all crude production outside of the US and communist states.

They also owned “70% of all refining capacity, every important pipeline and about two-thirds of the privately owned tanker fleet. In this period, international crude oil trade moved entirely within their integrated operations or through long-term contracts between them.”

This article was amended on 9 May 2016. Because of an editing error, an earlier version converted a rise of 2C to 35.6F; that is the fahrenheit equivalent of the actual temperature of 2C."

The White House's COP 21 goals: less climate idealism, more political realism
The United States’ refusal to make internationally binding its ambitious pollution targets at the Cop21 climate talks in Paris isn’t a sign of Barack Obama’s lack of political will, but a reflection of the legal limits of his authorities and the political realities of what other nations will commit to doing.

Obama has proposed a legally binding agreement applicable to all nations without binding emissions targets. That approach isn’t ideal, but it’s politically and legally achievable – and a massive step forward for climate action.

Related: Don't let the Paris climate talks ignore people displaced by global warming | Roberto Lovato

Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has led the effort to discredit Obama’s efforts in Paris, backed by a powerful apparatus of fossil fuel funded climate skepticism and state-level Republican opposition to the landmark Clean Power Plan, which would reduce US dependence on dirty coal. McConnell and others have made clear that no new international climate agreement would ever be approved by the Senate.

That credible threat is keeping US climate negotiators from making the pollution targets in the Paris agreement internationally binding. But it’s not putting the breaks on the idea of a legally binding agreement.

US law allows its president to approve some international agreements without the Senate. These are called “executive agreements” and they are exceptionally common: the United States enters into about 94% of its international agreements this way. The Yalta Agreement in 1945 that helped define the post-second world war order and the Paris Peace Accords in 1973 that ended the war in Vietnam are examples of this.

American courts have repeatedly held that executive agreements and treaties – which, under US law, but not elsewhere in the world, are defined as international agreements that must be approved by two-thirds of the Senate – are both valid ways of securing US participation. Both types of international agreement can create binding international obligations for the United States that as a matter of international law are equally durable and reliable for America’s allies. But only one of these agreements wouldn’t die in Congress.

The decision to move ahead without Congressional approval does have certain implications. Presidents generally only have authority to approve executive agreements without Congress when those agreements can be fully implemented under existing law. Current US law does not explicitly authorize the president to manage the US economy to achieve a national economy-wide climate target. But it does allow the president to bind the nation to international diplomatic processes.

That means US negotiators can push in Paris for an agreement that would obligate every nation to have internationally binding obligations to develop climate action plans, report transparently on progress and revise those plans regularly, all without needing new action by Congress.

Related: Climate change will continue to hurt America if we do nothing | Raúl M Grijalva

Obama has relied on executive authorities to push through climate regulations domestically much the same way. In its second term, the Obama administration has used existing domestic laws to launch a new climate initiative about every five days, according to the White House. This patchwork approach is working – with the United States on track to meet the 2020 climate goals.

In addition to these domestic legal constraints, the political reality is that the American people and Congress – Republicans and Democrats alike – would not support an agreement that was legally binding on the United States in ways that were not also binding on China and India. The president knows that there is likely no way that India, in particular, would accept having its pollution pledges binding under international law. As a consequence, the United States remains politically unwilling to consider making US pledges binding.

What matters most is that countries back their targets with the force of law domestically. Whereas the international community has no international climate police, the United States government can and does impose fines and even criminal penalties on polluters that disobey domestic environmental laws. If other countries take the same approach then Paris can succeed despite its imperfections."

Climate change and the continual demand for economic growth
The agreement reached at the COP21 Paris climate change talks is certainly a great improvement on anything that has gone before ( One paragraph at a time: how the deal was done to save the planet, 14 December). Whether it is enough to save the planet (to be more precise, save the human race from catastrophe; the planet will look after itself) is questionable. Apart from the question of actual implementation of even the agreed measures (themselves expected to achieve only a 2.7C limit) there are many factors not taken into account. Barack Obama says the deal will create “ more jobs and economic growth ”. But growth, even “green growth”, is precisely the problem. We live on a finite planet with finite resources which we are already exploiting to the limit and beyond. The aim must be to achieve a steady-state economy, with resources fairly shared, but that is incompatible with capitalism’s growth imperative.

A glaring omission is the effect of the many armed conflicts currently ongoing, The money allocated to tackling climate change is still dwarfed by that devoted to the means of death and destruction, currently $1.75tn annually. These conflicts themselves contribute to climate change: the US military is the biggest single corporate user of fossil fuels, a large proportion by high-flying jets, where the warming effect is variously estimated as from 1.7 to 4.0 times that at ground level. They inhibit attempts to deal with people’s real problems, the effects of global warming among many others. Mass migration, from a variety of causes including conflict and climate change, is another major problem that is ignored in the Paris agreement. There is still a very long way to go to ensure the future of the human race.

Frank Jackson

Former co-chair, World Disarmament Campaign

• The Paris accord has been hailed as a diplomatic triumph because the alternative is too awful to contemplate. Nevertheless the atmosphere does not respond to political craft and strategic compromise, it only responds to the laws of physics which are uncompromising and potentially lethal for most species on Earth, including our own.

All of the really tough decisions – such as carbon taxes, country-specific limits and financial penalties – have been shelved, which will allow countries such as India, China and even the UK to carry on burning fossil fuels while paying lip-service to the need to reduce emissions. Instead the goal of 1.5C and even 2C will now rely on unproven and currently non-existent technologies such as nuclear fusion, carbon capture with storage or carbon negative technologies. I pray these will come in time but how many people would get on a flight in the hope that someone can defuse the bomb before it blows up?

Dr Robin Russell-Jones

Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire

• While the agreement on tackling climate change is welcome, the big test, and the most challenging, will be the implementation. There are substantial business opportunities here, with countries supporting research and development into alternative energy and energy saving being the winners.

In order to develop this commercial opportunity and contribute to global emission reduction the UK government needs to reverse some of the decisions taken since it came to power. These include: divesting from renewables: privatising the Green Investment Bank; performing a monumental U-turn on the UK’s £1bn carbon capture and storage (CCS) competition; reducing subsidies for improving energy efficiency; reducing the requirement for developers to build energy-efficient homes; making fracking easy to achieve and windfarms difficult; and continuing to subsidise fossil fuels.

The UK could be taking a lead, and developing a substantial commercial advantage, instead of backtracking on everything the coalition achieved.

• The Paris climate talks followed a pattern that is familiar in international environmental negotiations. At the start of the conference tough commitments and ambitious targets were proposed, including on forest conservation and the transfer of environmentally clean technology to developing countries. Over the next two weeks many of these were weakened with caveats and, in some cases, quietly abandoned as delegates edged towards a politically acceptable compromise. This is the so-called convoy principle: everyone stays together, but all move at the speed of the slowest. Most disappointing of all is the failure to agree legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments. Without this, the pledge to limit the global temperature rise to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels remains purely aspirational.

• The key phrase in Bill McKibben’s piece ( Climate deal: the pistol has fired, so why aren’t we running?, 14 December) is “You have to raise the price of carbon steeply and quickly”, or else the necessary switch to renewable energy will not happen.

In other words, people have to vote for much higher petrol prices, much higher gas and electricity bills and far more expensive air travel. Or, which would be equally unpopular, we could ration these goods. Clearly, neither of these things are going to happen, so can we please stop fooling ourselves that the human race is capable of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by enough to prevent runaway climate change.

Therefore, we need to urgently start investing in other approaches, such as geoengineering, carbon scrubbing and reforestation. Otherwise, we do face disaster.

• Mitchell Anderson argues that cheap oil is the key to beating climate change ( Opinion, theguardian.com, 11 December), but his logic is flawed. In a free market the cheaper fossil fuels are burned first, then more expensive ones. This process does not end until the rising fossil-fuel price crosses the falling renewables price. The total amount of CO 2 (and methane) cumulatively emitted depends on this crossover point; a lower oil price pushes it further into the future, increasing total emissions. The most efficient way to bring forward the crossover, at the same time creating robust, distributed economic value, is a revenue-neutral carbon tax.

• We congratulate the leaders of our world on agreeing to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2C or, hopefully, 1.5C – a clear signal to transform our global economy to decrease emissions. We in the agricultural/scientific sectors have a key role in meeting this transformation by finding sustainable solutions to feeding the ever growing population, particularly in the dry tropics of Asia and Africa. For example, new drought-tolerant varieties of chickpea planted by Ethiopian farmers will lift 0.7 million people out of poverty and have a positive environmental impact.

In addition to climate change, these two continents are already facing the additional, but associated, problems of gender inequality, poverty, political instability etc. We need to redouble our efforts to leverage demand-driven innovation, partnerships and policies that ensure the poor can adapt to climate variability. The hard work starts now.

• Last week it was announced in the journal Nature Climate Change that world carbon emissions fell by 0.6%. This fall was attributed to the decline in Chinese manufacturing.

The world’s politicians pontificate about how to tackle the causes and remedy this problem which is blamed on the industrialised nations.

But surely the answer is obvious: let’s buy fewer Chinese goods. Apart from continuing this downward trend in emission reductions it would make China a much healthier place to live and it would also boost our manufacturing, jobs and economy immeasurably. Simple.

These goods may cost a bit more, but compared with the 10% extra we have added to our fuel bills and are forced to pay to meet EU emission targets plus the reduction in benefit payments as our unemployed obtain jobs, this could be a win-win policy.

However, there is a problem called the EU, which would do everything in its power to prevent this.

The clean energy economy is coming – and there's a lot to lose for those who can't keep up
Change is coming to the energy landscape. A transition to a new energy economy is happening. In a country like Australia – awash with energy both under and above the ground – this transition could be rapid and profound. There is a lot to lose for those who can’t keep pace.

Last month the government committed $1bn to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. The fund will have “the primary purpose of earning income or a profitable return” on debt and equity extended to renewable energy, energy efficiency and low-emissions technologies. While many will argue the right way for that money to be used, investment like this is well timed.

There are a number of converging technologies driving the transition. Their interaction will affect how we travel, how we live, the way our cities and houses are designed, our fuel supply and attitude to energy efficiency, and even how we interact.

One of the maturing technologies is solar. Over the past five years, solar has become a big part of our energy world. The Australian energy market operator estimated last year that by 2023/24 the state of South Australia may, at times, have its entire electricity needs met by solar systems on mostly urban rooftops, without the aid of coal, gas or oil.

Together with other renewables, photovoltaics are becoming increasingly competitive. Factoring in the cost of delivering energy through the grid, photovoltaic technology is probably the cheapest electricity supply option at the point of use right now. And it will continue to get cheaper.

Another is energy storage. Improvements in battery technology and cost will help overcome the intermittency of renewable energy. Tesla’s push into the consumer mass market is just the beginning of a decade in which electric cars will become significantly more common and at the heart of each electric vehicle is a battery that can store enough electricity to serve the average Australian home for days. Our cars will act as mobile batteries that “plug in” to the home, allowing their energy to be used for household purposes. Batteries will also be installed in our homes, complementing our rooftop solar. Utilities will use them to optimise their grids.

This new energy landscape will be more complex, requiring interaction between energy providers and users like never before. Controlling this will be the energy “internet”, a vast array of interconnected devices that will produce, store or use energy. These devices will communicate their energy deficits and surpluses and transport energy to where it is needed most, as well as allowing consumers to remotely control their devices to optimise energy usage. This capability will allow a range of new energy technologies and business models to emerge. Consumers will have more say in what energy they use and how, and by digitally understanding those needs suppliers will be able to optimise their services to align.

Another technology reaching maturity is the “smart” energy grid. Despite the self-sufficiency potential of renewable energy, the grid will not become obsolete. Pole and wire infrastructure will allow users to upload and download energy to maximise cost effectiveness and reliability – like off-peak hot water is used now but much more complex. As energy utilisation is automised, unintentional consumption will fall.

Related: Solar technology: the US and China look to Australian innovators for solutions

As with any fundamental disruption, there will be winners and losers. Foreseeing and harnessing the potential of the convergence won’t be easy for incumbents or new entrants. Significant investment will be required to develop and commercialise businesses and technology capable of harnessing the possibilities of convergence. But the potential pay-off for businesses that get it right will be huge.

There will be other benefits as well. Until now, I have barely mentioned emissions. The energy transition is happening without reference to its environmental value.

And yet, there are environment-related drivers. The final, published agreement from COP21, the climate change-related Conference of Parties 21 held in Paris last December, aims for essentially zero net emissions by 2050, the world over. Why are governments the world over suddenly willing to agree to such ambitious targets? The scientific consensus to act on climate has strengthened, for one. But pragmatic governments may also be seeing signs of tangible, real solutions emerging in energy markets. The timetable outlined in Paris for emissions reductions appears to align well with the published convergence of technologies – very roughly in the next 10 or so years. This, of course, could just be a coincidence but, if so, it is well timed.

Decarbonisation of the global economy now has a route that is starting to make commercial sense. Coal, oil and gas will continue as primary energy supplies for some time and simply being more efficient with our energy use is the first way to reduce emissions. As technology converges, we won’t need to be convinced that we should consider the environment: we will be too busy focusing on the economic benefits.

In the final meeting of the Paris talks on climate change on Saturday night, the debating chamber was full and the atmosphere tense. Ministers from 196 countries sat behind their country nameplates, aides flocking them, with observers packed into the overflowing hall.


World leaders hail Paris climate deal as ‘major leap for mankind’

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, talked animatedly with his officials, while China’s foreign minister Xie Zhenhua wore a troubled look. They had been waiting in this hall for nearly two hours. The French hosts had trooped in to take their seats on the stage, ready to applaud on schedule at 5.30pm – but it was now after 7pm, and the platform was deserted.

After two weeks of fraught negotiations, was something going badly wrong?

Then at 7.16pm, the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, returned abruptly to the stage, flanked by high-ranking UN officials. The last-minute compromises had been resolved, he said. And suddenly they were all on their feet. Fabius brought down the green-topped gavel, a symbol of UN talks, and announced that a Paris agreement had been signed. The delegates were clapping, cheering and whistling wildly, embracing and weeping. Even the normally reserved economist Lord Stern was whooping.

Outside the hall, a “Mexican wave” of standing ovations rippled across the conference centre as news reached participants gathered around screens outside for the translation into their own language. The 50,000 people who attended the summit had been waiting for this moment, through marathon negotiating sessions and sleepless nights.

The contrast with the last global attempt to resolve climate change, at Copenhagen in 2009, which collapsed into chaos and recriminations, could not have been greater. In a city recently hit by terrorist attacks that left 130 dead and scores more critically injured, collective will had prevailed.

Paris produced an agreement hailed as “historic, durable and ambitious”. Developed and developing countries alike are required to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels, of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Countries affected by climate-related disasters will gain urgent aid.

Like any international compromise, it is not perfect: the caps on emissions are still too loose, likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the 2C threshold that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects – droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises – are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Poor countries are also concerned that the money provided to them will not be nearly enough to protect them. Not all of the agreement is legally binding, so future governments of the signatory countries could yet renege on their commitments.

The deal alone won’t dig us out of the hole that we’re in, but it makes the sides less steep.
Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International
These flaws may shadow the future of climate change action, but on Saturday night they took second place. As the news spread through the world, the reaction from civil society groups, governments and businesses, was overwhelmingly positive.

Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International, summed up the mood: “It sometimes seems that the countries of the UN can unite on nothing, but nearly 200 countries have come together and agreed a deal. Today, the human race has joined in a common cause. The Paris agreement is only one step on a long road and there are parts of it that frustrate, that disappoint me, but it is progress. The deal alone won’t dig us out of the hole that we’re in, but it makes the sides less steep.”



Even as delegates celebrated at the conference’s end, there was a palpable sense of relief from the exhausted French hosts. At many points in this fortnight of marathon negotiating sessions, it looked as if a deal might be beyond reach. That it ended in success was a tribute in part to their diligence and efficiency and the efforts of the UN.

“France has brought openness and experience in diplomacy, and mutual respect to these talks,” said Stern, one of the world’s leading climate economists. “They have taken great care to make everyone listened to, that they were consulted. There was a great sense of openness, of professional diplomacy, and skill.”

Saturday night was the culmination not only of a fortnight of talks, but of more than 23 years of international attempts under the UN to forge collective action on this global problem. Since 1992, all of the world’s governments had been pledging to take measures that would avoid dangerous warming. Those efforts were marked by discord and failure, the refusal of the biggest emitters to take part, ineffective agreements and ignored treaties.

For these reasons, the Paris talks were widely seen as make-or-break for the UN process. If they failed, collective global efforts would be at an end and the world would be left without a just and robust means of tackling climate change.

The threat was catastrophic and the stakes could scarcely be higher. Without urgent action, warming was predicted to reach unprecedented levels, of as much as 5C above current temperatures – a level that would see large swathes of the globe rendered virtually uninhabitable. What is more, infrastructure built today – coal-fired power plants, transport networks, buildings – that entail high carbon emissions will still be operating decades into the future, giving the world a narrow window in which to change the direction of our economies.

“This was the last chance,” said Miguel Arias Canete, Europe’s climate chief. “And we took it.”

The terrorist attacks on Paris raised questions about whether the talks would go ahead at all but François Hollande, the French president, insisted that they must and, in a show of unity, more than 150 heads of state landed in the French capital for the opening day. Barack Obama hailed the conference as “an act of defiance” in the face of terrorism.

Immediately after the attacks, the first concern was for security. A planned march through central Paris by protesters was cancelled, though a version of it did go ahead as the talks opened and was marred by clashes with police and a small number of protesters, and arrests. Security for the conference was stepped up, with police and army patrolling the immediate area and transport routes nearby shut down for two days.

This was the biggest ever gathering of world leaders, whose presence was needed to empower their negotiators to move out of positions entrenched for more than 20 years. When they arrived, a series of key meetings were held, with Obama seeing Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India and representatives from the least developed countries. Hollande concentrated on forging links with the developing world. Angela Merkel, in a private meeting with Vladimir Putin, secured his pledge that Russia would not stand in the way of a deal.

Behind the conference centre gates, French delegates were marshalling their diplomatic forces. They had carefully arranged the conference centre so that their part of the compound – behind barriers staffed by UN guards and secret service officers, unlike the rest of the delegations which were open to access – was directly above the UN’s offices.

Fabius, from his office, could be with Christiana Figueres, the UN climate change chief, for a face-to-face chat within seconds. His fellow minister, Ségolène Royal, was just along the corridor, flanked with the offices of ambassadors and high-ranking officials. Within the buzzing control room, screens relayed pictures of what was happening in each of the conference rooms scattered around the compound and 24 hour news from French and international channels.

 Delegates celebrate as the agreement is accepted
About 60 French officials were there. In preparation for the all-night sessions that began almost immediately the conference started, a room with 20 cubicled beds was waiting for exhausted officials to refresh themselves with a few snatched moments of sleep.



Procedurally, the French took great care. They instituted a series of talks known as “confessionals”. These were intended as confidential places where delegates could, in the words of one French official, “speak from the heart” to listening French diplomats, with no holds barred and an assurance of privacy.

There were also the absurdly named “informal informals”, in which a small group of delegates from various countries were charged with tackling a small piece of disputed text often as little as a paragraph at a time. Their task was to try to remove the infamous “square brackets” denoting areas of disagreement on the text and they met in small huddles around the conference centre, squatting on the floor in corridors or standing around a smart phone.

After these measures were still not producing enough progress, Fabius turned to “indabas” – by Zulu tradition, these are groups of elders convened to try to discuss disputes in communities. They were first tried out at the Durban climate talks in South Africa, in 2011, and under France’s plan they consisted of groups of up to 80 delegates at a time gathered to thrash out the remaining disagreements.

While the French could draft in experienced diplomats on every side, some of the smallest countries had difficulty in keeping up with the meetings – many happened in parallel and they did not have the personnel to attend them all.

One way of getting around that was the formation of a “coalition of high ambition”, which was announced with three days to Friday’s deadline. Forged by small island states – a key figure was Tony de Brum of the Marshall Islands – and the EU, it was joined by many of the least developed countries, adding up to more than 100 nations. They could then negotiate together, with an agreed common interest. Before the end, this coalition had been joined by the US, Canada and Australia. It was hailed by Europe’s climate and energy commissioner Miguel Cañete as a key factor in the end agreement.

And yet with three days of the conference to go, it looked as if all of these efforts might yet come to nothing. On the second Wednesday of the talks, the French produced a second iteration of the core text, reducing the number of brackets from more than 300 to fewer than 40. They were hopeful that this could be almost the end – and it needed to be in order to have the legal “scrubbers” and linguistic experts assess the text and ensure it was in line with international law and accurate in all languages.



But it soon became apparent that things were not going to plan. As countries examined the draft agreement, ministers started raising concerns. On Wednesday afternoon, leading delegations trooped one by one into Fabius’ personal office: Edna Molewa of South Africa, Xie Zhenhua of China, John Kerry of the US, Julie Bishop of Australia.

For South Africa, issues over “loss and damage” emerged – for developed countries, this meant the question of whether developing countries should be entitled to special aid in the event of climate-related disasters; for the developing, it meant compensation and liability, which the US would never agree to. For China, a key sticking point was differentiation – the concept that developing countries have less responsibility for climate change. For the US, some parts of the deal could not be legally binding in order to pass Congress.

Fabius sought to allay their concerns and find a compromise. At 8pm, he convened a new plenary session, at which all countries were able to speak. It carried on through the night.

At this point, it was clear that further efforts were needed. There followed a rapid round of telephone diplomacy. Obama spoke personally to the Chinese leader. Hollande picked up the phone to as many of his counterparts across the world as he could manage.

Finally, after two more days of fraught negotiation, a consensus emerged. None of the major countries wanted to be seen as wrecking a deal that had come so close. All could agree that they wanted an agreement and all made compromises. The EU backed down on having the intended emissions cuts, agreed at a national level, to be legally binding; the US accepted language on “loss and damage”; China and India agreed that an aspiration of holding warming to 1.5C could be included.

For the diplomats involved, the efforts were exhausting. The talks took a personal toll. In the months before the conference, Laurence Tubiana, appointed as special ambassador on climate change, played a key role in liaising with developing and developed countries. Then disaster struck. A week before the COP was scheduled to begin, she suffered a sudden sharp pain. It was acute appendicitis, necessitating emergency surgery. Within days, however, she had resumed her key role. When the deal was signed, she was on the podium, receiving hugs from Ban Ki-moon, Figueres, Fabius and Hollande, a recognition of the sacrifices she had made.



All of these efforts came to a head in the final crucial days. On Saturday morning, a new draft text was prepared. Fabius assembled the delegates and told them to have lunch while they waited for it to be translated. That afternoon, they examined the text and nearly all agreed that, with minor reservations, they could accept it. The final meeting was scheduled for 5.30pm. As for the last-minute hitch that kept delegates waiting in the hall for two hours? A matter of minor aspects of wording, including the translation of a few terms and the placement of a comma. It was rectified, apologies given, and the jubilation could begin.

It is easy to forget what an extraordinary event these UN talks were. The UNFCCC is one of the last remaining forums in the world where every country, however small, is represented on the same basis and has equal say with the biggest economies. Most modern diplomacy carries on in small, self-selected groups dominated by richer countries – the G7, the G20, the OECD, Opec – but all 196 states have a seat and a say at the UNFCCC. Agreement can only be accepted by consensus.

If this makes for an unwieldy and frustrating process, it is also a fair one. The poorest countries of the world, so often left out of international consideration, are those which have done least to create climate change, but will suffer the most from it. Only at the UN are they heard."

'It's a disaster': children bear brunt of southern Africa's devastating drought
Chidyamakondo high school, near Masvingo in southern Zimbabwe, has won the national girls’ football championships three years in a row. But that cherished record – and far, far more – is now at risk.

“Students are fainting, struggling to concentrate in lessons, dropping out of school … we’re having to shorten our assemblies and cut back on sport,” says headteacher Morrison Musorowegomo.

“Some of our players would rather leave the school and get married, or they will simply stay in the villages because they have no food.”

Southern Africa is suffering the consequences of perhaps the worst drought in 35 years, and pupils at Chidyamakondo are bearing the brunt of it. Four of the football team’s best players have stopped coming to school because they need to help their families find food. The dropout rate fluctuates but is currently averaging 10%.

The problem, though, does not stop here. In March, the World Food Programme warned that almost 16 million people were already food insecure in southern Africa. Last week, this figure was raised to 31.6 million by the Southern Africa Food and Nutrition Security Working Group (pdf). One of the strongest El Niño weather events ever recorded is partly to blame: the UN has warned that its severity has “overwhelmed” many countries. It has caused severe droughts and floods in southern Africa, and hunger crises elsewhere.

South Africa, traditionally a regional breadbasket, is just recovering from what it described as its worst drought in about 30 years, receiving the lowest rainfall in 2015 since recording began in 1904. Mozambique has raised alert levels for central and southern regions.

Last week in Malawi, which is facing its most severe food crisis in a decade, president Peter Mutharika declared a state of national disaster. Almost half of Malawian children under five are malnourished.

At Chidyamakondo, an otherwise thriving school with immaculate grounds, the devastating effects of the drought are all too clear. “It’s very difficult to teach hungry children,” says Musorowegomo.

“In classes the [attention] span is very small, and you find the kids run to the tap to get water. It’s not that they are thirsty – no, they are hungry, they want to have something in their tummies, so their learning has been greatly affected by drought.

“The majority of these kids go hungry the whole day. If at all, they are going to get a meal at night – they will be very lucky to do so.” He points to a marula tree that has become an unofficial canteen.

“You would find our kids gathered around that tree eating the fruits. That is their lunch. The situation is really bad.”

The pressures of hunger tend to affect girls and boys differently. Girls become vulnerable to being coerced into sex for food or cash.

“Boys, they go for gold panning, and some will skip the border to South Africa,” says Musorowegomo.

Nineteen-year-old Prudence Zurumba plays in the football team. Currently studying literature, history and divinity A-levels, she wants to be a lawyer – if her parents can find the funds to get her through university. Things, she says, are “very difficult” both on and off the pitch.

“If a pupil comes to school hungry, they won’t have that power to do the session and maybe some of them would have to be sent back home,” she says. “Even if we are the champions we face difficulties to achieve that.”

Bernard Hadzirabwi, the administrator for Chivi, the district in which the school lies, says the impact of the drought in the community is widespread.

“People have not been able to plant. There is virtually nothing in most of the fields. As far as the food security situation is concerned, in the district, we can talk of between 33% and 40% affected as of March, and that percentage is expected to rise … because we really received very little rainfall.”

Chivi is also dealing with a shortage of drinking water. “We have very little surface water so people for domestic use and their livestock rely on borehole water. Out of the little rains we’ve received, the water tables have gone further down, so most boreholes are no longer yielding any water.”

Pastures are visibly poor, riverbeds are dry and livestock run down. Goats and especially cattle are one of the core means of surviving here.

“Some people have been trying to have supplementary livestock feeding but it’s now really very difficult for them to buy food plus livestock feed. Now the livestock is dying and people cannot dispose of their livestock to buy food,” says Hadzirabwi.

Faced with the crisis across southern Africa, donors are supporting both traditional food distributions and more innovative cash transfer trials but competition for funds is challenging. The UK’s Department for International Development has stepped up its support, USAid has also increased funding to the region while the European commission set out its contribution at the COP21 climate conference in Paris.

The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian (Ocha) Affairs says the current funding gap is $2bn (£1.38bn). A joint agency review of the response to the 2011 emergency in the Horn of Africa found that delays prove expensive and responding to drought early is significantly cheaper than waiting until famine criteria are reached.

In Malawi, vulnerable to a noxious combination of drought and flooding, there is little time to waste. President Mutharika appealed last week for 1.2m tonnes of maize, saying some people would need aid for all of this year and into 2017.

Agriculture is critical to the country, making up a third of the economy and providing livelihoods for 80% of the 16.7 million population.

Juliana Lunguzi, from the Malawi Congress opposition party and member of parliament for Dedza East, illustrates the scale of the catastrophe.

“In two villages, where kids were left at home, where the mother went to look for food, they ended up eating some plants and they died,” she says. “They ate that something because there was no food. I’m just reporting [it] as it is, the extent of the hunger. It’s a disaster.”

Thirty-six-year-old Annie Namakhwa is a single mother of four living in Neno district. Her home is surrounded by wilting crops and she is struggling to feed her children.

“Last year the floods affected the maize so severely, you can see over that side my house collapsed with the floods. We were camping at the school until I was able to come up with the new structure.”

In the past, says Namakhwa, no matter how bad things got, neighbours would rally around those most in need.

“Now even that neighbour is also hungry and we are all facing the same challenge.”

With her four goats already gone to pay for her elder daughter’s education, Namakhwa is running out of contingencies and adopting more desperate measures.

“I was registered in the food aid programme but we don’t know when we’ll be receiving the next food ration. Sometimes it’s been about going into the garden, even just into the bush, to look for any vegetables. As long as we have salt, that’s been what’s been turning out to be food.”

Thabani Maphosa, partnership leader for Food Assistance within World Vision, warns that time is running out: “I think we have a challenge of staying power, both from the communities’ perspective sometimes and from the donors’ as well.”

Beyond the immediate vulnerability, the longer term impacts are worrying, too.

Before this latest crisis, according to Virginia Kachigunda, deputy director for school health and nutrition, Malawi had begun to make small improvements to its significant stunting levels – nearly half of all children under five are stunted. The associated cognitive impairments and socio-economic consequences threaten to blight further generations.

“People should be reached with support, because people should eat. Food is a human rights issue,” says Kachigunda. “We are really at a point where we need support. This is a situation which will eventually recycle poverty in these families. It’s a serious problem.”

Fombe is a particularly beautiful region further along the Shire River valley, between Chikwawa and the Majete national park, which suffered the brunt of last year’s flooding and where fertile soil has been washed away leaving a cover of sand. Here, communities show the broth they are living off, made of unripe watermelons.

As she watches her daughter-in-law prepare their only meal that day, 91-year-old Temesi Chiwala reflects on the changes in climate she has witnessed throughout her long life. And then she adds: “I have never seen what I am seeing today.”

Paris climate deal the trouble with targetism
The 21st UN climate summit (COP21) found a happy ending on December 12, when delegates from 195 countries adopted a set of decisions and the so-called “Paris Agreement”. As usual in diplomatic negotiations, the final document contains very vague language on many crucial aspects. But this kind of ‘constructive ambiguity’ often is the only way to get a deal done. The actual meaning of many paragraphs will develop over time, not so much as a result of the most sophisticated interpretations but as outcome of ongoing power struggles. In the words of Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann  “He who has the bigger stick has the better chance of imposing his definitions of reality”.

Nevertheless, the game of framing the COP21 outcome started even before the final draft of the agreement had been published, targeting the most contentious and thus intangible paragraphs, like the new long-term mitigation goal or the five-year review-mechanism. What has been largely overlooked though, are the elements that contain the most precise language quantified temperature targets.

The much reported Article 2(1) of the Paris Agreement states that it aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by

Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change

Even here, some parts are rather vague (e.g., what exactly does “well below” mean), and we’re surely going to see serious framing efforts in this regard. But there’s almost no questioning of the parties’ intention to hold the temperature increase to below 2 or even 1.5°C. Surely it’s the articulated will of 195 governments Well, think again.

We might be falling victim to the cultural norm of consistency in policymaking. This norm can be found in any field of policy, but its effects are particularly problematic in public domains with a deliberately transformative agenda, like energy and climate policy.

Almost nobody seems to grasp the political rationalities behind setting long-term climate policy targets. In the broader climate discourse everybody assumes consistency between talk, decisions and actions. Accordingly, a decision on a certain target is presented and perceived as an act of deliberate ‘choice’ between different desired end-states, to be accompanied by assessments of proper instruments and followed by deployment of appropriate measures. In the end, it might not work out as planned, but this would simply be considered as an ‘implementation failure’. We might even be able to learn from it.

The problem with international climate policy is, though, that it’s constantly not working as planned, since policymakers view decisions as independent organizational products, not necessarily connected to action. The 2°C target had already been adopted at COP16 in Cancun 2010, but action has been insufficient ever since, contrary to climate economists’ modeling. Ironically, scientific advisers are already relaxing the requirements for meeting the 2°C limit and started moving goalposts to keep the target alive.

Unfortunately, there’s not much learning to see in the climate policy community. The usual answer to failure is “more of the same”. The legally binding Paris Agreement brought about a new goal (on long-term mitigation) and an even more ambitious temperature target (1.5°C). Adoption of both will lead to a new circle of studies, maybe even a IPCC special report, that answer policymakers’ most favorable question are UN climate targets still feasible Researchers’ answers will be positive in general, but based on ever more heroic assumptions, particularly on vast amounts of negative emissions compensating for initial overshoot of the original carbon budgets, betting on unproven technologies. But policymakers are mostly interested in the main message and largely ignoring the fine print, with obvious results. Current ‘intended nationally determined contributions’ (INDC) will only lead to a slowdown of emissions growth, there’s no global peaking in sight, the review mechanism will be largely insufficient to bring the world onto a 2°C pathway, let alone 1.5°C. But most probably, policymakers will ask for more studies later.

If limiting temperature increase to below 2°C is already called a ‘fantasy’, and if the original carbon budget for 1.5°C might be consumed as early as 2020, why decide to put these targets in a legally binding UN treaty Quite obviously, these decisions are not about choice between certain sets of appropriate actions. With Nils Brunsson we can detect other possible functions of ambitious climate target decisions (1) creating legitimacy for policymakers or the negotiation process; (2) claiming responsibility for saving the planet; (3) mobilizing short-term action within the negotiation process.

Whichever function has been dominant in Paris, they all share one common feature to be fulfilled, actual target implementation is not necessary. What is indispensable though, is adhering to the cultural norm of consistency. And that’s why any major decision in climate policy will lead to a multitude of implementation studies. But since there is no comprehensive rationality in policymaking, scientists cannot expect appropriate action, even if they produce vast assessments that deliver many options to meet a given target.

Inconsistency in policymaking stems from the simple fact that political organizations have to secure external support, but are confronted with inconsistent demands by different stakeholders. The most practical way to deal with this challenge is to address some stakeholder groups by talk, some by decisions, and some by actions. This inevitably leads to inconsistency. Unfortunately, in climate policy most governments choose a more progressive stance while talking and deciding, but a more modest one when acting. The easiest way for them to deal with impending inconsistency is ‘hypocrisy’ by, for example, talking and making decisions about the far-away future, where the need for immediate action is relatively limited. Unsurprisingly, climate policy has been much more about intentions than results. So far, setting ambitious long-term global climate targets has not been a prerequisite but a substitute for appropriate action.

But if consistency can’t be assumed, then concepts like ‘evidence-based policymaking’ become shallow. Where does this leave scientific policy advisers There is no easy answer. But it might be a good starting point for advisers to get a much better idea how governments and politicians are dealing with new knowledge, and why they constantly ask for more although they’ve ignored most of it in the past. If climate policy advisers really want to help to make the world a better place, then they will have to deal with the political world as it is, not with simplified representations in models or textbooks.

The Guardian view on Paris, terror and climate change: shaping the future
While Europe is on high alert against another murderous terrorist attack, it will be hard for Paris to look beyond the next 24 hours. But soon delegates start arriving in the French capital for preliminary meetings ahead of COP21, the United Nations climate change summit which will be launched on 30 November with all the grandeur attendant on a gathering of global leaders. There is a certain symmetry to the two events that goes beyond the nightmare task facing France’s overstretched security forces. As the UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond pointed out in an important speech in the US only days before the Paris attacks last Friday: “Unchecked climate change … could have catastrophic consequences – a rise in global temperatures … leading in turn to rising sea levels and huge movements of people fuelling conflict and instability.”

There are reasons to be optimistic about a useful outcome from these negotiations, not least the determination of President Barack Obama’s team to deliver a deal with some kind of legal force. But any deal will mark the start rather than the end of the process.

The world has learned from previous failures. The innovation of asking every country for its own intended nationally determined contributions in advance of COP21 is that they reduce the wriggle room, at least for the time being. Wednesday’s big speech from the UK energy secretary Amber Rudd, setting a cut-off date of 2025 for coal-fired power stations, will underline that sense of commitment and should help to build some momentum ahead of the talks, even though it is only a small advance on the policies she inherited. It is also a necessary reaffirmation of the Conservatives’ pledge to green the electricity supply which had begun to seem questionable after its widely criticised decision to end subsidies to wind and solar power unexpectedly early.

Ms Rudd said she was resetting UK energy policy and if she didn’t quite do that, she did make a more or less coherent pattern from the fragments that have emerged since the election in May. It is a plan. Yet with its contradictions and conditional undertakings, it did not quite add up to a clear path through the so-called energy trilemma: the balance to be struck between security, sustainability and affordability. Take the commitment to phase out coal over the next 10 years: it came with the caveat that it would not happen unless there was a clear and reliable alternative. Given the continuing uncertainty over new nuclear (which, in the Rudd plan, is what stands between decarbonisation of electricity supply and the lights going off), that means new gas-fired power stations – less dirty than coal, but still a finite fossil fuel. The plan will also entail exploiting shale gas, which is so far entirely untested in the UK and already politically neuralgic. And if gas is to be the core of energy supply beyond 2030, when electricity is supposed to become carbon free, then serious money needs to go into developing carbon capture and storage. CCS merited just one mention in Ms Rudd’s speech.

As for the decision to phase out subsidies for renewables, it was defended as part of a necessary move towards making green energy competitive with other fuels, even though that is something nuclear power will not be for the foreseeable future. However, there was a little good news for renewables: there will be subsidy for new offshore wind, when it can compete with the cost of new nuclear. The bad news is that although off-shore generation costs have fallen by a fifth in two years, there is still a distance to travel.

Decarbonising power supply is proving hard enough. But it poses a lesser challenge than weaning the nation off its gas-fired heating, and luring it out of its diesel- and petrol-powered cars. That puts the greatest burden of reducing carbon emissions on electricity generation. The cheapest way to get there, the way that would make most difference to consumers and shrink their energy bills by the greatest amount, is to increase energy efficiency. Ms Rudd seems to have left that part of her plan in her pending tray.

Britain does have a positive message to deliver in Paris, and that can only be good news. But the world has not yet come up with a way of holding global warming below the critical 2C. The serious negotiation in Paris will be about monitoring and enforcing compliance and setting a formula to ratchet up commitments into the future. For the UK, the Rudd plan, heavy on gas and light on efficiency, will make the next step in carbon emission cuts harder than it needs to be."

Politicians at COP21 climate talks should take courage after the Paris attacks
The official sherpas and their political masters preparing for the global climate change talks in Paris which start today, have their already complicated task beset further by concerns over security, following the appalling attacks in Paris on Friday 13th November.

Beyond questions of security, the attacks are likely to have much broader impacts on the climate change talks, which are a make or break moment in the effort to prevent runaway global warming. Politics and diplomacy have a long track record of being shaped by events, which open or close windows of political possibility. In the UK, the shock of the first world war helped create the political will to pass universal suffrage, while the second world war created a state of mind in the United Kingdom which made a welfare state possible.

In recent years, terrorist attacks have played significant roles as drivers of change. In 2001, the 9/11 attacks galvanised a dormant attempt to launch a global round of trade talks. I was in Qatar six weeks after the attack on New York’s twin towers, and watched as world leaders swallowed their differences in a collective determination to show that the international community could come together in the face of atrocity, launching the Doha round of WTO trade negotiations.

Related: Which are the best aid donors? Governments have their say

Four years later, the British government and Make Poverty History campaigners put debt relief and aid on the agenda of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July 2005, but it was the 7/7 London bombings in the middle of the summit that made it diplomatically inevitable that the other G8 leaders would throw Blair a bone in the form of an ambitious agreement on aid and debt (pdf).

In Paris in the weeks to come, there will be an equal determination to close ranks and give President Hollande a much-needed diplomatic victory. The President has already set the tone by telling a joint session of the French parliament that the conference would go ahead, to “show that the world must stay united against terrorism.” President Barack Obama will still speak in person at the beginning of the conference. With that kind of political momentum, the window is now open for a more ambitious climate change agreement than might otherwise have been possible.

After the attacks, the language around the impending Conference of the Parties will undoubtedly be full of the need for a moment of global solidarity, moving on from the tit-for-tat horse trading that has typified international climate negotiations to mutual cooperation between governments to tackle what Lord Stern called: “the biggest collective action problem in history.”

But the lesson of 9/11 and Doha is that the new momentum behind a deal could be a double-edged sword. There, pressure was piled on developing countries to dilute their demands in the interests of standing up to terrorism. The trade talks soon slid back into the mire as North-South differences resurfaced.

There is a risk that a similar lowest common denominator deal could be agreed in Paris by negotiators understandably keen to grab diplomatic victory and jump on the first plane home.

Related: Should we be spending our aid budget on making things better for Britain?

That would be a terrible missed opportunity, because the tide of events on climate change is already heading in the right direction – since failure in Copenhagen in 2009, developing and developed countries have got on board, the scientific consensus around the need for action has grown even stronger, and new technologies have made the inevitable carbon transition less painful.

Leadership, public pressure and not a little luck will be needed to make sure that Paris produces a deal worthy both of the moment and the climate challenge that faces us all."

Brands must become sustainable or risk irrelevance
There has been much talk in marketing circles over the past few years about brands with purpose, brands with meaning, brands that matter – whatever you chose to call them. In fact purpose was one of the three most used words at the Cannes Lions festival back in 2013 along with storytelling and data.

What people actually mean when they talk about this can be hard to pin down. What’s key for me when thinking about how this is different to corporate social responsibility is that deep and intrinsic connection to the brand and what it stands for. Purpose must sit at the core of the brand, driving everything it does. It cannot be an add-on or something that comes and goes according to whim or budget. It’s this authenticity that consumers recognise and reward, because today’s consumers, especially millennials, can smell bullshit a mile away.

It’s important because consumers are increasingly looking for – and expecting to see – the purpose behind the brand. It’s not enough to tell people Persil washes whiter any more, they want an idea to buy into as well. Brand purpose gives people a constant in a constantly changing world.

Related: Brands searching for purpose must think before hijacking social issues

For Unilever, it is entrenched in our heritage, from when our founder, Lord Lever, created the first brand, Sunlight soap. In a country of Victorian slums, he had a vision to reduce the burden on women and make cleanliness commonplace.

Today we have a vision to make sustainable living commonplace. This is not because it is a “nice to have”; our sustainable living brands – such as Lifebuoy, Ben & Jerry’s and Dove – are growing at twice the rate of the rest of our portfolio and delivering more than half our growth. This is an economic decision and it is driving our business.

There is a growing appetite and momentum in this space for brands. If you haven’t heard about Collectively.org then I urge you to check it out. It’s about encouraging people to take meaningful action in a positive way; to make choices that are better for them and for the planet and to demand solutions that make the world a healthier, happier place. What’s key though is that it is supported by many of the world’s biggest brands, lots of which are fiercely competitive rivals, alongside a variety of NGOs. Google and Facebook for example, or Nestle and Unilever. These companies have come together to work collaboratively for the same goal; establishing sustainability as the new normal.

Consumers’ desire to have a deeper connection with brands, the expectation not just that they won’t “be bad” but that they should actively “do good”, is not going to go away. The brands that have not yet caught on to this, and are not thinking about how they will embed environmental and social sustainability within their business model, will not be around in the next 50 years.

For any brand thinking about how to go about this – jump in with both feet. You won’t know exactly how it’s going to go at first, but don’t be scared to learn along the way. Understand the trends that are shaping your future, create a vision and purpose and build a plan. The key thing to remember is to make sure this sits at the core of your business. Then you have to walk the walk.

Increasingly, I see the strong role brands have to play as citizens. In today’s complex and hyper–connected world, brands have a responsibility to create and lead for positive change. We saw some fantastic examples of what brands can achieve around the launch of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in September last year. By using brands which are familiar to people to carry a message about something complex like the SDGs, it helps people feel they can be a part of it creating that change. Brands such as Gucci to Google, H&M to the BBC all got involved to support the Global Citizen concert, in addition to Project Everyone, which had an incredible ambition to share the goals with 7 billion people in seven days. By throwing their weight behind this, brands have the chance to really effect positive change and help deliver a brighter future for our planet.

This was furthered by the work around COP21 in Paris last December. As we move from declaration to implementation of this historic global agreement, it’s an incredibly exciting time for brands to act as catalysts for change and linchpins for engagement. Who wouldn’t want to be a marketer in that kind of age?"

Surge in renewable energy stalls world greenhouse gas emissions
John Vidal
Falling coal use in China and the US and a worldwide shift towards renewable energy have kept greenhouse gas emissions level for a second year running, one of the world’s leading energy analysts has said.

Preliminary data for 2015 from the International Energy Agency (IEA) showed that carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector have levelled off at 32.1bn tonnes even as the global economy grew over 3%.

Electricity generated by renewable sources played a critical role, having accounted for around 90% of new electricity generation in 2015. Wind power produced more than half of all new electricity generation, said the IEA.

The figures are significant because they prove to traditionally sceptical treasuries that it is possible to grow economies without increasing climate emissions.

“The new figures confirm last year’s surprising but welcome news: we now have seen two straight years of greenhouse gas emissions decoupling from economic growth. Coming just a few months after the landmark COP21 agreement in Paris, this is yet another boost to the global fight against climate changem” said IEA director, Fatih Birol.

The two largest emitters, China and the US, both reduced energy-related emmisions in 2015. In China, they declined 1.5%, as coal use dropped for the second year running and in the US they declined 2%, as a large switch from coal to natural gas use in electricity generation took place.

However, these declines were offset by increasing emissions in most other Asian developing economies and the Middle East, said the IEA.

In the 40 years in which the IEA has reported on CO2 emissions, there have been only four short periods in which emissions stood still or fell compared to the previous year. Three of those — the early 1980s, 1992 and 2009 — came in periods of economic crisis.

But the new stall in emissions comes amid economic expansion. According to the International Monetary Fund, global GDP grew by 3.4% in 2014 and 3.1% in 2015.

“When the IEA said last year that global emissions had stalled whilst economic growth had continued, they understandably sounded a note of caution; was this a one-off, or the start of something major?” said Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU).

“The sense of excitement as they report similar findings this year therefore is palpable, because in essence they’re showing that combating climate change is perfectly compatible with continuing economic growth, and that’s hugely significant,” said Black.

A seperate report by the European Environment agency (EEA) shows that the EU-wide share of renewable energy has increased from 14.3% in 2012 to 15% in 2013. This allowed the EU to cut its demand for fossil fuels by 110m tonnes of oil equivalent in 2013. This, said the EEA, is the equivalent of a gross reduction of CO2 emissions of 362m tonnes in 2013."

EU open to increasing 2030 carbon target, says top climate negotiator
Arthur Neslen
Europe’s chief climate negotiator has said he is open to increasing the EU’s carbon target for 2030, in a backdown by the European Commission.

Last week, the commission ruled out any increase in the bloc’s target of cutting emissions by 40% by 2030 on 1990 levels, sparking an outcry from several countries and green groups.

Ministers and environmentalists said that Europe should be increasing its ambition in light of the Paris climate deal agreed in December, where nearly 200 countries pledged to pursue efforts to keep temperature rises to 1.5C. That was a much tougher goal than the existing 2C goal which Europe’s 40% cut is based on.

On Monday, the EUdirector of climate strategy, Artur Runge-Metzger, responded to the criticism: “The question of the level of ambition for 2030 is open, as long as it is a binding EU target of at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990.”

Brook Riley, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth, welcomed his comments. “It’s good to hear the Commission saying that increased emission cuts are still on the table, even if this contradicts what it published last week. Without tougher targets Europe would be undermining and undoing the Paris agreement before it is even signed.”

Last Friday, the Austrian environment minister, Andra Rupprechter, told a ministerial summit in Brussels: “We shouldn’t let our ambition droop. We should keep putting out strong signals.”

The German environment minister, Jochen Flasbarth, added: “Our decision did not say that we would stay at a 40% emissions cut. It said we will cut ‘at least 40%’. The commission was a member of the ‘high ambition coalition’ in Paris so we would like to know how they intend to stand by this commitment.”

No answer is likely before 2018. That is when the UN’s climate science panel, reports back to the Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees international climate negotiations, on the policy implications of faster and more far-reaching action.

The first in a five-yearly series of “global stock-takes” on emissions cuts follows in 2023, and this will be the first opportunity for the EU to increase its pledge of a 40% cut by 2030.

The EU is currently modelling the economic impacts of improved energy efficiency targets, after criticism of previous impact assessments used to set policy.

In a sign that Brussels lobbies are beginning to see signs of change, the head of the solar photovoltaic industry’s trade association today called on the EU to set a new target of members states sourcing 35% of their energy from renewable sources by 2030.

“More ambition is needed in Europe to reach the objective of limiting global warming to just 1.5C, which the European Union signed up to in Paris,” said Oliver Schaefer, SolarPower Europe’s president. “The EU must review the targets suggested in 2014. It would be foolish to pretend that nothing has changed since COP21 [the Paris climate summit].”"

We need to change the language of sustainability
Kate Howe
Business goals and sustainable aspirations are coming closer together. If COP21 – where large multinationals pushed global leaders to reach a climate change agreement in Paris last year – was not proof enough, a visit last month to Davos demonstrated the intent of business leaders to take climate responsibility seriously.

Meanwhile, there have been episodes of pure corporate greed, such as the VW emissions scandal and Tesco deliberately delaying payments to boost its profits.

If events such as these have any virtue at all, it probably lies in the corporate world appreciating sustainability as a key business driver, with companies now required to play a key role in solving some of our planet’s largest problems.

I’ve been talking to business leaders on how best to use the science behind sustainability and conceive a new lexicon to champion this enhanced engagement with it. At gyro we have appointed a head of sustainability to help us do just that. Lord Gregory Barker, the former minister of state for energy and climate change will head up our sustainability practice.

Experience has taught me that the sustainability topic is much like the gender parity conversation: complex and lively. Everyone wants to do it, but no one knows how.

The ad industry has very little to show when it comes to either of these issues. Ironic considering that advertising is the one compass that allows us to start asking the right questions, framing them the right way to start an engaging dialogue.

Questions such as:

Can your sustainability manifesto be translated into stories that mean something to customers and other stakeholders (and stir up passion)?

What drives a business CEO to achieve sustainability – when sustainability is sold as a competitive advantage or when it appeals to a CEO’s desire to do the right thing?

What metrics should be set in place to measure sustainability?

The commercial case for sustainability has been proven – could we now build a creative case for sustainability?"

Wednesday was a historic day for the climate. No, not another record-breaking hottest month. Not another devastating hurricane. For once, it was a good day.

Wednesday was the day enough countries – representing more than 55% of global carbon emissions – ratified the Paris agreement on climate change for the treaty to enter force.

A weary world, weighed down by Syria, Brexit and American presidential elections must wonder if fancy words like “ratification” actually mean anything. The answer is unequivocally “yes”. This treaty sets us on an irreversible trajectory on which all investment, all regulation and all industrial strategy must start to align with a global economy powered by 100% clean energy.

So dramatic is this change of direction that, as of last December, more than 500 global institutions with assets in excess of $3.4 trillion had committed to divest themselves from the fossil-fuelled extractive industries of the past. Government policies globally are now aligned with real-world market forces pushing forward the next great industrial revolution: the clean low-carbon revolution that will transform how we power our lives.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, and the former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have set about transforming the global company reporting system so that it takes account of climate change risks.

Financial decision-makers at every level are recognising that fossil fuel investments risk their returns being undermined by stranded assets. They recognise that supply chains face disruption from the effects of climate change. Carney warned just last month that to minimise the risk to financial stability the transition away from high- carbon industries should begin early and follow a predictable path to help markets anticipate the central element of the Paris agreement: a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century. A disorderly transition would result in financial shocks that would make 2008 seem no more than a blip


Planet at its hottest in 115,000 years thanks to climate change, experts say

To achieve the central goal at the heart of the Paris agreement, of creating a net zero-carbon economy by the second half of this century, we need an orderly, managed transition that minimises risks and allows us to seize the opportunities created by the new jobs and investment in clean industries that will increasingly drive our economies.

Binding international law provides a solid bulwark against even the most unexpected political events – just think of Brexit or a Trump presidency. The involvement of city governments, investors and the private capital markets is making the progress to a clean future impossible to roll back.



Latest figures from Office for National Statistics show that Britain’s low-carbon businesses generate a total annual turnover of £46.2bn for the economy and employ nearly a quarter of a million people. The growth in the low-carbon sector of the UK economy is now outpacing the growth rate of the economy as a whole, and has grown by almost 30% in the past three years.

Of course, maintaining this level of growth requires clear signals from politicians – not the Tory stop-start decisions that have thrown renewable industries into chaos and energy investors into despair. A shale gas infrastructure would require a return on capital over 30 to 35 years. Quite simply this means that shale gas is an expensive detour the UK can ill-afford to take. That is why last week I announced that the next Labour government will ban fracking, and why community secretary Sajid Javid’s decision this week to overturn 18,000 local objections and clear the way for fracking in Lancashire is a colossal mistake.

Gas will play an important transitional role in the UK’s energy supply over the next 15 years. But energy efficiency in domestic heating and the decarbonisation of our power supply by 2030 will see demand for it fall by 26%.

We need to be investing in the low-carbon technologies that are creating the apprenticeships and skilled jobs of the future. Wednesday’s ratification of the Paris agreement makes business as usual impossible. We are in a different world now."

Beating climate change is key to making nutritious food needed to beat hunger
With hopes high that a new global climate change agreement will be signed at the UNs COP21 talks in Paris, the world faces a difficult question. How do we feed and nourish an increasing number of people while ensuring that expanded agricultural production becomes more sustainable, and does not put more strain on the worlds natural resources?

The balance is especially difficult to strike given that 70% of the worlds poor live in rural areas and, in developing countries, agriculture  particularly small-scale farming  is the main source of income and employment. But improving food security is critical: today, one in every nine people goes to bed hungry, while one in four children are undernourished.

Related: To end malnutrition, we must step up to the plate with data on what people eat | Lawrence Haddad and Patrick Webb

Ensuring greater food production alone is not enough. Since undernutrition is the principal cause of death for more than 3 million children each year, we need not just more food but also affordable, safe and nutritious food.

Climate change is a key factor to be addressed, in Paris and beyond. There is strong scientific evidence that changing temperatures and rainfall patterns have a significant impact on crops.

The EU actively promotes techniques that can reinforce the sustainability and productivity of farming. Measures aim to reduce exposure to climate change and avoid environmental degradation while simultaneously contributing to food security and better nutrition. Demand-driven agricultural research and innovation, benefiting small-scale farmers, are particularly important in this regard.

Of course, several factors put food security at risk. Weak productivity, price volatility, growing populations, and limited access to markets all play a part.

In recent weeks, the 2030 agenda has been adopted by the UN. Over the next 15 years, 17 global goals will drive our pursuit of a fairer and better world. Nutrition and food security will be among the core themes in this process.

More than 60 developing countries have asked the EU to support their efforts to promote sustainable agriculture and food systems as a key area of our cooperation. Already a leading donor in food and nutrition security, the EU is ready to invest up to 8.8bn (?6.5bn) in this area between 2014 and 2020. The focus will be on small-scale farmers and undernourished children, as well as preparing the most vulnerable to cope better with food crises.

For instance, the EU will support partner countries in their efforts to hit a 2025 target for reducing the number of children under five who suffer from stunting by 7 million. We have also pledged3.5bn to improving nutrition between 2014 and 2020.

We want to enhance the incomes of smallholder farmers, improve rural communities ability to withstand natural or manmade shocks by intensifying sustainable agriculture practices, and ensure food products are safe and nutritious.

Related: Ethiopia appeals for international aid in face of deepening food insecurity

The EUs strategy is to stimulate change within rural communities in order to achieve economic transition and, ultimately, sustainable transformation. As farming remains largely a private sector activity, and individual families of farmers or smallholders are the largest investors in developing countries agriculture, they should be central to this transformation.

Developing a viable and vibrant agricultural sector presents a significant market opportunity for small and family farmers. Further integration into the agricultural economy offers rural and urban farming households, as well as agribusinesses, the possibility of earning a living, thus increasing wealth and prosperity.

None of this will work unless we can ensure that agriculture and development policies actively contribute to achieving each others objectives. We are committed to making sure this happens.

'Solar energy isn’t just good for polar bears, it’s good for the working class'
There are many ways to frame a documentary about solar power; many ways to go about extolling the virtues of clean energy. The most obvious would be to pursue the following line: hit hard by the effects of climate change, the world can save itself by building a sustainable future in renewable technology.

It’s also a message that falls squarely in the tell-us-something-we-don’t-know box.

“You can’t talk in a neighbourhood like this about saving the polar bear. They’re not gonna feel ya.”

Many moons have passed – and much discussion has transpired – since Al Gore brought us the world’s first blockbuster powerpoint presentation, 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth. That film ended with what is now considered a cliche in environmental documentaries: a “what can I do to help?” section intended to turn audiences into campaigners.

For her Sundance-supported feature documentary debut Catching the Sun, which screens in Australia as part of environmental documentary film festival Transitions this month, film-maker and activist Shalini Kantayya took a different route. She framed the discussion not as a “world gone to hell” prophecy of doom but as the means to argue renewable tech is – or can be – all about the economy, stupid.

The film begins in Richmond, Virginia, a place that acts as a symbolic stand-in for any number of other American cities. The manufacturing industry, long its backbone, has withered and unemployment is rife.

A program called Solar Richmond creates “green-job opportunities”. It equips citizens, often those from rough-and-tumble neighbourhoods, with skills necessary for employment in solar panel installation. As one interviewee puts it: “You can’t talk in a neighbourhood like this about saving the polar bear. They’re not gonna feel ya.”

What they can feel is the difference between being trained and ready for employment and living on welfare. This is where Kantayya starts – the issue of job creation – viewing the word “renewable” in both an environmental and economic context.

“When I went to the Solar Richmond training program, I thought this is a symbol for the kind of transformation all cities must make if we’re going to move our global economy towards a renewable future,” she says.

“I really got excited with that idea, which is really about the economics. Could solar do for Americawhat the automotive industry did?”

Catching the Sun largely ignores the kinds of discussion about climate change synonymous with binary politics, and is intended for intelligent audiences who don’t need to be convinced about the environmental benefits of clean energy.

It has already screened in front of people for whom its messages about financial opportunity could make an impact – including at COP21 and for 100 mayors from around the world, at the invitation of the US secretary of state, John Kerry. “One of the most moving things about the film is that it is actually reaching policymakers,” says Kantayya.

“Solar energy isn’t just good for the polar bears, it’s good for the middle class and the working class,” says the director. “I found in the many years making this film that there’s a story that’s not been told – that solar energy is the foremost economic opportunity of our time.”

One interesting case study is staunch conservative Debbie Dooley, one of the founding members of the US’s Tea Party and a participant in the documentary. She is also an outspoken advocate for solar energy. This may be generally perceived as a left-leaning cause, but Dooley is adamant her passion for solar is because of her ideological beliefs, not despite them.

Kantayya says her and Dooley’s political opinions are diametrically opposed (“We don’t talk about any other issues, let’s be clear,” she says, chuckling). But she views their collaboration as representative of the potential to break down barriers.

“I think our friendship is a symbol of what can be possible when we push our differences aside – this labelling of left and right – and say: what is it that we actually both want?

“Arguably the most environmental president [the US] has ever had was Richard Nixon. He gave us the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. All of those things were signed under Nixon and you can hardly call him a granola hippy.”

Catching the Sun arrives at an interesting time in Australia. Freed from the weird cheerleading of Tony “ Coal is good for humanity ” Abbott, there is a sense that a corner has been turned.

In January, two new solar plants (now the largest in the country) were formally opened in Nyngan and Broken Hill, prompting speculation they may signal the “ the birth of large-scale solar ”. The Asia-Pacific manager for First Solar, which partnered with AGL, said costs for large-scale solar have fallen about 30% in recent years.

Uptake for individual homes and offices remains high, with recent data revealing more than 1.5m Australian homes have rooftop solar panels. And last month an Australian family became the first in the country to get a Tesla Powerwall unit installed.

But the danger is that political seesawing and changes in policy will stymie growth. Recently in Nevada, for example, thousands of workers were let go after the state’s energy commission passed rules that roll back solar incentives. Similarly energy campaigners in the UK blamed government policy for the collapse of two solar panel installers last year.

Kantayya reiterates the message that governments should “send strong signals to the business community” and believes root-and-branch reform has to be a part of it: “The rewiring of our energy system is also going to involve the rewiring of our political system.”

She singles out Germany’s feed-in tariff, which pays individual people to be power producers, as an example of an effective initiative.

“A large portion of the solar that came to Germany was actually owned by ordinary people. Industrialists were almost left out of Germany’s solar revolution.”

Catching the Sun does, by the way, end with that eco-activist doco cliche: a call-to-action imploring audiences to contact their elected officials. But the film is so logically argued, and advocates such highly pragmatic workable solutions, you can hardly fault it for doing so.

“Of course we need to make big federal changes but it is about ordinary citizens going to their local government, going to their state governments, and saying this is what we want.”"

Have we reached the tipping point for investing in renewable energy?
Divestment – the decision to voluntarily reduce one’s fossil fuel investments – has been a hot button topic of discussion since 2011, when university students began calling on their institutions to remove fossil fuels from their portfolios. Divestment arguments have often focused on the morality of investments, but the economic value of divestment has recently become hard to ignore.

In January, portfolio planner Advisor Partners reported that, between 2014 and 2015, New York City’s biggest pension fund lost $135m because of its fossil fuel holdings. And, earlier this month, Market Forces, an activist group that works in environmental finance, reported that fossil fuel investments cost 15 of Australia’s top funds an estimated $5.6bn. On average, this cost each member of these funds $1,109.

Related: Sustainable investing: are companies finally moving money away from fossil fuels?

For a long time, the corporate case for sustainability has been focused more on public relations than profit. Companies that pursued sustainable policies, the reasoning went, benefitted by gaining valuable points with customers, avoiding embarrassing scandals and – especially in recent years – getting their pick of eager young millennial workers.

But profitable sustainability is coming of age, at least as far as renewable energy is concerned. With the value of fossil fuel holdings plummeting and the profitability of renewables growing, investors and companies are increasingly looking to sustainable investments for good long term bets.

At January’s UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk – an event attended by 500 global investors representing an estimated $22tn in assets – most of the presenters shunted aside the standard public relations and millennial hire arguments in favor of an old fashioned look at profits and losses. And, as they made clear, companies and investors that shun sustainable, low-carbon assets stand to lose a lot of money.

Michael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, explained the new math of fossil fuels. Coal, he pointed out, is losing value in every country except India. Gas prices have also fallen sharply, leading to a steep drop in investment. A recent Citibank report predicted that oil is likely to “bottom out” in 2016. And Bloomberg recently quoted Vitol oil holding group CEO, Ian Taylor, as saying that crude oil will likely stay at $60 a barrel for at least 10 years.

The rise of renewables

On the other hand, renewable energy is becoming increasingly viable, a trend that could potentially be a game-changer for investors, particularly large scale, global investors like the ones attending the UN summit.

The falling prices of renewables-generated electricity are pulling the rug out from under fossil fuels, which are getting priced out of the market. According to former vice president Al Gore, who also spoke at the UN Investor Summit on Climate Risk, solar power has been dropping by 10% per year. If this curve continues, Gore said, then its price is going to fall “significantly below the price of electricity from burning any kind of fossil fuel in a few short years”.

In some places, Liebreich said, this is already happening. A year ago, a solar project in Dubai went online, and offered electricity at a rate of $0.058 per KwH. “This was the solar equivalent of the shot that was heard around the world,” he explained. “In the Middle East, a solar project was producing electricity more cheaply than you could produce it using natural gas.”

This month, Liebreich said, Morocco announced an offshore wind farm that will produce electricity for $0.03 per KwH. “This is probably the cheapest new electricity that you could build anywhere in the world,” he said. And not only is this a boon for consumers, but it also sends a clear message to utilities. “When you get electricity this cheaply, you have to buy some.”

The same thing is happening in the US. Gore pointed out that in Nevada, energy generators are selling solar electricity to utilities for $0.3 cents per KwH, a price well below that of coal-based electricity. And some utilities are even giving electricity away for free. Gore cited TXU, a utility in Texas. “Here’s their new rate plan: your rates will go up a little bit during the peak use periods during the day, but from 9pm until 6am the next morning, you can use all the electricity you want for free,” he said. “They have to get rid of it because it’s too hard to turn off the turbines. And in south Australia and parts of Germany, they’ve gone to negative rates for renewable electricity.”

The case for global investment

Falling electricity prices are great news for companies that use electricity and bad news for investors with holdings in fossil fuels. But what about people who hope to invest in renewables?

Related: Copenhagen set to divest from fossil fuels

As several of the UN summit’s participants pointed out, building a wind or solar farm requires a significant initial investment, after which the actual price of power generation will remain low indefinitely, as the sun will continue to shine on solar cells and the wind will continue to turn turbines. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which require a large upfront investment for building power plants, followed by continued expenditure for extracting, transporting and burning fuel.

And investors have gotten the message: as the Financial Times pointed out last year, the six major renewable investment funds yield between 5.5% and 7% – attractive returns in the current market. Not surprisingly, there has been sharp growth in renewable generation. “A dozen years ago, the best predictors in the world told us that the solar energy market would grow by 2010 at the incredible rate of 1 GW per year,” said Gore. “By the time 2010 came around, they exceeded that by 17 times over. Last year, it was exceeded by 58 times over. This year, it’s on track to be exceeded by 68 times over. That’s an exponential curve.”

In 2015, global clean energy investment hit $329bn, its highest level ever. But, despite all evidence of value, many corporations and investors are still hesitant to invest in renewables, and they often charge outrageous interest for solar projects.

UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon emphasized that the recent COP21 summit – particularly the pledges made by companies and governments from around the world – could encourage investment in renewables. “The Paris agreement provides a durable, yet flexible framework,” he said. “There are transparent rules of the road to monitor progress and enhance accountability.”

Ultimately, Moon says, both investors and corporations now have a signal that the time has come for them to direct their energies toward low-carbon, climate-resilient growth. “It marks the beginning of the end of growth built solely on fossil fuel consumption,” he said. “The once unthinkable has now become unstoppable.”"

Global warming: uneven changes across planet
Less than 2C of global warming for the Earth, the target agreed by leaders at the COP21 climate conference in Paris last November, doesn’t really sound too ambitious. In fact, many of us would welcome an extra couple of degrees warmth. So what is all the fuss about?

Unfortunately the warming would not occur evenly around the world. A study published recently in Nature shows what 2C of warming – a rise, of this level, above the pre-industrial global mean surface temperature – might really feel like and which regions may be hit hardest.

Related: Sea-level rise 'could last twice as long as human history'

Some of the regional hot spots cited are the Mediterranean countries, Brazil and the US, where 2C of global warming could translate into local temperature increases of more than 3C. But the region expected to suffer most is the Arctic, where night-time temperatures are predicted to soar by 6C.

“Some countries are much more exposed than others,” says Rob Wilby, from Loughborough University.

The Earth has already warmed by an average of 1C, and the uneven nature of this warming is becoming clear with Arctic regions already beyond the 2C mark. Meanwhile, climate models suggest that the Mediterranean could pass the 2C level once global temperatures have risen by 1.4C.

Oceans, which cover 70% of the planet, warm much more slowly than land and are partly responsible for the uneven pattern of warming. Local factors, like loss of heat-reflecting snow in the Arctic, make a difference, too.

And it isn’t just temperature: changes in rainfall are also expected to be unequally distributed, with most land areas getting more of a dousing, according to the researchers. “Recent flooding episodes in the UK give us an insight into just how vulnerable we are,” says Wilby."

Five reasons why the advertising industry needs sustainability tsars
As someone who runs a business-to-business (B2B) agency that creates humanly relevant ideas for future-forward companies, I know decision-makers today put a high value on trust, reputation and experience, and believe in their mission to help their businesses accelerate the shift to a flourishing future. Enter ethics, purpose, morality and sustainability. Post-COP21 (the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) there’s hope that even the most reluctant of businesses who see sustainability as a dirty word, or use it as a box-ticking exercise, would recognise 2016 as the tipping point to facing the reality of climate change.

I want us to join in and start making a difference. There’s a surge of shareholder activism around sustainability. The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently identified climate change as the “tragedy of the horizon”. Once climate change becomes a defining issue for financial stability, “it may already be too late,”

he said. He also proposed that firms “disclose not only what they are emitting today, but how they plan their transition to the net-zero world of the future”.

Our in-depth conversations with sustainability heads and CEOs of some of the UK’s most prominent companies, along with our experience of being at COP21, has convinced us that we can add value to the communications of any company looking to improve its sustainability practice.

Our focus is on how organisations can translate sustainability into stories that stir up passion, mean something to its customers and stakeholders, and translate into enhanced reputation and positive behaviours.

Beyond the Brand, a 2015 global executive survey conducted by gyro and the Fortune Knowledge Group, found that a partner’s corporate culture is valued more than a reputation for innovation or market dominance. The report found that business decision-makers are placing greater significance on a business partner’s culture than ever before. With that in mind, here are my top five reasons for needing a sustainability tsar at the agency:

Make a business case

How do you make the case for investing time and money in sustainable initiatives? That’s what it comes down to when trying to communicate the vision for

corporate sustainability strategies. Like Mark Carney, businesses must recognise sustainability as the right way of doing things. We need advocates who can bridge the gap between doing good and economic benefits.

Use the right language

In order to inspire business leaders and their employees to make a commitment to a future that’s both sustainable and profitable, we have to stop trying to sell the sustainability pitch. The vocabulary around sustainability has only meant images of melting ice caps or shivering pandas. This is not persuasive enough for business leaders to implement sustainable practices holistically.

Build partnerships

With the use of the right language comes the discovery that sustainability is much more than warming seas and melting ice sheets. It incorporates corporate culture, issues such as diversity, and corporate social responsibility — touch points that have a direct impact on employees and communities. Eventually, this will result in a complete buy-in from those employees and the people that businesses impact positively.

Appeal to the desire to do the right thing

It is of course imperative that businesses are appraised of their competitive advantage in sustainability practices. More importantly, it should appeal to their desire to do the right thing. A UK survey conducted by gyro, in association with YouGov, found that nearly two-thirds (65%) of executives believe subjective factors that cannot be quantified (including company culture and corporate values) make a difference when evaluating competing proposals.

However, different businesses might vary depending on what aspects or qualities of sustainability they value. For example, the environment is an important factor for some, but not for all. By focusing on one area, it could help make those connections for the greater good.

5. Start a new way of thinking

Sustainability is not a label or an add-on service – it has to centre on the relationships the business has with people, both its employees and customers. It has to be an enduring corporate value that challenges the way businesses operate – starting from a commitment to human rights, environment and labour, to providing solutions that help global challenges of climate, water and food crises, inequality and poverty.

As an agency, I want to be part of this transformation. Serious challenges call for serious actions, and we are only getting started. 2016 is going to be a formidable but an inspiring year."

'If the world ends in 2100, we’re probably OK'
There’s a myopia in the climate discourse today.

“Everyone is focused on what happens by 2100. But that’s only 2 generations from today. It’s like: If the world ends in 2100 we’re probably OK!” says Professor Richard Zeebe of the University of Hawai’i. “But It’s very clear that over a longer timescale there will be much bigger changes.”

If the next century seems impossibly far off, bear in mind that if you have a young child now, we’re talking about the world her or his grandchildren will be trying to raise their kids in.

Scientists who take the long view on climate change see parallels between global warming today and mass extinctions in Earth’s past: “Apart from the stupid space rock hitting the Earth, most mass extinctions were CO 2-driven global warming things,” says Professor Andy Ridgwell of Bristol University in the UK.

It has been a consistent pattern throughout geological time: “If you screw with the climate enough, you have huge extinctions,” says Ridgwell.

So much of what you read and hear about climate change is heavily based on instrument records that only go back 160 years or so. But Richard Zeebe and Andy Ridgwell are among a few scientists who look millions of years into Earth’s past to learn how the Earth responded to big additions of CO 2 into the atmosphere before. I had the opportunity to chat with each of them about their work during the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco at the end of last year.

Beyond the ice ages

It’s true that scientists can learn about the ice age climate going back 800,000 years from bubbles of air trapped in ancient ice drilled from Greenland and Antarctica. They reveal many swings from warm to cold to warm again, in a low-CO 2 world mostly cooler than today. “We went from very cold and low sea level to a mild climate with normal sea level,” says Ridgwell. But it was a very different scenario than today - those cycles were mainly driven by Earth’s wobbles as it circles the Sun, and those same orbital wobbles mean we should be cooling, not warming, today.

So both Ridgwell and Zeebe have been studying the best equivalent to modern climate change they have found so far, a relatively rapid global warming event that occurred 56 million years ago, called the “Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,” mercifully shortened to “PETM.” For Ridgwell, it’s a better analog for the future:

This is why I like the PETM, at least it’s a warming event. It had a peak global warming of about 5? or 6?C, which is a little bit beyond the end-of-the-century worst case scenario.

For Zeebe it’s also about data quality:

We are focusing on the PETM is because we have relatively good sediment records. We are able to constrain timescales and ages relatively accurately. If you go further back in time, these constrains become very, very difficult.

Unprecedented in 66 million years

Scientists use a wide variety of data from rocks exposed and drilled at various locations around the globe. They look at geology, fossils, and the chemical makeup of sediments, particularly chemical isotopes - different atoms of the same element that differ minutely in their mass. As Zeebe says,

We have two isotope systems that we can look at. One of those are oxygen isotopes and they are essentially a thermometer, they tell us about climate change. And the other isotope system we’re looking at is carbon isotopes and they tell us something about carbon release.

Zeebe and colleagues compared isotope samples with computer models of the climate system. They stretched the models’ carbon emission timescale until they got a match with the isotope measurements. This showed that the carbon emissions which caused the PETM took about 4,000 years - remarkably similar to an estimate of about 3,000 years just published by Ridgwell and his colleague Sandy Kirtland Turner. They used a completely different approach from Zeebe, focusing on the differences in the carbon signal between marine and land sediments.

Narrowing the PETM emissions timeframe to around 3,000 to 4,000 years shows that, like today, the global warming back then was caused by geologically-fast carbon emissions. But our emissions have taken just a couple of centuries so, as Zeebe points out:

What we’re doing with our emissions is unprecedented in the past 66 million years!

Even if the PETM isn’t a perfect equivalent of today’s climate (it was slower, and it happened in a world that was already warmer than today), it still tells us how the planet reacts to a sharp excess of carbon in the atmosphere. For example, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says we can expect a warming of between 1.5°C and 4.5°C if we double atmospheric CO 2 levels, but also acknowledges that the longer term warming (over centuries to millennia) “could be significantly higher” than that. The PETM tells us it is. Zeebe notes:

If we just try to explain the PETM with a climate sensitivity of 4.5°C, we only get maybe 60% of the warming. So my conclusion would be that long term sensitivity must be more than 4.5°C.

Mass extinctions

Ridgwell has also investigated global warming events going back deeper in geological time, including the big mass extinction events like the end-Permian and the end-Triassic, as well as so-called “Ocean Anoxic Events” in the Cretaceous. These involved profound and long-lived environmental disruption, with symptoms quite similar to today’s climate change, such as global warming, rainfall changes, and ocean acidification.

“Overall these are relatively slow events, on timescales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years,” says Ridgwell. But recent advances in rock dating, and in tracing Earth’s magnetic field frozen into ancient lava, suggests that within those slow events there may well have been intense, rapid episodes that came closer to today’s human emission rates.

You might have very short pulses of CO 2 release within them. Some of these pulses of CO 2 could look like what we’re doing now in terms of amount and rate. That’s an area of active research, because the estimates of individual pulses are getting better, but the estimates of how much CO 2 would be released associated with an individual pulse are still uncertain.

The change already baked in

Ridgwell is skeptical about ambitions to limit warming to 1.5°C:

We have 1.5°C already programmed in, so even if we bring emissions right, right down, immediately, now, we already have 1.5 degrees! So how we’re keeping to a 1.5-degree threshold isn’t clear. So a fun thing we’re doing now with our very fast warming is the ocean surface warms up and the deep ocean is still cold, which is partly why we have this programmed-in warming that we haven’t seen yet. The deep ocean hasn’t yet noticed that the planet at the surface is rather warmer. If we just sit here at current CO 2 levels and let the system equilibrate, it’s 1.5°C anyway. Which comes back to COP21 - what is this 1.5°C target? We’ve emitted the CO 2 to reach 1.5°C already, so I don’t know what they’re thinking of! It seems as if everyone is assuming, without thinking about it, that there is massive carbon geoengineering going on.

Geoengineering is a word that covers a multitude of sins, but in this case it refers to sucking CO 2 out of the atmosphere and burying it. Even the 2?C target aimed at (but not reached) in Paris assumes quite a lot of active CO 2 burial. The feasibility – or not – of that endeavor is an active debate, usefully summarized by Andy Skuce on SkepticalScience.com, but it may be crucial if we are to avoid the more extreme long term environmental effects and sea level rises that scientists see in the geological record.

A glimmer of hope

Ridgewell again:

If the COP21 agreement works out even partly, then we probably won’t see 5 or 6°C. But the PETM took several thousand years, so marine and terrestrial ecosystems had thousands and thousands of generations to adapt and evolve, whereas we’re doing this on a decade-to-century scale. It’s a very, very different event in terms of rates, although you at least have a total magnitude maybe like the future.

For Zeebe the ability not only to reduce emissions, but to reverse them, is crucial.

The timescale over which ice sheets disintegrate depends on the duration of a temperature anomaly. If you warm the planet by 3 degrees [Note: that’s effectively what the COP21 Paris Agreement adds up to ] over a few decades, and then you cool it down, you can probably keep large portions of Greenland and West Antarctica. But if temperatures remain elevated, this will melt big ice sheets. And then we’re not talking just of a sea level change of 1 meter by 2100, but rises of several meters for centuries. But people tend to ignore this. The opinion seems to stop at 2100!

Want to do good at work? Here's where to find a job in the sustainability market
The COP21 agreement was a historic milestone for climate change action, with a similarly historic price tag. According to the International Energy Agency, achieving its goals will cost an estimated $16.5tn by 2030.

By comparison, when US President Barack Obama referenced “the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history” in his 2016 State of the Union address, he was referring to a comparatively tiny $90bn investment part of the 2009 Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

But while America’s prior efforts can’t compare to the scale of COP21, they do hint at its impact on the sustainability job market. From international policy and financial services to research and development, the pledge to cut local carbon emissions will affect a vast range of job sectors – and create a host of opportunities.

1. Policy

Jobs at this level vary widely. In addition to senators and directors, cabinet secretaries and Obama himself, the US COP21 delegation included a host of lawyers, economists, scientists and public relations experts. But the most represented job title was foreign affairs officer, under the US Department of State’s Bureau of Oceans, Environment and Science (OES).

Aiming to promote US foreign policy goals in areas such as climate change, renewable energy and resource scarcity, OES officers work nationally and internationally to negotiate climate policy, form partnerships and develop programs. The job requires an academic background in public policy, economics, the environment or energy, as well as several years of work experience or a master’s degree.

As countries work together on COP21’s initiatives, international policy negotiation will become even more crucial. And, as the agreement’s effects ripple around the world, negotiators, policy experts, economists, lawyers and others will be needed on the national level.

For its part, Obama’s $90bn clean energy program quickly created a host of administrative, bureaucratic and negotiating jobs. Within a year of its announcement, the Department of Energy hired 200 people just to process the grants that it disbursed. On the opposite end, states, municipalities, research labs, companies and universities scurried to hire skilled grant writers, administrators and lawyers to help them take advantage of the influx of money.

2. Renewables and construction

The sustainability job surge is enhanced by the fact that many vital sectors are already on the upswing. For example, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, 724,000 Americans were working in renewables in 2014 – a 16% increase over the previous year. Green construction is similarly energized: it grew by an estimated 15% between 2014 and 2015, with comparable growth predicted until 2018.

According to the White House, the clean energy program directly created 60,800 new jobs and 72,400 support jobs within its first quarter. By the second quarter of 2010, the program had “saved or created” between 2.5-3.6m jobs.

Green administrative support jobs aren’t far behind. After the clean energy program passed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that professional and business services accounted for 36.2% of green jobs, including work in finance, market strategies, operations and business administration.

3. Research

Several of COP21’s initiatives are designed to spur new innovations. For example, the Low Carbon Technology Partnership Initiative (LCTPI) hopes to create plans for the large scale development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. It specifically targets agriculture, forestry, energy, construction, chemistry, carbon capture and transport.

The partnership estimates that – if taken to scale – its programs could provide $5-$10tn in business opportunities between today and 2030, directly creating between 5-10m jobs per year, and indirectly providing another 15-35m jobs.

These jobs would range widely. On the research and development side, LCTPI’s plan to develop new biofuels, insulation materials, low-carbon fuels and building materials would lead to work for researchers, administrators and grant writers at research labs and academic programs around the world.

These R&D investments would create new innovations, investments, and startups – and, not incidentally, jobs for people with backgrounds in investor relations, finance, operations and market strategies.

Another intiative, the Breakthrough Energy Coalition (BEC), also hopes to transform the green energy market by focusing on electricity generation and storage, transportation, industrial use, agriculture and energy system efficiency. Launched in November by 28 billionaires, including Bill Gates, it plans to circumvent the current research structure, which it says is too rigid. Instead, it will provide seed, angel and Series A investments, leading to a quick influx of investment into R&D followed by a quick move from lab to market.

4. Global development

As part of COP21, developed countries will provide the developing world an estimated $100bn per year to help them convert to greener energy and adapt to climate change. AECOM, a US-based global engineering design firm, is already positioning itself for this by calling for CVs from climate change experts with experience in adaptation and mitigation projects.

Given AECOM’s previous work with large scale infrastructure projects like the Southern Africa Trade Hub, the Delhi sewer system and the Adapt Asia-Pacific program, it’s likely that these specialists will work in climate adaptation, resiliency planning and greenhouse gas mitigation projects for local governments and other public agencies.

It’s almost impossible to imagine the breadth of COP21’s potential economic and employment impact. But, while its scale is potentially world-transforming, its mechanism will likely be very familiar. Which means that bright days are likely on the way for people in policy and negotiation, startups and finance and R&D.

New programme to tackle deforestation in cocoa production
Chocolate is a treat that so many people in the developed world take for granted, yet cocoa bean cultivation can destroy forests thousands of miles away from the shops selling the end product. Financially, it’s tempting for smallholder cocoa farmers, unaware of the impact their actions have on a global scale, to expand their plots into forest areas.

According to the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF), deforestation and forest degradation have been identified as the causes of more than 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire global transportation sector.

REDD+, or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, provides a financial incentive to forested countries that protect their forests and stem the rate of forest loss. In Cote d’Ivoire, a three-way partnership with the government, the World Bank and Mondelez International, the world’s biggest chocolate maker, aims to eliminate deforestation linked to the country’s cocoa production by educating farmers to preserve forest areas through training carried out by Mondelez as part of its $400m Cocoa Life programme.

Mondelez executive vice-president, Hubert Weber, explains that the company became involved in the programme after calculating and assessing its own carbon footprint. The lifecycle assessment confirmed to executives the proportion caused, not through manufacture or transportation, but by land clearance associated with agricultural production of key ingredients like cocoa. That led the company to reinforce the environmental dimension of its Cocoa Life programme through which it aims to empower cocoa farmers with a combination of productivity and community development actions, says Weber. Announced at COP21, this partnership is in line with similar initiatives Mondelez is working on with the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to end deforestation linked to cocoa production in Ghana and Indonesia, he says.

Mondelez hopes that as the world’s biggest player in the chocolate market, the partnership’s innovative lead will be followed by other producers and by other countries.

Weber explains that a big part of Cote D’Ivoire’s gross domestic product (GDP) is dependent on cocoa, a fact that spurs its government on when securing future cocoa supplies. Financial incentives from the World Bank and the close partnership with Mondelez enable the country to reduce its carbon emissions while ensuring economic development in a sector dominated by smallholder farmers.

“Through Cocoa Life, we already work with more than 17,000 Ivorian farmers. We provide them good agricultural practice training so they can increase the productivity of their existing plot and their resulting income, and we also work with the cocoa communities to make them thriving, attractive environments for the next generation of farmers”, says Weber.

Mondelez will work with specialised NGOs to support forest mapping, farmer training and monitoring. Maps of land use will be based on satellite imaging, vegetation analysis and biomass measurements. And the mapping will serve as a basis for the government to develop its national strategy under REDD+.

Conversations between REDD+ partners at COP 21 in Paris in December were positive, and by mapping out and setting priorities within change programmes in countries such as Cote D’Ivoire, Weber is confident that success is achievable. “We discovered there are many commonalities,” he says.

Mondelez has noticed growing consumer interest in how its chocolate is produced, farmers’ livelihoods and what the ingredients are doing to the planet, especially with premium products such as Cote d’Or and Green & Blacks, as well as the Cadbury brands with its rich heritage in supporting cocoa origins.

Social media and the internet allow consumers to see farmer training in action and connect consumers with the reality of their day-to-day purchase.

“My biggest hope is that more people can enjoy a chocolate treat in a good way and in turn, farmers who are dependent on cocoa can live a more prosperous life that gives their children a future,” says Weber."

Climate talks UN agrees way forward - but path is unclear: A global warming pact has been struck, but now, says Nicholas Stern, nations must not only meet targets but fund clean development
Nicholas Stern
Governments took a step back from chaos yesterday in the climate change discussions in Lima and found a way forward, albeit with some fudges and compromises, giving themselves just 12 months to finalise a crucial international agreement to avoid dangerous levels of global warming.

Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, Peru's environment minister, who had skilfully presided over more than two weeks of fraught negotiations, announced that a deal had been struck by more than 190 countries. The five pages of text, dubbed the Lima Call for Climate Action, outline a way forward on hotly contested issues, including the process for countries to set out their pledges to cut annual emissions of greenhouse gases after 2020.

The aim remains the creation of an international agreement on climate change to be settled at the next UN summit, COP21, in Paris in December 2015.

Without a successful outcome in Paris it is unlikely the world can avoid a rise in global average surface temperature of more than 2C, recognised as a threshold beyond which risks of climate change are likely to become unacceptably large.

Countries will be expected by spring 2015 to announce ""intended nationally determined contributions"", including domestic targets for emissions reductions and plans to increase resilience against the impacts of climate change that cannot now be prevented.

Four years ago in Cancun, Mexico, nations recognised the dangers of warming exceeding the 2C increase and more than 100 governments gave pledges to reduce emissions, by 2020, accounting for more than 80% of the annual output of greenhouse gas pollution. Although the cuts, if delivered, would slow the rate of increase in global emissions, the Cancun targets were not ambitious enough. Nevertheless they were a significant step forward after the discussions in Copenhagen in 2009, which only produced an accord, though it did provide the basis for the Cancun agreements.

The road to Lima began in Durban, South Africa, in December 2012, when governments decided to try again to hammer out an international deal, setting themselves a three-year deadline. Now, with just 12 months left, the talks in Lima mean that there is a draft negotiating text for the Paris summit.

But there are still significant stumbling blocks. Perhaps the biggest challenge is that governments are unlikely to outline cuts in annual emissions that will be collectively consistent with a path that gives a good chance of remaining below the 2C danger limit.

So countries must focus on increasing the ambition of their intended reductions, and show these are credible by setting out how they will be achieved through domestic policies and legislation. But they must also recognise that a mechanism must also be included in the Paris agreement which commits countries to continuous reviewing and strengthening of their emissions targets.

One reason this is so difficult is the dispute over ""common but differentiated responsibility"" - which means each country's action reflecting its historical contributions to raising cumulative levels of greenhouse gases, and also its wealth.

Developing countries believe the rich countries have not shouldered a fair share of the burden and should lead by example, in cutting emissions and also providing financial support to poorer nations. In Cancun the rich countries agreed that they should provide extra funds from public and private sources to help developing countries, a sum rising from about US$10bn to $100bn a year by 2020. But the rich countries have barely kept this promise, and have largely re-labelled parts of their overseas aid budgets to achieve progress.

While the creation of the Green Climate Fund to administer parts of the funding has important symbolic value, it is in danger of distracting from the most important issue.

Over the next 15 years up to $4tn (pounds 2.5tn) a year will be invested in the emerging and developing countries for infrastructure. It is this investment that must be transformed. If it is, economic growth can be strong, cleaner, less congested, more efficient, more biodiverse - sustainable and more attractive.

If these investments lock countries into high-carbon economies with dirty growth, powered by fossil fuels, the world will not be able to reach its climate target of avoiding warming of more than two degrees.

And the developing countries will also experience greater air pollution, which already takes millions of lives each year and damages the economies of many countries, including China and Germany. All this on top of waste, inefficiencies and energy insecurity.

So while rich countries should honour the funding pledges they made in Cancun it is even more important they support and help transform the investment of that $4tn into clean, sustainable, infrastructure. The rich countries also have so much to gain domestically from such transformations.

Over the next 20 years the world has the chance to embark along a better path of economic growth that gives a much greater chance of managing climate change and overcoming poverty than the old high-carbon route. In this way, rich and developing countries can get equitable access to sustainable development, which should be the key aim that drives each country over the next 12 months on the road from Lima to Paris.

2016: the year consumers stop caring about sustainability - and business starts
2016 will be a year of distraction, fear and disruption. Around the world, a host of economic and political threats – including the refugee crisis, terrorism and teetering markets in Europe and China – will crowd headlines. In the US, the presidential election season will push fights over domestic security, guns, race and immigration to the forefront.

In the midst of this noisy climate, long term environmental destruction will get pushed to the back burner of global consciousness. For consumers, corporate responsibility will simply not continue to drive buying decisions at the same level that it has in previous years. When people feel threatened and insecure, they generally turn to shorter term thinking and deprioritize pro-social behavior.

That’s bad news for businesses whose marketers rely on sustainability claims. We’re coming off a golden era for CSR. For the past decade, consumers have become increasingly concerned about environmental threats. This has led to a massive shift in consumer spending and the direction of investment dollars. Sustainable businesses – and those who have just claimed to be sustainable – have been able to cash in, and thousands of players have come to the market.

This new, more cynical environment will test the resolve of all but the most committed sustainable businesses. If you work in a CSR department, lead a purpose-driven enterprise or are encouraging higher sustainability performance through your operations, now is a good time to ask how deeply sustainability runs in your company’s DNA. If the answer is “not very”, you might want to shore up your company’s commitments now or begin looking for another gig. Companies with weak or nascent commitments will likely put them on hold or shut them down altogether.

It doesn’t help that sustainability itself took a beating in 2015. VW’s sensational Dieselgate scandal set back public trust immeasurably. Its sustainability commitments were not only widely declared, but were rigorously tested and confirmed by federal agencies. If we can’t trust claims like these – consumers and investors will reason – how can we trust any corporate sustainability commitment? And in the absence of trust, why would anyone reward sustainable behavior?

Even 2015’s biggest bright spot, the Paris COP21 agreements, poses a threat to consumer concern about corporate sustainability. In an effort to generate hope and commitment, governments, journalists and NGOs declared the talks a major victory against climate change. While it is possible that the news from Paris will generate deeper public support for carbon reductions and personal responsibility, this type of progress can have unintended, negative consequences. Hearing vague pronouncements about how major progress has been made, consumers often decrease their concern and commitment, reasoning that everything will be ok regardless of what they do.

This has certainly been shown to be the case with recycling. Researchers have shown that the presence of recycling receptacles actually encourages people to waste. Believing that trash will find a new life, people consider the problem solved and reduce their vigilance.

With a dropoff in positive feedback, direct from the market, corporate sustainability commitments will be much harder to justify in the short term, especially if – as many have predicted – the global economy slows down. The sustainability bandwagon that’s been building for the last decade will begin to fall apart.

Of course, the fundamental advantages of sustainable business operations will remain. The truly committed will continue to reap the benefits of lower resource use, higher employee engagement and health, a drive for operational excellence, and less exposure to risk as carbon becomes more expensive. As businesses that were faking it to begin with leave the scene, the space will become less crowded and more authentic. Only the leaders and innovators will be left standing.

Admittedly, it won’t feel that safe to remain somewhat alone in the field, but saving the future has never been about playing it safe.

2016 may be a year dominated by Donald Trump, Isis and pessimistic pundits. But the future of business still belongs to those able to see and build for the long term. The best businesses will ride this one out and emerge stronger on the other side."

Arnold Schwarzenegger says climate campaigns need to focus on 'right now' not 2050
Green campaigners should stop talking about the risks from climate change in 2050 and talk about right now, the former governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has said.

It drives me crazy when people talk about 30 years from now, rising sea levels and so on, he told the Guardian in an interview at the Paris COP21 climate conference. What about right now? Thousands of people are dying from pollution. People are living with cancer [because of air pollution].

He said campaigners should focus on the immediate effects of polluting the environment, because that resonates with the public in a way that distant visions of future harms do not. Most people find it hard to imagine the world in 2050 or 2100, the dates that are being discussed at the Paris conference for a long-term goal on climate action, he said.

There are people stuck in cancer wards now, tubes sticking out of them - 7 million people die a year because of pollution, he said. We should be talking about that.

Stuff that happens in the future does not mean anything to people, he said.

He cited an advertising campaign in California that showed small children sucking air through an inhaler, because of the damage done to their respiratory systems by breathing polluted air. People saw this commercial, what we are doing to our kids, and thought we have to protect our environment.

Polls found that the ads were effective in persuading people of the need for new regulations, he said. All of a sudden, the poll numbers changed.

My job is to get the message out there, he added. If you do not have people behind you, you cant do anything [on legislation]. Global warming is an extremely important issue, the most important issue. You have to communicate it properly. You have to communicate to people that this is right now.

At the Paris climate change conference, entering its second and final week, governments are hoping to forge a new global agreement on limiting emissions that would kick in from 2020, when current commitments run out. A new draft text of an agreement was published on Saturday, and is now under scrutiny by the 195 governments gathered in France.

Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and internationally known as a star in films such as Terminator, was a strong proponent of action on air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while in office. His successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, joined him in Paris in calling for action on emissions. The Paris conference is the biggest leap forward in dealing with climate change. France has been instrumental in advancing this agenda, he told the Guardian.

Schwarzenegger said such joint efforts from both sides of the US political divide were essential to making progress on environmental problems. I never paid much attention to [political] parties, he said. This is a peoples issue, not a party issue.

He said that sub-national authorities, such as state governors and assemblies in the US, and regional and city governments, could play an important role in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, by taking their own initiatives independently of national governments.

It is good that this is now being recognised, he said. Its about [emphasising] efficiency, and alternatives [to fossil fuels].

California under successive administrations has brought forward a series of measures on air pollution and greenhouse gases, including a pioneering regional cap-and-trade system for carbon. Republicans in the Senate recently opposed Barack Obamas historic Clean Power Plan to cut nationwide emissions from power plants, and Republican states have filed lawsuits against the regulations.

In Paris, a group of Republican politicians from the US has been seeking meetings with the chief officials of leading developed and developing nations. They broadly oppose an international deal on climate change, while the Obama administration has pushed strongly for an ambitious deal in Paris.

A group of 10 Democratic senators also attended the talks at the weekend, pledging to help President Obama attain his environmental goals."

Eco-geeks hold open source alternative to UN climate talks
This December world leaders convene in Paris for COP21, their 21st attempt at curbing global climate change.

Divided by borders, assembled in hierarchies and motivated by the kind of competitive ideology shared by the neoliberal business class, this meeting embodies the self-interested conventions of the old world. Unsurprisingly, the context has resulted in a failure of shameful proportions.

“For the 21st time, we don’t expect much,” says Dominic Wind, core organiser of POC21, a grassroots alternative to COP21 taking place near Paris. “Over the last 20 years, carbon dioxide emissions have doubled. Our trust in this institution is gone.”

In reaction to the failure of COP21, POC21 has brought together a network of 100 plus designers, makers and eco-geeks to innovate a new breed of sustainable lifestyle products. In the unusual setting of an ancient French castle, 12 selected projects have spent the last five weeks developing portable solar power systems, low-waste self-filtering showers, upcycled wind turbines, urban food production systems, affordable electric bicycles and human-powered agricultural machines.

“We need the tools to create different buying and consumption patterns,” Wind continues. “Tools that are less destructive and more sustainable. Then we [will] form global communities around these tools, bringing people together to amplify their impact, exchange what works best and speed up the process of adoption.”

The new ideas

One of the participants at the alternative gathering, Daniel Connell, the New Zealand-born founder of a project to build a wind turbine for $30 (?20), is among those sceptical about the UN talks in Paris in December.

“The COP21 talks will not result in anything. If you hope they will, that hope is a negative thing. In having hope you are still engaging with governments, and in so doing wasting time that can be spent on actual solutions.”

Using an old bike wheel, disused printing plates and a couple of waste electric motors, one of Daniel’s small turbines can meet 25% of the power needs of an average suburban home. With accessible parts, basic skills and a little time, the project is making it feasible to step away from the fossil-fuelled power grid.

Another developer, Jason Selvarajan from Finland, has invented Showerloop, a system that cleans water as the water cleans you. As well as limiting water waste, it saves on significant amounts of energy needed to heat boiler systems.

Meanwhile, in a newly erected co-working space inside the castle, Peruvian Mauricio Cordova tirelessly churns out prototypes for Fair Cap, a 3D printable bottle cap that makes bacteria-filled water drinkable.

No more patents

A pivotal element weaving the POC21 projects together is the importance of open source, a methodology for collaboratively developing anything from software platforms to houses. Open source requires that the technical makeup of a project be shared, changed and improved by anyone who cares to participate, shunning patents and other legal restrictions to harness the combined creativity of the internet connected world.

POC21 has created a space where this solution-based concept can be applied to the most pivotal crisis of our age: climate change. It is both an incubator for a new sustainable tech infrastructure that can help us disrupt our carbon outputs and a symbol of citizens evolving towards taking the future into their own hands.

“We’re creating waves here that will become a growth spurt for the open source hardware movement,” says Milena Sonneveld, Belgian co-founder of the Velo M2 modular cargo bike project.

Indeed, POC21’s message has already begun to resonate. French, German, Belgian, Italian, Brazillian and US participants have all congregated here, mostly unpaid, to work tirelessly at bringing this vision to life. The media, seemingly hungry for a new narrative on climate issues, has been knocking at the gates. Rumours circle that certain heads of state are even keen to speak with the community here.

Bound together with the optimism and quiet courage to try something different, could this new network indicate the beginning of a people-powered movement we so desperately need? Last week, a final exhibition at the chateau invited the public to decide for themselves. In true, open source fashion, attendees were invited to observe, play with and perhaps adopt the tools created here into their own lives."

Energy minister under fire for hiring jet to fly back from climate change deal
Severin Carrell, Scotland correspondent
Climate campaigners have rounded on the energy minister, Matthew Hancock, for hiring a private jet to fly himself back to London after signing a deal with the Mexican president in Aberdeen to help combat climate change.

The Guardian has established that Hancock, the Tory MP for West Suffolk, chartered an aircraft after meeting Enrique Pena Nieto in Aberdeen on 5 March during the president’s official visit to the UK.

The memorandum of understanding they signed focused heavily on the UK’s commitment with Mexico to press for an “ambitious, equitable, comprehensive and legally binding global agreement” at the climate talks in Paris in December.

Whitehall sources said that Hancock persuaded two Foreign Office diplomats to share the 100-minute flight back to London to help cover the costs, even though there were 16 scheduled services from Aberdeen to four London airports that day.

Ollie Haynes, an energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: “A minister in any government department should know better than to use taxpayers’ money to charter a private jet when a scheduled flight is available.

“But in this case, the minister is from the climate change department and has used a private jet to fly back from doing an oil deal. You couldn’t make it up.”

Alison Johnstone, a Scottish Green party MSP, said it was perverse for an energy minister to hire their own jet after signing such a deal.

“It shows flagrant disregard for the public purse,” she said. “It’s also deeply ironic that a minister from the department with responsibilities for climate change uses one of the most polluting forms of transport to attend a meeting aimed at encouraging the extraction of fossil fuels.”

Hancock was in Aberdeen with the Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael, on the final day of President Pena Nieto’s official visit to the UK, to sign a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Mexico which placed heavy stress on tackling climate change and promoting safe energy cooperation.

The agreement updated a 2011 deal between the two countries “to work together on sustainable and low carbon development. It reaffirms the progressive stance of both countries and our shared aim to reach an ambitious, equitable, comprehensive and legally binding global agreement at the COP21 climate negotiations in Paris in December”.

The memo also spoke of ensuring “environmental protection in both countries” in an ambitious deal to increase cooperation and collaboration on oil extraction. That included a $1bn (?674m) line of credit for British oil firms operating in or exporting to Mexico.

Hancock, who holds a dual ministerial role at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and is fighting to retain his seat at the election, was one of 100 Tory MPs who signed an open letter opposing continuing subsides for onshore wind farms in England.

A vocal critic of windfarms in his constituency and a supporter of fracking, Hancock also welcomed a Tory election pledge last year to end state support for the sector.

Related: UK's new energy and environment ministers opposed green energy

The Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Foreign Office confirmed that only three people from the UK delegation took the private flight. Carmichael is thought to have had other appointments in the area and stayed in Aberdeen.

They insisted it was in line with UK government policy and the ministerial code, but refused to disclose how much the flight cost, what type of aircraft was hired and why the flight was authorised.

A DECC spokesman said Hancock was too busy to take any of the scheduled flights. Aberdeen airport confirmed the commercial services that day went to Heathrow, Gatwick, London City airport and London Luton.

“The minister was in Aberdeen helping to secure an agreement worth millions of pounds to the economy. He got a chartered flight together with senior diplomatic officials for the return journey, to fit around diary commitments,” the DECC spokesman said."

Earth Day: scientists say 75% of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in ground
Three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground if humanity is to avoid the worst effects of climate change, a group of leading scientists and economists have said in a statement timed to coincide with Earth Day.

The Earth League, which includes Nicholas Stern, the author of several influential reports on the economics of climate change; Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate scientist and adviser to Angela Merkel; and the US economist Jeffrey Sachs, urged world leaders to follow up on their commitments to avoid dangerous global warming.

Spelling out what a global deal at the UN climate summit in Paris later this year should include, the group demanded governments adopt a goal of reducing economies’ carbon emissions to zero by mid-century, put a price on carbon and that the richest take the lead with the most aggressive cuts.

In its “Earth statement”, the group said that three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserves must be left in the ground if warming was not to breach a rise of 2C, the “safety limit” agreed to by governments.

Johan Rockstrom, the statement’s lead author, said: “From a scientific perspective, 2015 is a decisive moment. The window to navigate ourselves free from a ‘beyond 2C future’ is barely open. It’s the last chance to navigate ourselves towards a desired future.

“It’s so frustrating, because it’s the choice of moving down a business-as-usual route with devastating outcomes for humanity and, at the same time, we have this almost unprecedented opportunity, we can transform the world economy to a fossil fuel-free one and moreover do it in a way that is security and health-wise more attractive.”

The statement says that failure by the world to act on climate change would bring is a one in 10 chance of temperatures rising by more than 6C by 2100, a level of risk that would be comparable with accepting 10,000 plane crashes daily worldwide.

Rockstrom said there was now enough scientific evidence that the world was approaching irreversible tipping points where the Earth’s system begins to accelerate the warming that man has already caused. Methane being released as permafrost thaws and melting ice meaning less solar energy reflected back into space are two examples.

“That’s the scientific nightmare,” Rockstrom said. “You don’t want the Earth to go from friend to foe … this could happen quite soon; we need to bend the curve on emissions over the next 10 to 15 years.”

He admitted, however, that there was a significant gap between the group’s demands and what might be achieved at the Paris conference, COP21, with several significant players already playing down expectations. “We’re not at all where we need to be,” Rockstrom said.

Sachs said: “COP21 is the moment of truth, the last chance to stay within the 2C upper limit.”

The statement called for developed countries to help scale up financial aid for developing countries to deal with climate change, and for Paris to agree the beginnings of a strategy to make countries more resilient to the extreme weather a warming world is expected to bring.

Brian Hoskins, one of the Earth statement signatories and the director of the Grantham institute for climate change at Imperial College London, said that given the importance of the Paris summit, the attention given to climate change in the UK general election campaign was “pathetic” and “extremely disappointing”.

“The contrast between the importance of this year and our election is just stark,” he said. “It seems we go towards the lowest common denominator in such a discussion of this, instead of stepping back and saying what do we want, what is our vision for the country, what is our vision for the world, we’re saying, are we going to get a pack of butter for 20p rather than 30p? It’s a shopping list rather than a vision.”

This year’s Earth Day was marked by Barack Obama in his weekly video address. He said he would be visiting the Florida Everglades on Wednesday to see how the environment is at risk from rising sea levels there: “Climate change can no longer be denied or ignored,” he said."

Climate change has exacerbated poverty in Nigeria
By 2050, Nigeria will be the third most populous nation in the world but much of its largest city, Lagos, and 75% of the oil-producing Niger Delta could be underwater. Despite this, climate change has not been high on the agenda until recently. But with President Buhari pledging to tackle climate change in his inaugural speech in May, it’s clear that Africa’s largest economy is taking this threat to its development seriously. This fact is underscored by the appointment of former Special Advisor to the UN Secretary General on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Amina Mohammed as Minister for Environment.

Two weeks after her appointment, and with Nigeria’s climate pledge (known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs) approved, Mohammed will take centre stage at the Cop21 UN climate change conference in Paris.

Branded a “climate warrior” by Vogue magazine this week, Mohammed firmly believes that climate change and development are inextricably interlinked. She grew up in the Lake Chad region and has witnessed the devastating cycle of climate impacts, economic decline and rising insecurity first-hand. Prolonged drought in the region has deprived 11 million Nigerians of secure livelihoods, and contributed to political and economic instability – which Boko Haram has been able to exploit. By mid-century, climate change could cost Nigeria between six and 30% of its GDP. Mohammed managed Nigeria’s ?660m millennium development goals (MDGs) debt relief fund, coordinating a range of poverty reduction initiatives. Alongside this, she was a key player in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda for financing sustainable development. So how will this experience translate into practice in Mohammed’s new role?

Three themes from her background play loud and clear and may well guide her agenda.

Real change for real people

Leaving no one behind and ensuring a life of dignity for all has been the clarion call made by Mohammed for people and planet. She stresses that action on climate change means safeguarding the lives of the poor, especially women, and working to pull people out of poverty: “If we don’t deal with climate change, we can’t achieve the global goals for poverty and inequality.” This is reflected in Nigeria’s climate pledge. Some 30% of the population lives on less than ?1 a day and more than 50% of people have no access to electricity. On top of that, for the past four decades the Nigerian economy has depended on proceeds from the sales of crude oil, but falling oil prices have slashed export revenues.

President Buhari has placed the need for rapid economic diversification high on the agenda. The INDC focuses on the delivery of direct development benefits and sustainable economic growth, including decentralised energy generation, climate smart agriculture, improved freight infrastructure and the development of robust urban transit systems for 50% of Nigeria’s population living in cities. However, achieving energy access for all is stressed as a pledge conditional on increased international support.

Strengthen international partnerships

While Nigeria has pledged a robust 20% unconditional emissions reduction, Mohammed is keen to stress that for the 45% conditional reductions to be achieved, Nigeria needs to strengthen international partnerships, including those in business. Achieving a strong climate deal for developing countries in Paris will therefore be high on her agenda but Mohammed is also keen to stress that raising the funds will require a combination of national, regional and international partnerships including business. Nigeria will need to assess how it can best create the right incentives and leveraging mechanisms to make the most of funds on offer.

From policy to action

Mohammed’s experience translating policy into action is vital. With a suite of climate change policies already in place in Nigeria, concrete delivery plans are needed to put these into action. However, this must be done in the context of a national plan that ensures a coordinated and coherent approach to the country’s development. Strengthening the links between climate action and the achievement of the SDGs in national plans and implementation strategies will be key to success. Strengthening the partnerships between government, business and civil society in practice, will require radical change. Nigeria could take the lead from strong subnational governments in other countries with federal systems, such as India, Australia and the US, which have resulted in innovation, leadership and local ownership.

With a meaningful climate deal on the horizon in Paris, Mohammed is committed to securing a robust deal for Nigeria; one that will deliver both emissions reduction and ultimately see the end to poverty."

Ed Miliband pushes for zero carbon emissions target following COP21
Ed Miliband has vowed to use the landmark international agreement on climate change to push the British government into being the first in the world to put a zero carbon emissions target into law.

The former Labour leader said a global agreement on achieving zero emissions by the end of the century would make it logical for Britain to put its own commitment on the statute books.

Miliband, who will lead a cross-party campaign on the issue in the new year, added that the agreements in Paris would strengthen the hand of those who want more action from David Cameron’s government and “will weaken those who say Britain should hang back” on investing in green energy.

He said: “At the moment we have an 80% reduction in domestic emissions by 2050. This international agreement establishes that the world trades in zero emissions by the second half of the century.

“The logical thing is also to commit to zero emissions domestically, and what I have suggested on a cross-party basis is to get the climate change committee to advise us on the date. It is the new long-term goal for the UK and we will, I think, be the first country to put it into law. I will now come back in the new year with my campaign.”

Miliband, who was lauded in 2009 when he was energy secretary for rescuing something from a poor summit in Copenhagen, said the details of the agreement unveiled this weekend should be a source of optimism. However, he called for the UK to now back up its drive for setting ambitious international targets on emissions with more resolve on the domestic front.

Cameron’s government has been criticised for a whole raft of recent policy decisions, including cuts to subsidies for renewable energy that have left many businesses in that sector bereft. Just 5.1% of energy used in the UK is renewable, according to figures produced by the EU statistical office.

Miliband said Britain needed to show the way forward and match “high ambitions abroad, with high ambitions at home”. He said: “I think the biggest weakness to the Paris agreement is the commitment to keeping global temperature increases below 1.5 degrees – the national pledges don’t yet add up to that.

“The anxiety around the green groups and others will be to ensure that reality ends up matching the rhetoric. I do think the 1.5-degree commitment is important and governments have set themselves a standard that they will be held to account for, and that is true for the government in the UK and elsewhere.

“I think that is a really important tool in the arsenal for those people who want to push for further activity. I think it will strengthen those who say that we need to up our ambition and I think it will strengthen the business voices as well that wanted certainty on a global level and are now arguing for it on a domestic level. There has been uncertainty and drift.”

Miliband said that, while it was difficult to link climate change to flooding events, such as those being endured by Cumbria in recent days, it was clear that there would be more such problems in the future without action. But he added that the environmental impact was not the sole reason for greater resolve by Cameron’s administration in backing renewable energy.

He said: “It is important not just to avoid disaster, although of course we do need to do it for that reason, but it is also to do with jobs. That is what the government is doing wrong. They think it is good for the economy or it is good for the environment and you can’t have both. But actually the truth is the opposite.”"

World artists call on climate negotiators to reach 'ambitious' deal in Paris
Bjork, David Bowie and a host of musicians, actors, artists, novelists and leading figures in the creative industries have called on negotiators at next week’s climate summit in Paris to reach a deal that staves off dangerous global warming.

The letter to the French foreign minister and the UN climate chief in charge of the talks is signed by a selection of A-listers from the British cultural scene, including actors Steve Coogan and Emma Thompson, musicians Damon Albarn and Guy Garvey, and writers Ian McEwan and Philip Pullman.



The heads of national institutions such as the Royal Opera House, the Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre, along with the chiefs of Bafta and UK Music, are among more than 300 people who have signed the letter asking governments to ensure the Paris deal is “ambitious” and “inspiring.”

Nearly 150 world leaders including Barack Obama, Xi Jinping and David Cameron will arrive in Paris on Monday for the UN climate summit, billed as one of the largest diplomatic conferences ever organised.

More than 170 countries have submitted plans to curb carbon emissions in advance of the COP21 conference, which is designed to produce a binding deal on emissions beyond 2020 and financing for poorer countries to deal with climate change.

The creative industry’s letter to Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister who will be president of the talks, reads: “We are deeply concerned that our global economic and industrial systems are accelerating rates of extinction, desertification and soil depletion, degrading ecosystems, acidifying and littering our rivers and oceans, and resulting in a relentless rise in greenhouse gas emissions driving irreversible climate change.

“In short, we are overwhelming the planet’s life support systems.”

The signatories say that Paris offers an “historic opportunity” and any agreement reached must be binding and keep future temperature rises below 2C, considered the threshold after which dangerous global warming takes hold.

“We will come together and intensify our efforts, but we need you to give us confidence in a sustainable future, to share our ambition, and recognize our capacity to strengthen your leadership,” they write.

Alison Tickell, who coordinated the letter and runs Julie’s Bicycle, a charity advising the arts on sustainability, admitted that some interventions on global warming by the creative industry in the past had been crass but the sector could play a key role in tackling climate change.

“The success of COP21 is not just politics, it’s also about civil society. Climate change is not just about politics, economics or science, but about culture. The arts can move us in a way that science just can’t.” Artists and cultural figures also had much greater “reach” with the public, she added.

Kevin Price, chief operating officer at Bafta, said that the TV and film industries were cutting their own carbon emissions and what he called the “real sense of waste”, from the way A-listers are treated to the amount of energy consumed for lighting.

But he said that perhaps the biggest role it could play was in the shows and films it produced: “The potential for our industry to play a role in emissions reduction is profound.”

British business groups warned on Thursday that the UK was risking its leadership at Paris with its actions at home, such as George Osborne breaking a manifesto promise this week by cancelling a ?1bn carbon and capture storage competition.

“Unexpected decisions like this and a slackening off on domestic energy efficiency policy do not fill one with confidence that the UK’s increasingly ambitious climate change targets are entirely backed up with the will and means to succeed,” said Claire Jakobsson, head of climate and environment policy at EEF, the manufacturers’ organisation.

Separately, 39 French companies including EDF, Total and Orange pledged yesterday to spend €45bn over the next five years on renewable energy and other low carbon technologies."

Global panic: art show Exit brings climate change to shocking life
There are more than 19.5 million refugees worldwide, cities are emitting 70% of all greenhouses gases and around 3,500 languages are currently in danger of extinction.

The statistics around the climate change debate may make for increasingly stark reading, but they suffer from one major drawback: that we, as humans, find it difficult to relate to data – no matter how shocking the numbers.

This issue is central to a new exhibition, Exit, being staged at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. A vast 360-degree video installation, with viewers seated in the middle, Exit will bring to life – through a number of animated maps, visuals and text – all the data that shows the extent of the human and ecological cost of climate change.

The show’s curator, Herve Chandes, says Exit offers a “new aesthetic for how we can relate to the the destruction of our own planet”.

The staging of Exit will tie in with the COP21 United Nations climate change conference taking place in Paris, which will see world leaders gather in a bid to create an agreement on global warming. By placing the installation within this context, Chandes says, makes it a “call to action”.

Chandes, director of the Fondation Cartier contemporary art museum in Paris, originally commissioned the installation in 2008, at a point when human migration began to take place on an unprecedented scale. The idea was born from a single question posed by the cultural theorist Paul Virilio: “What is left of this world, of our native land, of the history of what so far is the only habitable planet?”

The Fondation brought in New York design studio Diller Scofidio + Renfro to work with climate change scientists, including Franc?ois Gemenne, to create a work that spanned the disciplines of science and art to bring to life the current state of planet Earth.

The installation shows that, in the years between 2008 and 2015, the global population grew by a billion and the number of refugees increased fivefold.

Elizabeth Diller, director of the design studio that brought the data to life through geocoding, says: “We wanted to tell poignant stories of the drama of uprooting people from their homes without resorting to narrative media, whose familiarity and realism is often desensitising. So we challenged ourselves to use only data – the driest and most abstract information – to create a strong, palpable effect.”

The 45-minute installation displays the stark reality of population shifts and city growth, the global spread of political refugees and forced migration, rising sea levels, natural disasters, deforestation and the death of languages – all drawn from more than 100 different sources of scientific and ecological data.

“An alchemical result can come from combining the objectivity of science and the interpretive potential of art that can touch an unsuspecting audience,” added Diller. “The work makes no judgments – it simply allows data to speak for itself.”

Climate change scientist Gemenne, who has consulted on the project since 2007, says that updating Exit has been a “devastating exercise”.

“The situation, on all six of the maps, has deteriorated since 2008,” he says. “What I hope this show emphasises is the humanity – that we are all connected and that this is not a distant threat that only affects some of us. We are all already in the middle of this catastrophe.”

Gemenne says he was most shocked by the part of the installation that engages with the numbers of internally displaced people.

“Everyone knows these numbers and usually migration flows are displayed using arrows on maps, as if it was a kind of invasion,” he says. “But here you see each person – and seeing people rather than arrows is extremely shocking and makes you realise the magnitude of the tragedy that is unfolding.”

Gemenne says he sees Exit as a “planetarium of the Anthropocene” – referring to the epoch when human activity started to have a significant global impact on Earth’s ecosystems.

“One of the key problems of climate change discussions today is that people cannot directly relate to them,” he explains. “They know that half of the world’s languages are [becoming] extinct or that there are going to be millions of refugees. But they generally don’t impact on their daily lives and they cannot experience them; the time scale of planetary change does not match the human experience.”

Gemenne hopes that Exit will be a “reality check” for those attending the climate change conference, and will highlight in particular the human cost of global warming, which “is so often neglected”.

“Typically in these kinds of climate change conferences, very often the negotiations seem disconnected from the realities,” he says. “They negotiate tons of CO2 emissions and billions of dollars of funding without realising what that means for people. Exit demonstrates to the negotiators what they are really negotiating about – and the human cost at stake.”

• Exit is at Palais de Tokyo, Paris, until 10 January 2016. Admission is free."

Thomas Piketty calls for investors to divest from fossil fuels ahead of climate talks
Thomas Piketty has called for investors to move their money out of fossil fuels ahead of landmark UN climate change talks.

The French economist, along with ‘ecological economist’ Tim Jackson, authors of the respective bestselling books Capital in the Twenty-First Century and Prosperity Without Growth: economics for a finite planet, said that investors should divest from a sector with a business model “at odds with physical realities”.

In a letter to the Guardian, they wrote: “This is a rare and decisive moment in history. Science, ethics, and economics are intersecting to form a clear market signal: in the lead up to the COP21 climate talks, responsible investors should divest from fossil fuels.”

COP21 is a landmark UN summit in Paris opening at the end of November, where nearly 200 countries will attempt to reach a deal on limiting greenhouse gas emissions post-2020.

The economists warned that public wellbeing was at risk from continued investment in oil, coal and gas companies whose products are driving global warming.

“Set against a backdrop of record-breaking climatic extremes and weather events, capital continues to flow into the exploration and future extraction of dirty energy. Those investments are wagers on a future in which vast potentials of carbon reserves are available to be processed – a bet against the public’s wellbeing.”

In the letter Piketty and Jackson cite the growth of a global divestment movement which has now persuaded more than 400 institutions and 2,000 individuals worth $2.6tn to divest from oil, coal and gas companies.

They add: “At a time when the fossil fuel industry should be shifting their businesses to focus on renewable energy they are doing the opposite, doubling down on coal, oil and gas... Meanwhile, clean, carbon-free energy is rapidly becoming cost-competitive with dirty energy. These recent political and market shifts are all being driven forward by a dramatic shift in the social zeitgeist. Climate change is now a primary social concern.”

The letter comes one week after Piketty, professor at the Paris School of Economics and the London School of Economics, published a proposal calling for the introduction of a tax on business flights to raise funds for countries suffering the impacts of climate change such as drought, sea level rise and flooding.

Fossil fuel divestment campaigners have previously won vocal support from the Nobel prizewinning economist Joseph Stiglitz and the UN, although other investors such as Bill Gates have criticised the movement as propounding an ineffective “false solution”."

The Paris Agreement on Climate Change Is Official. Now What?
By KEITH BRADSHERNOV. 3, 2016

PARIS — When the landmark Paris Agreement to address climate change officially goes into effect on Friday, the Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe will be floodlit green to celebrate the occasion. Now comes the hard work: figuring out the details.

Top energy policy makers and corporate leaders caution that it will be challenging to meet even the deal’s modest goals to reduce planet-warming emissions of greenhouse gases.

Many companies have not even figured out yet how much greenhouse gas they emit, much less made plans to curb these emissions. Rapid technological advances in areas like electric cars are not enough to stop the world’s long climb in oil consumption, let alone reverse it.

The financial framework, namely a carbon price or tax that would force industries to pay for the pollution they spew, has barely started to emerge. And while tens of billions of dollars of green bonds have been issued to finance environmental projects, these are a pittance compared to the sums required to make a difference.


“It’s not a question of billions, it’s a question of trillions,” said Ángel Gurría, the secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, speaking on Thursday at The New York Times Energy For Tomorrow conference in Paris.

The Paris Agreement, reached in December among 195 countries, was never imagined as the silver bullet for global warming. Rather, the goal of the agreement was to stave off the most devastating effects of climate change by limiting the increase in global temperatures to two degrees Celsius, and to just 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible.

But even that may prove problematic. If every country fully accomplishes its initial pledges, the increase would be closer to 2.7 degrees, according Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, which is based in Paris. (In the next several years, countries are supposed to set additional goals for deeper reductions.)

Nor have all the countries actually ratified the Paris Agreement. Ségolène Royal, France’s minister for ecology, sustainable development and energy, announced at the conference on Thursday morning that 94 countries that had signed the agreement had ratified it, representing 66 percent of global emissions.



From a market perspective, many companies do not yet have a strong financial imperative to make sweeping changes to address climate change.

Fledgling exchanges for trading carbon emissions rights have attracted limited interest. And the prices on those markets are well below the $100 a ton or more that experts say would force companies to limit their emissions of greenhouse gases.

The world needs “a big, fat price on carbon,” Mr. Gurría said at the conference.

The market for carbon emissions has actually weakened in the months since the deal was approved. “It has gone from $9 after the agreement to $6 — it shows us the market impact of the Paris Agreement has not been as strong as we all think,” Mr. Birol said.

The scope of the issue continues to expand.

Worldwide petrochemical consumption is doubling every 10 years. Aviation fuel consumption has surged as hundreds of millions of people in China and other advanced developing countries have become able to afford air tickets. And sales of fuel-guzzling trucks have soared in developing countries.

Ben van Beurden, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference that he thought worldwide demand for oil in the transportation industry, as well as worldwide demand for oil over all, would not peak until the 2030s.

Technological advances by themselves may not slow the surge in the world’s oil consumption.

Electric car sales, for example, have taken off globally, increasing elevenfold in the last five years. But they still represent a little less than 1 percent of all cars sold.

Some automotive experts have predicted a rapid embrace of electric cars in the next decade, as governments and automakers set ambitious targets for sales. If plug-in hybrids are included, more than 20 electric car models are already on the market.


But it is unclear how powerful a force they will be in fighting climate change.

If half the cars sold worldwide were electric starting next year and continuing for the next 20 years, worldwide oil demand would keep rising, Mr. Birol said at the conference, citing an analysis that his agency plans to release on Nov. 16. The problem is that trucks, aviation and petrochemical production are now the main drivers of the growth in oil consumption.

Patrick Pouyanné, the chairman and chief executive of Total, the French oil and gas giant, predicted that electric cars would not represent more than a third of sales until 2025 and would not represent a third of all cars on the road until a decade later. That will be too late and too little to make a big difference in global oil consumption, he said.

Even so, automakers view electric as crucial to their future profits. They are convinced that regulators will keep loading more rules onto gasoline- and diesel-powered cars.

“If you don’t have 20 percent-plus of your sales in electric cars, you’re not going to make it,” said Carlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive of Nissan and Renault and the chairman of Mitsubishi Motors.

There are other forces at work, too. A common refrain among many executives these days is that they are feeling more social pressure to address global warming — sometimes from within their own families.

Mr. van Beurden of Shell said that a year ago he found his 9-year-old daughter inconsolable, and initially thought it was because he and his wife were leaving the children for a short excursion. But when he spoke to his daughter, he learned that her teacher had talked about dire risks from climate change, blamed oil companies for causing it and suggested that the answer was giving money to Greenpeace.

He said he reassured his daughter that global warming would be addressed and that he would help in the struggle. “She said, ‘Of course, I trust you,’” Mr. van Beurden said, adding, “and in that sense she is different from the rest of society.”"

THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING
Capitalism vs. the Climate
ByÊNaomi Klein
566 pp. Simon & Schuster. $30.
""Every inhabitant of this planet must contemplate the day when this planet may no longer be habitable."" Thus spoke President Kennedy in a 1961 address to the United Nations. The threat he warned of was not climate chaos -- barely a blip on anybody's radar at the time -- but the hydrogen bomb. The nuclear threat had a volatile urgency and visual clarity that the sprawling, hydra-headed menace of today's climate calamity cannot match. How can we rouse citizens and governments to act for concerted change? Will it take, asÊNaomi KleinÊinsists, nothing less than a Marshall Plan for Earth?
""This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate"" is a book of such ambition and consequence that it is almost unreviewable. Klein's fans will recognize her method from her prior books, ""No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies"" (1999) and ""The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism"" (2007), which, with her latest, form an antiglobalization trilogy. Her strategy is to take a scourge -- brand-driven hyperconsumption, corporate exploitation of disaster-struck communities, or ""the fiction of perpetual growth on a finite planet"" -- trace its origins, then chart a course of liberation. In each book she arrives at some semihopeful place, where activists are reaffirming embattled civic values.
To call ""This Changes Everything"" environmental is to limit Klein's considerable agenda. ""There is still time to avoid catastrophic warming,"" she contends, ""but not within the rules of capitalism as they are currently constructed. Which is surely the best argument there has ever been for changing those rules."" On the green left, many share Klein's sentiments. George Monbiot, a columnist for The Guardian, recently lamented that even though ""the claims of market fundamentalism have been disproven as dramatically as those of state communism, somehow this zombie ideology staggers on."" Klein, Monbiot andÊBill McKibbenÊall insist that we cannot avert the ecological disaster that confronts us without loosening the grip of that superannuated zombie ideology.
That philosophy -- neoliberalism -- promotes a high-consumption, carbon-hungry system. Neoliberalism has encouraged mega-mergers, trade agreements hostile to environmental and labor regulations, and global hypermobility, enabling a corporation like Exxon to make, as McKibben has noted, ""more money last year than any company in the history of money."" Their outsize power mangles the democratic process. Yet the carbon giants continue to reap $600 billion in annual subsidies from public coffers, not to speak of a greater subsidy: the right, in Klein's words, to treat the atmosphere as a ""waste dump.""
So much for the invisible hand. As the science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson observed, when it comes to the environment, the invisible hand never picks up the check.
Klein diagnoses impressively what hasn't worked. No more claptrap about fracked gas as a bridge to renewables. Enough already of the international summit meetings that produce sirocco-quality hot air, and nonbinding agreements that bind us all to more emissions. Klein dismantles the boondoggle that is cap and trade. She skewers grandiose command-and-control schemes to re-engineer the planet's climate. No point, when a hubristic mind-set has gotten us into this mess, to pile on further hubris. She reserves a special scorn for the partnerships between Big Green organizations and Immense Carbon, peddled as win-win for everyone, but which haven't slowed emissions. Such partnerships remind us that when the lamb and the lion lie down together, only one of them gets eaten.
In democracies driven by lobbyists, donors and plutocrats, the giant polluters are going to win while the rest of us, in various degrees of passivity and complicity, will watch the planet die. ""Any attempt to rise to the climate challenge will be fruitless unless it is understood as part of a much broader battle of worldviews,"" Klein writes. ""Our economic system and our planetary system are now at war.""
Klein reminds us that neoliberalism was once an upstart counterrevolution. Through an epic case of bad timing, the Reagan-Thatcher revolution, the rise of the anti-regulatory World Trade Organization, and the cult of privatizing and globalizing everything coincided with the rising public authority of climate science. In 1988,ÊJames Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute, delivered historic testimony at Congressional hearings, declaring that the science was 99 percent unequivocal: The world was warming and we needed to act collectively to reduce emissions. Just one year earlier,ÊMargaret ThatcherÊfamously declared: ""There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families."" In the battle since, between a collective strategy for forging an inhabitable long-term future and the antisocial, hyper-corporatized, hyper-carbonized pursuit of short-term growth at any cost, well, there has been only one clear winner.
But counterrevolutions are reversible. Klein devotes much of her book to propitious signs that this can happen -- indeed is happening. The globalÊclimateÊjusticeÊmovement is spreading. Since the mid-1990s, environmental protests have been growing in China at 29 percent per year. Where national leaders have faltered, local governments are forging ahead. Hundreds of German cities and towns have voted to buy back their energy grids from corporations. About two-thirds of Britons favor renationalizing energy and rail.
The divestment movement against Big Carbon is gathering force. While it will never bankrupt the mega-corporations, it can reveal unethical practices while triggering a debate about values that recognizes that such practices are nested in economic systems that encourage, inhibit or even prohibit them.
The voices Klein gathers from across the world achieve a choral force. We hear a Montana goat rancher describe how an improbable alliance against Big Coal between local Native American tribes and settler descendants awakened in the latter a different worldview of time and change and possibility. We hear participants in Idle No More, the First Nations movement that has swept across Canada and beyond, contrast the ""extractivist mind-set"" with systems ""designed to promote more life.""
One quibble: What's with the subtitle? ""Capitalism vs. the Climate"" sounds like a P.R. person's idea of a marquee cage fight, but it belies the sophistication and hopefulness of Klein's argument. As is sometimes said, it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. Klein's adversary is neoliberalism -- the extreme capitalism that has birthed our era of extreme extraction. Klein is smart and pragmatic enough to shun the never-never land of capitalism's global overthrow. What she does, brilliantly, is provide a historically refined expos of ""capitalism's drift toward monopoly,"" of ""corporate interests intent on capturing and radically shrinking the public sphere,"" and of ""the disaster capitalists who use crises to end-run around democracy.""
To change economic norms and ethical perceptions in tandem is even more formidable than the technological battle to adapt to the heavy weather coming down the tubes. Yet ""This Changes Everything"" is, improbably, Klein's most optimistic book. She braids together the science, psychology, geopolitics, economics, ethics and activism that shape the climate question. The result is the most momentous and contentious environmental book since ""Silent Spring.""

NEWS ANALYSIS
Climate Study Puts Diplomatic Pressure on Obama
By CORAL DAVENPORT
WASHINGTON -- A sweeping new study on the effects of climate change -- which the report says is already disrupting the lives and livelihoods of the poorest people across the planet -- creates a diplomatic challenge for President Obama, who hopes to make action on both climate change and economic inequality hallmarks of his legacy.
The report, published this week by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concludes that the world's poorest people will suffer the most as temperatures rise, with many of them already contending with food and water shortages, higher rates of disease and premature death, and the violent conflicts that result from those problems.
Countries like Bangladesh and several in sub-Saharan Africa that are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change say the report strengthens their demand for ""climateÊjustice"" -- in other words, money, and plenty of it -- from the world's richest economies and corporations, which they blame for the problem.
Those countries and nongovernmental organizations point to a 2009 pledge by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to create a $100 billion annual climate fund for poor countries by 2020. The World Bank justified such an expenditure in a 2010 report concluding that it would take up to $100 billion a year to offset the ravages of climate change on poor countries.
Climate policy experts say that the United States, as the world's largest economy, would be expected to provide $20 billion to $30 billion of that annual fund.
That puts Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been working aggressively behind the scenes to forge a United Nations climate change treaty in 2015, in a tough position.
But both men know there is no chance that a Congress focused on cutting domestic spending and jump-starting the economy will enact legislation agreeing to a huge increase in so-called climate aid. Since 2010, the Obama administration has spent about $2.5 billion a year to help foreign countries adapt to climate change and adopt low-carbon energy technology.
It will be a stretch even to continue that level of spending. Many Republicans, who control the House and have a chance to gain the Senate this fall, question whether climate change is real.
""If the White House actually wants something like this, it should begin by building support among congressional Democrats, but -- at this point -- I don't see any real signs of support from House or Senate Democratic leaders at all,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.
Vulnerable nations, emboldened by the new United Nations report, are demanding more, not less, from the United States.
Ronald Jean Jumeau, the United Nations ambassador from the island nation of Seychelles, and a spokesman for the Alliance of Small Island States, compared the proposed fund with the amount of money Congress approved after Hurricane Sandy.
""We know that $100 billion is not going to be enough,"" Mr. Jumeau said. ""After Sandy, Congress voted for $60 billion in recovery for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- for one storm. It shows you how much $100 billion is going to cover.""
""The science is getting better, and it tells us things are getting worse for us,"" he added. ""And the money is not coming.""
The window is starting to close on Mr. Obama's ability to broker a treaty that could significantly reduce greenhouse gas pollution in time to avoid the most disastrous effects of climate change. This fall, at the United Nations General Assembly, world leaders will meet to put offers on the table for a climate change pact, a mix of commitments to cut fossil fuel pollution at home and provide money to poor countries to adapt. A few months later, at a two-week summit meeting in Lima, Peru, they will negotiate a draft of a final treaty that is set to be signed next year in Paris and take effect in 2020.
Diplomats say the new report has increased pressure on governments to reach a climate deal.
""By underscoring impacts and vulnerabilities, the report makes clear the urgency for strong action to reduce emissions and build greater resilience,"" said Todd D. Stern, the State Department's chief climate change negotiator.
In a speech in London last fall, Mr. Stern made clear that there was no chance that the United States would finance most of any climate adaptation fund with taxpayer dollars. ""The fiscal reality of the United States and other developed countries is not going to allow it,"" he said. Mr. Stern and others say the bulk of that money will have to come from private investors and corporations.
Nongovernmental organizations say that relying chiefly on the private sector will not be enough, especially as food supplies grow short. ""The scientists could not have been more clear, particularly in the area of food security,"" said Timothy Gore, an analyst for Oxfam, the antipoverty group. ""There is no government that's going to be able to stick around very long if the price of bread keeps going up, if they can't feed their people.""
""I challenge anyone in the U.S. government to explain how the private sector is going to invest in what's needed on the ground, like funding farmers in the Sahel region facing crop loss from changing rainfall patterns,"" Mr. Gore said, referring to the area of Africa just south of the Sahara.
Hanging over the coming negotiations will be the specter of the failed 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Vice President Al Gore promised in those talks that the United States would act on climate change, only to have the Senate refuse to ratify that treaty. At a 2009 climate summit meeting in Copenhagen, Mr. Obama promised that Congress would soon pass a sweeping climate change bill. Just months later, the bill died in the Senate.
Mr. Obama is now trying to bolster his credibility on the issue by flexing his executive authority and acting without Congress. His administration is moving ahead with aggressive new Environmental Protection Agency regulations to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. At talks around the world, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Stern have sought to persuade other nations that, this time, the United States will be able to keep its commitments, since they do not require action from Congress.
The United States' inability to offer more substantial aid to countries that did little to cause global warming will probably remain a major sticking point with developing nations, including India and China.
Still, Connie Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner for climate action, said she hoped that could eventually be overcome: ""I think the $100 billion mark can be reached. It was understood in Copenhagen that it had to be a mix of public and private money. I think vulnerable groups -- families in Bangladesh or the Philippines -- don't care whether a dollar coming their way is public or private.""

Philippines Pushes Developing Countries to Cut Their Emissions
By CORAL DAVENPORT
LIMA, Peru -- As the torrential rains of Typhoon Hagupit flood the Philippines, driving millions of people from their homes, the Philippine government arrived at a United Nations climate change summit meeting on Monday to push hard for a new international deal requiring all nations, including developing countries, to cut their use of fossil fuels.
It is a conscious pivot for the Philippines, one of Asia's fastest-growing economies. But scientists say the nation is also among the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and the Philippine government says it is suffering too many human and economic losses from the burning of fossil fuels.
Previously, Philippine negotiators -- most notably, climate diplomat Naderev Sao, who shot to fame last year after staging a hunger strike in the wake of the deadly Typhoon Haiyan -- have not been shy about demanding that the industrialized world cut its carbon emissions.
But now, the negotiators say, the Philippines is pledging cuts of its own and urging other developing nations to follow suit, a significant shift that they hope will advance global negotiations.
Negotiators here in Peru are working this week on a climate change accord, with the aim of producing one that will be signed by world leaders next year in Paris.
""The thinking of the pivot is -- we're going to take on commitments and do our part,"" said Tony La Via, a Philippine climate change delegate. ""The call has always been for developed countries to act. But the thinking is simple. If we're going to get hit every year again and again, how can we call on developed countries to reduce their emissions, but not reduce our own?""
The move follows a joint announcement in November by the United States and China that both countries -- the world's two largest carbon polluters -- will commit to reducing their fossil fuel emissions in the coming years.
Climate negotiators had hoped that the announcement by China would help end an impasse that, for 20 years, has plagued efforts to forge a global deal to stop climate change: Developing economies insist that industrialized nations -- as the world's historic polluters -- greatly reduce emissions, while poor countries remain exempt from such requirements.
The announcement by the Philippines ""builds on the dramatic U.S.-China announcement two weeks ago,"" said Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. ""It shows that there can be a deal in which emerging economies and countries on the growth path from developed to developing are now willing to negotiate.""
In particular, negotiators have hoped that the American deal with China would spur action from India, the world's third-largest carbon polluter. But more broadly, climate negotiators hope to bring every nation in the world to the table to pledge cuts, regardless of the size of economy.
In a clear sign of the shift by the Philippines, delegates from the country said they were breaking away from an informal bloc of nations known as the ""Like-Minded Group,"" which has for the past two years negotiated together on climate treaties.
The group includes nations like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Venezuela and other petro-states, which have long been viewed as stalling the push for an ambitious global deal designed to lower global oil consumption.
Instead, the Philippines assumed the chairmanship of another negotiating bloc -- the ""Most Vulnerable Countries.""
""The Philippines is thrilled with this opportunity to play a central role in stepping up the joint efforts for vulnerable countries,"" said Mary Ann Lucille Sering, secretary of the Philippines climate change commission.
""We have sustained losses every year since 2008 of 5 percent of GDP,"" she said. ""We are experiencing tremendous damages and loss of life from typhoons.""
Climate change policy experts applauded the country's new move but suggested that it could prompt an exodus of other countries from the ""Like-Minded Group.""
""They're playing a new role,"" said Jennifer Morgan, an expert on climate change negotiations with the World Resources Institute, a research group. ""It will be interesting to see if other countries, vulnerable countries, pull out of that group.""
The switch came as Typhoon Hagupit -- translated in English as ""Lasher"" -- churned through the nation. A series of scientific reports have linked the burning of fossil fuels with rising sea levels and more powerful typhoons, like those that have battered the island nation.
""How many more lashings can we bear?"" Ms. Sering asked.
But even as the Philippine delegation announced its new stance, many noticed the absence of Mr. Sao, who had become the face of the country's climate efforts.
Last year, weeks after super typhoon Haiyan left thousands dead in its wake, Mr. Sao gave an impassioned, weeping speech that electrified the annual United Nations climate change summit meeting, demanding that the world wake up to the impact of fossil fuels on his homeland.
Over the next year, he gained world attention as an advocate for his cause, staging a hunger strike, giving speeches to thousands and taking part in a 38-day climate awareness march from Manila to his flattened hometown Tacloban.
Mr. Sao's tactics were widely credited with raising awareness of climate change inside a government with economic ties to some of the world's biggest oil producers. But they did not necessarily translate to good negotiating practices, his colleagues said. This year, the government did not include Mr. Sao in the official negotiating team. He is in Manila, helping victims of the typhoon.
Mr. La Via, the Philippine negotiator who was also Mr. Sao's law professor at the University of the Philippines, said he admired his former student's passion. But Mr. La Via questioned the efficacy of tearful, angry demands that rich countries make ""climatejustice"" amends to poor countries.
""Everyone's heard that,"" he said.
Such an approach, while it may be morally justified, does not play well at the negotiating table, Mr. La Via said. That is why the Philippine delegation this year is not spotlighting its prominent activist, but rather the fact that it intends to put forward a plan to reduce its own emissions.
""If you change the conversation to what you can do, you get listened to more,"" Mr. La Via said.

In India, Slight Rise in Temperatures Is Tied to Heat Wave Deaths
By MIKE IVES
HONG KONG — A temperature increase of less than one degree Fahrenheit over half a century raised the probability of mass heat-related deaths in India by two and a half times, a new study has found, in the latest sign that even a slight rise can have a grave effect on health.

The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, found that as the mean summer temperature and the annual number of heat-wave days increased in India from 1960 to 2009, there was a “substantial increase” in related mortality rates.

The climate change researchers also warned that future increases in global temperatures — which are projected to be far greater than those analyzed in the study — could take a “relatively drastic human toll” in India and many other low-latitude countries in the developing world.

The study “provides evidence of not only warming in India, with some parts warming more than others, but also that as warming progresses heat waves become more frequent and more intense,” said David Mark Taylor, a professor of tropical environmental change at the National University of Singapore. (He was not involved in the study.)

With the problem expected to worsen, he added, the challenge is “finding a comprehensive solution rather than a temporary fix that benefits some at the expense of the majority.”

Parts of Asia have experienced record-breaking heat waves in recent years, with temperatures well above 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celsius). In 2015, more than 2,400 people, mostly laborers and farmhands, died from heat-related illness in India, according to the country’s National Disaster Management Authority.

NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported in January that the earth’s average surface temperature has risen by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 Celsius) since the late 19th century, largely because of human-caused atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide.

Climate scientists predict that, without preventive action to curb emissions, global mean temperatures could rise by several degrees Celsius by the end of this century and warn that a rise of more than 2 degrees could tip the earth into a future of irreversible rising seas and melting ice sheets.

The goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord was to prevent the worst effects of climate change by limiting the global temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius). Nearly every country pledged to reduce its emissions. But President Trump announced last week that the United States would withdraw from the accord, saying that it imposed unfair environmental standards on American businesses and workers. (Environmental groups disputed the economic study that he had cited to prove his point.)

The new India study was based on data from the India Meteorological Department showing that in the 50 years up to 2009, the country’s mean summer temperature rose by more than 0.9 degree Fahrenheit (0.5 Celsius). The study also looked at statistics that the department had compiled from newspaper reports and other sources about deaths during heat waves.

The study’s authors used scientific modeling to show that with a 0.9 degree Fahrenheit (0.5 Celsius) rise in temperature, the probability of a heat wave with more than 100 deaths in India increased to 32 percent from 13 percent.

The researchers found that, compared with the period from 1960 to 1984, southern and western India experienced 50 percent more heat waves from 1985 to 2009.

They wrote that even “moderate and practically unavoidable increases in mean temperatures” — like the ones they analyzed — “may lead to large increases in heat-related mortality, unless measures are taken to substantially improve the resilience of vulnerable populations.”

Some experts expect India’s temperature to rise by 4 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (2.2 to 5.5 Celsius) by the end of this century, the study said.

The study is not the first effort to link climate change to heat-related deaths among vulnerable populations, and the phenomenon is not limited to developing countries.

A 2010 study in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, for example, said that the mortality rate in Hong Kong rose 1.8 percent for every one-degree-Celsius rise above 28.2 Celsius (82.8 Fahrenheit). It said that people living in poorer neighborhoods were among the most vulnerable.

Emily Y.Y. Chan, the lead author of the 2010 study, and a professor of public health at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that there was an urgent need for more research that would allow governments to help specific groups, like the aged, the disabled or the chronically ill.

But Professor Taylor said that individual responses to heat waves tended to illustrate a problem of environmental justice.

Richer populations in Asia can afford to invest in air conditioning and other mitigating measures, he said, “but using air conditioning adds to warming, making it worse for those who cannot afford such luxuries.”"

Debate on Pulling Back From Paris Climate Deal Could Turn on a Single Phrase
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- The debate within the Trump administration over what to do about the Paris climate agreement has reached a critical phase, according to people familiar with the internal negotiations. The decision could hinge on the interpretation of a single phrase in a single provision of a document that took years to write.

The question is whether to walk away from the agreement sealed by the Obama administration and nearly 200 other nations at the end of 2015 -- as Donald J. Trump promised as a presidential candidate to do -- or to weaken the nation's commitment under the deal to reducing greenhouse gases while remaining in the accord.

The provision at issue, Article 4.11, states that a nation ""may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition."" The question is whether the ability to ""adjust"" is like a ratchet, allowing progress only in one direction -- upward -- or if it permits a country to weaken its commitment without violating the terms of the deal.

The fight within the White House over what to do about the Paris deal has been going on for months. One side, led by the president's chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has argued that the language of the provision does not allow nations to weaken their commitments. They urge the president to withdraw entirely from the Paris deal.

Another faction, which includes the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and colleagues, believes that the agreement does allow downward adjustments to nations' goals and targets, and that the administration should modify the commitment, not walk away.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, too, has called for the administration to ""renegotiate"" the climate pact without withdrawing from it.

If Mr. Bannon's side of the debate wins the contest for Mr. Trump's approval, the announcement of a decision to withdraw from the climate deal could come as early as next week.

The two sides clashed over the issue in a meeting on Thursday, when the White House Counsel's Office surprised Ms. Trump by suggesting that Mr. Pruitt's faction might have the law on its side, Politico reported. The conflict led to an unusual meeting on Monday involving lawyers from several government agencies, reportedly including the White House, the Justice Department and the State Department.

Among the hard-line opponents of action against climate change both inside and outside the White House, the strong resistance to the notion that the Paris agreement includes downward flexibility is accompanied by warnings that efforts to relax commitments will lead to burdensome lawsuits from activists.

Christopher C. Horner, a senior legal fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, said liberal state attorneys general and climate activists would inevitably sue over efforts to weaken the targets. ""This will be most aggressive in the Ninth Circuit, which hopefully triggers some memories in the minds of administration lawyers,"" he said, referring to the fight over the administration's immigration plan, which has been stayed by the California-based federal appeals court.

""Despite the mad rush to insist that plain language means either the opposite of what it says, or else nothing at all, under any canon of construction, Article 4 does not permit revisions downward,"" Mr. Horner said. ""The language is deliberate and reads only one way: the way it was written and, as the context affirms, was plainly intended.""

The officials aligned with Ms. Trump and Mr. Tillerson, however, have suggested privately that the legal theory of a strictly binding agreement is little more than a ploy to force the administration to pull out of the deal.

Todd D. Stern, the lead climate negotiator in the Obama administration and an expert on the deal, said negotiators wrote the flexibility to reduce targets into the agreement by careful design. ""It wasn't like, 'Boy, nobody thought of that,""' he said.

The issue was discussed intensely in Paris, he explained. ""There were countries that wanted to say, 'Thou shalt not, you are precluded from adjusting now.' We did not want to do that,"" he said. Downward adjustment had already occurred with climate commitments. Japan, after losing nuclear power facilities in the Fukushima disaster, had to adjust its targets downward.

The United States had feared that without the ability to adjust targets, countries would lowball their commitments, Mr. Stern said.

He said leaving the Paris agreement would be a ""serious mistake"" that would have grave consequences: ""I think it would produce broad collateral damage for the U.S. internationally.""

The question of whether the administration will leave the climate agreement has drawn broad opposition from the nation's trading partners and businesses, and even from fossil fuel companies.

In a recent letter to administration officials, Exxon Mobil called the agreement ""an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."" At the coal company Cloud Peak Energy, a spokesman, Rick Curtsinger, said, ""We do believe that it needs to be amended, but think that it's important to stay at the negotiating table.""

Colin Marshall, the company's chief executive, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on April 6 urging him to remain in the Paris agreement, ""albeit with a much different pledge on emissions,"" and to promote technologies that can reduce the greenhouse gases produced by the use of coal.

Other nations have urged the United States to remain at the Paris table, including Britain, Canada and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has said his country will stay in the deal even if the United States withdraws.

Maros Sefcovic, a vice president of the European Commission, has urged American officials to stick with the agreement, but has also said that if not, ""we are ready to continue to provide the leadership on climate change."""

Alarmed by Trump's Environmental Agenda, Thousands Join Climate March
By NICHOLAS FANDOS; Reporting was contributed by Emily Baumgaertner and Coral Davenport from Washington, Adeshina Emmanuel from Chicago, and Ciaran McEvoy from Los Angeles.
WASHINGTON -- Tens of thousands of demonstrators, alarmed at what they see as a dangerous assault on the environment by the Trump administration, poured into the streets here on Saturday to sound warnings both planetary and political about the Earth's warming climate.

Starting at the foot of the Capitol, the protesters marched to the White House, surrounding the mansion while President Trump was inside on his 100th day in office. Once there, the demonstrators let out a collective roar, meant to symbolically drown out the voices of the administration's climate change deniers.

The protesters, who had gathered for the latest in what has become near-weekly demonstrations of varying stripes against the president, then offered a chant: ""Resistance is here to stay, welcome to your 100th day.""

Billed as the Peoples Climate March, the demonstration here in Washington, and hundreds of smaller events like it across the country, had long been planned to mark the 100th day of the new president's term. What organizers did not know, at least initially, was that that president would be Mr. Trump.

His administration has gone on to begin rolling back his predecessor's most ambitious environmental measures, renewing fears that government inaction will send the world headlong into an era of rising seas and violent weather.

""I want to make a statement. I'm showing my daughters we can believe in something and express what we believe in,"" said Scott Trexler, who came with one of his daughters and a church group from Rocky Ridge, Md., to march for the first time. He said his faith demanded it. ""I believe the environment is important for my daughters and future generations,"" he said.

The demonstration was also being used to gauge what Democrats hope is a blossoming opposition movement to Mr. Trump that they can parlay into lasting political power.

""There has been devastating news on climate coming out of the White House and Congress, and a lot of people are really angry,"" said May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org, an environmental advocacy group that helped plan the march. ""We can't deny that is a big part of it. But we want to make a distinction between anger and resolve.""

The demonstration's organizers made a point of casting a big net, seeking to make the case that climate change is interwoven with traditional social justice issues like racial, gender and economic inequality.

The marchers in Washington included Hollywood celebrities and stars of the political left like former Vice President Al Gore and the business magnate Richard Branson. The front of their ranks, though, was reserved for ordinary people: the immigrants, indigenous people, laborers, coastal dwellers and children, who organizers say are most vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate.

Alphonse LeRoy, a member of the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota, said he had traveled to Washington with so-called water protectors like himself who had spent time protesting the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines.

""I think first of the grass, plants, animals, eagles, birds, fish -- without water, nothing will survive,"" he said. ""This isn't just important for me; it's important for everybody.""

Thousands of the marchers arrived by car, train or bus. Bren Smith of New Haven came on a 24-foot oyster vessel. ""We're here because climate change is an economic issue now,"" said Mr. Smith, a commercial fisherman. ""This is not just about bees and bears anymore, it's about jobs.""

At a rally in Chicago, Sue Meyers, a retired teacher from Frankfurt, Ill., said it was important to tell skeptics on climate change that ""nowhere else in the world do people think like this.""

""The problems need to be addressed, and to deny there is a problem is even worse,"" she added.

In Los Angeles, protesters gathered near the port, where the oil refiner Tesoro wants to expand its operation. ""A lot more people are becoming engaged because they realize they have to,"" said Kaya Foster, an environmental educator and activist from Santa Monica.

Around the country, the demonstrators' list of grievances was long. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has appointed one of the chief antagonists of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, as its administrator and proposed slashing its budget by nearly a third, more than any other federal agency. He has signed several executive orders aimed at rolling back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a set of regulations intended to close heavily polluting coal-fired power plants, and restrictions on vehicle emissions, among others.

This past week, Mr. Trump signed orders intended to initiate reviews aimed at opening certain protected lands and waters to drilling, mining and logging. His advisers were still debating whether the United States would remain in the landmark Paris climate accord. And on Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it had taken down several agency web pages that contained climate data and other scientific information relating to climate change.

Sweltering temperatures that threatened to break a heat record in Washington on Saturday added a poetic flourish to the demonstrators' argument.

Dire though the warnings were, the march was not without levity. One group wheeled a large ""Trojan Oil Drum"" that warned: ""Climate Activists Inside."" White full-body polar bear suits dotted the crowd, their owners dripping in sweat underneath as they posed for seemingly endless photographs. Others hoisted miniature wind turbines, which twisted in the wind.

""We're here, we're hot, this planet's all we got,"" demonstrators chanted. As they passed the Trump International Hotel, the chant became ""Shame, shame, shame.""

For organizers, the demonstrations offered a chance to assess the progress and setbacks since the first People's Climate March in New York City in 2014. That march, organized by many of the same groups to urge international leaders to take collective action, predated both the Paris accord and many of Mr. Obama's most ambitious actions.

Two and a half years later, organizers said their movement had grown considerably more diverse. They said they were focused on building a political coalition capable of countering Mr. Trump and advancing liberal policies at all levels of government. A daylong training workshop for those contemplating running for office was planned for Sunday.

Saturday's march came a week after thousands of scientists and their supporters gathered here to respond to what they called threats against their enterprise by the administration. Another march, for immigrant and worker rights, was scheduled for Monday.

Cindy Wiesner, the national coordinator for the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, a coalition of liberal organizing groups, said leaders of the movement hoped to capture that energy.

""I think there's a lot more clarity about the stakes for all of our communities,"" she said.

Climate Scientists Unite With Lawyers to Counter Attacks on Their Efforts
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
Lawyers and scientists do not always get along, but some are now finding common cause in an effort to defend the integrity of science -- especially climate science -- in government and academia.

Climate scientists are feeling the heat as Republicans cement control of the executive branch and Congress. The Trump administration has already rolled back about two dozen environmental laws and regulations, dismissed members of an important science panel and taken down web pages giving information on climate change. Republicans in Congress have also brought pressure to bear on climate scientists.

Now scientists and lawyers are fighting back, with well-attended public demonstrations and legal action. The push included a recent conference that brought law professors from across the United States to New York for training to protect scientists who come under scrutiny.

Scientists have found themselves the targets of investigations from those who deny the evidence of climate change -- most notably in the 2009 scandal known as Climategate, when hackers stole and released internal research discussions. Global warming denialists took comments out of context to allege widespread scientific fraud.

Subsequent efforts to mine internal emails have been undertaken by conservative organizations like the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute and Judicial Watch, as well as conservative public officials like Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, a former Virginia attorney general.

When the Environmental Protection Agency removed the climate-related web pages, it announced that it was reviewing and revising portions of its website in ways ""that reflect the agency's new direction under President Donald Trump and Administrator Scott Pruitt.""

Judith Enck, a former top E.P.A. official who is critical of the agency's new direction, said its online presence ""now looks like the National Mining Association website.""

In Congress this month, two Republican representatives, Rob Bishop of Utah and Raul R. Labrador of Idaho, sent a letter to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke saying they would review climate change adaptation programs at his agency to examine the ""effectiveness, management and levels of oversight"" of the programs.

Other conservatives in Congress took aim at climate researchers well before the 2016 election. Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the House Science Committee, last year subpoenaed federal climate scientists whose work supporting the evidence of a warming planet shows what he has called a ""suspect climate agenda.""

Actions by the Trump administration have been met with anger, lawsuits and friend-of-the-court briefs. A group of former Obama administration lawyers has filed lawsuits seeking information about charges of bullying of civil servants and scientists who work on climate issues.

David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and a former top prosecutor of environmental crimes at the Justice Department, has taken part in several such efforts, including briefs filed before Mr. Trump took office. He said the work was important both as an attempt to preserve environmental progress and as a message to his students.

In November, many of his students expressed dismay over the election results ""and their concern that everything they came to law school for no longer mattered,"" Professor Uhlmann said. ""My message to them was, 'Everything you came to law school for matters more than ever before.""'

Other lawyers are stepping up to protect dozens of climate scientists who have been targeted by private conservative groups demanding their personal emails and other documents. The groups, which dispute the powerful evidence underlying climate change science, use the tactic to unearth embarrassing and inartful language in private correspondence and then publicize it.

Those filing the document requests say they are trying to ferret out politicized, sloppy science and fraud. David Schnare, an official at the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, said, ""The legislatures give the citizens a right to know, and for good reasons -- and there are good reasons for citizens to find out what's going on."" Mr. Schnare, who was a longtime E.P.A. employee, briefly served in the Trump administration's transition team at the agency; the group receives funding from the fossil fuel industry.

The tactic can be ""a P.R. home run,"" said Andrew Dessler, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University who received one such demand in 2012. He said he recognized the filing as ""a fishing expedition"" intended to ""find anything that makes climate scientists look foolish, or corrupt, or biased or stupid -- anything that can cast doubt on climate science.""

Dr. Dessler cited the Climategate emails, which included discussion of the work of Michael E. Mann, now a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, with phrases like ""Mike's Nature trick"" and a technique to ""hide the decline,"" which conservative commentators publicized as proof of fraud in climate science.

The phrases, which were taken out of context, did not involve fraud, and several investigations have cleared the scientists of allegations that they manipulated research to meet their predetermined expectations. Still, Climategate was used to smear the scientists; President Trump has cited the ""horrible emails"" as a reason for doubting the threat of climate change.

The law professors who came to New York for training attended classes taught by the Climate Science Legal Defense Fund.

The fund was created in 2012 in response to litigation by Mr. Cuccinelli that also involved Dr. Mann's emails. Dr. Mann would eventually win that case, but by then, the burdensome litigation had run up hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills for Dr. Mann and the University of Virginia, his employer at the time.

In light of those costs, the defense fund got its start. What had been an informal referral network for scientists facing legal pressure took on structure and financing. Mr. Trump's election has provided a boost to the defense fund, said Joshua Wolfe, a founder.

""We've been a bit overwhelmed by the number of checks that came in postelection,"" he said. And while he noted that ""we didn't build the organization for the Trump era,"" the previous cases ""really prepared the organization for the current set of challenges.""

The New York conference kicked off an effort to build a nationwide network of legal aid providers. Participants heard lectures on open records laws and were warned that the climate fight could be brutal, with online harassment and death threats common for researchers.

One law professor attending the conference, Myanna Dellinger of the University of South Dakota, said her own environmental legal scholarship had prompted attacks from conservatives, so ""if I could help others who might be in the same situation, I would like to do so.""

Emphasizing that she spoke only for herself and not for her institution, she added: ""It would be easy to sit and do nothing and write about tax law. But some of us have to do something."""

Wrong Message, Wrong Coal Mine
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Scott Pruitt, the climate-change denier charged by President Trump with making the Environmental Protection Agency less protective of the environment, traveled to Pennsylvania last week to kick off E.P.A.'s ""back to basics"" agenda and tell a group of worried coal miners that the Obama administration's ""war on coal"" was over and that he and Mr. Trump would lead a revival of the industry.

He may have chosen the wrong coal mine at which to make his pitch. The Harvey Mine, in Sycamore, Pa., is part of the Bailey Mine Complex, the largest producing underground mine in North America. The complex employs 2,000 people and is clearly vital to the local economy.

What's not clear at all is that it represents the future of the local economy. Like a lot of mines, Bailey has had its share of environmental violations, including some that led to a $3 million fine last year from the pre-Trump E.P.A. and the Justice Department for polluting Ohio River tributaries. But the much larger question mark hanging over Bailey is that its parent, Consol Energy, wants to get out of the coal mining business and focus on its more profitable natural gas operations. Consol told Bloomberg News in March that it had engaged two financial firms to help find a buyer.

The mine, once sold, could stay in business for a time, which would be good news for the miners who heard Mr. Pruitt's pep talk. Still, coal's long-term outlook is poor, less because of environmental regulations than market forces, including competition from natural gas and increasingly cost-effective renewable sources. Loosening environmental laws won't make coal cheaper than natural gas, and it certainly won't make it cleaner. Which is why Consol's management, as clearheaded as Mr. Pruitt is delusional, wants to exit coal.

Mr. Pruitt also used the occasion to restate the administration's environmental agenda, which was set forth in Mr. Trump's energy independence executive order last month and which basically involves demolishing or amending beyond recognition every useful thing the Obama administration did to improve air and water quality and reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change.

At the top of the hit list is Mr. Obama's Clean Power Plan, which targets old coal-fired power plants and is the most visible symbol of the ""regulatory overreach"" from which Mr. Pruitt promised to deliver ""the hard-working coal miners who help power America."" Those miners would be far better served by honesty and a serious effort to train them for a world in which coal plays an ever-smaller role."

Trump Plans to Begin E.P.A. Rollback With Order on Clean Water
By CORAL DAVENPORT; Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Tuesday aimed at rolling back one of former President Barack Obama's major environmental regulations to protect American waterways, but it will have almost no immediate legal effect, according to two people familiar with the White House plans.

The order will essentially give Mr. Trump a megaphone to direct his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt, to begin the complicated legal process of rewriting the sweeping 2015 rule known as Waters of the United States. But that effort could take longer than a single presidential term, legal experts said.

An advance copy of the order was viewed by The New York Times on Monday. It is the first of two announcements expected to direct Mr. Pruitt to begin dismantling the major pillars of Mr. Obama's environmental legacy.

In the coming week, Mr. Trump is also expected to sign a similar order instructing Mr. Pruitt to begin the process of withdrawing and revising Mr. Obama's signature 2015 climate-change regulation, aimed at curbing emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants.

Because both of those rules were finalized under existing laws long before Mr. Obama left office, they cannot be simply undone with a stroke of the president's pen, legal experts in both the Obama and Trump White Houses have said.

""The executive order has no legal significance at all,"" said Richard L. Revesz, a professor of environmental law at New York University. ""It's like the president calling Scott Pruitt and telling him to start the legal proceedings. It does the same thing as a phone call or a tweet. It just signals that the president wants it to happen.""

Still, Mr. Pruitt, who was confirmed by the Senate to his new position this month, is expected to enthusiastically dive in to the lengthy task of undoing major environmental rules on clean water, climate change and air pollution. In his former job as attorney general of Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt led or took part in 14 lawsuits intended to block the E.P.A.'s major regulations, including the clean water and climate rules that he is now charged with dismantling.

Speaking over the weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Pruitt told an audience, to applause, ""I think there are some regulations that in the near term need to be rolled back in a very aggressive way,"" and he said those rollbacks would probably begin this week.

The clean water rule, completed by the Obama administration in spring 2015, was issued under the 1972 Clean Water Act. It gives the federal government broad authority to limit pollution in major bodies of water, like Chesapeake Bay, the Mississippi River and Puget Sound, as well as in streams and wetlands that drain into those larger waters.

Two Supreme Court decisions related to clean water protection, in 2001 and 2006, created legal confusion about whether the federal government had the authority to regulate the smaller streams and headwaters and about other water sources such as wetlands.

The Obama administration's water rule, put forth jointly by the E.P.A. and the Army Corps of Engineers, was intended to clarify that authority, allowing the government to once again limit pollution in those smaller bodies of water. Environmentalists have praised the rule, calling it an important step that will lead to significantly cleaner natural bodies of water and healthier drinking water.

But it has come under fierce attack from farmers, property developers, fertilizer and pesticide makers, oil and gas producers, golf-course owners and other business interests that contend that it will stifle economic growth and intrude on property owners' rights.

The American Farm Bureau Federation, which has led the legal fight against Mr. Obama's rule, contends that it places an undue burden on farmers in particular, who may find themselves required to apply for federal permits to use fertilizer near ditches and streams on their property that may eventually flow into larger rivers.

On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump won cheers from rural audiences when he vowed to roll back the rule.

Despite the controversy over the regulation, it has yet to be put into effect. A federal court delayed it as judges review the legal challenges against it. Mr. Trump's executive order directs Attorney General Jeff Sessions to review the challenges and to consider asking the court to delay a decision on the matter until a new regulation is released.

That could take several years. To follow the law, Mr. Pruitt will have to withdraw the current Obama administration water regulation and craft a new version of the rule, along with a justification as to why it would be legally superior to the earlier one. That would be subject to a public comment period before it is finalized, and it could face new lawsuits afterward.

Either way, the fight over who controls the nation's waterways is expected to end up in front of the Supreme Court. In directing Mr. Pruitt's efforts to craft the new water regulation, Mr. Trump's order asks him to consider a 2006 review of the rule that was written by Antonin Scalia, the Supreme Court justice who died last year. Justice Scalia, who was long the court's most prominent conservative voice, offered a narrow and tightly constrained interpretation of what would constitute a federally protected body of water. Based on his interpretation, the number of federally protected waterways under Mr. Trump's order would probably be far less than the 60 percent covered by the Obama administration.

Also on Tuesday, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order intended to strengthen the federal office in charge of coordinating support for the nation's historically black colleges and universities. That office has for years been housed in the Education Department, but it will now move to the White House, officials said.

Aides to the president, who requested anonymity to discuss the executive order before it had been officially announced, said Mr. Trump hoped the move would mean more support for the colleges. They said the president also hoped to enlist the colleges in efforts to help urban centers in America."

A Vatican Declaration Seeks Equitable Clean-Energy Access in a Livable Climate
By ANDREW C. REVKIN  APRIL 28, 2015 12:21 PM April 28, 2015 12:21 pm 370

Updated | A daylong Vatican meeting on climate, energy, ecology and equity has produced a declaration that offers a promising vision for religious and secular leaders eager to foster a sustainable human journey. The event, attended by dozens of religious leaders, scientists, social and environmental campaigners and others, is part of Pope Francis’s campaign ahead of the release of his encyclical on the environment and equity. Read more in my initial post.

It’s encouraging to see that some language in a longer draft declaration that might have created unnecessary divisions (see my previous post) is not in the statement that emerged after a final round of vetting by participants, including the Vatican and the office of U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Here’s today’s “Declaration of Religious Leaders, Political Leaders, Business Leaders, Scientists and Development Practitioners“:

28 April 2015

We the undersigned have assembled at the Pontifical Academies of Sciences and Social Sciences to address the challenges of human-induced climate change, extreme poverty, and social marginalization, including human trafficking, in the context of sustainable development. We join together from many faiths and walks of life, reflecting humanity’s shared yearning for peace, happiness, prosperity, justice, and environmental sustainability. We have considered the overwhelming scientific evidence regarding human-induced climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and the vulnerabilities of the poor to economic, social, and environmental shocks.

In the face of the emergencies of human-induced climate change, social exclusion, and extreme poverty, we join together to declare that:

Human-induced climate change is a scientific reality, and its decisive mitigation is a moral and religious imperative for humanity;

In this core moral space, the world’s religions play a very vital role. These traditions all affirm the inherent dignity of every individual linked to the common good of all humanity. They affirm the beauty, wonder, and inherent goodness of the natural world, and appreciate that it is a precious gift entrusted to our common care, making it our moral duty to respect rather than ravage the garden that is our home;

The poor and excluded face dire threats from climate disruptions, including the increased frequency of droughts, extreme storms, heat waves, and rising sea levels;

The world has within its technological grasp, financial means, and know-how the means to mitigate climate change while also ending extreme poverty, through the application of sustainable development solutions including the adoption of low-carbon energy systems supported by information and communications technologies;

The financing of sustainable development, including climate mitigation, should be bolstered through new incentives for the transition towards low-carbon energy, and through the relentless pursuit of peace, which also will enable the shift of public financing from military spending to urgent investments for sustainable development;

The world should take note that the climate summit in Paris later this year (COP21) may be the last effective opportunity to negotiate arrangements that keep human-induced warming below 2-degrees C, and aim to stay well below 2-degree C for safety, yet the current trajectory may well reach a devastating 4-degrees C or higher;

Political leaders of all UN member states have a special responsibility to agree at COP21 to a bold climate agreement that confines global warming to a limit safe for humanity, while protecting the poor and the vulnerable from ongoing climate change that gravely endangers their lives. The high-income countries should help to finance the costs of climate-change mitigation in low-income countries as the high-income countries have promised to do;

Climate-change mitigation will require a rapid world transformation to a world powered by renewable and other low-carbon energy and the sustainable management of ecosystems. These transformations should be carried out in the context of globally agreed Sustainable Development Goals, consistent with ending extreme poverty; ensuring universal access for healthcare, quality education, safe water, and sustainable energy; and cooperating to end human trafficking and all forms of modern slavery. All sectors and stakeholders must do their part, a pledge that we fully commit to in our individual capacities.

It’s important to note subtle, but significant, wording here, in particular the phrase “and other low-carbon energy” — code for both nuclear power and for “carbon capture” methods of using fossil fuels that capture and sequester carbon dioxide (which will need an awful lot of large-scale development before they can be seen as a climate-scale option).

Both have been included in the recent Deep Decarbonization Pathways analysis undertaken by one of the sponsors of today’s meeting, the U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network.

There’s plenty that’s missing, including any mention of the population factor that affects greenhouse gas emissions projections but also (and more importantly, to me) the extent of vulnerability of poor people in marginal climates.

But whittling is the inevitable result of trying to seek agreement among disparate parties, each with a varied range of interests and obligations.

I’m sure some participants would have loved to see mention of a price on carbon, for instance.

This is a fine start, and a helpful moment on the path through (not to) Paris.

After all, this is a long climate and energy march we’re on.

Postscript, May 3 | Jeff Sachs, the head of Columbia University’s Earth Institute and one of the organizers of the Vatican meeting, has written a Project Syndicate column on the meeting, including this:

[A]s the climate debate unfolds this year, most of humanity will find Francis’s message compelling: we need both science and morality to reduce the risk to our planet….

Francis’s purpose, of course, is to marry modern science, both natural and social, with faith and morality. Our hard-won scientific knowledge should be used to promote human wellbeing, protect the vulnerable and the poor, preserve Earth’s fragile ecosystems, and keep faith with future generations. Science can reveal the environmental dangers caused by humanity; engineering can create the tools to protect the planet; and faith and moral reasoning can provide the practical wisdom (as Aristotle and Aquinas would have said) to choose virtuously for the common good.]"

A Vision for Floating Cities to Fend Off Rising Seas
By MIKE IVES
HONG KONG -- You might call it a Noah's Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets.

An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon.

The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2.5 million from more than 1,000 interested donors. Randolph Hencken, the group's executive director, said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year, pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies.

""We have a vision that we're going to create an industry that provides floating islands to people who are threatened by rising sea levels,"" Mr. Hencken said.

The group's original founders included Peter Thiel, a billionaire investor and prominent supporter of President Trump, although Mr. Thiel is no longer donating to the institute, Mr. Hencken said.

Mr. Hencken said that the project's pilot islands would cost a total of $10 million to $50 million and house a few dozen people and that the initial residents would most likely be middle-income buyers from the developed world. He added that the institute was seeking to build the islands in what would be a nautical version of a special economic zone and that it would showcase innovations in solar power, sustainable aquaculture and ocean-based wind farms.

The project's leaders face many hurdles, such as building waste-management systems for the islands and convincing investors to buy property in such an untested environment. Joe Quirk, a spokesman for the Seasteading Institute, said in a 2014 video that the cost of housing on the artificial islands would initially be on par with real estate in London or New York City.

[Video: Top 5 things to know about the Floating CIty Project, Feb 2014 Watch on YouTube.]

But the project also appears to show how the acceleration of climate change has prompted technology entrepreneurs to devise innovative solutions to climate-related problems like rising sea levels.

""The oceans are the most ignored part of the planet, so I'm excited by the possibilities which will emerge when you get some of Silicon Valley's more adventurous souls focusing on the sustainable use of our coastal and marine areas,"" Lelei LeLaulu, a development entrepreneur from Samoa who specializes in the Pacific Islands and advises the International Finance Corporation on sustainable business, said in an email from French Polynesia.

But the project has critics in French Polynesia and beyond.

Alexandre Le Quere, a radio host at the station Polynesie 1ere, said this month that the Seasteading Institute's project reminded him of a plan to build artificial islands off the Indonesian resort island of Bali that has drawn heavy criticism amid concern over its projected environmental effects.

""One might think the engineers behind Seasteading have responses to these ecological questions,"" Mr. Le Quere said. ""Nevertheless, it doesn't stop skepticism about this slightly crazy project.""

Mr. Hencken said that he expected the project to eventually include dozens of artificial islands and that similar projects could someday be built in other atoll nations or coastal areas threatened by rising sea levels. He added that the cost of housing would decrease as the so-called island platforms became cheaper to manufacture.

""I certainly don't think this is a project that is exclusively for the wealthy,"" he said, adding that his background was in social justice activism.

But experts familiar with climate change and the South Pacific said they doubted the project would be feasible on a wide scale in a region with some of the world's poorest countries. They also wondered whether the money could be better spent on education or health care.

""I wouldn't write it off entirely; I just come to these things with a healthy skepticism,"" said Matthew Dornan, the deputy director of the Development Policy Center at Australian National University in Canberra.

""There is a tendency for very technologically focused solutions to the challenges in the Pacific without any real input from the Pacific Islanders themselves,"" he added.

Simon Donner, a geography professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who studies the effects of climate change in the Pacific Islands, said that the French Polynesia project looked intriguing and that he had no reason to doubt that its backers were well intentioned.

But he said the project reflected a cruel reality: The developed world is both responsible for climate change and better able to cope with it.

The French Polynesia project would effectively be a ""cruise ship,"" Professor Donner said. ""Meanwhile, the other actual islands in the Pacific are stuck with the impacts of climate change.""

Mr. Hencken disputed that assessment, saying it was unfair to compare his initiative with traditional aid projects.

""We're not taking French Polynesia's money,"" he said. ""We're investing our own money with the hopes of making a direct and indirect benefit to our host.""

The French Foreign Ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the Seasteading Institute's plan.

Recent climate models predict that the world's oceans could rise five to six feet by 2100, roughly twice the increase reported as a plausible worst-case scenario by a United Nations panel in 2013.

Atoll nations in the Pacific are seen as uniquely vulnerable to sea level rise because they are often low-lying and extremely narrow. One of them, Kiribati, has become an unofficial champion of a movement to call global attention to the threat.

In an interview with The New York Times last year, Kiribati's president at the time, Anote Tong, said he had commissioned experts from the government of the United Arab Emirates to study the feasibility of artificially raising Kiribati's islands as a climate adaptation strategy. But he declined to provide specifics, and subsequent attempts to reach officials in Kiribati and the United Arab Emirates for details were unsuccessful.

Koen Olthuis, an architect in the Netherlands whose projects are entirely water-based, said that interest in amphibious construction among developers and municipalities had surged worldwide in the last four years and that floating projects could potentially have an enormous range of beneficial social uses. An early example, he said, is a floating school he designed recently for Bangladesh, where sea level rise threatens low-lying coastal communities.

Mr. Olthuis said that the technical challenges of artificial island construction could be resolved and that he hoped the French Polynesia project would succeed. But it was still an open question, he added, what the ultimate goal or scale of such projects should be.

""What do we want to save? How much money do we want to spend on it, and what does it bring for those people?"" he said. ""With billions, you can save 300,000 people. But you can also take them away and put them in other countries and use those buildings to help people in slums worldwide."""

Drilling and Dirty Air in Los Angeles
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The air in much of Wilmington, at the southern tip of Los Angeles, has a fetid, tarry scent, but Giselle Cabrera can't smell it anymore. Sixteen years old, she's lived in the neighborhood her whole life, and she no longer notices the stench of pollutants from hundreds of oil wells.

She does, however, notice the persistent cough she's been fighting for five months; the asthma that affects her, her mother and her sister; and the cancer rate in her neighborhood, one of the highest in Southern California.

Even in Los Angeles, a place with over 1,000 oil wells, Wilmington, a working-class neighborhood where a majority of residents are Latino, stands out for the proximity of wells to homes, playgrounds and schools. One large rig stands next to a field where Little League teams play. Pumpjacks operate on residential streets, next door to homes. Ms. Cabrera lives a block away from a drilling site.

Wells on the city's wealthier west side tend to be farther away from homes and are more likely to be enclosed to reduce pollution. Health risks like asthma, cancer and other ailments tend to rise with proximity to drilling sites.

In 2015, Youth for Environmental Justice, of which Ms. Cabrera is a member, and other groups, sued Los Angeles. The suit said the city had permitted drilling without performing required environmental reviews, not only in Wilmington but also South Los Angeles, a low-income area where most residents are black or Latino.

Last year, the city settled after adopting new procedures for reviewing drilling applications. The California Independent Petroleum Association, which represents oil companies, countersued to block the settlement in a clear attempt to avoid stricter environmental requirements.

Under the proposed reforms, the city would hold a public hearing and conduct an evaluation of potential health and environmental consequences for each new drilling project, and require oil companies to mitigate any health hazards.

These are useful ideas but they fall short of the specific steps other cities and states have taken. Pennsylvania, for instance, bans drilling within 200 feet of a building, and unconventional gas drilling, including hydraulic fracturing, within 500 feet. In 2013, Dallas passed an ordinance banning drilling within 1,500 feet of homes. Scientists believe most air pollutants dissipate within about half a mile, or 2640 feet, from a drilling site.

Ultimately, a switch to renewable sources of energy is the only way to eliminate the effects of drilling on human health and the global climate. Last year, the Los Angeles City Council directed the Department of Water and Power to study how the city might make such a switch.

In the meantime, a buffer zone law would give people like Ms. Cabrera a measure of protection. ""I don't think it's fair that our communities are suffering through this just because of our income and our ethnicity,"" said Ms. Cabrera. ""We deserve to have healthy communities too."""

Now Testing the Waters: Wind Power
By DIANE CARDWELL
CORRECTION APPENDEDOnly a few years ago, the long-held dream of harnessing the strong, steady gusts off the Atlantic coast to make electricity seemed destined to remain just that. Proposals for offshore wind farms foundered on the shoals of high costs, regulatory hurdles and the fierce opposition of those who didn't want giant industrial machinery puncturing the pristine ocean views.

Now the industry is poised to take off, just as the American political landscape and energy policy itself face perhaps the greatest uncertainty in a generation.

Last fall, five turbines in the waters of Rhode Island -- the country's first offshore farm -- began delivering power to the grid. European energy developers like Statoil and Dong Energy are making big investments to bring projects to American waters. Last year in Massachusetts, Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, signed into law a mandate that is pushing development forward.

And in New York, after years of stymied progress, the Long Island Power Authority has reached an agreement with Deepwater Wind, which built the Rhode Island turbine array, to drop a much larger farm -- 15 turbines capable of running 50,000 average homes -- into the ocean about 35 miles from Montauk. If approved by the utility board on Wednesday, the $1 billion installation could become the first of several in a 256-square-mile parcel, with room for as many as 200 turbines, that Deepwater is leasing from the federal government.

""We're developing this first offshore wind project in federal waters, but it's really a gateway project to other locations around Long Island,"" said Thomas Falcone, the power authority's chief executive. ""We're now at a point where developers can build projects at prices where utilities are willing buyers, and to me that is a very big deal.""

These projects could also become an important test case in establishing just how far states can go to to pursue their clean energy agendas under the Trump administration. Before putting steel in the water, the project would need federal approvals and policies that are in doubt amid Washington's changing of the guard.

Wind power has finally become viable for a number of delicately interlaced reasons. It has taken favorable state policies and technological and economic advances to spur the current level of activity, as well as interest among developers and investors, including foreign oil and gas companies that see offshore wind as an important part of their corporate strategies. In Europe, where the offshore wind industry is far ahead of the United States', costs have plummeted to roughly half of what they were five years ago, said Thomas Brostrom, who runs United States operations for Dong Energy, the Danish oil and gas giant and a leading offshore wind developer.

As the industry has grown, manufacturers have been able to take advantage of economies of scale and cut their prices. At the same time, turbines have grown ever larger, allowing them to capture and produce more energy on the same site.

Dong hopes to help foster similar developments in the United States. The company bought leases in Massachusetts and New Jersey and opened an office in Boston. ""We are here to create an industry,"" Mr. Brostrom said. ""There's still a ways to go, but everything that we hoped would happen has happened.""

Dong has plenty of company. Statoil, the Norwegian fossil-fuel giant, has been aiming to get into the offshore business in the United States for years, and proposed in 2011 to build a farm off the Maine coast using floating platforms it had designed. The company withdrew the project two years later amid uncertainty over changing state policies, eventually deciding to build off the Scottish coast.

Now it is back, having won a 33-round auction to secure a 79,000-acre site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. Statoil beat out several other bidders, including the state's energy agency, Dong and a subsidiary of Iberdrola, a leading energy company based in Spain. Statoil pledged $42.5 million for the lease, which still awaits final approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, far more than the $16 million generated by all earlier offshore wind auctions combined.

""There's a lot of companies starting to invest that had been wary of the U.S. offshore wind market and some of the initial lease sales,"" said Walter Cruickshank, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. ""They have been coming to the table in a big way more recently.""

The appeal of offshore winds as an energy source goes beyond their potential role in efforts to slow global warming. As people flock to coastal cities, where land is scarce and expensive, and conventional power plants are moving toward retirement, states have looked to add new forms of power production. Moving it out to sea has become more attractive, proponents say.

The country's coasts, home to over half the population, offer some of the strongest wind resources in the world, creating, in theory, enough energy to provide roughly four times the power the nation now produces.

Though it is easier and cheaper to construct turbines on land, the East Coast in particular offers opportunity because of its strong winds and shallow waters, which means turbines can operate farther out to sea, and out of sight. The potential of offshore wind power converged with rising demand on Long Island's South Fork, where in areas like the Hamptons, commercial activity was rising and property owners were building larger houses, calling for more air-conditioning and more pool pumps.

In New York, the Long Island farm is part of a plan to meet Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's goal of drawing 50 percent of the state's power from renewable sources by 2030. That includes developing 2.4 gigawatts of offshore wind, he said in his State of the State address this month, by far the nation's highest target, equaling the capacity of the Niagara Falls generating station.

The wind array would not be visible from Montauk Point, and difficult to see from Martha's Vineyard, some 15 miles away, said Jeffrey Grybowski, Deepwater's chief executive. That makes it unlikely to stir the kind of public opposition that all but sank Cape Wind, the ambitious development that would have positioned 130 wind machines just five miles off Cape Cod but stalled in a political storm over blighted vistas.

The Rhode Island project allowed Deepwater to work through many of the obstacles that had been holding back the industry, Mr. Grybowski said, including the lack of an established permit process and acceptance on the part of the public and the electric companies. ""The Block Island project made offshore wind a reality in the United States,"" he said, ""so the conversations changed with utilities, who want to know that you can actually deliver on a project that you're proposing to them.""

Indeed, officials at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which approved the Cape Wind site in 2010, have spent years clarifying rules and identifying marine parcels suitable for wind power development in an effort to balance several often-competing concerns. Those include the needs of marine life and of industry, along with those of coastal communities. They also include the demand for economic development and clean energy sources, from states concerned about both job losses and climate change. Since 2013, the agency has conducted six competitive auctions of long-term leases for parcels from New England to Virginia, and in the past week it announced a seventh, for North Carolina, scheduled to take place in March.

Deepwater Wind first proposed the South Fork wind farm in response to a Long Island Power Authority solicitation for projects, but it was ultimately rejected by the authority's board in favor of several solar farms. The wind developer returned the next year with a new proposal that came close to approval a number of times, but fell short.

Now, however, executives have negotiated a contract that they expect the board to approve. Under it, the utility will purchase all of the electricity delivered from the turbines by an underwater transmission line to a substation in East Hampton, paying a price comparable to what it would pay for other utility-scaled renewables like onshore wind and solar, according to the utility. Those prices have run around 16 cents a kilowatt-hour, higher than its average wholesale price of 7.5 cents.

Deepwater plans to finance the project with a mix of loans and equity investments, though it is unclear if it will be able to benefit from federal tax credits that have spurred investment in wind farms and helped reduce the price of the power they produce. Until this year, a federal investment tax credit worth 30 percent of the development cost could be claimed. That has dropped to 24 percent for projects that begin this year and is set to be phased out by the end of 2019. To qualify, the project would need to demonstrate construction activity by then, which could be open to interpretation by the Treasury Department.

But wind developers and advocates say the credit is also important to red states in the middle of the country, where it has helped drive the spread of land-based wind farms. Nurturing an offshore wind industry would meet the stated goals of many Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration, including the pursuit of an ""all of the above"" energy program. Building and installing the wind machines could create thousands of new jobs, as it has in the land-based wind business, in manufacturing and construction. The project would also require special vessels and large onshore staging areas to assemble the components of the platforms and turbines, which could help the shipbuilding and port industries.

""We're a heavy industry that's poised to build, employ and invest,"" said Nancy Sopko, who manages advocacy and federal legislative affairs at the American Wind Industry Association.

That momentum may be difficult to slow, even if new federal policies put a stop to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's leasing activities for wind energy, its proponents say. The active leases alone, if developed, are enough to create an industry, they say. And the commitments of states like New York and Massachusetts, and experienced multinational developers, show that the struggle to harness Atlantic breezes is no longer the same as tilting at windmills.

""It is a sign of something that's inevitable, which is the addition of offshore wind into the energy mix,"" said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ""It's just going to be too appealing. In the end, the economics trump Trump.""

Correction: January 29, 2017, Sunday

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the future of offshore wind farms misidentified the agency that needs to sign off before Statoil can proceed with its plan for a wind farm site south of Jones Beach on Long Island. The remaining signoffs involve the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management -- not the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which have already approved the plan."

Philippines Moves to Shut Mines Accused of Polluting
By AURORA ALMENDRAL
CLAVER, Philippines -- The Philippine mining town of Claver is busy with bakeries, fruit stands, pool halls and karaoke bars. In the mountains nearby, bulldozers cling to treeless slopes, scooping out red soil and leaving gaping pits. On the horizon, cargo ships wait to bring nickel ore to China.

Many here are afraid that none of this will last.

""If the mines go, then the jobs are gone too,"" said Jayson Reambonanza, 31, who drives a dump truck for one of the area's many nickel mines.

The Philippines, which exports more nickel ore than any country in the world, is in the midst of a wide crackdown on mines accused of violating environmental protection laws.

In February, Gina Lopez, the acting secretary of the environment, said she was shutting down the operations of 28 of the country's 41 mining companies. Those companies, which account for about half of Philippine nickel production, have been accused of leaving rivers, rice fields and watersheds stained red with nickel laterite.

On Feb. 14, she followed up by canceling 75 contracts to develop new mines, in what she called a ""gift of love"" for the Filipino people.

And on Thursday, she said she would soon issue an order banning open-pit mines, calling the pollution of rivers with heavy metals ""a perpetual liability.""

""It is time for social justice,"" she said in announcing the initial ban in February. ""You cannot run your business and affect our farmers and fishermen.""

The crackdown has unnerved the mining industry; the people who depend on it have denounced the move as disastrous for the economy. They are joined in their opposition by indigenous tribes that stand to lose royalties paid by mining companies for use of their ancestral lands.

Environmentalists, religious groups and others have cheered the mine closings, saying that corruption has long given the mining industry free rein to pollute. Among the supporters is the country's popular president, Rodrigo Duterte.

""Sons of whores, look at what you're doing,"" Mr. Duterte said last month, addressing the mining companies. He has dismissed concerns about the potential loss of tax revenue from closed mines, saying, ""We can live without it.""

The costs are substantial. The government has estimated that 234,000 jobs could be lost. The mining industry says the closings would affect as many as 1.2 million people, including employees of companies that depend on the industry, like equipment suppliers.

The country's annual nickel ore production would fall as much as 50 percent, Ms. Lopez has said. Such a drop, analysts said, would dent global supply by 8 percent to 10 percent. A temporary increase in world nickel prices followed Ms. Lopez's announcement in February.

Many mines continue to operate while companies fight Ms. Lopez's orders in court. They are also opposing her permanent appointment as environment secretary, which Congress is expected to vote on next week. (In the Philippines, presidential appointees can run departments before they are confirmed, but they must step down if Congress votes against them.)

Ms. Lopez, a former environmental activist, said that her office was rushing to finalize the ban on open-pit mines before the confirmation hearing. ""I am not going to take the risk of not getting it done,"" she said in an interview on Thursday.

Government corruption has let Philippine mining companies skirt environmental regulations for decades, said Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace for Southeast Asia. The results have included deforestation, flattened mountaintops and heavy metal contamination of water and soil, said Mr. Sano, who called it shortsighted to focus on the benefits brought by the mining industry.

""The environmental impacts will outlive any benefit,"" he said.""They will outlive anyone.""

In Caraga, the region that includes Claver, where a nickel-mining boom began in the 2000s, both the benefits and the damage are apparent.

In the mountains surrounding the village of Barangay Magasang, an open-pit nickel mine is clearly visible, even though the village is in a watershed area, where mining is prohibited by law. Ronito Eresari, 42, a farmer in the village, said the river had been muddied with nickel laterite, making well water undrinkable and killing the freshwater mollusks that villagers once collected from the banks.

The companies responsible should be put out of business, Mr. Eresari said. ""I don't want to see them digging out our mountain,"" he said.

Romeo Lisano, 44, sees those companies very differently. Mr. Lisano is the datu, or chief, of a 17-family tribe of Lumad Mamanwa, an indigenous ethnic group that claims the mountains of Surigao del Norte in Caraga as its ancestral domain. Many men in his tribe lost their jobs on nickel ore barges after a Claver mining operation was suspended by Ms. Lopez in August.

Now the men strip rattan vines that women in the tribe weave into baskets or hammocks, to sell by the roadside along with orchids gathered by their children, Datu Lisano said. The tribe makes a fraction of what it did before, and the children have stopped going to school, he said.

""We came from the forest,"" Datu Lisano said, referring to the tribe's hunter-gatherer past. ""We don't want to go back to the forest.""

The mining companies also provide services that poor rural communities have come to rely on, like medical services, student scholarships and funding for infrastructure projects.

Ms. Lopez has proposed hiring former mine workers to rehabilitate the closed sites and establish environmentally friendly industries in mining areas.

The industry is regulated by the Mining and Geosciences Bureau, a division of the department now headed by Ms. Lopez. Its regional director for Caraga, Roger de Dios, denied that enforcement had been lax before the Duterte administration, saying the bureau had shut down mines before. ""If there's an imminent threat to the environment, we can suspend the mines,"" he said.

But Dr. Cielo Magno, an economist at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, who studies extractive industries, said that previous suspensions had amounted to slaps on the wrist, and that the industry had long operated with little oversight. The country has sound environmental laws, but the government's failure to ensure compliance is ""a huge problem,"" she said.

Many officials in Caraga responsible for monitoring the mines own businesses that benefit from the industry, like barge companies or bars in mining towns, said Danilo Adorador, a Caraga journalist. ""There's a clear conflict of interest there,"" he said.

Claver's mayor, Eddie P. Gokiangkee, is among the industry's critics. He said he was ""200 percent sure"" that bribery and corruption had undermined enforcement of environmental laws.

""I know this from observation,"" he said. ""It's very, very clear: The sea is red, the rivers are red. It shouldn't be that way if they are regulating it."" He said that he welcomed the tax revenue and supported responsible mining, but that he did not want Claver left with a ravaged environment once the nickel was gone.

Ronald S. Recidoro, vice president of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines, an industry lobbying group, said that any environmental infractions by mining companies had been ""very minor and do not warrant a closure or suspension."" He also accused Ms. Lopez of not being forthcoming about how companies were selected for shutdowns or suspensions.

Though Mr. Duterte is best known for his bloody antidrug campaign, he calls himself a progressive and has spoken out against abuses by the logging industry as well as the mining companies.

But activists say he has a mixed record on the environment. He signed the Paris agreement to address climate change only in March, after initially saying that he would not because it would interfere with development. He also recently approved new coal-fired power plants.

In Claver, even some of those who benefit directly from the mines support Ms. Lopez's actions.

A truck driver, Demetrius Orong, 27, said that if the mines closed, they would find other work. ""We were fine before the mines came,"" he said, ""and we'll be fine after they leave."""

A Push for Diesel Leaves London Gasping Amid Record Air Pollution
By KIMIKO de FREYTAS-TAMURA; Tatiana Schlossberg contributed reporting from New York.
LONDON -- Every winter, as if on cue, the coughing begins.

As soon as the weather turns cold, Tara Carey, an international aid worker living in London, ritually places cough syrup on her bedside table because she knows her sleep will be punctuated by hacking coughs. She also coughs at work. And she coughs while cycling to her office, on a road so toxic that for a brief period last month the air pollution there was greater than in infamously smoggy Beijing.

With her cough persisting winter after winter, Ms. Carey, 43, became worried she might have contracted tuberculosis during a work trip to Africa and sought medical help. She was shocked by the doctor's eventual diagnosis asthma.

In Ms. Carey's view, she said the only reasonable explanation for her illness was the pollution to which she was exposed over the last six years cycling through thick traffic on Brixton Road, one of London's busiest and most noxious routes.

You get a massive mouthful of fumes, she said, noting that asthma does not run in her family. But we don't really realize how much toxic air we breathe in because we're acclimatized to it. It's pernicious.

London is choking from record levels of pollution, much of it caused by diesel cars and trucks, as well as wood-burning fires in private homes, a growing trend. It has been bad enough to evoke comparisons to the Great Smog of December 1952, when fumes from factories and house chimneys are thought to have killed as many as 12,000 Londoners.

That crisis led to the landmark Clean Air Act in 1956.

London's air pollution today is different from seven decades ago, and more insidious. No longer thick as pea soup, as it was traditionally described, the city's air is now laced with nitrogen dioxide -- a toxic gas mostly produced by vehicles with diesel engines.

The pollution is linked to 23,500 deaths in Britain each year, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Britain has the highest number of annual deaths from nitrogen dioxide in the European Union after Italy, European Union statistics show.

On Wednesday, the European Union ordered five members, including Britain, to reduce car pollution levels or risk being sent to the European Court of Justice where they could face huge financial penalties.

The current problem is, in part, an unintended consequence of previous efforts to aid the environment.

The British government provided financial incentives to encourage a shift to diesel engines because laboratory tests suggested that would cut harmful emissions and combat climate change. Yet, it turned out that diesel cars emit on average five times as much emissions in real-world driving conditions as in the tests, according to a British Department for Transport study.

No one at the time thought of the consequences of increased nitrogen dioxide emissions from diesel, and the policy of incentivizing diesel was so successful that an awful lot of people bought diesel cars, said Anna Heslop, a lawyer at ClientEarth, an environmental law firm that last year forced the British government to produce a better plan to improve air quality.

Air pollution is a more significant public health hazard in China, India and Eastern Europe, where the average annual levels of PM2.5 pollution, the fine soot particles and molecules that pose the greatest danger to health, are up to 10 times as high as in London.

But in mid-January in Brixton, the area in south London where Ms. Carey lives, hourly mean levels of PM2.5 were higher than in Beijing. And over just five days in January, Brixton exceeded the European Union's nitrogen dioxide legal limit for the entire year.

London last month was put on a very high pollution alert for the first time ever, as cold air and a stationary weather pattern failed to clear the toxic air caused by diesel traffic, as well as by the high use of open fires, which contribute to about 10 percent of pollutants in winter months.

The time will come when we'll start wearing masks like in China, Ray Hussain, 73, said as he waited for his bus on Brixton Road one recent morning. At nearly any point during the rush, 16 double-decker buses lined the road. Traffic was snarled, and whiffs of acrid air stung the eyes.

Mr. Hussain checked Airvisual, an air pollution tracking app on his smartphone. Brixton's air quality that day was called Good, in green lettering. Just below, Hyderabad, a city in India, had a red Unhealthy label and a picture of a person wearing a face mask.

The local authorities are scrambling to defuse what many consider a ticking time bomb for public health.

Some schools are considering handing out gas masks to pupils, saying children's lungs are in danger of being stunted. More than 440 schools are in areas exceeding legal air quality levels, according to Mayor Sadiq Khan of London.

Earlier this month, London's Metropolitan Police announced a plan to introduce about 300 environmentally friendly cars, including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and hybrid electric cars, as part of a fleet overhaul.

On Friday, Mr. Khan, who has adult-onset asthma, announced that in October he would introduce in central London a toxicity charge, a $12-a-day tax for the most polluting vehicles, typically diesel- and gasoline-powered automobiles registered before 2006.

He also plans in 2019 to expand central London's low-emission zone across the capital, charging drivers of polluting vehicles $15 a day to enter. London has had a congestion charge since 2003 to reduce traffic, but the fee's impact on emissions is unclear.

Mr. Khan is also planning 12 low-emission bus zones across the city that would allow only hybrid or electric buses on certain bus routes, including in Brixton.

London has encouraged people to use bicycles more, but there is a growing debate over whether bike lanes make congestion and pollution worse by forcing more cars into fewer lanes and increasing the amount of time they remain stationary. Some people have also suggested that bicycle commuters are exposing themselves to harm by being too close to exhaust-emitting cars.

Researchers from the London School of Medicine say that cyclists inhale more than twice the amount of black carbon particles as pedestrians making the same trip.

Rob Flello, a Labour member of Parliament, said bike lanes may not be as green as they are made out to be. The transfer to two wheels clearly hasn't solved many problems, he told the Independent newspaper in January. Cambridge, where half the residents cycle at least once a week, became one of the most congested places in the country, he said.

Air quality campaigners support Mr. Khan's efforts to create clean air zones that restrict the dirtiest cars. But activists also are pushing the government to give diesel drivers financial help to switch to cleaner vehicles.

Half of Britain's private cars are diesel. Despite the health warnings, the latest figures show that the total number of diesel vehicles licensed in London grew from 601,456 in 2012 to 774,513 in 2015, a 29 percent increase.

Mr. Khan has asked the government to set up a national fund worth 500 million pounds, or about $620 million, that would pay drivers and cab owners to buy cleaner vehicles.

Bob Miller, 69, a cabdriver who has crisscrossed London for 30 years, wasn't convinced. He has lost faith in recommendations by policy makers and experts, he said.

We were told how wonderful diesel is, how they were supposed to be cleaner than petrol, Mr. Miller said, idling his cab in heavy traffic with the window open.

The experts make the rules, then they're wrong, he said, shaking his head. I give up."

NONFICTION

Our Invasive Species
By ROBERT SULLIVAN
THE UNNATURAL WORLD

""The Unnatural World"" is a travelogue with that good human epoch in mind, a trip around the world to meet people working out new ways for humanity to live as well as survive. At the University of Leicester, the paleobiologist describes the man-made fossils that mark human presence -- the stratum of plastics, soot and radionuclides that stain the Earth everywhere from lake bottoms to mountaintops. ""Massive technofossils like London and Shanghai will call out to the future: Something was here!"" Biello writes.

Indeed, the defining feature of the new world is a tangle of what we consider natural and what we don't, nature not ended but morphed. In Maryland, Biello visits a landscape ecologist who has pioneered investigations of human interactions with ecosystems, mapping various anthropogenic biomes, concluding that people are, in Biello's words, ""the world's most (successful) invasive species."" Biello follows along as this ecologist programs drones to monitor forests in the anthropogenic biome known as suburban Maryland, refining ways to measure and manage relatively new landscapes. ""The threat is us, the solution is in us,"" Biello writes.

He maintains a kind of upbeat morbidity while describing a database of extinct creatures' genomes, everything from mammoths to giant beavers: ""Tough decisions have to be made about what species to save outright, what species to save for later by freezing genetic data that may come in handy, and what species to, with due respect, allow to perish, as has been the norm on this ever-changing planet for billions of years."" Yet work to revive particular species inevitably comes off as the sort of hubristic scientific thinking that got us into this Anthropocene era to begin with. Biello notes complications. Say we brought back sky-darkening flocks of passenger pigeons, extinct since 1914: Would we need to revive the American chestnut trees (gone by way of an invasive fungus) that provided their food?

Cities might be our greatest invention as creatures; they are where we herd, reflecting how we think, our shining hope as far as handling our own growth is concerned. How we manage the metabolic intake and output of cities is likely to determine the way that future archaeologists debate the merits of human civilization in whatever comes after the Anthropocene. To consider cities, Biello travels to China, talking to a lawyer at the local environmental protection bureau in Rizhao, a city on the Yellow Sea coast that hopes to be carbon neutral one day. ""I don't know when we will succeed, but we will move in that way,"" the lawyer says. Biello examines ways China uses waste as an energy source -- America take heed, or mourn, given the Trump administration's stated attitudes toward carbon reduction -- as well as the Chinese government's trade-off of shoddily built nuclear power plants for less smog.

""The Unnatural World"" is detail-packed, almost to a fault, but a dramatic high point comes when Biello recounts how a man living in the United States (him) fares as an Anthropocenic Homo sapiens, which is either really impressive or really distressing, depending on your scruples: ""The average American uses 90 kilograms of stuff each day, day in and day out. We consume 25 percent of the world's energy despite being 5 percent of the world's population. We lust for the latest gadget, which hides away minerals wrested from beneath the Congo, among other places, deep in its innards.""

Managing the Anthropocene, then, comes down to issues of economic inequality, and given the tech obsession in wealthier nations, it's hardly surprising that a book by a first worlder dwells on technological fixes like geoengineering. (I found myself imagining an Anthropocene that ends well when Bruce Willis in his spaceship saves us all.) In Germany, Biello meets Victor Smetacek, who attempted in 2009 to dust the Indian Ocean with 20 metric tons of iron sulfate, in the hope that proliferating plankton blooms would suck carbon from the atmosphere. He and his team were forced to turn back, for fear of plankton farming unleashing another greenhouse gas (methane), or perhaps causing an ocean dead zone. In the New Jersey Palisades, Biello inspects a carbon injection process, in which carbon dioxide is sucked from the air and pumped underground, filling sandstone crevices, a sort of reverse frack. In this case, as in most geoengineering schemes in the Anthropocene, environmental fixes beget concerns, which (perhaps) beget new fixes.

Eventually, Biello winds up looking to Silicon Valley for a titanium bullet. Vinod Khosla, the billionaire who co-founded Sun Microsystems, exhorts us to seek, in Biello's words, ""rare innovation,"" the kind of ""black swan"" idea ""that goes on to have extreme impact"" -- though this is how venture capitalists think as opposed to scientists, who rely on communities of data gatherers. ""Experts are as good as dart-throwing monkeys,"" Khosla declares. Then, as if jet-lagged, Biello concludes with thoughts on Pope Francis (for his cautionary words on technology) and Elon Musk (for being Musk). ""We are living in a quest that he has devised,"" Biello writes about Musk, ""even if it isn't entirely original to him -- electric cars and solar power to clean up this planet and rockets to spread life to another one.""

The Tesla may not pollute Palo Alto, but the production of all its components and construction, involving graphite, lithium and cobalt mining, aren't so great for the rest of the world. We don't need rare innovations so much as old-fashioned political tools. Almost everybody knows what's going on with the climate, even the most carbon-guilty: The oil company Exxon, while dismissing scientists' evidence of climate warming, worried in the 1980s about the effect of a climate-induced rise in sea levels on its offshore rigs. Likewise, just about everybody knows that things can be changed. Biello cites London's 1821 decision to build underground sewers to stop deadly cholera outbreaks, a project that was completed in six short years.

At this point, if there's any hope for a ""good human epoch,"" it has less to do with technology than with imagining new power structures. ""Local people, their voice is never heard,"" a China-based official with Rare, an N.G.O. that works with indigenous people, tells Biello. In the United States, the Standing Rock Sioux's protest of the Dakota Access pipeline through their watershed is a good example of what stewardship might look like in the Anthropocene, and Biello touches on this when he visits the Naxi in the Yunnan Province of China. He meets a young Naxi woman who fights the government on behalf of her own local ecology, or anthropogenic biome. ""The world gets better when women are empowered rather than marginalized,"" he writes. ""More economic growth, better health, less environmental destruction all go hand in hand with free women."" The roots of our cataclysm, in other words, lie in the machinery of economic and social justice. The sooner we recognize this, the sooner we can enact meaningful change."

Climate Policy Faces Reversal by New Leader
By CORAL DAVENPORT; Justin Gillis contributed reporting from Christchurch, New Zealand, Vanessa Piao from Beijing, and Ellen Barry from New Delhi.
CORRECTION APPENDEDWASHINGTON -- For a look at how sharply policy in Washington will change under the administration of Donald J. Trump, look no further than the environment.

Mr. Trump has called human-caused climate change a ""hoax."" He has vowed to dismantle the Environmental Protection Agency ""in almost every form.""

And in an early salvo against one of President Obama's signature issues, Mr. Trump has named Myron Ebell of the business-backed Competitive Enterprise Institute to head his E.P.A. transition team. Mr. Ebell has asserted that whatever warming caused by greenhouse gas pollution is modest and could be beneficial. A 2007 Vanity Fair profile of Mr. Ebell called him an ""oil industry mouthpiece.""

Global warming may indeed be the sharpest example of how policy in Washington will change under a Trump administration. President Obama has said his efforts to establish the United States as the global leader in climate policy are his proudest legacy.

But if Mr. Trump makes good on his campaign promises, experts in climate change policy warn, that legacy would unravel quickly. The world, then, may have no way to avoid the most devastating consequences of global warming, including rising sea levels, extreme droughts and food shortages, and more powerful floods and storms.

Mr. Trump has already vowed to ""cancel"" last year's Paris climate agreement, which commits more than 190 countries to reduce their emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution, and to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama's domestic climate change regulations.

""If Trump steps back from that, it makes it much less likely that the world will ever meet that target, and essentially ensures we will head into the danger zone,"" said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces global reports on the state of climate science.

Mr. Trump cannot legally block other countries from fulfilling their Paris agreement commitments, nor can he quickly or unilaterally erase Mr. Obama's climate rules.

But he can, as president, choose not to carry out the Paris plan in the United States. And he could so substantially slow or weaken the enforcement of Mr. Obama's rules that they would have little impact on reducing emissions in the United States, at least during Mr. Trump's term.

That could doom the Paris agreement's goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions enough to stave off an atmospheric warming of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which, many scientists say, the planet will be locked into an irreversible future of extreme and dangerous warming.

Without the full participation of the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, after China, that goal is probably unattainable, even if every other country follows through on its pledges.

And, the experts say, without the participation of the United States, other governments are less likely to carry out their pledged emissions cuts.

""That target is already extremely difficult to achieve, but it could be done with very hard, very diligent work by every single country,"" Mr. Oppenheimer said.

The election of Mr. Trump is likely to cast a pall over Marrakesh, Morocco, where global negotiators have gathered for a 12-day conference to hash out the next steps for the Paris accord: how to verify commitments are being met, and how to pay for enforcement by poor countries that cannot afford the technology or energy disruptions.

Traveling in New Zealand, Secretary of State John Kerry was asked if he still planned to attend the conference, given the results of the election.

""I'm absolutely going to Marrakesh, perhaps even more important,"" he said. ""And I look forward to being there very, very much.""

Pessimism appears to be warranted. Mr. Oppenheimer and other climate policy experts said all major emitters needed to take action in the near term to stave off the 3.6-degree increase.

Scientific reports released over the last two years have concluded that the measurable warming of the planet because of human activities has already begun. This year is on track to be the hottest on record, blasting past the previous records set in 2015 and 2014.

An analysis by Climate Interactive, a scientific think tank that provides data used by many governments, concluded that the policies by the United States would account for about 20 percent of the expected greenhouse gas reductions under the Paris plan from 2016 to 2030. But absent the expected policy actions in the United States under the Trump administration, scientists at Climate Interactive said, the math of emissions reductions will be much more difficult to maintain.

""Pessimists will find abundant support for despair this morning,"" John Sterman, a professor of system dynamics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote in a Climate Interactive analysis on Wednesday morning.

""With Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and Republican majorities in both houses,"" Mr. Sterman wrote, ""there is little hope that the Clean Power Plan will survive in the Supreme Court or for federal action to meet the U.S. commitment under the Paris accord. Worse, other key emitter nations -- especially India -- now have little reason to follow through on their Paris pledges: If the U.S. won't, why should developing nations cut their emissions?""

The Clean Power Plan is the ambitious centerpiece of Mr. Obama's climate change legacy and the key to his commitment under the Paris accord. At its heart is a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to curb planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants. If enacted, the rules could transform the American electricity sector, close hundreds of coal-fired plants and usher in the construction of vast new wind and solar farms. The plan is projected to cut United States power plant emissions 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.

But the program is currently under litigation by 28 states and more than 100 companies, and it is expected to go before the Supreme Court as early as next year.

Mr. Trump and other Republicans have attacked the Clean Power Plan as a ""war on coal."" As president, Mr. Trump would not have the legal authority to unilaterally undo the regulations, which were put forth by the E.P.A. under a provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act.

However, Mr. Trump could target the rules by appointing an industry-friendly justice to the Supreme Court and then refusing to defend the plan when it goes before the court.

He could also direct the E.P.A. to reissue the plan to be extremely friendly to industry. Such a move would also be subject to lawsuits by environmental advocates, which would further drag out the process. And in concert with congressional Republicans, he could decimate the E.P.A.'s budget, crippling its rule-making capacity.

""They may still have to have a regulation, but they don't have to do it the way the Obama administration did it,"" said Jeff Holmstead, a former E.P.A. official in the George W. Bush administration. ""And in the meantime, those suits often go on for years and years.""

Even if Mr. Trump ultimately fails to gut Mr. Obama's climate change rules, he could ensure that their enforcement is delayed through his term, as lawsuits wind their way through the courts.

Mr. Trump would face difficulties in his plans to eliminate the E.P.A., although it is likely he could substantively reduce its size. He would need approval from Congress to completely erase the agency, said Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University and a former counselor to Mr. Obama.

Ms. Freeman noted that several major environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, specifically call for rules to be enacted and overseen by the E.P.A. Changing those decades-old rules would also require action from Congress, and Senate Democrats would certainly block such efforts -- unless Senate Republican leaders opt to scuttle what is left of filibuster rules already weakened by Democrats.

In China, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, climate change officials said they intended to continue with plans to cut carbon emissions regardless of Mr. Trump's plans. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has vowed under the Paris agreement that Chinese emissions will drop after 2030, and that China will put in place a national system next year to force companies to pay a fee for their carbon pollution.

""China's attitude toward low-carbon development, as President Xi Jinping has said when he met with Secretary of State Kerry earlier, is that tackling climate change is not something anybody asks us to do,"" Chai Qimin, a Chinese negotiator, said in an emailed response from the Marrakesh talks. ""It's what we want to do.""

But in India, the world's third-largest greenhouse gas polluter, the election of Mr. Trump has raised doubts about a willingness to move forward. Under the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, pledged that rich countries would mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries make the transition to cleaner forms of energy. Indian officials have made clear that their steps to cut emissions will depend on financial aid from rich countries, but Mr. Trump has also vowed to cut all ""global warming payments.""

""I think most certainly it will affect the momentum in negotiations because it throws up a lot of questions,"" said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi policy group.

""The chances of public funds coming from climate finance are much more dismal now,"" he said. ""Right now I don't feel very optimistic.""

Climate Change; Upending Curbs
By CORAL DAVENPORT
WASHINGTON -- The shift in Washington comes just as the United States has been assuming a leadership role in combating climate change, and it will almost certainly upend the world's efforts to curb the impact of global warming.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied the science of human-caused climate change, incorrectly calling it ""fictional"" and saying it was a hoax created by the Chinese. He has said that he will do everything in his power to undo Mr. Obama's ambitious domestic and international climate change policies.

While some legal and procedural roadblocks would impede a complete gutting of Mr. Obama's existing climate change regulations, Mr. Trump could significantly weaken or slow them. And in sending a message to the rest of the world that the United States does not intend to enact a climate change agenda, the Trump presidency could cause reluctant governments such as those in India and Poland to slow or weaken their efforts to cut planet-warming emissions.

Mr. Trump has vowed to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement, the 2015 deal in which nearly every country put forth plans to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. In fact, it is not possible for a world leader to unilaterally block or undo the accord, nor would it be possible for the United States to legally withdraw from it for at least the first term of a Trump administration. That is because with Mr. Obama and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urging other countries to ratify the accord rapidly, it entered into legal force last week. Any country wishing to withdraw must wait four years to do so.

But even though the United States, the world's second-largest source of greenhouse-gas emissions, remains legally bound to the Paris plan for four years, there will be no legal consequences or economic sanctions if Mr. Trump does not follow through with the Obama administration's commitment. Under the accord, Mr. Obama promised that the United States would cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, largely through a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants.

Mr. Trump could not immediately block the E.P.A. rules, but over the course of his administration he could ensure that they are weakened or rolled back. Currently, the rules are facing a legal challenge by 28 states and dozens of companies, and the case is expected to go before the Supreme Court as soon as next year. By appointing an industry-friendly Supreme Court justice and failing to argue for the rules, President Trump could weigh the court against them. He could also direct the E.P.A. to rewrite the regulations to be far more lax.

Beyond Mr. Trump's remarks challenging the science of climate change, he has taken steps to translate those views into policy. The head of environmental policy on his transition team is Myron Ebell, who directs energy and environment policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, and has gained national prominence for his polarizing skepticism of climate science. Also informing Mr. Trump's transition team is Michael McKenna, an influential Republican energy lobbyist who has urged Republican lawmakers to deny climate science.

OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR

A Pipeline to Climate Disaster
By BILL McKIBBEN
MIDDLEBURY, Vt. -- The Native Americans who have spent the last months in peaceful protest against an oil pipeline along the banks of the Missouri are standing up for tribal rights. They're also standing up for clean water, environmental justice and a working climate. And it's time that everyone else joined in.

The shocking images of the National Guard destroying tepees and sweat lodges and arresting elders this week remind us that the battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline is part of the longest-running drama in American history -- the United States Army versus Native Americans. In the past, it's almost always ended horribly, and nothing we can do now will erase a history of massacres, stolen land and broken treaties. But this time, it can end differently.

Those heroes on the Standing Rock reservation, sometimes on horseback, have peacefully stood up to police dogs, pepper spray and the bizarre-looking militarized tanks and SWAT teams that are the stuff of modern policing. (Modern and old-fashioned both: The pictures of German shepherds attacking are all too reminiscent of photos from, say, Birmingham, Ala., in 1963.)

The courage of those protesters managed to move the White House enough that the government called a temporary halt to construction. But the forces that want it finished -- Big Oil, and its allies in parts of the labor movement -- are strong enough that the respite may be temporary.

In coming weeks, activists will respond to calls from the leaders at Standing Rock by gathering at the offices of banks funding the pipeline, and at the offices of the Army Corps of Engineers, for protest and civil disobedience. Two dozen big banks have lent money to the pipeline project, even though many of them have also adopted elaborate environmental codes. As for the Corps, that's the agency that helped ""expedite"" the approval of the pipeline -- and must still grant the final few permits.

The vast movement of people across the country who mobilized to block fossil-fuel projects like the Keystone pipeline and Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic need to gather once more. This time, their message must be broader still.

There are at least two grounds for demanding a full environmental review of this pipeline, instead of the fast-track approvals it has received so far. The first is the obvious environmental racism of the whole project.

Originally, the pipeline was supposed to cross the Missouri just north of Bismarck, until people pointed out that a leak there would threaten the drinking water supply for North Dakota's second biggest city. The solution, in keeping with American history, was obvious: make the crossing instead just above the Standing Rock reservation, where the poverty rate is nearly three times the national average. This has been like watching the start of another Flint, Mich., except with a chance to stop it.

The second is that this is precisely the kind of project that climate science tells us can no longer be tolerated. In midsummer, the Obama administration promised that henceforth there would be a climate test for new projects before they could be approved. That promise was codified in the Democratic platform approved by Hillary Clinton's campaign, which says there will be no federal approval for any project that ""significantly exacerbates"" global warming.

The review of the Dakota pipeline must take both cases into account.

So far, the signs are not good. There has been no word from the White House about how long the current pause will last. Now, the company building the pipeline has pushed the local authorities to remove protesters from land where construction has already desecrated indigenous burial sites, with law enforcement agents using Tasers, batons, mace and ""sound cannons.""

From the Clinton campaign, there's been simply an ugly silence, perhaps rooted in an unwillingness to cross major contributors like the Laborers' International Union of North America, which has lashed out against the many other, larger unions that oppose the project. But that silence won't make the issue go away: Sioux protesters erected a tepee in her Brooklyn campaign office on Thursday. If Mrs. Clinton is elected on Nov. 8, this will be the new president's first test on environmental and human rights.

What's happening along the Missouri is of historic consequence. That message should reverberate not just on the lonely high plains, but in our biggest cities, too. Native Americans have carried the fight, but they deserve backup from everyone with a conscience; other activists should join the protest at bank headquarters, Army Corps offices and other sites of entrenched power.

The Native Americans are the only people who have inhabited this continent in harmony with nature for centuries. Their traditional wisdom now chimes perfectly with the latest climate science. The only thing missing are the bodies of the rest of us joining in their protest. If we use them wisely, a fresh start is possible."

Appeals Court Hears Challenge to Obama's Climate Change Regulations
By CORAL DAVENPORT
WASHINGTON -- The nation's second-most powerful court grappled Tuesday with the intractable and potentially catastrophic problem of climate change, weighing whether constitutional questions surrounding President Obama's climate change regulations should trump the moral obligations of upholding a plan to curb global warming.

The president's Clean Power Plan generated intense interest as the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard oral arguments over West Virginia vs. E.P.A., the lawsuit filed by 28 states and hundreds of companies and industry groups against the Obama administration's climate rules. People camped overnight in the rain outside the federal courthouse to grab seats before arguments began.

And those arguments took on a lofty tone as the judges considered the administration's actions in the wake of Mr. Obama's failure with Congress. The administration has fallen back on the 46-year-old Clean Air Act to justify emissions controls Congress would not pass.

""The policy is laudable,"" said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a George W. Bush appointee. ""The earth is warming. Humans are contributing. I understand the international impact and the problem of the commons. The pope's involved. And I understand the frustration with Congress.""

But, he said: ""If Congress does this, they can account for the people who lose their jobs. If we do this, we can't.""

A Justice Department lawyer, Eric Hostetler, agreed that the Clean Air Act had rarely been used in the way the administration is trying. But, he said, ""Just because you haven't used the fire extinguisher in your house doesn't mean you shouldn't use it if your house is burning down.""

Administration officials have expressed optimism about the outcome of the case. The federal panel -- with six judges appointed by Democratic presidents and four by Republicans -- appears to benefit their side. Even if the panel splits, 5 to 5, the regulation would stand, pending an almost certain appeal to the Supreme Court.

Supporters, opponents and judges all painted a picture of Mr. Obama's climate policy as sweeping and historic.

""This is a huge case,"" Judge Kavanaugh said. ""It has huge economic and political consequences. This has huge international consequences.""

But opponents, led by West Virginia's solicitor general, Elbert Lin, described a regulation with a scope that far exceeds the intent of the law in an effort to transform the nation's electricity system.

""The E.P.A. has invoked a little-used provision in the Clean Air Act and used it to justify creation of a new energy economy,"" Mr. Lin told the judges.

The Environmental Protection Agency relied on an obscure provision of the Clean Air Act, Section 111 (d), last year to put forth an aggressive rule aimed at cutting planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels.

Traditionally, when the E.P.A. puts forth such a pollution reduction rule, it includes a requirement for polluting entities to purchase existing technology, such as smokestack ""scrubbers,"" to cut pollution. But no such commercially available technology exists for reducing carbon dioxide.

Instead, the E.P.A. has assigned each state a target to cut emissions, and asked states to come up with comprehensive plans to do so. To meet those targets, most states would have to shut down polluting coal-fired electric plants and replace them with clean sources like wind and solar. The rule is also intended to push states to institute interstate ""cap-and-trade"" systems, allowing polluters to buy and sell allowances to pollute. If states do not produce rules, the E.P.A. will impose its own state plan, which is expected to follow the cap-and-trade model.

Mr. Obama tried but failed to push a cap-and-trade bill through Congress in 2010. Opponents of the Clean Power Plan argued that Mr. Obama was using his executive authority to push through a policy he could not persuade Congress to enact.

""Why isn't this debate going on on the floor of the Senate instead of with a group of unelected officials?"" asked Judge Thomas Griffith, a George W. Bush appointee.

Among the most prominent opponents of the plan is Laurence H. Tribe, a constitutional authority who was Mr. Obama's mentor at Harvard Law School.

""This action by the E.P.A. is impermissible,"" Mr. Tribe told the court.

Judge David Tatel, an Obama appointee, appeared to disagree. He likened the rule to the Americans With Disabilities Act, in which the federal government set standards for states to make public spaces accessible to people with disabilities, and supplied states with federally devised plans for doing so. Tribe pushed back at that comparison.

""Imagine if Congress had been unable to pass the Americans With Disabilities Act, as it was unable to pass cap-and-trade, and if instead that same agency told states they had to each pass a mini-A.D.A., and said if they don't, we will use executive authority to put it into place?"" he said.

Both judges and lawyers also weighed the wider implications of a global warming policy. The Clean Power Plan gave Mr. Obama the leverage to negotiate the Paris Agreement, the first global climate change deal committing nearly every country to some action to lower planet-warming emissions.

The rule comes in the context of ""the most urgent environmental threat our nation has ever faced,"" Mr. Hostetler said.

Judge Sri Srinivasan, who has been mentioned as a possible nominee to the Supreme Court should Hillary Clinton be elected president, noted that the Clean Air Act and subsequent Supreme Court statute gave the E.P.A. broad authority to regulation carbon dioxide.

""You wouldn't dispute that Congress delegates authority to regulate carbon dioxide from power plants,"" he said. ""This is a way to regulate carbon dioxide.""

Opponents also brought up a question about the rule raised by clerical error in a 1990 update of the Clean Air Act. That update accidentally included conflicting versions of the amendment. There is a House version, which by some readings could forbid the E.P.A. from regulating carbon dioxide from power plants if it also regulates other pollutants under a different section of the law. A Senate version would more clearly appear to permit double regulation. But the frustrated judges seemed to find the matter unclear.

Judge Kavanaugh told Mr. Lin that his justification, in the legal briefings, for reading only the House provision ""is a hall of mirrors.""

He added, ""I needed a drink after going through all your footnotes."""
NYT-3.txt,"Managing Greece’s debts
JULY 12, 2015

Re “It’s time for Greece to go” (Opinion, July 8): Jochen Bittner expresses indignation that debt relief would constitute a moral hazard violating contractual commitments to Greece’s creditors. Debt restructuring, where necessary, has been an essential strategy of the United States and world economies for enabling corporations, municipalities and nations to rehabilitate rather than fail. Corporations and municipalities are allowed to file for bankruptcy and restructure their debts. Germany restructured its debts in 1953, and debt restructuring was essential to the Brady Plan for Latin America. Debt restructuring necessarily involves a revision of contractual commitments, but it allows economies to get back on their feet. Greece has made extreme sacrifices even as it endures depression-like hardships, but all the reforms in the world cannot enable it to rehabilitate without debt restructuring. Why is it so hard to extend to Greece the same opportunities that were given to Germany, large corporations and other states?

David S. Elkind, Greenwich, Conn.

I believe the best thing to do now would be not only to forgive Greek debts but also to ask them to leave the eurozone as well — in a phased manner, say over the next five years. Greece doesn’t appear to have the ability to pay its debts, nor will more austerity improve the situation. This option would give the Greeks a fresh start outside the eurozone — and go a long ways toward preventing this kind of problem from recurring. The Greeks need to stop holding the rest of the world economy hostage in order to solve their problems.

Emmanuel Sunil, Delft, Netherlands

The financiers who made the irresponsible decisions to loan the money to Greece have already made their profits and insulated themselves from future losses. All things considered, the bankers would experience nothing more than nominal losses, if that. It would be the European taxpayers, the 99 percent, who would have to take it on the chin.

Why should we fault the Greek people for their civil, democratic stand against a very uncivil financial process? Germany, Greece’s chief antagonist, never repaid its debts from the two great wars of the 20th century it instigated. Much of Germany’s current economic strength has its foundation in forgiven national debt.

The pope and climate change

Re “The pope’s beautiful, misguided ideas” (June 24): David Brooks critiques the papal encyclical, “Laudato Si’,” for an insensitivity to the apparent economic benefits of fracking and natural gas. Citing business assessments and vague environmental evaluations, Mr. Brooks chides the Vatican and the encyclical for undervaluing scientific and technological advancement.

As a contributor to the encyclical, I read it quite differently. A key quote is that a “revolution is needed to combat climate change” because the world “is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth.” Here the encyclical is calling for an investment in and a mobilization of science, technology and policy to preserve the planet and to improve the lives of the poor.


SEE SAMPLE PRIVACY POLICY
Globally we have an outstanding technical base to decarbonize energy systems to address issues from energy poverty to climate change. But without equal attention to the moral and long-term vision of the planet and society we want, how to use those resources remains unclear. While fracking may look, to some, to be a short-term panacea, a true energy and environmental accounting reveals the need to transition from, not simply extend, the reign of fossil fuels. With fracking under aggressive acceleration in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico and elsewhere, we need that compass most urgently.

Daniel Kammen, Berkeley, Calif.

The writer is a professor of energy at the University of California and founding director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory.

Pope Francis’ ideas on the environment are not only beautiful but far from misguided. Those who create pollution are rarely obliged to pay for its removal. Technological advances improve productivity, but the gains are not distributed fairly, with massive unemployment of no concern to factory owners who reap the profits. The environmental problems of California — water mismanagement, automobile congestion and air pollution — cannot be solved by market-based solutions like corrupt cap-and-trade programs. Likewise, Mr. Brooks’s argument that fracking has produced important economic and environmental advances fails to take into account the many harmful side effects of this industry that has led to its banning in many countries.

Henry Meyerhoff, Lucinges, France

Brazil’s unfinished work

Re “Shaken optimism in Brazil” (Opinion, June 24): Antonio Prata’s article brings up the interesting point that increases in income and economic success aren’t the only important factors for evaluating how well a country is helping the poor. Brazil’s health care and education systems have not improved at the same rate as income has for the poor. Both health care and education are important institutions to improve so that more of the poor will have access to them and so that reductions in poverty will continue over the long term. It is vital for Brazil to see through the institutional improvements that will truly make it the country of the future.

Trump Urges More Drilling and Few Rules
By ASHLEY PARKER and CORAL DAVENPORT; Ashley Parker reported from Bismarck, and Coral Davenport from Washington.
BISMARCK, N.D. -- Donald J. Trump traveled Thursday to the heart of America's oil and gas boom, where he called for more fossil fuel drilling and fewer environmental regulations while vowing to ""cancel the Paris climate agreement,"" the 2015 accord committing nearly every nation to taking action to curb climate change.

Laying out his positions on energy and the environment at an oil industry conference in North Dakota, he vowed to rescind President Obama's signature climate change rules and revive construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring petroleum from Canada's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries.

It was the latest in a series of recent policy addresses, including on Israel and foreign policy, intended to position Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul and reality show star, as credible on substantive issues now that he is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.

But experts remain skeptical of Mr. Trump's command of the complexities of the global energy economy. And he made claims, such as a promise to restore jobs lost in coal mining, that essentially defy free-market forces.

""Many of his proposals thus far don't seem to appreciate the complex forces that drive the energy system,"" said Richard G. Newell, an energy economist at Duke University who has closely followed Mr. Trump's remarks.

Mr. Trump's decision to set his speech in North Dakota was politically strategic. He began the day fewer than 30 delegates shy of clinching the nomination, and on Thursday, he reached the required 1,237-delegate threshold with the help of unpledged delegates in the state who moved to support him.

Mr. Trump asked North Dakota's Republican congressman, Kevin Cramer, to suggest energy policies before the speech.

A central question confronting the next president will be how to address climate change. Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly denied the established science that climate change is caused by humans, vowed in his speech to undo many of Mr. Obama's initiatives.

He did not explicitly address the scientific legitimacy of human-caused climate change, but said, ""We're going to deal with real environmental challenges, not the phony ones we've been hearing about.""

Mr. Trump said that in his first 100 days in office, he would ""rescind"" Environmental Protection Agency regulations established under Mr. Obama to curb planet-warming emissions from coal-fired power plants.

""Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones -- how stupid is that?"" Mr. Trump said.

However, the next president will not have the legal authority to unilaterally rescind the climate rules, which are now being litigated in federal courts. If, as is widely expected, the case goes to the Supreme Court, the justices, rather than the president, will determine its fate. But if elected, Mr. Trump could nominate a new Supreme Court justice to help strike down the rule.

Mr. Trump's threats to unravel the Paris Agreement could carry more weight.

In his speech, he complained, inaccurately: ""This agreement gives foreign bureaucrats control over how much energy we use on our land, in our country. No way.""

In fact, at the heart of the Paris Agreement are voluntary pledges put forward by the governments of over 190 nations, laying out plans to lower emissions. No government has control over the emissions-reduction plans of other governments.

Once the accord is ratified by 55 countries responsible for 55 percent of global emissions, it will enter into legal force, and any country wishing to withdraw would have to wait four years to do so. However, if the deal has not been ratified by January 2017, a new American president could withdraw immediately. For that reason, many countries, fearful that a President Trump would do just that, are racing to ratify the deal this year.

But there would be no legal consequence if the United States, the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter, simply did not follow through with the Obama administration's pledge to cut emissions up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.

In an even more potent threat, Mr. Trump declared that the United States would ""stop all payment of U.S. tax dollars to global warming programs.""

""We've got big problems, folks, and we can't be sending money all over the world,"" he said. ""We're going to keep our money here and our jobs here and bring our jobs back.""

But developing nations, including India, have made clear that their ability to cut emissions depends largely on financial help from other countries. And as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton pledged that rich countries, including the United States, would commit $100 billion annually by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to the ravages of global warming. A clear signal that the United States would back down from its commitments to reduce emissions and provide financial assistance could undermine the political will in other countries, such as India and China, to take action.

Other elements of Mr. Trump's energy proposals appear less viable. As coal mining jobs have declined, Mr. Trump has vowed to fully restore their numbers.

""We're going to bring back the coal industry, save the coal industry,"" he said. ""I love those people.""

It is unclear how Mr. Trump could restore lost jobs in the coal industry. As domestic coal demand has declined, companies have laid off thousands of miners. But economists say that shift is driven by market forces: The natural gas boom led power companies to buy cheaper gas rather than coal.

""Most analysts would say that coal is hurting because natural gas prices have collapsed,"" said Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, an energy consulting firm, and a senior energy official in the George W. Bush administration. ""Donald Trump would have to find a way to raise natural gas prices.""

Mr. Trump also repeatedly emphasized ""energy independence"" -- the idea that the United States could isolate itself from global oil markets and cease importing fuels.

""Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence,"" he said. ""We will become totally independent of the need to import energy from the oil cartel or any nation hostile to our interest.""

But experts say that such remarks display a basic ignorance of the workings of the global oil markets.

""Even if energy independence was achievable, it would not be desirable,"" Mr. Newell, the Duke University energy economist, wrote in an email. ""Our interests tend to be best served by getting each type of fuel we need from the least expensive source, be it domestic or imported. When domestic U.S. energy is globally competitive, like the recent oil and gas boom, our imports go down. But energy independence itself is one of the least useful energy policy goals -- and is at times damaging.""

Mr. Trump's speech, which he delivered with the help of teleprompters, drew a large, cheering crowd to the conference, packing an arena here with thousands of people.

Steve DeWacht, 45, a district manager at Colter Energy, a company in the fracking industry, said he liked what he knew of Mr. Trump's energy policy.

""I'm hoping he's going to support the oil industry, open up some new plays -- in Pennsylvania, maybe -- keep Texas going and help out in North Dakota,"" he said. ""He's got to get us off the OPEC train and help us make our own train.""

Bob Morman, 60, who works for Montana-Dakota Utilities on the natural gas side, said he was supporting Mr. Trump, but knew little about his energy plans and had come to learn more.

""I want to see what his stance is on oil fracking, oil renewables and coal,"" he said. ""I would like to see coal be part of the energy mix."""

Climate Change Reaches Courts as Citizens Sue
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
Global warming is already disrupting the planet's weather. Now it is having an impact on the courts as well, as adults and children around the world try to enlist the judiciary in their efforts to blunt climate change.

In the United States, an environmental law nonprofit is suing the federal government on behalf of 21 young plaintiffs. Individuals in Pakistan and New Zealand have sued to force their governments to take stronger action to fight climate change. A farmer in Peru has sued a giant German energy utility over its part in causing global warming.

And while the arguments can be unconventional and surprising, some of the suits are making progress.

Last month, a federal magistrate judge in Oregon startled many legal experts by allowing the lawsuit filed on behalf of 21 teenagers and children to go forward, despite motions from the Obama administration and fossil fuel companies to dismiss it; the suit would force the government to take more aggressive action against climate change. The ruling by the magistrate judge, Thomas M. Coffin, now goes to Federal District Court to be accepted or rejected.

Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, called the ruling a potential landmark.

""It is the first time a federal court has suggested that government may have a constitutional duty to combat climate change, and that individuals can sue to enforce that right,"" he said.

Other legal scholars were skeptical that the case would progress much further.

""The constitutional claims are novel, to say the least,"" said David M. Uhlmann, a former federal prosecutor of environmental crimes who teaches law at the University of Michigan. ""I have a hard time seeing the case succeeding in the Supreme Court, if it gets that far, and it may not even survive review in the Ninth Circuit.""

The young plaintiffs, led by the environmental law nonprofit Our Children's Trust, argued that the Obama administration and the administrations before it had ample evidence of the risks of climate change and ""willfully ignored this impending harm.""

Victoria Barrett, one of the plaintiffs, from Westchester County, N.Y., said that older generations had ignored the threat to the planet even as the scientific evidence of warming became undeniable.

The current plans and efforts to battle climate change are not enough, Ms. Barrett, 17, said, adding that her generation, with its passion and social media tools, would make a difference.

""We want our children to look back in the textbooks and say, 'Oh, our parents' generation -- they really fought for us,' "" she said.

The lawsuit calls for the courts to order the government to stop the ""permitting, authorizing and subsidizing of fossil fuels"" -- by, for example, canceling plans for projects like a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Oregon -- and ""to develop a national plan to restore Earth's energy balance, and implement that national plan so as to stabilize the climate system.""

Julia Olson, the executive director and chief legal counsel for Our Children's Trust, helped form the organization in 2010 in collaboration with the iMatter Youth Movement, then known as Kids vs. Global Warming.

In an interview, Ms. Olson said the goal was to pursue action against climate change in the courts as a human rights issue, and in the name of young people. ""Most of them can't vote,"" she said, ""and they don't have the money to lobby.""

Youth-oriented climate groups put out calls for volunteers, and Ms. Olson found herself with more than enough enthusiastic young activists willing to be plaintiffs. The organization is financed in part by individual contributions and institutional funding from groups like the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, which contributes heavily to environmental causes.

An earlier federal suit from Our Children's Trust failed in 2012; the organization is also pursuing several lawsuits at the state level and collaborating on a number of international suits.

It scored a victory in Washington State recently, when Judge Hollis R. Hill of King County Superior Court ordered the State Department of Ecology to develop an emissions reduction rule in response to a legal challenge from Our Children's Trust.

As for the federal case, Ms. Olson said, ""We are optimistic that the decision will affirm the findings and the recommendations and put us on a track to a trial.""

The Our Children's Trust suit is part of a wave of citizen actions to take on climate change.

In Pakistan, Ashgar Leghari, a law student, sued the government last year over delays in carrying out a national climate change policy that could help reduce the heavy floods and droughts that threaten the country's food and energy security, as well as the Leghari family's farm.

A court ordered the Pakistani government in September to form a climate change commission to address what Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said ""appears to be the most serious threat facing Pakistan.""

In November, the farmer in Peru, Saul Luciano Lliuya, sued the German utility RWE for its proportional contribution to global climate change. The effects of increasingly extreme weather such as drought can make farming a more precarious proposition, but Mr. Luciano's fears are focused on Palcacocha Lake, which sits above his town and farm and is being filled to overflowing, he said, by meltwater from nearby glaciers.

""We could see the glaciers melting,"" he said. ""They were disappearing year by year. Somebody has to be made responsible.""

An engineer he knew put him in touch with the environmental group Germanwatch, which found him a German lawyer. While it might seem bizarre for a farmer in Peru to sue a utility in Germany, Noah Walker-Crawford, an adviser to the group, said Germany's laws seemed auspicious for such a suit.

""It would be quite difficult to sue in the U.S. or Saudi Arabia,"" he said.

The German courts have accepted the case, but a representative of the company, Klaus-Peter Kress, said, ""RWE does not see a legal basis for this type of claim.""

In New Zealand, a law student, Sarah Lorraine Thomson, said she had been inspired to take legal action by the Our Children's Trust suit and a 2015 decision by a court in the Netherlands that ordered the Dutch government to take more forceful action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""Hearing about those cases was a kick in the butt -- they were just ordinary people, too -- I felt that I really had no excuse,"" Ms. Thomson wrote in an email.

Her lawsuit against the New Zealand government has been filed, but no hearing date has been set.

Ms. Olson of Our Children's Trust said that the cases in the United States and abroad ""build on one another.""

Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, a 16-year-old high school student and hip-hop artist from Boulder, Colo., who became a plaintiff in the Oregon case after getting involved in one of the state lawsuits sponsored by Our Children's Trust, said that because ""climate change is really the defining issue of our time, there is no lawsuit of greater importance happening anywhere in the country.""

If this suit fails, he said, he expects new ones will be filed. ""The evidence will only get stronger,"" he added.

Some of the arguments in the Oregon lawsuit surprised legal experts, and cases that extend rights in innovative ways tend to be long shots. A lawsuit brought against fossil fuel companies and utilities by the citizens of Kivalina, Alaska, a coastal town battered by climate forces, was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2009.

But courts do blaze new paths, establishing rights to, for example, same-sex marriage.

""Most novel arguments crash and burn, but some soar,"" Professor Gerrard said. ""It's often hard to predict in advance which is which.""

Crusader in the Coal Mine
By JAD MOUAWAD
ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio -- The rolling hills of eastern Ohio show few signs of the frenzied activity unfolding hundreds of feet underground. Inside the Powhatan No. 6 mine, a machine the size of a city bus is slowly slicing the earth, scraping out coal and sending it on a 40-minute ride to the surface.

""It will see the light of day for the first time in 200 million years,"" says Robert E. Murray, the 76-year-old chairman of the Murray Energy Corporation, rolling toward the coalface, where the coal is cut out of the rock, in an electric cart.

The digging occurs at the distant end of a forbidding maze of tunnels stretching more than 16 miles into the earth. The walls are coated with ""rock dust,"" or pulverized limestone, which acts as a fire retardant and gives the place a chalky, ethereal appearance. It is mostly silent but for the occasional whoosh of air venting from above.

This is a special place for Mr. Murray, who likes to tell the story of how he sold his children's toys and mortgaged his home to acquire this mine -- his first -- nearly 30 years ago. He went on to build the nation's largest independent coal producer by pioneering efficient new technologies like longwall mining, where the cavern ultimately collapses in on itself after yielding considerably more coal than traditional underground mining methods.

Mr. Murray is also the architect of the most serious challenge to the Obama administration's environmental goals, particularly its policy on climate change. He has filed more than a half dozen lawsuits against the administration, including several challenging its landmark policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. In February, he scored a big victory when the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the administration's plan until an appeals court can consider an expedited challenge this summer.

The expansion of its mining business at a time of deep industry disillusionment, coupled with an activist agenda, has made Murray Energy one of the leading forces combating environmental regulations. And it has made Mr. Murray a galvanizing champion of a once dominant industry fallen on hard times.

For him, any attempt to regulate pollution from power plants is a plot not only to destroy coal producers in the United States but also to take control of the nation's electrical supply. He blames regulators in Washington intent on accumulating power and handpicking winners and losers. ""What it is is a political power grab of America's power grid to change our country in a diabolical, if not evil, way,"" he says. ""Thank you, Obama!""

As the nation struggles to come to terms with greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and mining's environmental toll, Mr. Murray stands at the center of the economic, social and political debate. His life goal is to see that coal production in America remains vibrant -- even as his critics say he is waging a doomed, rear-guard battle against inevitability.

Electricity from fossil fuels, including coal, remains the single biggest contributor to global carbon emissions, which scientists blame for rising temperatures.

The business faces challenges from not only toughening environmental standards but also cheap natural gas resulting from the practice of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking"" -- breaking up the bedrock to extract more oil and gas. This year, for the first time, natural gas is expected to pass coal as the main source of fuel for power plants.

A Life in the Mines

If Mr. Murray helped remake the modern American coal industry, then coal made the man. He started mining at age 16, a few years after a mining accident left his father paralyzed. His own neck has been broken three times. Over the years, his technological expertise has helped keep mines working that might otherwise have been shuttered long ago.

And he says he vehemently believes that humans are not responsible for global warming. Last year, he said Pope Francis was ""totally wrong"" for calling climate change an urgent issue.

On this day, Mr. Murray descended into the Powhatan No. 6 mine for what would probably be his last visit. The mine will close in November when it comes to the end of its productive life after nearly a half-century in operation. Most of the 431 miners are likely to be laid off.

""This is a human issue for me,"" Mr. Murray says. ""It kills me. Lives are being destroyed deliberately by some and by the ignorance of most.""

Moving deeper into the mine, he passes a pair of men drilling into the ceiling. ""We appreciate your work,"" he tells them.

Despite the obstacles, Mr. Murray is doubling down. In 2013, his company acquired the coal business of Consol Energy for $3 billion, nearly doubling its mines with the addition of five more. Last year, it bought a stake in Foresight Energy in a $1.37 billion transaction. Murray Energy now has the capacity to produce about 10 percent of the nation's coal.

""The coal industry is being destroyed,"" he says. ""And it's scary to me because electricity is a staple of life -- like potatoes were to the Irish. And Obama has largely destroyed reliable, low-cost, affordable electricity in America.""

The day was taking its toll on Mr. Murray, who had been up since 5 a.m. and had flown by helicopter to a meeting in Akron with one of his biggest customers, the FirstEnergy Corporation. That meeting, which lasted six and a half hours, had not gone well. The sides could not agree on a new price for coal, with the power utility demanding more concessions from its supplier.

The walls of Murray Energy's corporate offices are lined with mementos and pictures, and his own office is decked with small military plane models. Nearby stands a recent Christmas gift from a customer: a life-size statue of Mr. Murray, wearing a Scottish kilt in the Clan Murray tartan.

Coal mining runs in the family. Mr. Murray is a fourth-generation miner, and his three sons all work for the company. His father was paralyzed from the neck down after falling in a stairway in 1948, when Mr. Murray was 9 years old.

Those were tough days, he says, chicken dinner once a week. ""We never bought fish,"" he says. ""Too expensive.""

He spent 16 years working underground, earning a degree in mining engineering along the way, and rising through the ranks of the North American Coal Corporation. He helped develop new mines in Ohio and North Dakota, among other places, and broke his neck in mining accidents in 1963 and 1969 (and in a car accident in 1987). By 1983, had become the company's chief executive.

He was fired in 1987 over a disagreement with the board on dissolving and reincorporating the company in Delaware. Mr. Murray says the move was designed to shed employee benefits, and he refused to go along.

Within a year, with the backing of a local utility, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, now called the FirstEnergy Corporation, he secured financing to buy the Powhatan No. 6 mine. He knew it was not being used to its full potential. And he had some ideas for fixing that.

One of the biggest expenses in mining, aside from getting the coal out of the ground, is transportation. Here, Mr. Murray took a novel approach.

On a map, he drew circles around power plants located near rivers -- cheap transportation -- then went shopping for mines nearby. Despite new environmental regulations on the horizon, he knew that even low-quality, high-sulfur coal could still be mined, provided that plants were equipped with scrubbers. He snapped up mines for a song.

Then, his masterstroke: longwall mining, which he helped perfect.

In traditional mining, individual ""rooms"" are cut into a coal seam and then supported by pillars to prevent a collapse. The result is that a lot of coal is left behind in the walls between the various rooms.

Longwall mining, on the other hand, extracts almost every last bit of coal.

It works like this: First, miners cut two parallel tunnels, often miles long, along either edge of the coal seam. After that, the longwall machine -- a $350 million articulated piece of equipment equipped with a giant power drill -- simply moves back and forth between the two tunnels, cutting off the coal face in three-foot slivers, like a giant salami slicer.

As the machine completes a pass, the excavated parts of the mine collapse. It's more efficient and, Mr. Murray argues, safer.

The longwall machine can produce about 25,000 tons daily, a significant improvement on traditional underground methods, which typically produce up to 2,000 tons of coal a day in a section. Today, Murray operates 17 of the 40 longwall mines in the nation.

""He's been pretty darn successful at it,"" says Bob Hodge, a coal expert at IHS Energy, a consulting firm. ""And he answers only to Bob Murray.""

Black-Rock Blues

The fact is, coal's century-long dominance is ending. As recently as 2008, it accounted for more than 50 percent of electric power. But last year, that slipped to about 33 percent. And natural gas is expected to overtake coal as the single largest fuel for electricity production for the first time this year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

One reason is fracking, which has pushed down gas prices. The other major coal killer is the adoption by the Obama administration of more stringent standards to regulate carbon emissions and other pollutants that contribute to climate change or are harmful to human health.

These regulations have prompted utilities in recent years to shut more than 400 coal-fired plants that could not comply with the new rules or would be too costly to upgrade with pollution controls. Coal plants retired last year equaled the entire coal capacity of Britain, according to the Sierra Club.

The impact on mining has been swift. Coal production in the United States peaked in 2008 at 1.17 billion tons. It has since fallen 24 percent to its lowest level in 30 years.

A November study by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company refers to the coal business as a ""slow-motion train wreck"" and estimates that the industry is about $45 billion short to cover all its debts and liabilities. Those would include pensions and employee-retirement benefits, as well as the cleanup cost of shuttered mines.

More than 40 producers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years, including some of the biggest. ""The situation for coal in the United States is about as bad as it has ever been in modern history, and maybe even beyond that,"" says Mark Levin, an analyst with BB&T Capital Markets. ""I don't think we're done.""

This is taking a toll on mine workers, whose numbers have shrunk by 19 percent in the last three years, to about 75,000. A typical miner earns $83,700 a year, according to the National Mining Association. For a laid-off worker with only a high school diploma, if that, that kind of pay is nearly impossible to find.

""We're getting shelled,"" says Ryan Murray, the youngest of Mr. Murray's three sons and the company's director of operations. ""We have to fight back out of necessity.""

The company has opposed the Obama administration over a variety of new regulations

One, known as the Stream Protection Rule, was proposed to limit surface mining near waterways. Mr. Murray argues that it would effectively condemn longwall operations as well by prohibiting underground mining under vast tracts of land. The company filed 14,000 pages of comments opposing the rule, which is still under consideration.

Another is the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which set limits on air pollutants like mercury, arsenic and metals. Murray Energy sued the Environmental Protection Agency and won a major victory last year after the Supreme Court struck down the rule.

But the celebration was short-lived for coal producers. While the case was wending through the courts, utilities did not wait for a legal resolution. Those most affected shut plants that wouldn't meet the regulations.

A bigger battle still is taking place over the Clean Power Plan, a cornerstone of the Obama administration's international commitment to cut carbon emissions. The plan would, by the year 2030, reduce carbon emission from power plants by 32 percent from 2005 levels. It was a major part of the administration's pledge to reduce carbon emissions made at the international Paris Climate Conference, in December.

The power plant rule leaves it up to each state to find ways to reduce emissions by shifting away from coal to cleaner energy sources, including renewable energy and natural gas. Murray filed an early challenge to the draft rules, and 29 mostly Republican-led states and other coal producers eventually joined.

Their challenge argues that the E.P.A. does not have the power under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon emissions and that the rules violate state sovereignty and state power to regulate local utilities.

In February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the administration's initiative, dealing an early blow to the policy, though it did not rule on the merits of the case. Also, the ruling was issued by a court divided along ideological lines.

The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is expected to hear oral arguments on the legality of the regulation in June. Ultimately, both sides are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court if they lose. This time, the parties could face a court evenly split between its left-leaning and right-leaning factions since the death of the conservative justice Antonin Scalia.

Fighting Words

The day after his coal-mine visit, Mr. Murray delivered a lecture at West Liberty University, a small public college in nearby West Virginia. There, about 150 students packed a hall to earn extra credit for their business class.

Mr. Murray came with a five-page speech titled ""The Ongoing Destruction of a Major American Industry,"" which, among other things, described the ""regal, outlaw Obama administration."" But once he reached the lectern, the speech was forgotten. Instead, Mr. Murray spoke extemporaneously.

He warned the students about government bureaucrats (""They are rejects compared with people in the private sector""); about Bernie Sanders (""The problem with socialists is that they eventually run out of other people's money,"" paraphrasing Margaret Thatcher); about the leading Republican presidential candidate (""I'm not sure about Donald Trump""); and about Ivy League schools (""These schools are lousy"").

He announced that he was organizing a fund-raiser for Ted Cruz, though he pointed out that he was not endorsing him.

And finally, he shared his views on what he described as the Obama administration's lies about global warming. It doesn't concern Mr. Murray that his climate views run counter to the scientific consensus, which has found that warming is ""unequivocal,"" according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

""This global warming hoax,"" Mr. Murray told the students, ""it's a movement that is destroying America."""

Leaders Meet to Sign a Climate Pact Fraught With Uncertainties
By JUSTIN GILLIS and CORAL DAVENPORT; Somini Sengupta and Ellen Barry contributed reporting.
An airport hangar outside Paris shook with cheers, toasts and foot-stomping in December as diplomats ushered a landmark climate agreement into existence. On Friday morning, world leaders will gather again at the United Nations for a grand ceremony to sign the document.

But can they deliver on their promises to fight global warming?

After a quarter-century of failed diplomatic efforts, signs are growing that nations have turned a corner in their political willingness to tackle climate change. Many leaders are pushing to make the Paris agreement legally binding years earlier than originally expected. The falling cost of clean energy is providing a powerful tailwind for their efforts.

For all the signs of progress and political will, however, new challenges to implementing the accord have arisen just since December. Outside experts also say the countries' bare-bones plans are still far from enough to keep global warming to tolerable levels. No country has shared a detailed, credible strategy to achieve what scientists think is necessary: ending the era of fossil-fuel emissions and converting entirely to clean energy no later than the middle of this century.

Unless countries develop more ambitious plans, the experts say, the world could ultimately suffer profound consequences, including debilitating heat waves, food shortages and fast-rising seas.

""I think the train has left the station, and the clean-energy transition is going to happen,"" said Guido Schmidt-Traub, managing director of a group in Paris and New York, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, that is analyzing the needed steps. ""Whether it will happen in time to head off dangerous climate change is really the question.""

Big uncertainties hung over the climate deal even as the wording was being finalized in Paris, and in some ways, they have only grown since December.

President Obama's domestic climate program was essential in helping him lobby other countries to reach a deal, but it was thrown into turmoil in February when the Supreme Court temporarily shelved his Clean Power Plan.

In developing countries, hundreds of coal-burning power plants are still on the drawing board. And oil and gas companies continue to invest billions of dollars a year searching for new reserves of fossil fuels.

All those factors mean that a goal established by the governments of the world in 2009 -- limiting the warming of the planet to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above the preindustrial level -- remains far out of reach.

The temperature has risen half that much already, the climate appears to be destabilizing and the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are starting to melt.

The plans that countries offered in Paris would, even if faithfully carried out, fall far short of cutting emissions enough to meet the goal. Moreover, Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, noted this week that most of those plans run only to 2030, with countries still offering no hint of how they might eradicate greenhouse emissions by the 2050s.

""The signing ceremony, the unprecedented number of countries that are going to sign is creating a momentum,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Washington advocacy group. ""But there is still a lot of work to do, not just in the U.S. but around the world, to nail down these domestic actions.""

Looming large over the climate push is the American presidential election. The Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have promised to build on Mr. Obama's legacy and to pursue strong climate policies. But the two leading Republicans, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have questioned the science of climate change and sharply criticized the Paris agreement.

The fight over a nominee to the Supreme Court is, in part, a fight over the fate of the Clean Power Plan, which is intended to limit emissions from power plants in the United States.

The Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 in February to stall the plan. Justice Antonin Scalia, who voted in the majority, died four days later.

The plan still has to move through a June hearing in a federal circuit court, and the deciding vote when it gets to the Supreme Court for a final ruling could well be cast by Justice Scalia's replacement.

Moreover, even if the plan is upheld, some experts have concluded that Mr. Obama is likely to leave office without establishing policies sufficient to ensure the country will meet the pledge he offered in Paris: to reduce American emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent in 2025, compared with their level in 2005.

The Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm, has calculated that Mr. Obama's plans may reduce emissions by only 23 percent or so.

The signing ceremony on Friday is only an intermediate step. After, countries will still have to present formal ratification documents, and the Paris Agreement will not take effect until 55 countries representing 55 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions have done so.

That was originally expected to take at least a couple of years. But some countries are talking about rushing through the final steps, possibly even bringing the agreement into force by the end of this year, before Mr. Obama leaves office on Jan. 20.

The French minister of environment and energy, Segolene Royal, alluded to the importance of the American presidential election during a meeting on Monday with reporters at the United Nations, saying the agreement might be ""signed and ratified by the time anybody is elected.""

At that moment, the French ambassador to the United Nations, Francois Delattre, uttered a stage whisper within the earshot of several reporters. ""On espere,"" he said, or ""One hopes.""

For all the lingering political uncertainty, however, the economics of clean energy appear to be improving so rapidly that a radical acceleration of the energy transition may become possible, if governments push it along with new policies.

For instance, some analyses suggest that keeping climate change to a tolerable level will require mass adoption of electric cars by the 2030s, coupled with a transition to a cleaner electricity grid to power the cars.

Sales of electric cars are now growing at 60 percent a year, albeit from a tiny base, according to a recent report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

Moreover, car companies are promising a wave of electric models with improved range over the next couple of years, including the Tesla Model 3 that inspired more than 300,000 people to put down deposits over the last three weeks.

Even more significant, perhaps, is that most of the capital being spent in the world to build new power plants is being spent on renewables, twice as much in 2015 as on fossil-fired power plants, Bloomberg New Energy Finance found.

Most of the existing power plants still run on nonrenewable energy, however, and because the plants last for decades, that is likely to change only slowly. Wind turbines and solar panels are now supplying about 10 percent of the world's electricity, a figure that has doubled in the last decade. The pace of adoption would need to rise sharply to meet the broad climate goals.

As the market for clean power technology has grown, the cost has plummeted, and countries are scrambling to adapt their plans. India has promised a 20-fold increase in solar power, and bids for giant solar farms there have been coming in so low that many analysts are increasingly convinced that the country can pull it off.

The promises rich countries made to secure the Paris agreement included mobilizing billions in financing for poor countries like India.

""India's needs are going to be astronomical if we are going to succeed,"" said Dipak Dasgupta, an Indian economist and a former board member of a United Nations fund intended to channel some of the climate money.

Whether the money will materialize is one of the great uncertainties about the Paris deal. Mr. Obama has had trouble persuading Republican lawmakers to provide even small sums to advance his international climate agenda, though Congress did approve tax measures in December that would give a big push to wind and solar power in the United States over the next few years.

But if the money promised by rich countries is not forthcoming, the poor countries that pledged strong climate action in Paris could easily decide to walk away, one of the many ways the progress reflected in the deal remains fragile -- and easily reversible."

Green, Sure. And Maybe One Day in the Black.
By JULIE CRESWELL and DIANE CARDWELL
It was just last summer that SunEdison was a Wall Street darling, the very air around the fast-growing company seeming to shimmer with potential.

SunEdison was, after all, a red-hot company in a red-hot space -- renewable energy. Its market capitalization reached nearly $10 billion, putting it on a par with the likes of Wynn Resorts of Las Vegas. Among the believers betting on its stock was the hedge-fund heavyweight David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital. With plans to buy Vivint Solar for $2.2 billion, SunEdison appeared unstoppable.

And then the company went supernova. Its shares fell from around $32 last summer to 34 cents this week. Mr. Einhorn furiously tried to dump his stake in recent weeks. In early March, Vivint said, ""thanks, but no thanks"" and exited the deal with SunEdison.

On Thursday, to the surprise of no one, SunEdison filed for bankruptcy -- one of the largest in a series of recent green-energy failures.

There is a timeless element to SunEdison's swift demise: an executive with an Icarus complex chasing a fast-growing market embarks on an aggressive strategy fueled by cheap debt. Soar. Crash. Burn. Repeat.

Yet the collapse raises a bigger question: Can renewable-energy companies be profitable? Can green make green?

The answer, of course, is yes. Just as soon as they cross over a fundamental hurdle: finding a strategy that actually works.

""We haven't totally figured out exactly what the business models are going to look like, for who wins and who loses,"" said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.

Significantly, though, the sudden decline in oil prices isn't largely to blame. The difficulties run much deeper, echoing industrial collapses of earlier eras -- the telecom-industry boom and bust of the 1990s and early 2000s, and disruptive cycles before that.

On the surface, the various green-energy companies all seem to be pursuing different strategies. But there is a unifying problem they have yet to overcome: Finding enough customers to support the costly infrastructure they must first build.

SunEdison is far from being the only troubled green-energy business.

Abengoa, which grew from a small electrical equipment company in Seville, Spain, to a multinational solar and biofuel giant, is in restructuring proceedings in the United States and abroad. Solazyme, a once-promising maker of algae-based biofuels, has abandoned the energy markets and changed its name in favor of focusing on ingredients for personal care and food products for companies like Unilever and Hormel. And NRG has pulled back from its headlong rush into alternative energy as it restructures to focus on its conventional operations after the ouster of its chief executive, David Crane.

What's remarkable is that these leading energy companies are struggling at a time when regulatory, public and investor support for the renewable-energy industry has arguably never been greater.

On Friday, world leaders are signing the Paris agreement on climate change, a sweeping commitment to lower carbon emissions that practically requires that renewable development be steeply ramped up. At the end of last year, American lawmakers extended important tax credits for green energy several more years, while in recent days, the Senate approved a broad energy bill that would further promote clean power.

Moreover, investors around the world sank hundreds of billions of dollars into clean-energy technologies last year even as the prices of competing fossil fuels -- oil and natural gas -- tumbled.

Though development in renewable energy climbed in the last 15 years, the industry is still widely considered to be in its early stages. Nonetheless, there has been a race among companies to develop, commercialize and eventually prosper from what many see as one of the largest tectonic economic shifts in decades.

Last year, China started construction on a massive solar farm in the Gobi desert that is expected to generate enough power to light up one million homes. Dong Energy is developing a multibillion-dollar wind farm off the Yorkshire coast that could eventually power even more.

And in the United States, the federal government recently approved a major new transmission line to move wind-generated electricity east from the Great Plains.

But all good bubbles burst. What is happening in renewable energy now has similarities to the telecommunications bubble of the 1990s. Led by hard-charging executives seeking big paydays, giants like WorldCom, Global Crossing and Adelphia started far-reaching acquisition and capital-expenditure programs -- burning through billions of dollars -- to buy cable companies or bury long-haul fiber-optic cable under land and sea. They were all chasing expected high demand and soaring revenues from the dawn of the Internet.

Those revenues eventually materialized, but they came too late for the first movers of the revolution. After creating a broadband glut, and buried under mountains of debt -- let's not forget the various accounting scandals and frauds -- the many companies collapsed into bankruptcy.

But the infrastructure they created lived on. Last weekend, when you binge-watched the fourth season of ""House of Cards"" or streamed your own cooking show on Facebook Live, chances are better than not that your data zoomed through at least some of those networks.

In that case, it turned out that if you build it, they will indeed come. But as many renewable energy companies are learning, building it costs dearly.

Even before SunEdison, the landscape of green energy companies was littered with failed strategies.

Dozens of solar-focused companies around the globe have disappeared, through bankruptcy, insolvency or just shutting their doors, since 2009 when prices for solar panels plunged as competition from China increased.

Among the high-profile failures was that of Solyndra, a solar module manufacturer, which became a symbol of green energy ambitions gone awry for the Obama administration after it burned through $527 million in government loans.

Part of the conundrum for these companies is that the most effective way to cut costs has been to grow, to take advantage of economies of scale, certain forms of financing and generous subsidies that were set to expire.

But with all that growth has come debt, and an inability to show a profit, even if the companies are creating value.

""Clearly in a market that has had a lot of growth, you are going to have some companies -- and in this case many companies -- that try to do too much, too fast,"" said Shawn Kravetz, founder of Esplanade Capital, which invests in solar power. ""We're going to continue to see a shakeout.""

The vulnerability to shifting conditions has been evident for industry leaders like SolarCity and SunPower, companies whose stock prices can swing wildly with energy markets and policy changes.

But it is especially the case at SunEdison, where its chief executive, Ahmad R. Chatila, set about expanding, seemingly in all directions at once.

With roots in making components for solar panels, SunEdison aimed to become the world's largest renewable energy development company. It bought ventures in wind and energy storage, looked to increase manufacturing, entered big new markets and created new subsidiaries known as yieldcos to help it raise cheaper financing by buying the projects it developed.

That strategy was further complicated by questionable accounting and opaque financial reporting -- SunEdison has received an inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subpoena from the Justice Department -- that confounded even experts in the field.

""This is going to be a big industry globally, but we're stumbling and bumbling to get there,"" said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. ""If they weren't trying to beat each other to the next rooftop they wouldn't be needing to do this financial engineering.""

Still, industry analysts and executives say that despite the fall of SunEdison, the future for renewable energy is bright.

Indeed, there are a few stalwarts in the renewable-energy race.

Take First Solar. The company, which supplies solar panels and develops solar farms, has had its share of troubles. It has been the target of shareholder lawsuits claiming it hid big problems and misrepresented its prospects. Its stock, at $62 a share, is a far cry from its bubble-peak of $311 in the spring of 2008.

But by adopting a slower-growth strategy and reducing debt, First Solar is a rarity in the green-energy industry. It is profitable. Last year, the company made $546 million on $3.6 billion in revenue.

For now, First Solar may be an anomaly, particularly amid uncertainty around the presidential election and the policy stances of candidates like Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump on renewable energy sources. Some warn that a lull could settle over the industry in the short term.

""The Secretary Clinton perspective on lots of distributed clean energy couldn't be more different than the Trump view,"" said Daniel M. Kammen, the director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. ""That could mean hugely different things for the growth of the industry."""

Climate Policy's Advocates Take a Page From the Same-Sex Marriage Playbook
By CORAL DAVENPORT
WASHINGTON -- Two months ahead of a federal court hearing on President Obama's signature climate change rule, a coordinated public relations offensive has begun -- modeled after the same-sex marriage campaign -- to influence the outcome of the case.

A national coalition of liberal and environmental advocacy groups, state attorneys general, mayors and even some businesses are adhering to the strategy that a network of gay rights and other advocacy groups began in the months before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the same-sex marriage case, Obergefell v. Hodges, last year. Those advocates cannot be certain, but they said they believed it had influenced the opinions of the justices, who ruled in June that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage.

While such campaigns are common before major Supreme Court arguments, it is unusual to see a national effort aimed at a lower court hearing. But the climate change case, West Virginia v. the United States Environmental Protection Agency, to be argued June 2 before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is unusual.

""The reason there is all this focus is that this is arguably the most important environmental regulation ever,"" said Richard L. Revesz, the director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law. This week, the institute and several other groups will file briefs in support of the E.P.A.'s position in the case.

At stake is a sweeping federal rule intended to cut the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power plants. While environmentalists see the rule as the largest step ever taken by the United States to tackle climate change, the coal industry sees it as a huge threat.

If enacted, the rule could shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and rapidly escalate wind and solar power, transforming the American electricity industry. The rule also provided Mr. Obama with a pivotal tool during negotiations of last year's Paris Accord, the first deal committing action from every country in the world to fight climate change. If the rule unravels, it could severely weaken that global pact.

Meanwhile, the vacancy on the Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month has also heightened the national impact of decisions by lower courts. If the decision by the Federal Circuit Court is appealed to the Supreme Court -- as is widely expected -- and the eight justices are evenly split, the decision of the lower court will stand.

""If the Supreme Court is divided 4 to 4, it would make sense that you want to pour resources into the outcome of the lower court, if that's the one that's going to matter at the end of the day,"" said Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at the William and Mary Law School.

The campaign by the advocates kicked off Tuesday morning, timed to highlight the E.P.A.'s Monday afternoon filing of its legal briefs in the case and an expected Tuesday court filing by about 20 states and other outside groups, such as the Sierra Club and Natural Resources Defense Council, which support the rule.

Even more groups planned to file briefs this week in support of the administration. In New York, Al Gore, the environmental advocate and former vice president, joined several state attorneys general, led by the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, at a news conference supporting the Obama administration's position.

The groups backing the administration began posting quotable excerpts from the legal briefs on Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday. Several more such events are planned for this week, and the public relations push will escalate for the next eight weeks, culminating in a rally outside the federal courthouse on the day of the hearing.

The White House is aware of the campaign, but is not coordinating with the groups or planning any messaging of its own, said Thomas Reynolds, who until last week directed climate change communications efforts for the White House, but this week moved back to a similar position at the E.P.A.

While developing the campaign, the environmental advocates closely examined the messaging tactics of the same-sex marriage efforts -- particularly the message that the issue affects individual lives beyond the gay community.

""On gay marriage, it was that everyone has a friend, a neighbor, a sibling who could be impacted,"" said Joshua Dorner, a strategist at the Washington political communications firm SKDKnickerbocker, who worked on the same-sex marriage public relations campaigns ahead of the Supreme Court argument. The same message could be applied to a campaign on climate change, ""showing how it directly impacts people's lives,"" he said.

To that end, the environmentalists will deploy several mayors, like Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken, N.J., who will speak at news conferences over the coming months in support of the climate rule.

""After Hurricane Sandy, we had senior citizens stranded in their apartments who couldn't get medicine,"" she said. ""Substations were flooded, and we were without power for two weeks. The threat to Hoboken from climate change and rising sea levels is very real, and the predictions are it's getting worse.""

But the plaintiffs in the case, including over two dozen states and the nation's largest coal companies, are not planning a similar public campaign. Those groups began planning their legal attack on the administration's climate change rules long before they were made final, and are expected to focus their attention on the legal arguments.

""There's people on both sides of the aisle who specialize in this kind of thing, but the idea that you're going to affect these judges on the D.C. Circuit and their clerks is ridiculous,"" said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who is closely involved in the legal and public relations strategy for the coal companies. ""It may work at the Supreme Court level. But every judge and clerk I've ever met at this level would be insulted at the suggestion that they could be influenced by something like this. It's a colossal waste of money.""

Ultimately, it may be impossible to know the impact of campaigning in the courts. ""The theory is that you want to influence them just like you influence any other citizen,"" Ms. Larsen said of the judges. ""But the only person who knows the influence of something like that is the judge herself."""

As Trump Denies Climate Change, These Kids Die
By NICHOLAS KRISTOF
TSIHOMBE, Madagascar -- She is just a frightened mom, worrying if her son will survive, and certainly not fretting about American politics -- for she has never heard of either President Obama or Donald Trump.

What about America itself? Ranomasy, who lives in an isolated village on this island of Madagascar off southern Africa, shakes her head. It doesn't ring any bells.

Yet we Americans may be inadvertently killing her infant son. Climate change, disproportionately caused by carbon emissions from America, seems to be behind a severe drought that has led crops to wilt across seven countries in southern Africa. The result is acute malnutrition for 1.3 million children in the region, the United Nations says.

Trump has repeatedly mocked climate change, once even calling it a hoax fabricated by China. But climate change here is as tangible as its victims. Trump should come and feel these children's ribs and watch them struggle for life. It's true that the links between our carbon emissions and any particular drought are convoluted, but over all, climate change is as palpable as a wizened, glassy-eyed child dying of starvation. Like Ranomasy's 18-month-old son, Tsapasoa.

Southern Africa's drought and food crisis have gone largely unnoticed around the world. The situation has been particularly severe in Madagascar, a lovely island nation known for deserted sandy beaches and playful long-tailed primates called lemurs.

But the southern part of the island doesn't look anything like the animated movie ""Madagascar"": Families are slowly starving because rains and crops have failed for the last few years. They are reduced to eating cactus and even rocks or ashes. The United Nations estimates that nearly one million people in Madagascar alone need emergency food assistance.

I met Ranomasy at an emergency feeding station run by Catholic nuns who were trying to save her baby. Ranomasy had carried Tsapasoa 12 hours on a trek through the desert to get to the nuns, walking barefoot because most villagers have already sold everything from shoes to spoons to survive.

""I feel so powerless as a mother, because I know how much I love my child,"" she said. ""But whatever I do just doesn't work.""

The drought is also severe in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, and a related drought has devastated East Africa and the Horn of Africa and is expected to continue this year. The U.N. World Food Program has urgently appealed for assistance, but only half the money needed has been donated.

The immediate cause of the droughts was an extremely warm El Nino event, which came on top of a larger drying trend in the last few decades in parts of Africa. New research, just published in the bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, concludes that human-caused climate change exacerbated El Nino's intensity and significantly reduced rainfall in parts of Ethiopia and southern Africa.

The researchers calculated that human contributions to global warming reduced water runoff in southern Africa by 48 percent and concluded that these human contributions ""have contributed to substantial food crises.""

As an American, I'm proud to see U.S. assistance saving lives here. If it weren't for U.S.A.I.D., the American aid agency, and nonprofit groups like Catholic Relief Services that work in these villages, far more cadavers would be piling up. But my pride is mixed with guilt: The United States single-handedly accounts for more than one-quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions over the last 150 years, more than twice as much as any other country.

The basic injustice is that we rich countries produced the carbon that is devastating impoverished people from Madagascar to Bangladesh. In America, climate change costs families beach homes; in poor countries, parents lose their children.

In one Madagascar hamlet I visited, villagers used to get water from a well a three-hour walk away, but then it went dry. Now they hike the three hours and then buy water from a man who trucks it in. But they have almost no money. Not one of the children in the village has ever had a bath.

Families in this region traditionally raised cattle, but many have sold their herds to buy food to survive. Selling pressure has sent the price of a cow tumbling from $300 to less than $100.

Families are also pulling their children out of school, to send them foraging for edible plants. In one village I visited, fewer than 15 percent of the children are attending primary school this year.

One of the children who dropped out is Fombasoa, who should be in the third grade but now spends her days scouring the desert for a wild red cactus fruit. Fombasoa's family is also ready to marry her off, even though she is just 10, because then her husband would be responsible for feeding her.

""If I can find her a husband, I would marry her,"" said her father, Sonjona, who, like many villagers, has just one name. ""But these days there is no man who wants her"" -- because no one can afford the bride price of about $32.

Sonjona realizes that it is wrong to marry off a 10-year-old, but he also knows it is wrong to see his daughter starve. ""I feel despair,"" he said. ""I don't feel a man any more. I used to have muscles; now I have only bones. I feel guilty, because my job was to care for my children, and now they have only red cactus fruit.""

Other families showed me how they pick rocks of chalk from the ground, break them into dust and cook the dust into soup. ""It fills our stomachs at least,"" explained Limbiaza, a 20-year-old woman in one remote village. As it becomes more difficult to find the chalk rocks, some families make soup from ashes from old cooking fires.

Scientists used to think that the horror of starvation was principally the dying children. Now they understand there is a far broader toll: When children in utero and in the first few years of life are malnourished, their brains don't develop properly. As a result, they may suffer permanently impaired brain function.

""If children are stunted and do not receive the nutrition and attention in these first 1,000 days, it is very difficult to catch back up,"" noted Joshua Poole, the Madagascar director of Catholic Relief Services. ""Nutritional neglect during this critical period prevents children from reaching their full mental potential.""

For the next half century or so, we will see students learning less in school and economies held back, because in 2017 we allowed more than a million kids to be malnourished just here in southern Africa, collateral damage from our carbon-intensive way of life.

The struggling people of Madagascar are caught between their own corrupt, ineffective government, which denies the scale of the crisis, and overseas governments that don't want to curb carbon emissions.

Whatever we do to limit the growth of carbon, climate problems will worsen for decades to come. Those of us in the rich world who have emitted most of the carbon bear a special responsibility to help people like these Madagascar villagers who are simultaneously least responsible for climate change and most vulnerable to it.

The challenges are not hopeless, and I saw programs here that worked. The World Food Program runs school feeding programs that use local volunteers and, at a cost of 25 cents per child per day, give children a free daily meal that staves off starvation and creates an incentive to keep children in school.

We need these emergency relief efforts -- and constant vigilance to intervene early to avert famines -- but we can also do far more to help local people help themselves.

Catholic Relief Services provides emergency food aid, but it also promotes drought-resistant seed varieties and is showing farmers near the coast how to fish. It is also working with American scientists on new technologies to supply water in Madagascar, using condensation or small-scale desalination.

American technology helped create the problem, and it would be nice to see American technology used more aggressively to mitigate the burden on the victims.

For me, the most wrenching sight of this trip was of two starving boys near the southern tip of Madagascar. Their parents are climate refugees who fled their village to try to find a way to survive, leaving the boys in the care of an aunt, even though she doesn't have enough food for her own two daughters.

I met the boys, Fokondraza, 5, and Voriavy, 3, in the evening, and they said that so far that day they hadn't eaten or drunk anything (the closest well, producing somewhat salty water, is several hours away by foot, and fetching a pail of water becomes more burdensome when everyone is malnourished and anemic). Their aunt, Fideline, began to prepare the day's meal.

She broke off cactus pads, scraped off the thorns and boiled them briefly, and the boys ate them -- even though they provide little nutrition. ""My heart is breaking because I have nothing to give them,"" Fideline said. ""I have no choice.""

At night, the boys sometimes cry from hunger, she said. But that is a good sign. When a person is near starvation, the body shuts down emotion, becoming zombielike as every calorie goes to keeping the heart and lungs working. It is the children who don't cry, those quiet and expressionless, who are at greatest risk -- and the two boys are becoming more like that.

I don't pretend that the links between climate change and this food crisis are simple, or that the solutions are straightforward. I flew halfway around the world and then drove for two days to get to these villages, pumping out carbon the whole way.

Yet we do know what will help in the long run: sticking with the Paris agreement to limit global warming, as well as with President Obama's Clean Power Plan. We must also put a price on carbon and invest much more heavily in research on renewable energy.

In the short and medium term, we must step up assistance to climate refugees and sufferers, both to provide relief and to assist with new livelihoods that adjust to new climate realities. (For individuals who want to help, the organization most active in the areas I visited was Catholic Relief Services, which accepts donations for southern Madagascar.)

The most basic starting point is for the American president-elect to acknowledge what even illiterate Madagascar villagers understand: Climate change is real.

As the sun set, I told Fideline that there was a powerful man named Trump half a world away, in a country she had never heard of, who just might be able to have some impact, over many years, on the climate here. I asked her what she would tell him.

""I would ask him to do what he can, so that once more I can grow cassava, corn, black-eyed peas and sorghum,"" she said. ""We're desperate.""

Mr. President-elect, are you listening?"

Meat Makes the Planet Thirsty
By JAMES MCWILLIAMS
AUSTIN, Tex. -- CALIFORNIA is experiencing one of its worst droughts on record. Just two and a half years ago, Folsom Lake, a major reservoir outside Sacramento, was at 83 percent capacity. Today it's down to 36 percent. In January, there was no measurable rain in downtown Los Angeles. Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency. President Obama has pledged $183 million in emergency funding. The situation, despite last week's deluge in Southern California, is dire.

With California producing nearly half of the fruit and vegetables grown in the United States, attention has naturally focused on the water required to grow popular foods such as walnuts, broccoli, lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, almonds and grapes. These crops are the ones that a recent report in the magazine Mother Jones highlighted as being unexpectedly water intensive. Who knew, for example, that it took 5.4 gallons to produce a head of broccoli, or 3.3 gallons to grow a single tomato? This information about the water footprint of food products -- that is, the amount of water required to produce them -- is important to understand, especially for a state that dedicates about 80 percent of its water to agriculture.

But for those truly interested in lowering their water footprint, those numbers pale next to the water required to fatten livestock. A 2012 study in the journal Ecosystems by Mesfin M. Mekonnen and Arjen Y. Hoekstra, both at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, tells an important story. Beef turns out to have an overall water footprint of roughly four million gallons per ton produced. By contrast, the water footprint for ""sugar crops"" like sugar beets is about 52,000 gallons per ton; for vegetables it's 85,000 gallons per ton; and for starchy roots it's about 102,200 gallons per ton.

Factor in the kind of water required to produce these foods, and the water situation looks even worse for the future of animal agriculture in drought-stricken regions that use what's known as ""blue water,"" or water stored in lakes, rivers and aquifers, which California and much of the West depend on.

Vegetables use about 11,300 gallons per ton of blue water; starchy roots, about 4,200 gallons per ton; and fruit, about 38,800 gallons per ton. By comparison, pork consumes 121,000 gallons of blue water per ton of meat produced; beef, about 145,000 gallons per ton; and butter, some 122,800 gallons per ton. There's a reason other than the drought that Folsom Lake has dropped as precipitously as it has. Don't look at kale as the culprit. (Although some nuts, namely almonds, consume considerable blue water, even more than beef.) That said, a single plant is leading California's water consumption.

Unfortunately, it's a plant that's not generally cultivated for humans: alfalfa. Grown on over a million acres in California, alfalfa sucks up more water than any other crop in the state. And it has one primary destination: cattle. Increasingly popular grass-fed beef operations typically rely on alfalfa as a supplement to pasture grass. Alfalfa hay is also an integral feed source for factory-farmed cows, especially those involved in dairy production.

If Californians were eating all the beef they produced, one might write off alfalfa's water footprint as the cost of nurturing local food systems. But that's not what's happening. Californians are sending their alfalfa, and thus their water, to Asia. The reason is simple. It's more profitable to ship alfalfa hay from California to China than from the Imperial Valley to the Central Valley. Alfalfa growers are now exporting some 100 billion gallons of water a year from this drought-ridden region to the other side of the world in the form of alfalfa. All as more Asians are embracing the American-style, meat-hungry diet.

Further intensifying this ecological injustice are incidents such as the Rancho Feeding Corporation's recent recall of 8.7 million pounds of beef because the meat lacked a full federal inspection. That equals 631.6 million gallons of water wasted by an industry with a far more complex and resource-intensive supply chain than the systems that move strawberries from farm to fork.

This comparison isn't to suggest that produce isn't occasionally recalled, but the Rancho incident reminds us that plants aren't slaughtered, a process that demands 132 gallons of water per animal carcass, contributing even more to livestock's expanding water footprint.

It's understandable for concerned consumers to feel helpless in the face of these complex industrial and global realities. But in the case of agriculture and drought, there's a clear and accessible action most citizens can take: reducing or, ideally, eliminating the consumption of animal products. Changing one's diet to replace 50 percent of animal products with edible plants like legumes, nuts and tubers results in a 30 percent reduction in an individual's food-related water footprint. Going vegetarian, a better option in many respects, reduces that water footprint by almost 60 percent.

It's seductive to think that we can continue along our carnivorous route, even in this era of climate instability. The environmental impact of cattle in California, however, reminds us how mistaken this idea is coming to seem."

Energy groups games donated millions to Trump's inaugural
By Fredreka Schouten, @fschouten, USA TODAY
President Trump, who has moved quickly to sweep aside environmental regulations that he says curtail U.S. energy production, took in more than $8million from energy interests to help underwrite his Jan. 20 inauguration, according to a USA TODAY analysis of a newly filed inaugural report.

Energy companies and executives donating to Trump's inaugural committee include ExxonMobil, which contributed $500,000 in January, and Clifford Forrest, the founder of Pennsylvania-based coal-mining company, Rosebud Mining. Forrest donated $1 million in December.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said companies and individuals donated out of civic pride.

""Funding the inaugural committee is pretty much a non-partisan activity that has gone back every administration,"" Spicer said. ""I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural.""

Trump's committee raised a record $106.7million from private sources to fund six days of events, more than doubling the previous record of $53million raised for President Obama's first inauguration in 2009.

Other $1 million contributors from the energy sector include a trust tied to billionaire coal operator Joseph Craft and John Hess, the chief executive of the Hess Corp., an oil and gas company.

On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal , citing unidentified sources, reported that Exxon has asked the U.S. Treasury Department for a waiver from U.S. sanctions against Russia to allow the company to resume drilling operations with the Russian-owned oil company, Rosneft. Exxon officials did not immediately respond to an interview request.

Dozens of companies and individuals wrote seven-figure checks, many with policy issues pending before the administration. AT&T, which is awaiting a Justice Department review of its proposed $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner, donated $2.08million, records show.

Other big contributors included billionaire hedge-fund manager Robert Mercer, who donated $1 million; and NFL team owners Dan Snyder (Washington Redskins), Robert Kraft (New England Patriots), and Shahid Khan (Jacksonville Jaguars).

Committees are not required to disclose how they spend their contributions."

A sting operation by the environmental group Greenpeace suggests that some researchers who dispute mainstream scientific conclusions on climate change are willing to conceal the sources of payment for their research, even if the money is purported to come from overseas corporations producing oil, gas and coal.

Over a period of several months, two Greenpeace employees posed as representatives of energy companies and offered to pay prominent commentators on climate change to write papers that extolled the benefits of coal and carbon emissions. The Greenpeace workers also asked that the payments not be disclosed.

The commentators — a professor from Princeton University and one from Pennsylvania State University — agreed to the offers.

Disclosure of funding for scientific research has been a flash point in the fight over climate change, especially in the case of published scientific research. The effort by Greenpeace, which has a long record of using aggressive tactics to make environmental statements, was to “unravel the story” of industry ties to denial of climate change, said Lawrence Carter, one of the Greenpeace employees involved in the subterfuge.


“It shows a way that fossil fuel money can get into funding these climate skeptic campaign groups,” he added.

Chasing a Climate Deal
We’re tracking developments from the COP21 climate conference in Paris.

 

Frank Clemente, a professor emeritus of sociology at Penn State, agreed to write a paper on coal on behalf of a coal mining firm that he was told was based in Indonesia. William Happer, a professor of physics at Princeton, agreed to write a paper at the request of an unnamed oil and gas company in the Middle East.

Both men acknowledged, in response to requests for comments, that the exchanged emails about the arrangements, which Greenpeace released on Tuesday, were genuine. But both denied having done anything improper.

Dr. Clemente formerly served as director of an environmental policy center at Penn State. He said in an email response to questions: “I fully stand behind every single statement I made in the emails apparently pirated by Greenpeace. I am very proud of my research and believe that clean coal technologies are the pathway to reliable and affordable electricity, reduction of global energy poverty and a cleaner environment.”

In an email message responding to a request for comment, Dr. Happer said, “I don’t think I have anything to be embarrassed about.”

When asked whether he agreed that there should be full disclosure of foreign and industry influence on science, Dr. Happer said, “Yes, I believe in full disclosure.”

 
Short Answers to Hard Questions About Climate Change
But, he added, “I don’t think that full disclosure was the point of the Greenpeace article at all. The aim was simply to smear their enemies.”

Dr. Happer testified on Tuesday at a hearing of the Senate subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness, whose chairman is Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and a presidential candidate who disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change.

Michael Halpern, a program manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, expressed discomfort over the scrutiny of unguarded email exchanges, a controversial element of monthslong efforts by Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, to challenge the work of climate scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

“I know they can be taken out of context,” Mr. Halpern said. But, he added, “It’s entirely justified to ask for information that relates to researchers’ funding and whether there are any strings attached.”

Dr. Happer wrote in his exchanges with Greenpeace that he believed there were “real pollutants associated with the combustion of fossil fuels,” including the oxides of nitrogen and sulfur that contribute to smog, and that he supported regulation of those pollutants.

But he opposed the notion that carbon dioxide itself is a pollutant.

“More CO2 will benefit the world,” he wrote. “The only way to limit CO2 would be to stop using fossil fuels, which I think would be a profoundly immoral and irrational policy.”

Dr. Happer suggested to the purported funders that he not be paid directly. “My activities to push back against climate extremism are a labor of love,” he wrote.



He recommended that money for the project be paid to a nonprofit organization he helped found this year, the CO2 Coalition, which he said paid him no fees or salary, but “covers occasional travel expenses.”

On the question of disclosure, Dr. Happer said, “I don’t think there would be any problem stating that ‘the author received no financial compensation for this essay.’ ”

Dr. Happer then wrote to William O’Keefe, managing director of the nonprofit, and said, “I am trying to get another mysterious client to donate funds to the CO2 Coalition instead of compensating me for my writing something for them.” Dr. Happer also asked Mr. O’Keefe about disclosure.

Mr. O’Keefe responded, “We are under no obligation to identify donors, except to the I.R.S.,” and that list, he said, is redacted before release to the public."

'No Such Thing as Justice' in Chemical Pollution Fight in China
By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Owen Guo and Karoline Kan contributed research.
DAPU, China -- The small boy could no longer recognize the sound of his mother's voice. Bony and pale, vanishing beneath a winter coat, he spoke mostly in grunts and screams, the language of his malady. He stumbled as he walked, never certain of the ground beneath him.

Wang Yifei, 5, was destined for a better life, his family thought. To ensure years of good fortune, they relied on traditions that had always guided them: making certain his mother stepped over hot coals on her wedding day and lining his crib with white cloth to fend off wayward spirits.

But Yifei had fallen ill, and like more than 300 other children in Dapu, a town of 62,000 in Hunan Province, in central China, he suffered hearing loss, impaired speech and difficulty walking. Many other children also struggled with memory problems, stunted growth, anemia and seizures.

Doctors eventually determined that the children had lead poisoning and pointed to a nearby factory, Meilun Chemical Materials, which produced pigments for use in paints and makeup powder. Upset and demanding accountability, dozens of families prepared to sue.

Yet in Dapu, as in much of China's rural heartland, the chemical industry is king -- the backbone of years of above-average economic growth. Local Communist Party officials depended on Meilun and other plants for their livelihoods and political fortunes, and they had a history of ignoring environmental violations to keep the factories humming.

Yifei's father, Wang Jiaoyi, did not anticipate the backlash to the lawsuit. First, he said, his co-workers at a local farm warned that he might lose his job packing vegetables. Then thugs showed up at his door, threatening to hurt his family. After months of pressure, Mr. Wang decided to drop the case.

""There's no way to win,"" he said. ""There's no such thing as justice.""

After a decade in which companies in wealthier nations exported to poorer ones much of the dirty business of making hazardous substances, China is now the world's largest manufacturer of industrial chemicals, claiming a third of global production by some estimates.

But as the Chinese government has promoted the sector's rapid growth, it has struggled with its impact on the environment. The chemical industry has quashed calls to strengthen oversight and force companies to publicly disclose what substances they produce. Local environmental bureaus are often politically feeble and understaffed. Even when companies acknowledge some responsibility for harming public health, as Meilun did, the remedies given to communities often fall far short of the victims' needs.

""It's a dwarf regulating a giant,"" said Ma Jun, a prominent Chinese environmentalist.

Under President Xi Jinping, the government promised a chance for people to fight back, declaring a ""war on pollution"" and enacting a law in 2015 to make it easier to sue companies and force them to cover the cost of cleaning up neighborhoods. The law was supposed to level the playing field by enabling nonprofit groups to file public interest lawsuits against polluters. Environmentalists heralded it as a breakthrough.

But progress has been limited. In the Chinese courts, the Communist Party controls the decisions of judges, and they routinely rule on cases in consultation with officials who have a political and financial interest in the outcome. The police, at the behest of the local authorities, often harass lawyers and activists, hoping to deter them from bringing cases, advocates say. And the government decides which nonprofit groups can file public interest lawsuits.

As a result, those who stand up to the chemical industry in China rarely prevail.

Wang Zhenyu, a lawyer based in Beijing who has taken on cases on behalf of pollution victims, said the new law had failed to deter what he called a ""privileged class"" from intervening in environmental cases. ""The elite see pollution victims as their enemies,"" he said, ""and they will do everything possible to undermine them and keep their grip on power.""

Signs of Something Wrong

Staff members at Dapu Elementary School were startled. Children at the school were showing signs of hyperactivity and memory loss at an alarming rate. Teachers spent hours drilling geography and math into their students, but the next morning, many seemed to have forgotten the material.

Seeking answers, parents took their children to hospitals in the provincial capital, Changsha, and in Shanghai, 600 miles away. Doctors ordered blood tests and discovered a pattern: The children showed unusually high levels of lead in their blood. By the spring of 2014, lead poisoning had been diagnosed in more than 300 children.

For years, residents had accused Meilun of polluting the town. The plant stood in the center of a densely populated stretch of homes, vegetable markets and rice paddies.

When Dapu residents challenged the wisdom of allowing Meilun to operate so close to homes and schools, local officials were defiant. Meilun, formerly a state-owned plant, was one of the town's biggest employers, with more than 100 workers at its peak, and it generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax revenue.

Across China, a similar refrain was spreading. Chemical plants were popping up by the hundreds of thousands -- alongside train tracks, public housing complexes, rivers and farms.

China forbids facilities with hazardous chemicals to operate less than two-thirds of a mile from public buildings and major roads, but the rules are often violated. Lax enforcement contributed to a series of accidents, including the deadly explosion at a chemical plant in the port city of Tianjin two years ago, one of the worst industrial disasters in China's history.

In Dapu, few companies could rival Meilun's influence. When officials from the local environmental bureau accused the Meilun plant of violating emissions rules in 2013 and 2014, the plant's leaders called senior party leaders in Hengdong County to object, employees said. The regulators quickly dropped their complaints.

As public anger grew, China Central Television, the influential state broadcaster, aired a report that outlined the problems in Dapu and featured students who complained of stomach pain and nausea.

In one segment of the report, Su Genglin, the head of Dapu's government, said students might have been poisoned by chewing on pencils, though they contain graphite, not lead.

The report stirred popular outrage and forced the factory to halt production.

But Mr. Su stayed in office. The land remained highly toxic, according to tests by local environmental activists, and there was no plan to clean it up. Many children continued to be afflicted with symptoms related to lead poisoning. The government offered free milk to treat them, suggesting incorrectly that it could flush the lead out of their bodies.

On a recent morning, Mao Baozhu, 63, watched over her young grandson, who suffered chronic stomachaches and memory loss. They lived across the lane from the former Meilun plant, and tests showed the lead in his blood at six times international safety standards, one of the worst cases in Dapu.

Ms. Mao said she had once walked among cedar trees as a young woman. Now the earth was a wasteland, covered with tree stumps and jasmine bushes that had lost their scent. She held her grandson's hand. ""This isn't the life we imagined,"" she said.

Intimidating the Families

The trial was about to begin, and Dai Renhui was anxious. He had devoted his career to defending pollution victims. But rarely had he found himself in a case as contentious as the lead pollution lawsuit in Dapu.

Even before Mr. Dai filed the case, Meilun had waged a campaign to intimidate the families of the sick children, according to Dapu residents. Groups of unidentified men would show up at dusk, warning residents that they could lose their jobs or face violence if they continued to pursue the case. They offered bribes of $1,500 to those who would withdraw, some families said.

By the spring of 2015, when Mr. Dai went to court, 40 people had abandoned the suit. Only 13 remained.

They were seeking more than $300,000 from Meilun to pay medical bills for 13 children who had high levels of lead in their blood.

In court, Meilun's lawyers moved to dismiss the suit by questioning whether the children had proper paperwork to show that they resided near the factory, even though many of their families had lived there for decades.

At one point, the lawyers even suggested that poor hygiene among the children in Dapu might be to blame, provoking shouts of protest from the audience, according to relatives who were in the courtroom.

The challenges the Dapu families faced in court were just some of the many obstacles that confront pollution victims in China.

Collecting evidence is expensive, with even the most basic tests of soil or water pollution costing tens of thousands of dollars. Many plaintiffs spend years and small fortunes trying to build a case.

Adding to the difficulties, judges often question data collected by third parties, favoring official reports, which local governments sometimes refuse to release.

Victims of pollution can band together to hire lawyers and cover the cost of collecting evidence and soliciting expert opinions. But Chinese courts are often unwilling to hear cases with multiple plaintiffs, worried they might embolden citizens to organize protests.

The new environmental law promoted by President Xi was meant to help people like the families in Dapu by empowering nonprofits to take on powerful companies.

But courts have dampened the law's effects by favoring nonprofit groups that enjoy good relationships with the government or are controlled by the party. In 2015, only nine nonprofits managed to file cases under the law, even though more than 700 environmental groups across China were eligible.

Zeng Xiangbin, a lawyer in the central city of Wuhan, represented residents of a village in the southwestern province of Yunnan that had been contaminated with cadmium. Several villagers, including a 15-year-old boy, died suddenly, and residents blamed the pollution.

The case received wide attention in the Chinese news media in 2012. But there has been little action since. A court accepted the case, Mr. Zeng said, but has refused for years to hold a hearing.

""It keeps stalling, and that's it,"" he said. ""That's China's way of solving the problem.""

Victory, but Little Reward

Ms. Mao, whose grandson has lead poisoning, struggled to grasp the number before her.

A Hengdong County court ruled last year that Meilun was responsible for seriously poisoning two of the 13 children whose cases made it to court, including Ms. Mao's grandson. But it ordered the company to pay her and relatives of the other child only 13,000 renminbi each, or $1,900.

The money was barely enough to cover legal fees and the cost of collecting evidence, she said, let alone medical bills. The other families would get nothing.

In April, a Hengdong court agreed to hear the case again. Still, Ms. Mao said she worried that the outcome would be the same.

""Sometimes I lose hope and feel this will never end,"" she said. ""Nobody wants to take responsibility for what has happened to our children.""

In Dapu, the local government has tried to restore a sense of calm. Officials acknowledge that some children, but no more than 100, showed signs of serious lead poisoning but insist they have all been treated. Tan Zhenli, a propaganda official in Hengdong County, said that all the children were now healthy and that the polluted land had been cleaned.

""It's old news,"" Ms. Tan said. ""The factory has been closed. Everything is improving here.""

But Ms. Tan would not allow people in Dapu to speak with reporters unless she was present. Several said the authorities had ordered them not to accept interviews and warned they could be imprisoned for continuing to speak out.

Meilun has relocated to a nearby town, and its old factory in Dapu sits abandoned. Yifei plays nearby, splashing in puddles and pushing a yellow racecar down the sidewalk.

On Tuesdays, he goes to the hospital to check the level of lead in his blood, which was once nine times international standards and remains dangerously high. His condition is mostly unchanged, his parents said, but his memory shows signs of weakening.

""We're powerless to change our situation,"" his father said. ""There's nothing we can do to win."""

TRUMP RULES

Pruitt's E.P.A. Is Boon to Oil and Gas
By HIROKO TABUCHI and ERIC LIPTON; Hiroko Tabuchi reported from Wyoming, and Eric Lipton from Washington.
FREMONT COUNTY, Wyo. -- In a gas field here in Wyoming's struggling energy corridor, nearly 2,000 miles from Washington, the Trump administration's regulatory reversal is crowning an early champion.

Devon Energy, which runs the windswept site, had been prepared to install a sophisticated system to detect and reduce leaks of dangerous gases. It had also discussed paying a six-figure penalty to settle claims by the Obama administration that it was illegally emitting 80 tons each year of hazardous chemicals, like benzene, a known carcinogen.

But something changed in February just five days after Scott Pruitt, the former Oklahoma attorney general with close ties to Devon, was sworn in as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.

Devon, in a letter dated Feb. 22 and obtained by The New York Times, said it was ""re-evaluating its settlement posture."" It no longer intended to move ahead with the extensive emissions-control system, second-guessing the E.P.A.'s estimates on the size of the violation, and it was now willing to pay closer to $25,000 to end the three-year-old federal investigation.

Devon's pushback, coming amid an effort to ease a broad array of federal environmental rules, is the first known example under the Trump administration of an accused polluter -- which has admitted violating the law -- backing away from a proposed environmental settlement. It is already being hailed by other independent energy companies as a template for the future.

""Not in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything,"" said Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based association of independent oil and gas companies. ""We were kind of used to getting punished.""

The extraordinary about-face reflects the onset of an experiment in President Trump's Washington that is meant to fundamentally reorder the relationship between government and business. Across the federal government, lobbyists and lawyers who once battled regulations on behalf of business are now helping run the agencies they clashed with.

Mr. Trump and his team believe that loosening the regulatory grip on business will help the economy, create jobs and allow Americans ""to share in the riches,"" as he said during the campaign. But in the energy field, environmentalists, Democrats and even some in the industry fear the efforts will backfire, harming health and safety without creating much economic benefit.

The E.P.A. has not yet made a public response to Devon's new posture, and Mr. Pruitt declined to comment for this article. But the new approach follows a series of important victories for the energy industry in Washington that could reshape environmental policy on a national scale and undermine the Obama administration's campaign to combat climate change.

In just the last three months, with Mr. Pruitt in charge, the E.P.A. postponed a long-planned rule requiring companies like Devon to retrofit drilling equipment to prevent leaks of methane gas -- a major contributor to climate change -- and to collect more data on how much of the gas is spewing into the air.

The Interior Department, meanwhile, announced this month that it would reconsider a separate rule limiting the burning of unwanted methane gas from wells drilled on federal and Indian lands, a process called flaring. That announcement came the same day the Senate narrowly rejected industry calls to repeal the same rule.

Interior officials have also announced their intention to repeal or revise a contentious rule requiring companies like Devon to take extra steps to prevent groundwater contamination caused by hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, a drilling technique in which chemicals and water are forced into rock formations.

Environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund are outraged by these moves, and have vowed to fight any rollbacks in court.

""Devon is doing to the oil and gas industry what Donald Trump did to the Republican Party, pushing the whole agenda into a world of extremes,"" said Mark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund.

The rollbacks cap a carefully coordinated campaign over the last eight years led in part by Devon, which is based in Oklahoma City and is the nation's eighth-largest natural gas producer, and Mr. Pruitt, who served six years as Oklahoma attorney general before Mr. Trump named him E.P.A. chief.

Devon and Mr. Pruitt, while he was still attorney general out West, teamed up to block new federal rules imposed by the Obama administration that required fossil fuel companies to more closely monitor oil and gas wells for leaks, and disclose chemicals used in hydraulic fracking. Devon also poured millions of dollars a year into lobbying -- and hundreds of thousands into campaign contributions to Mr. Pruitt and other Republicans -- as it pushed regulators and lawmakers in Washington to do away with the restrictions.

For Devon and its industry allies, the turnaround is as startling as it is long-sought.

""We are so used to not being able to move an agenda forward that it has been very surprising how quickly things have changed,"" Ms. Sgamma said.

In Riverton, Wyo., a frontier city of dusty roads and squat brick buildings a half-hour drive from where Devon operates its gas field, a fossil fuel revival could not come quickly enough.

Well-paying jobs in oil and gas -- drilling wells, managing roustabouts -- are fast disappearing, as production in the state declines because of a slump in energy prices. Government agencies are bracing for cuts to basic services, including children's health programs and security at the county jail, because of declining tax revenues from fossil fuel companies.

Against that backdrop, Mr. Trump's defiant promises to free fossil fuels from their regulatory shackles have resonated here and across Wyoming, the country's second-biggest energy producing state after Texas. Mr. Trump scored his biggest margin of victory in Wyoming, beating Hillary Clinton by 46 percentage points.

In Fremont County, home to Riverton, seven in 10 voters chose Mr. Trump; in Campbell County, the heart of Wyoming coal country, it was nine out of 10. And there is a palpable disdain toward outsiders -- especially those in Washington -- who local officials say are quick to vilify fossil fuels without a full understanding of local economic realities.

""At the end of the day, we all just want to make sure we can prosper and raise our families,"" said Holly Jibben, a local councilwoman, a former rig worker and a mother. ""When oil and gas profits, everybody profits.""

A Mutually Beneficial Friendship

The invitation to lunch at the towering new Devon Energy Center in downtown Oklahoma City came to Mr. Pruitt in June 2012 -- 18 months into his tenure as Oklahoma's top law enforcement official -- from Larry Nichols, a co-founder of what had become the city's biggest independent oil and gas company.

Mr. Nichols and his father, John, had created Devon in 1971, starting with four employees and a negative net worth of several million dollars, while sharing a receptionist at an office building not far from their new tower, an early company history says.

Now, there was no denying Devon had reached extraordinary heights.

The Devon tower, 50 stories high, was unlike anything ever built in Oklahoma. It was an Empire State Building of this fossil-fuel town, visible from miles away. It could even be seen far west of Oklahoma City, out toward the 430,000 acres in the center of the state where Devon's rigs were drilling new wells.

Devon was riding a tremendous boom in oil and gas production in the United States that was fueled by the revolutionary new technologies that it had helped establish, like so-called coal-bed natural gas, which uses advanced drilling techniques to extract methane gas from underground coal deposits.

There was just one complication threatening Devon's ascent. President Barack Obama, unable to move many of his environmental goals through Congress, had adopted a new slogan: ""We Can't Wait,"" a blunt statement that he intended to start using his executive powers to combat climate change.

That's where Mr. Pruitt came in.

""We'll meet Scott in the lobby when he checks in at our concierge desk,"" William F. Whitsitt, then the head of Devon's fast-growing public relations and lobbying operations, wrote in an email to Mr. Pruitt's executive assistant.

Mr. Pruitt, a folksy, deeply religious former state legislator and minor-league baseball team general partner who was largely unknown on the national political stage, had won an upset victory in 2010. He had vowed to challenge Washington's intervention in Oklahoma's affairs.

""There's a mentality emanating from Washington today that says, 'We know best,""' Mr. Pruitt said during the campaign, which was supported by a donation from Mr. Nichols, as well as Devon's political action committee. ""It's a one-size-fits-all strategy, a command-and-control kind of approach, and we've got to make sure we know how to respond to that.""

Devon, historically, had been a minor player in Washington. But that changed in the first year of the Obama presidency, when Devon's spending on lobbying jumped nearly 350 percent to $2.5 million. Devon brought on a team of politically connected lobbyists, including Anthony Ferate, known as A. J., a lawyer with close ties to Mr. Pruitt, as well as Rebecca Rosen, a former Capitol Hill staff member who had worked on the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor.

The first major target was an E.P.A. data-collection effort that had determined methane emissions caused by oil and gas operations were much larger than Devon's own calculations. Air pollution from the then-booming oil and gas industry was now being blamed for extreme declines in air quality in rural areas of Wyoming and Utah. One sparsely populated stretch of northeastern Utah had a worse ozone problem than Los Angeles during the peak of the energy boom.

Devon initially participated in a voluntary program to capture leaking methane, or close off leaks, but was so suspicious of the Obama administration's intentions that it dropped out.

And indeed, the administration soon announced a major expansion of federal regulations aimed at cutting overall industry methane emissions by 45 percent. The oil and gas industry estimated just one of the new rules could cost more than a $800 million a year in new compliance costs.

Devon, furious, turned to Mr. Pruitt for help in pushing back.

""Just a note to pass along the electronic version of the draft letter to Lisa Jackson at E.P.A.,"" said one early request for help in 2011 from Devon to Mr. Pruitt. Devon suggested that Mr. Pruitt follow up with Mr. Ferate, the company's Washington lobbyist and a fund-raiser for Republican causes, if he had questions.

Mr. Pruitt did just as Devon asked, sending along the draft letter to Ms. Jackson, on his own stationery and under his signature, with only a few word changes.

The interventions by Devon also targeted the Interior Department and its Bureau of Land Management, which controls 260 million acres of public land and leases out large chunks to oil and gas companies for drilling, including the land here in Fremont County.

The bureau was pushing ahead with plans to require that Devon and other companies take extra steps to prevent chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing from contaminating groundwater, including a demand that Devon disclose the ingredients in millions of gallons of chemical-laced water it pumped into the federally managed land.

Devon has a total of about 1,500 wells on bureau-controlled land, representing about 15 percent of its oil and gas production.

Devon and Mr. Pruitt called the rules redundant in letters to federal officials, including the secretary of the Interior and Mr. Obama, while they also worked to challenge them in court and in Congress.

Devon made targeted contributions to sympathetic Republican lawmakers, who introduced legislation to block the rules or collected signatures among their colleagues on letters pressing federal agencies to back down. Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, was a particular favorite of Devon, as he repeatedly co-sponsored bills with names like ""Fracturing Regulations Are Effective in State Hands Act"" that would block federal intervention.

Each of the pieces of this campaign fell into place as planned. But Mr. Obama and his aides were hardly about to fold.

""Every day this was not attended to was a day we got closer to the tipping point -- when it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to prevent the kind of climate change damage we are worried about,"" said Janet McCabe, who led the air pollution enforcement division at the E.P.A. under Mr. Obama.

Devon Energy, Ms. McCabe said, was among the most determined opponents of the agency's work, far more so, for example, than international giants like Shell.

""In any regulated industry, there are companies that are more aggressive than others in pushing back at every turn and trying to stop the policy,"" she said. ""Devon was one of those.""

The Lifeblood of Riverton, Wyo.

Riverton's mayor, John Baker, known as Lars, turned carefully onto a dirt road that winds through Devon's sprawling oil and gas fields just outside the city limits, a source of both pride and frustration in a frontier town the ""Marlboro Man,"" Darrell Winfield, once called home.

Since the early 1900s, oil and gas have been pulled from the ground here, a vast stretch of arid plains in a valley that runs down from Yellowstone National Park -- an almost lunar landscape dotted with dry clumps of sagebrush, and rock formations adorned with the petroglyphs etched by Native American tribes, which have inhabited the area for centuries.

But production from the area's wells had slowed over recent decades, and Devon, known for its emphasis on new technologies, had a solution: It would inject carbon dioxide into the ground, putting pressure on underground oil deposits and pushing them to the pump.

The new method would allow Devon to ramp up production at the site from 100 barrels a day to 5,000, the company said. Statewide, drilling surged, with gas production more than doubling from 2000 to 2010.

The roaring minerals economy filled state coffers with billion-dollar annual surpluses and brought jobs that kept the unemployment rate for much of that decade below the national average.

""It was gangbusters,"" said Mr. Baker, a former weed and pest control man, who points out the oil and gas rigs as fondly as he does the local flora and fauna, like the Indian paintbrush plant that was just starting to show its red flowers.

Mr. Baker is not alone. In Riverton, a city of 11,000, the fading road signs -- Gas Hills, Oil Field Road -- underline the importance of fossil fuels. Local officials talk of companies like Devon as good corporate citizens.

For the last six Thanksgivings, Devon has helped a local group give food baskets to the needy. For years, the company has also donated to youth educational programs at local state parks.

But even as production was rising, tensions were brewing with Washington. The Obama administration had made cracking down on fugitive emissions from oil and gas sites a national priority.

By 2014, Devon stood accused by the E.P.A. of releasing 80 more tons a year of the harmful gases from its Beaver Creek plant in Wyoming than its permit allowed. The extra emissions amounted to a fifth more than the company's stated emissions of 361 tons in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available.

This class of chemicals -- known as volatile organic compounds -- is extremely potent and is blamed for helping create blankets of smog. Several of the chemicals are known carcinogens.

""You can smell it in the air,"" said John Fenton, a former Devon contract worker turned environmentalist who monitors oil and gas facilities scattered across Fremont County using an infrared camera.

At Devon, Mr. Fenton repaired heating equipment and did general maintenance jobs. He later worked elsewhere in the gas fields welding pipes for as much as $50 an hour. But he stopped when wells started cropping up close to residential areas, including about 200 feet from his Fremont County ranch. His neighbors' water turned black. His wife, Catherine, complained of losing her senses of smell and taste.

""These companies are emboldened by this remoteness to not do anything,"" he said.

But Mr. Fenton's concerns have not gained wider traction. Residents fret mostly about the crackdown on energy companies under Mr. Obama, which coincided with a downturn in oil and gas production brought on largely by a glut in the market and lower energy prices. That has made his tough approach a scapegoat for the downturn, and it is difficult to overstate the animosity toward federal environmental agencies.

Wyoming was one of around two dozen states that sued to block regulations imposed by the Clean Power Plan, Mr. Obama's effort to rein in greenhouse gas emissions. On the campaign trail, Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and the state's sole member of the House of Representatives, repeatedly called for a reduction in the size and authority of the E.P.A.

""The E.P.A. is the evil empire here,"" said Steven R. Peck, publisher of The Ranger, Fremont County's daily newspaper. ""But the regulatory game hasn't changed as much as the oil and gas industry itself,"" he said.

""People think, 'If we could just drill more wells a year,""' he said, ""but we also need clean energy and jobs.""

In Riverton, empty houses dot the city. The unemployment rate hovered around 7 percent earlier this year before dropping in March to 6.4 percent as seasonal jobs kicked in. The area's largest private employers are casinos.

""Everything's gone down, down,"" said Frenchie Warren, 59, a member of the Arapaho tribe, who sat killing time one recent afternoon on a bench next to a Shell gas station.

Mr. Warren lost his $23-an-hour job at the SST Energy Corporation earlier this year after he mangled his hand in a chain, he said. He is bitter toward Washington politicians, who he said were squeezing the life out of Riverton.

""They aren't helping us,"" Mr. Warren said. ""If I had a gun, I'd shoot them.""

Tacking Hard in Another Direction

They gathered in the Rachel Carson Green Room at the E.P.A.'s headquarters in Washington, about 75 agency employees in a high-ceiling conference room named after the famed environmentalist whose book ""Silent Spring"" helped inspire the modern environmental movement.

Mr. Pruitt, who a few days earlier had been confirmed as the new E.P.A. administrator, stood on the stage and tried to calm the nerves of the agency's staff in the room, as well as thousands more watching remotely.

""You don't know me very well,"" Mr. Pruitt said. ""In fact, you don't know me hardly at all other than maybe what you've read in the newspaper and seen on the news. ... I look forward to sharing the rest of the story with you as we spend time together.""

Catherine McCabe, the outgoing acting administrator, presented Mr. Pruitt with a baseball cap that featured the agency's iconic logo of a blooming flower surrounded by a sphere that represents blue sky, green earth and blue-green water.

But it quickly became clear that a new day had arrived at the E.P.A. as Mr. Pruitt offered a hint of his priorities at the agency. ""I believe that we as an agency and we as a nation can be both pro-energy and -jobs, and pro-environment,"" he said. ""That we don't have to choose between the two.""

Within weeks, the dismantling of the Obama-era rules was set in motion, first through broad proclamations from the White House as Mr. Trump signed executive orders, and later through specific administrative actions by Mr. Pruitt.

In April, Mr. Pruitt notified the oil and gas industry that he was granting its wish to at least temporarily suspend the agency's new rule. ""American businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,"" he said in a statement then.

Devon Energy was poised to be a major beneficiary of the changes.

Killing the methane rule would save Devon an estimated $430,000 a year in the four states where it operates wells, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund, although if industry estimates of the actual costs are accurate, the savings may be much higher.

A month earlier, Mr. Pruitt had squelched a request from the E.P.A. that 15,000 oil and gas companies nationwide collect data on methane emissions to help the agency fine-tune its regulations. Devon and other companies feared the data would be used to justify even tighter controls, so Mr. Pruitt canceled the requirement.

Devon has other allies on the Trump team.

A Devon lobbyist, Michael Catanzaro, resigned from his post and now is the top White House adviser on energy policy. His lobbying disclosure report filed on Jan. 19 -- the day before Mr. Trump was sworn in -- lists his lobbying work for Devon as targeting ""methane emissions from oil and gas production.""

Ms. Rosen, the former Romney campaign worker who until late last year was Devon's top in-house lobbyist in Washington, was spotted walking into transition team meetings hosted by Mr. Trump's advisers after the election.

The industry also has important allies in Congress, like Senator John A. Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees the E.P.A. and the Interior Department.

On the day the Senate voted, 54-46, to move ahead with Mr. Pruitt's confirmation, Mr. Barrasso walked off the Senate floor and headed to Charlie Palmer Steak, just across the street from the Senate side of the Capitol. Mr. Barrasso would not say who his guests were, but campaign finance records show that within roughly a month of that event, donations came in from Devon, as well as Chevron, Shell, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute. Mr. Barrasso has collected more than $500,000 in contributions from the oil and gas industry in the last two years.

Some Democrats in Congress have questioned whether Mr. Pruitt is taking actions explicitly to benefit Devon and other financial supporters.

In a letter last month, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and three other Senate Democrats pressed Mr. Pruitt to explain why he canceled the data-collection effort on methane -- suggesting it might be a favor to industry friends.

After a barrage of such questions, Mr. Pruitt agreed in early May to recuse himself from taking part in the agency's response to the lawsuits he had filed as attorney general, including one challenging the E.P.A.'s methane rule.

Oil and gas companies are hoping that Mr. Pruitt's business-friendly approach will extended to enforcement issues. Devon was first targeted by the E.P.A. in 2014, after it was accused of illegally discharging 80 tons a year of volatile organic compounds into the Wyoming air. The company had been close to reaching a settlement with the federal government.

Devon disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, on Feb. 15, that negotiations with the E.P.A. ""may result in a fine or penalty in excess of $100,000.""

But two days after that disclosure, Mr. Pruitt was confirmed as E.P.A. administrator, and by the next week, Devon was changing its tune.

Instead of the proposed leak-detection system, the company was now planning to replace an older gas-fired compressor with an electrically powered unit, reducing volatile organic compound emissions by about 5 tons a year. Devon also says that, after revisiting aspects of the case, it now ""does not believe that a six-figure civil penalty is justified.""

Tim Hartley, a Devon spokesman, acknowledged that the company had laid out a shift in its negotiating position. But he attributed the change to ""simple economics.""

The plant, he said, was marginal and had been considered for shutdown, and adopting a sophisticated leak-detection program there was not economically feasible, especially at a difficult time for the oil and gas industry. Devon's stock surged after Mr. Trump won the election, but has since dipped as oil prices have remained depressed.

The cost of the leak-detection program would amount to about 20 percent of the plant's annual operating budget, the company said in its letter.

Mr. Hartley said that the violations stemmed from a misinterpretation of complicated regulations and that Devon had not intentionally circumvented the rules. He said that Devon had not contacted Mr. Pruitt about the case.

The E.P.A. has not yet made public the investigation, or its decision on a settlement. Andrew Mutter, a spokesman for the agency's Colorado regional office, which covers Wyoming, said that talks on the matter remained active. The Justice Department attorney in charge of the case did not return requests for comment.

Mr. Hartley declined to comment on the effects for Devon of the wider regulatory rollback, saying it would be ""pure speculation"" to consider how the company might benefit.

But Ms. Sgamma, the president of the Western Energy Alliance, which includes Devon, said that Devon is among several independent oil and gas companies now taking a tougher stand with the E.P.A.

""I am not going to settle with you now, when this new administration has such a different philosophy,"" she said, explaining the new approach. ""It makes sense to do a wait-and-see."""
NYT-42.txt,"Philippines Rejects Environment Chief Who Took On Mining Interests
By AURORA ALMENDRAL
A former environmental activist who cracked down on the Philippine mining industry as the country's acting environment secretary was forced from her job on Wednesday when Congress denied her confirmation to the post.

Since being appointed in June by President Rodrigo Duterte, the acting secretary, Gina Lopez, has taken aim at the mining industry. She has acted aggressively to close mining companies accused of violating environmental laws and canceled mining contracts in watershed areas. Last Thursday, Ms. Lopez raced to issue a ban on open-pit mining along with other restrictions.

""We planned many things,"" Ms. Lopez said during a news conference after the vote against her confirmation. ""What a waste. Everyone would have benefited from the management and care of the environment.""

Ms. Lopez was championed by environmental activists, religious groups and social justice organizations, some of whom rallied in her support outside the Senate building on Wednesday. During her tenure, Ms. Lopez moved to shut the operations of 28 of the country's 41 mining companies. Those companies account for about half of the nickel production in the Philippines and have been accused of leaving rivers, rice fields and watersheds stained red with nickel laterite.

But the vote on Wednesday could not have come as a surprise for Ms. Lopez.

Congress twice deferred decisions on her appointment after contentious confirmation hearings in November and again in March. Mr. Duterte reappointed her both times. The vote on Wednesday, however, is final. In the Philippines, it is unusual for cabinet appointments to be denied confirmation, and they are normally allowed to serve while they await approval.

Mining companies, industry lobbying groups and some members of Congress strongly opposed her appointment.

In March, the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines filed a complaint against Ms. Lopez, calling her decision to close mining operations ""baseless and illegal."" During her confirmation hearings, lawmakers grilled Ms. Lopez on her knowledge of the mining industry, challenged her competence and questioned the legality of her orders.

Even as lawmakers deliberated behind closed doors Wednesday, a suspended mining company filed a graft complaint against Ms. Lopez, the fourth since her appointment.

Yeb Sano, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, said in a statement to reporters that the decision ""shows how destructive industries continue to hold Philippine lawmakers by their necks.""

Mr. Sano, who has argued that government corruption has allowed mining companies to pollute the environment for decades, accused the body voting on the appointment of being ""dominated by politicians with questionable loyalty,"" with some receiving campaign contributions from mining interests.

While Ms. Lopez must step down immediately, her orders will stand.

""It's just the beginning, because at least someone has defined the problem,"" said Cielo D. Magno, a professor of economics who studies extractive industries. Ms. Magno said Ms. Lopez had raised awareness on environmental issues and set a standard for future decisions around mining.

Ernesto Abella, a spokesman for the president, praised Ms. Lopez's contributions but added that ""this is a democratic process, and we respect their decision."" The presidential palace said that Mr. Duterte was now looking for a successor.

At the news conference after the vote, Ms. Lopez went out with a rallying cry, insisting that the people were entitled to a clean environment.

""That is our God-given right, and that is more important than business interests,"" Ms. Lopez said. She then broke into song, leading the room in a rendition of ""I Believe I Can Fly."""

Norway Divests From Coal
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The Norwegian Parliament voted on Friday to order the country's huge oil fund -- at $890 billion, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund -- to pull billions of dollars of investments out of companies that derive 30 percent or more of their business from mining or burning coal. The move is a major boost to the three-year-old campaign to persuade large investors to divest their fossil fuel stocks. And it could add to the momentum toward concrete action at the climate-change summit conference to be held in Paris in December.
That much is good. There is, however, a problem. Norway is also Europe's biggest producer of other fossil fuels, and the money that the country is pulling out of coal came from more than four decades of pumping oil and gas out of the North Sea. Coal may be a worse offender on the climate change front, and the Norwegian legislators may truly have the planet's best interests at heart, but it is hard to avoid the perception of hypocrisy in Norway's selective combat against carbon emitters.
There is no question that climate change is one of the great challenges of our time, that action is sorely overdue, and that it is imperative for the ParisÊCOP21Êclimate conference to make the serious decisions on reducing carbon emissions that previous such conference have failed to take. If the decisions to curb or cut coal investments by major institutions such as theÊChurch of England,ÊOxford University,ÊStanford University, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (also the product of oil production), the French insurer Axa -- and now the Norwegian oil fund -- help raise awareness and build momentum, good.
But that cannot be all, especially not for Norway. It is simply not enough for a country that contributes so much gas and oil to publicly put the onus on coal. The divestment decision must be only the first step: If Norway is not yet ready to keep its own fossil resources in the ground, it should at least seriously examine how its vast wealth could be used to support research and development of ways to wean the world from its reliance on fossil fuels. All fossil fuels.

Marketing a Harrowing Message With Hope
By CARA BUCKLEY
Two movies on similar missions are opening within weeks of each other this season, ""Racing Extinction"" and ""This Changes Everything,"" both exploring the devastation humanity has wrought on the natural world.
Yet rather than focusing only on what is dying and lost, both films offer messages of hope, profiling people who have helped stop, animal by animal, acre by acre, the pillaging of wildlife and land.
The question is whether people will go see the films. Accounts of global warming tend to leave those who aren't apathetic paralyzed and depressed, and tales of animal cruelty and extinction can be too harrowing to bear. The director of ""Racing Extinction,"" Louie Psihoyos, who won an Oscar for his 2009 documentary, ""The Cove,"" about the annual dolphin slaughter in Japan, said people still tell him they lack the mettle to see that film. And Naomi Klein, who adapted ""This Changes Everything,"" based on her book of the same name, said a film salesman, whom she declined to name, told her that he would market the movie only if there was no reference to climate change in the marketing.
""If you beat people over the head with shame, guilt and despair, you get exactly what you expect -- people turn away and try to forget about it,"" said Shawn Heinrichs, a photographer and an activist featured in ""Racing Extinction."" He added: ""The last thing people want to do is take on a heavy dose of depression. We have to recognize that.""
Cognizant of such aversion, the teams behind each film, which share the same distributor, developed similar plans: target the people most passionate about what's at stake, and bank on them to draw in others.
""We want to make sure we approach the core audience directly,"" said Richard Abramowitz, whose company, Abramorama, is distributing both films. ""Once we've gotten their attention, we work with them to activate others and spread the word.""
As he did with ""The Cove,"" Mr. Psihoyos sought to create a thriller, using undercover spies to expose animal traffickers while highlighting acts of environmentalist derring-do. ""Racing Extinction"" got a head start with its message this summer when the director and his collaborators projected images of endangered animals onto the Empire State Building.
The film opened theatrically on Sept. 18, and an awards run is being eyed. (It helps that Mr. Psihoyos has name recognition from his Oscar win.) But whether ""Racing Extinction"" has a broader impact may not be clear until Dec. 2, when theÊDiscovery Channelplans to broadcast it in prime time in about 220 countries and territories.
John Hoffman, a former HBO producer who is now executive vice president for documentaries and specials at Discovery, said the channel's executives decided to throw their weight behind the film shortly after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January.
""We have aired things globally, but never as this sort of call to action,"" Mr. Hoffman said, adding: ""We have to make this a global event. We have to say to the world, 'For a moment, we have to stop, and look at the issues' "" that the film raises. ""Our aim is that everybody in the world should know this film is on.""
The Dec. 2 date is strategic:ÊCOP21, theÊUnited NationsÊclimate change conference, is to be held in Paris from Nov. 30 through Dec. 11.
Similarly, Ms. Klein and Avi Lewis, her husband and the film's director, hustled to get ""This Changes Everything"" out well ahead ofÊCOP21. ""Working back from Paris has been the orienting goal here,"" said Janet Brown, chief executive of FilmBuff, which is releasing the film with Abramorama and handling its worldwide distribution.
The film focuses on grass-roots movements that thwarted oil companies and communities that embraced renewable energy. Ms. Klein and Mr. Lewis, both longtime activist journalists, began building support for the documentary when she started researching her book about five years ago. They hired an outreach director immediately, and worked with groups like 350.org,ÊGreenpeaceÊand Friends of the Earth to plan screenings. Such organizations can draw in audiences that may be further galvanized by what they see, Ms. Klein said.
""Films don't change the world, movements do,"" she added, pointing to the momentum that the film ""Gasland"" gave to the anti-fracking movement.
""This Changes Everything,"" which will be released theatrically on Friday, also had showings in a dozen cities last Saturday, including one in Amsterdam, where it was projected on a coal-fired power station. The film will also be available on iTunes on Oct. 20. ""We believe that to bring a new narrative into a cluttered culture, you need multiple points of entry,"" Mr. Lewis said.
Mr. Abramowitz, the distributor, said he did not think ""Racing Extinction"" and ""This Changes Everything"" would cannibalize each other's audiences, and Mr. Lewis agreed. ""We believe the more documentaries on the subject, the better,"" he said.
The ""Racing Extinction"" promoters also made sure they had an infrastructure -- they called it an ""impact campaign"" -- in place before the film opened, ready to give answers to viewers who ask, ""What can I do?"" They teamed with Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, and his company Vulcan to push for laws banning the trafficking of endangered species, among other initiatives, and exhorted, via social media and a website, supporters to do the same.
Mr. Psihoyos also chose an image from one of his projections -- a manta ray, glowing on a tall building -- for the film's poster, certainly far more beckoning than any picture of the large-scale marine killing that the film explores. (The filmmakers said they also left far more upsetting images on the cutting room floor.) He did the same with ""The Cove,"" adorning DVD covers with images of frolicking dolphins.
It's all part of the effort to get people to see the movie and then take an action. The message Mr. Psihoyos is propounding is that each voice and each act, no matter how small, counts: Outrage generated by ""The Cove"" helped reduce dolphin killings in Japan to 6,000 a year from 23,000.
""We set up a chorus of people doing amazing things so at the end, people want to join us, rather than get full of despair,"" Mr. Psihoyos said. ""We try to bookend everything we do with hope.""

Connecticut Should Be Tesla Turf
By NICK SIBILLA
When President Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, Gov.ÊDannel MalloyÊof Connecticut responded that his state would continue its push to reduce its carbon footprint. ""Connecticut has been a national leader in combating climate change,"" he declared. ""We have no plans of slowing down our efforts.""
Yet Connecticut is a surprising laggard when it comes to one obvious way to cut carbon emissions: Consumers are not allowed to buy electric vehicles without a costly middleman. Connecticut is one of at least six states that bans carmakers -- including Tesla, the nation's largest manufacturer of electric vehicles -- from opening their own storefronts and selling their cars directly to consumers.
With cities and states moving to the forefront of the climate battle as the federal government steps back, even small regulatory changes, like allowing carmakers to sell electric vehicles directly to the public, could have an outsize impact.
Although Tesla can already sell directly to consumers in neighboring New York and Massachusetts, Connecticut is an especially alluring market. Long known for its clusters of wealth (it was the top-ranked state last year in per capita income), Connecticut has pledged to put around 155,000 ""zero-emission"" vehicles (including electric cars and hybrids) on the road by 2025. To reach that goal, Connecticut offers rebates of up to $3,000 for anyone who purchases or leases a green car, and hosts about 300 charging stations.
Connecticut and Tesla should be a perfect fit. But lawmakers failed to act on a bill in this year's regular legislative session (for the third straight year) that would have legalized direct sales by Tesla, whose business model is rooted in selling directly to consumers.
The culprit? Heavy lobbying by the state's car dealerships.
Thanks to Connecticut's decades-old franchise laws, new cars can be sold only through licensed franchises independent of carmakers. Even though only about 5,500 zero-emission cars have sold in Connecticut since 2011, Tesla's effort to cut out the middlemen would undermine the lucrative stranglehold that car dealerships have on the new car market.
The Connecticut General Assembly's failure to act follows a rough year of defeats for Tesla. In Texas this spring, the car dealers lobby killed a similar measure in the legislature for the third year in a row. In April, the Utah Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state's Tesla ban, handing a win to the Utah Auto Dealers Association, which filed an amicus brief in the case. And last month, Louisiana's governor signed a new law that entirely bars direct sales by carmakers. Michigan and West Virginia have similar laws.
This flurry of lobbying by car dealerships is a prime example of so-called bottleneckers in action. As used in the title of a new book by the Institute forÊJustice, where I work, a bottlenecker is ""a person who advocates for the creation or perpetuation of government regulation"" in order to accrue ""an economic advantage without providing a benefit to consumers."" Often, bottleneckers urge lawmakers to create new regulatory bottlenecks (as in Louisiana) or to preserve existing ones (as in Connecticut and Texas).
Since manipulating public policy to increase profits is hard to defend publicly, bottleneckers rely on other arguments.
For instance, the Connecticut Automotive Retailers Association, which represents 270 car dealerships and led the charge to kill the Tesla bill, claimed that allowing direct sales would mean ""10 percent of employees at dealerships could lose their jobs.""
But after reviewing employment figures for car dealerships in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, the Acadia Center, a nonprofit focused on creating a cleanÊenergyÊeconomy, concluded that ""there has been no negative impact on auto dealer job levels or trends"" in neighboring states that allow direct sales of electric vehicles.
Using a different argument, the National Automobile Dealers Association claimed franchise laws ""keep prices competitive and low."" However, a 2009 paper by an economist at theÊJustice Department's Antitrust Division instead concluded that ""car customers would benefit from elimination of state bans on auto manufacturers' making direct sales to consumers."" The paper pointed to a study by aÊGoldman SachsÊanalyst in 2000 that found that direct manufacturer sales could lower costs by 8.6 percent, with most of the savings resulting from more efficient matching between consumer demand and supply, and a subsequent reduction in inventory.
No wonder theÊFederal Trade CommissionÊhas criticized franchise laws as a ""special protection"" for these dealers -- ""a protection that is likely harming both competition and consumers.""
The battle between Tesla and car dealers is echoed in other industries. The hotel industry has started a ""multipronged, national campaign"" to counter the short-term rental company Airbnb, which now has a valuation on par withÊMarriott International. And, facing stiff competition from Uber and Lyft, taxi associations are suing to block their ride-hailing rivals.
The failure to legalize direct sales by Tesla is a testament to how archaic laws stifle entrepreneurship and limit consumer choice. If America wants to combat climate change, it needs to take on bottleneckers and change its climate for innovation.

For Faithful, SocialÊJusticeÊGoals Demand Action onÊEnvironment
By JUSTIN GILLIS
For an earnest young Christian named Ben Lowe, revelation came on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, in Africa. A relentless warming of the lake was reducing the catch of fish, the people were going hungry -- and he had learned of scientific evidence that climate change was to blame.
For the Rev. Brian Sauder, who grew up attending a small Anabaptist church in rural Illinois, the moment came in a college classroom. Studying the fallout from environmental degradation, he learned of poor people who had to walk hours longer each day to gather firewood from depleted forests.
For both men, Christian duties that their upbringing had led them to regard as separate -- taking care of the earth and taking care of the poor -- merged into a morally urgent problem. ""Why haven't I ever made this connection before?"" Mr. Sauder recalled asking himself.
It is a connection that many people of faith all over the world are starting to make.
The sweeping pastoral letter issued by Pope Francis on Thursday may prove to be a watershed, highlighting the issues of socialÊjusticeÊat the heart of the environmental crisis. But the pope's encyclical is, in a sense, simply an exclamation mark on a broad shift in thinking that has been underway for decades and extends far beyond theÊRoman Catholic Church.
Many faith traditions are awakening to the burden that climate change is placing on poor people, and finding justification for caring for the environment in their scripture. The pope's urgent call is likely to intensify this discussion, provoking what could be one of the most important dialogues between science and religion since the days ofÊCharles Darwin.
Environmental scientists who are themselves people of faith are in rising demand, valued as translators between two camps that have often seen the world in radically different ways. These scientists have known for a long time that the facts and data produced by their research colleagues would not be sufficient to rouse the public to act. For that to happen, the science had to be reframed in moral terms, they said.
""The science is critical, but it's not enough,"" said Nathaniel P. Hitt, a fisheries biologist who is active in aÊPresbyterian churchÊin Shepherdstown, W.Va. ""Science is like a compass. It can tell us where north is, but it can't tell us if we want to go north. That's where our morality comes in.""
Dr. Hitt and the congregation to which he belongs are, to borrow his phrase, heading north. They recently put solar panels on the roof of their church and linked their home water heaters into a network that can help balance the grid fluctuations from renewable power, and they are avidly studying other ways to tackle the emissions causing global warming.
Hundreds of other churches, mosques and synagogues across the country have put up solar panels in recent years or retrofitted their buildings to cut energy use, or both. With the cost of renewable energy falling, that number could soon be in the thousands.
Politicians who try to reduce incentives for renewable power can find themselves contending with a new force: upset preachers packing the front row of the hearing room. A pastor in Fort Wayne, Ind., Brian Flory, recently helped stall such a bill in his state, citing the right of churches to ""generate electricity from God's free sunshine.""
For a long time, people of faith who felt a sense of urgency about the environment were outnumbered in their congregations by parishioners who disagreed with them on the issue or simply saw more immediate concerns. That is still true in many churches, perhaps in most of them, but the evidence suggests that the priorities are starting to change.
Polls show that a majority of American Christians view climate change as real, but fewer than a third of them understand the point, thoroughly documented in scientific studies, that poor people are already being harmed by it.
Men like Mr. Lowe and Mr. Sauder have dedicated their lives to helping other people of faith grasp the connection.
Mr. Sauder, ordained in the Mennonite denomination, is the executive director of Faith in Place, an interfaith group in Illinois that helps houses of worship with energy retrofits, solar panel installations and other steps that cut planet-warming emissions. Similar groups have sprouted across the country under the banner of a national organization called Interfaith Power and Light.
Mr. Lowe traveled as a college student, nearly a decade ago, to Lake Tanganyika, where he studied with an environmental scientist named Catherine O'Reilly. Dr. O'Reilly had documented that rising temperatures in the lake were depleting the surface waters of nutrients. That, in turn, was damaging fish populations that historically helped feed millions of people.
""I realized that climate change was already having impacts, and not just on God's creation, but on many of my brothers and sisters around the world,"" Mr. Lowe said.
The situation has grown only worse since, with overfishing being a possible factor, said Dr. O'Reilly, now an assistant professor at Illinois State University. She visited the lake again last year, and ""the price of a small pile of fish has gone up 10 times, which is huge for people who are living day to day,"" she said.
After college, Mr. Lowe helped found, and is now the spokesman for, Young Evangelicals for Climate Action, a national organization that has allied with other faith and environmental groups to push for change.
Despite shifting public opinion, Mr. Lowe and others who employ the slogan ""creation care"" are still viewed with suspicion by many fellow evangelicals.
Polls suggest that evangelicals are the American religious group least likely to believe that global warming is real or caused by humans. Many of them are politically conservative and are influenced by groups that question established climate science and defend the rising use of fossil fuels.
Among Christians and Jews, theological discussion sometimes centers on exactly what God meant in the first chapter of Genesis when he granted human beings ""dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.""
Does this passage -- in Christian theology, it is called the dominion mandate -- mean that people can do no ecological wrong? Some conservative politicians do seem to interpret the verse, and related ones, as a promise that God would not let humans wreck their only home.
""My point is, God's still up there,"" Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who is one of the leading climate-science doubters in Congress, said on a Christian radio program in 2012. ""The arrogance of people to think that we, human beings, would be able to change what he is doing in the climate is, to me, outrageous.""
In his encyclical, Francis disputed this view, declaring not only that humans are altering the climate but that the dominion mandate encompasses a duty to care for creation. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist atÊTexas Tech UniversityÊwho is an evangelical Christian, lines up with the pope on the issue.
If God granted humanity free will, she sometimes asks audiences, why would that not include the capacity to harm the planet?
Religious conservatives who oppose environmentalism profess a deep concern for the plight of the poor. But they point out that economic success has historically been closely linked to the use of fossil fuels.
""The policies meant to mitigate global warming would oppress the poor by depriving them of the energy without which they cannot rise out of poverty,"" E. Calvin Beisner, a leader of an American group called the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, declared this year in Rome at a symposium held to pre-emptively counter Francis' message.
Liberal groups often dismiss that view as tendentious, yet it is precisely the fear that preoccupies countries like India that have refused to commit to serious emissions limits.
The stated goal of the environmental movement is to break the link between fossil fuels and economic success.
Perhaps the biggest question now is whether rising concern about the environment among religious groups will translate into stronger political demands that governments find ways to reduce the cost of low-carbon energy supplies, improve their reliability and speed their deployment.
This month, more than 350 American rabbis issued a letter of their own, declaring that the time for action was at hand.
""The hope is that over and over in our history, when our country faced the need for profound change, it has been our communities of moral commitment, religious covenant and spiritual search that have arisen to meet the need,"" the rabbis declared. ""So it was 50 years ago during the civil rights movement, and so it must be today.""

NYT-5.txt,"Hillary Clinton Lays Out Climate Change Plan

Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday toured a Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority station with Elizabeth Presutti, general manager, and Keith Welch, building superintendent. Credit Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press
DES MOINES — Setting ambitious goals for producing energy from the sun, wind and other renewable sources, Hillary Rodham Clinton seized on an issue Monday that increasingly resonates with Democratic voters and sets up a stark contrast with the Republican presidential field.

With many Republican candidates saying they do not believe that climate change is a threat or requires government intervention, Mrs. Clinton assailed their logic, saying, “The reality of climate change is unforgiving no matter what the deniers say.”

She set a goal to produce 33 percent of the nation’s electricity from renewable sources by 2027, up from 7 percent today — a higher goal than the 20 percent that President Obama has called for by 2030.

Mrs. Clinton’s strategists see climate change as a winning issue for 2016. They believe it is a cause she can advance to win over deep-pocketed donors and liberal activists in the nominating campaign, where she is facing Democratic challengers to her left on the issue. It is also one that can be a weapon against Republicans in a general election. Polls show that a majority of voters support candidates who pledge policy action on the warming climate.

Mrs. Clinton called for installing a half-billion solar panels by 2020, a sevenfold increase from today, and to generate enough energy from carbon-free sources within 10 years of her inauguration to power every home in America.

Continue reading the main story
Republicans criticized the proposal as an “energy poverty” agenda that could raise utility bills and lead to blackouts. Policy analysts said it could be tough for Mrs. Clinton to follow through on such ambitious goals.

 
Who Is Running for President?
While Mr. Obama’s climate change goals, driven by regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, would lift the nation’s renewable power to about 20 to 25 percent, according to E.P.A. estimates, the rest of the increase, experts said, will be impossible without new laws requiring renewable power. Congress has failed over the past decade to pass such laws.

The Clinton campaign emphasized that her targets cleared a bar set last week by the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who spent $74 million on political races in 2014. He announced that for candidates to receive his support in 2016, they must offer policies that would lead the nation to generate half its electricity from clean sources by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050.

Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who has made climate change the center of his Democratic presidential campaign, laid out a plan last month that meets the criteria, winning Mr. Steyer’s blessing. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has called for a tax on carbon emissions, draws thunderous applause at rallies by promising bold action to combat climate change.

Although Mrs. Clinton has emphasized fighting global warming as a priority in earlier speeches, the role of a single large donor, Mr. Steyer, in apparently influencing the details of her proposal was suggested by her press secretary, Brian Fallon. On Twitter he said, “Counting nuclear, as Steyer does, she exceeds his 50 percent goal” for 2030.

But Mrs. Clinton showed some limits to how far she would go to address climate change by refusing to say, once again, if she opposed the Keystone XL pipeline — a litmus test for grass-roots environmentalists. The pipeline would deliver oil from the oil sands of northern Alberta in Canada to Texas.

Recusing herself because she had played a role as secretary of state in evaluating the pipeline, Mrs. Clinton said the decision was in the hands of the Obama administration. Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley oppose the pipeline.

 
Just as liberal Democrats have tried to pull Mrs. Clinton to the left on economic issues, environmental groups have sought stronger statements from her opposing hydraulic fracturing, oil trains and drilling in the Arctic.

Anti-Keystone protesters have greeted Mrs. Clinton on the campaign trail in New Hampshire and even outside a May fund-raiser for her at Mr. Steyer’s home in San Francisco overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge.

“Hillary Clinton is just half the way there,” said Bill McKibben, head of the group 350.org, which has led the grass-roots movement calling for Mr. Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline. “This is a credible commitment to renewable energy, and a recognition that the economics of electricity are changing fast. Now, we need Clinton to show she understands the other half of the climate change equation — and prove she has the courage to stand up against fossil fuel projects like offshore and Arctic drilling, coal leasing in the Powder River basin, and the Keystone XL pipeline.”

Without offering specifics, Mrs. Clinton promised that in coming months she would unwrap additional climate policies, including aid to workers in coal-producing regions who suffer economic harm.

“I am going to set ambitious goals, and I am going to have a real plan that will enable us to meet those goals,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Her campaign put the cost of her clean electricity initiatives at about $60 billion over 10 years, which it said would be offset by ending tax breaks for oil and gas producers.

“We’ll stop the giveaways to big oil companies and extend, instead, tax incentives for clean energy, while making them more cost-effective for both taxpayers and producers,” Mrs. Clinton said.

Experts said there would be more practical challenges.

“It’s an ambitious goal. It will be a big lift to get there,” said Anthony Paul, a fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan research organization.

Mr. Paul suggested that in order to meet Mrs. Clinton’s goals, Congress would have to mandate production of renewable power, or to tax greenhouse gas pollution — both proposals that have floundered on Capitol Hill.

Republicans were quick to criticize the proposals. “Hillary Clinton’s energy plan is to raise more taxes and double down on President Obama’s E.P.A. overreach, which held down wages and cost American jobs,” said Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee.

Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta, was the architect of Mr. Obama’s signature climate change policy, a set of E.P.A. regulations to cut carbon emissions from power plants. Mrs. Clinton’s new plan appears explicitly designed to build on that plan.

While running for re-election in the 2012 campaign, Mr. Obama almost never mentioned climate change. But Democratic strategists say they now see it as a resonant campaign issue.

A January poll conducted by The New York Times, Stanford University and Resources for the Future found that two-thirds of Americans said they were more likely to vote for political candidates who campaign on fighting climate change.

“This issue now polls better than any other issue for Democrats,” said Paul Bledsoe, a former top climate change official in the Clinton administration. “It’s in Clinton’s interest to talk about the issue, both for primary voters and to highlight Republican vulnerabilities in the general election.”"

THEÊCLIMATEÊISSUE
The Deluge
By JON MOOALLEM
A few years ago, a locally famous blogger in San Francisco, known as BurritoÊJustice, created an exquisitely disorienting map, with help from a cartographer named Brian Stokle, and started selling copies of it online. The map imagined the city in the year 2072, after 60 years of rapid sea-level rise totaling 200 feet. At present, San Francisco is a roughly square-shaped, peninsular city. But on the map, it is severed clean from the mainland and shaved into a long, fat smudge. The shape of the land resembles a sea bird diving underwater for prey, with odd bays chewing into the coastlines and, farther out, a sprawl of bulging and wispy islands that used to be hills. If you lived in San Francisco, it was a map of where you already were and, simultaneously, where you worried you might be heading. ""The San Francisco Archipelago,"" BurritoÊJusticeÊcalled it -- a formerly coherent city in shards.
The map wasn't science; it didn't even pretend to be. I want to be very clear about that, because I worry it's reckless to inject any more false facts into a conversation about climate change. Projecting the effect of sea-level rise on a specific location typically involves recondite computer models and calculations; BurritoÊJusticeÊwas just a fascinated hobbyist, futzing around on his laptop in his backyard. His entire premise was unscientific; for now, it is unthinkable that seas will rise so high so quickly. Even as most credible scientific estimates keep increasing and the poles melt faster than imagined, those estimates currently reach only between six and eight feet by the year 2100. That's still potentially cataclysmic: Water would push into numerous cities, like Shanghai, London and New York, and displace hundreds of millions of people. And yes, there are some fringe, perfect-storm thought experiments out there that can get you close to 200 feet by the end of the century. But in truth, BurritoÊJusticeÊsettled on that number only because that's how high he needed to jack up the world's oceans if he wanted to wash out a particular road near his house. He has a friendly rivalry with another blogger, who lives in an adjacent neighborhood known for being a cloistered hamlet, and BurritoÊJusticeÊthought it would be funny to see it literally become an island. So again: The map wasn't science. It didn't pretend to be. The point, initially, was just to needle this other guy named Todd.
Still, the San Francisco Archipelago has always stuck with me, because, almost in spite of itself, it managed to convey something peculiar and destabilizing about our climatological future. BurritoÊJusticeÊhadn't just redrawn the geography of a place; he'd also carried a sense of that place forward in time. And by transposing some of the grit and silly shibboleths of contemporary city life onto that alternate landscape, the map (and the little blog posts he wrote to accompany it) prodded you to entertain the possibility that this ruined future might not feel like an emergency to those living it, that life in that archipelago might have all the richness, realness and inanity of ours.
There were, most obviously, the breezy, optimistic names given to every new feature of the redrawn city, as though its ever-peppy real estate agents had gone on rebranding neighborhoods as the landscape drowned. Climate change, in this scenario, had more in common with gentrification than with a natural disaster: a ceaseless upheaval of familiar spaces that left old-timers shaking their heads, then kept accelerating. Instead of Telegraph Hill rising north of Market Street downtown, Telegraph Island now offered a tranquil view of Market Shoals. Dolores Park was gone. But Cape Dolores jutted toward it, overlooking the submerged Mission District -- now Mission Gulf. The former San Francisco Zoo, out at Ocean Beach, was labeled San Francisco Aquarium.
Life went on, in other words -- albeit in some bleak and greatly diminished capacity. Taco boats replaced taco trucks, the public-transit agency's ""sea bus"" system exaggerated its on-time performance statistics and the city government was offering to extend the notorious tax break it offered Twitter in 2011 if the tech company relocated to ""disadvantaged Nob Island."" The only people who remembered us, or validated our earlier reality, came off as loopy, Nimby activists aiming to obstruct development on one of the new coasts. ""Old San Francisco is still alive in our hearts and minds,"" a statement from the Submerged Historic San Francisco Preservation Association insists, ""even if only the tops of the buildings can be seen!""
The map was a joke. But the longer I looked at it, the less funny and more upsetting it got. I pictured the first apartment my wife and I rented in San Francisco, how I'd parked the car out front while, just home from the hospital, she carried our first baby up the stairs. Then I pictured that all under water, and a man pushing off in his kayak for a paddle far overhead.
The future we've been warned about is beginning to saturate the present. We tend to imagine climate change as a destroyer. But it also traffics in disruption, disarray: increasingly frequent and more powerful storms and droughts; heightened flooding; expanded ranges of pests turning forests into fuel for wildfires; stretches of inhospitable heat. So many facets of our existence -- agriculture, transportation, cities and the architecture they spawned -- were designed to suit specific environments. Now they are being slowly transplanted into different, more volatile ones, without ever actually moving.
We're accustomed to hearing about the tragically straightforward cases of island nations that will simply disappear: countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati that face the possibility of having to broker the wholesale resettlement of their people in other countries. Yet there must also be, in any corner of the planet, and for each human living on it, a threshold at which a familiar place becomes an unfamiliar one: an altered atmosphere, inundated by differentness and weirdness, in which, on some level, we'll live on, in exile. The Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht describes this feeling as ""solastalgia"": ""a form of homesickness one gets when one is still at 'home.' ""
Some communities will face new problems and varieties of weather; in others, existing ones will intensify. Already-vulnerable societies -- the poor, the poorly governed -- may be stressed to grim breaking points. Consider the mass starvation in South Sudan, Nigeria, Yemen and Somalia, where a total of nearly a million and a half children are predicted to die this year -- and that climate change is projected to worsen the kind of droughts that caused it. Consider, too, a 2015ÊDepartment of DefenseÊreport, which framed climate change as a geopolitical ""threat multiplier"" that will ""threaten domestic stability in a number of countries,"" and cited a study showing how a five-year drought in Syria contributed to the outbreak of the current conflict there. Nonetheless, denial is coming back in fashion among the most powerful. We have a president who dismisses climate change as a hoax, and a budget director who belittles government programs to study and adapt to our new reality as a ""waste of your money.""
Still, we insulate ourselves from the disorientation and alarm in other, more pernicious ways, too. We seem able to normalize catastrophes as we absorb them, a phenomenon that points to what Peter Kahn, a professor of psychology at theÊUniversity of Washington, calls ""environmental generational amnesia."" Each generation, Kahn argues, can recognize only the ecological changes its members witness during their lifetimes. When we spoke recently, Kahn pointed to the living conditions in megacities like Kolkata, or in the highly polluted, impoverished areas affected by Houston's oil refineries, where he conducted his initial research in the early '90s. In Houston, Kahn found that two-thirds of the children he interviewed understood that air and water pollution were environmental issues. But only one-third believed their neighborhood was polluted. ""People are born into this life,"" Kahn told me, ""and they think it's normal.""
AÊUniversity of British ColumbiaÊfisheries scientist, Daniel Pauly, hit upon essentially the same idea around the same time, recognizing that as populations of large fish collapsed, humanity had gone on obliviously fishing slightly smaller species. One result, Pauly wrote, was a ""creeping disappearance"" of overall fish stocks behind ever-changing and ""inappropriate reference points."" He called this impaired vision ""shifting baseline syndrome.""
There are, however, many subtler shifts in our awareness that can't be as precisely demarcated. Scenarios that might sound dystopian or satirical as broad-strokes future projections unassumingly materialize as reality. Last year, melting permafrost in Siberia released a strain of anthrax, which had been sealed in a frozen reindeer carcass, sickening 100 people and killing one child. In July 2015, during the hottest month ever recorded on earth (until the following year), and the hottest day ever recorded in England (until the following summer), the Guardian newspaper had to shut down its live-blogging of the heat wave when the servers overheated. And low-lying cities around the world are experiencing increased ""clear-sky flooding,"" in which streets or entire neighborhoods are washed out temporarily by high tides and storm surges. Parts of Washington now experience flooding 30 days a year, a figure that has roughly quadrupled since 1960. In Wilmington, N.C., the number is 90 days. But scientists and city planners have conjured a term of art that defuses that astonishing reality: ""nuisance flooding,"" they call it.
Kahn calls our environmental generational amnesia ""one of the central psychological problems of our lifetime,"" because it obscures the magnitude of so many concrete problems. You can wind up not looking away, exactly, but zoomed in too tightly to see things for what they are. Still, the tide is always rising in the background, swallowing something. And the longer you live, the more anxiously trapped you may feel between the losses already sustained and the ones you see coming.
Such shifting baselines muddle the idea of adaptation to climate change, too. Adaptation, Kahn notes, can mean anything from the human eye's adjusting to a darker environment within a few milliseconds to wolves' changing into dogs over thousands of years. It doesn't always mean progress, he told me; ""it's possible to adapt and diminish the quality of human life."" Adapting to avoid or cope with the suffering wrought by climate change might gradually create other suffering. And because of environmental generational amnesia, we might never fully recognize its extent. Think of how Shel Silverstein's Giving Tree, nimbly accommodating each of the boy's needs, eventually winds up a stump.
On the most fundamental level, Kahn argues, we are already adapting to climate change through a kind of tacit acquiescence, the way people in a city like Beijing accept that simply breathing the air outside can make them sick. ""People are aware -- they're coughing and wheezing,"" he told me, ""but they're not staging political revolutions."" Neither are we. And, Kahn went on, we risk imprisoning ourselves, through gradual adaptation, into a condition of ""unfulfilled flourishing."" A wolf becomes a dog, genetically; it wants to fetch tennis balls and sleep at the foot of your bed. But imagine a dog that isn't yet a dog, that still wants to be a wolf.
Sure, I told him, but at some point it would all be too much. Potentially, Kahn said. But assumptions about the future, no matter how self-evident they may feel, don't automatically come true. ""The amazing thing is that none of this seems to work the way we think it should. When I was growing up in the Bay Area in the 1970s, the traffic was really bad. And I said, If it just gets a little bit worse, you're going to have a major upheaval in consciousness. And every five years it got worse."" He went silent for a second, then continued, ""I'm just thinking about how many five-year periods I've lived through.""
One more thing about BurritoÊJusticeÊand the origins of his archipelago map: Shortly after moving to San Francisco in the early 2000s, he happened upon a map of the city from 1853. Like other cities -- New York, Boston, Seattle -- San Francisco expanded its natural coastline with thousands of acres of ""made land,"" filling in mud flats and harbors with phenomenal amounts of debris and sand. But much of this happened after 1853; on the map BurritoÊJusticeÊwas looking at, San Francisco was smaller -- physically smaller. And he was struck by how much its former shape might resemble its future one. It wouldn't take much water for climate change to unmake the made land. The city would revert to its previous version, as though leveled by some cosmic control-Z.
As BurritoÊJusticeÊdescribed this to me on the phone one recent afternoon, I thought of a woman in San Francisco named Pamela Buttery, whom I'd heard about onÊNational Public RadioÊin January. Buttery owned a condo in the Millennium Tower, a waterfront skyscraper downtown. But the tower had started sinking at an irregular angle, even before its completion in 2010; by now, it has tilted six inches and sunk a foot into the hodgepodge Victorian landfill on which it was constructed. Buttery lived on the 57th floor. ""I've moved on into a depression about it,"" she said. Though she used to unwind by putting golf balls, the reporter noted that even this didn't ""give her the same joy it once did. No matter which way she hits them, they all end up in the same corner."" And I realized that if someone in 1853 had tried to anticipate the texture and oddities of future life in his artificially expanding city, and imagined a woman who can't satisfactorily putt golf balls on the 57th floor because her luxury condo is sinking into old garbage -- well, I probably would have bought a copy of that guy's map, too.
The future is always somebody else's present -- it will very likely feel as authentic, and only as horrific, as our moment does to us. But the present is also somebody else's future: We are already standing on someone else's ludicrous map. Except none of us are in on the joke, and I'm guessing that it won't feel funny any time soon.

Trump Has Several Tools For Putting the Brakes OnÊClimateÊPrograms
By HENRY FOUNTAIN and ERICA GOODE
President-electÊDonald J. TrumpÊhas vowed to dismantle many of the signature policies put in place by theÊObamaÊadministration to fight the effects of climate change.
During the campaign, he threatened, among other things, to kill the Clean Power Plan, a set of rules to reduce emissions from power plants. He has also taken aim at new regulations to limit methane leaks from wells and pipelines. And members of his transition team have suggested that he may reduce or eliminate basic climate research atÊNASAÊor other agencies.
If he follows through, most of these moves will be opposed by environmental groups, byÊDemocratsÊin Congress and perhaps even by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump will have several tools to begin nullifying theÊObamaÊclimate agenda.
One of them is the little-known Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a small outpost within the executive branch that has, since the Clinton administration, been the last stop for many regulations before they go into effect.
Lawyers in the office pore over thousands of pages of federal regulations daily and pride themselves on meticulously reviewing the fine print, even if that takes months or years.
Under the control of the new administration, the office could slowÊPresident Obama's latest regulatory initiatives by repeatedly sending them back for additional work.
""It has been a brake on agency regulation throughout its lifetime,"" said Jody Freeman, a professor atÊHarvardÊLaw School and an expert on environmental regulation. ""Some presidents have used it as more of a brake than others.""
Much remains to be learned about the president-elect's environmental policy goals, and some of his views appear to have shifted.
Mr. Trump, who has claimed that global warming is a hoax, said this week in an interview withÊThe New York TimesÊthat he now saw ""some connectivity"" between humans and climate change, and that he would ""keep an open mind"" about whether to pull out of the Paris climate accord, as he threatened to do during the campaign.
Yet at the same time, some key positions on his transition team are occupied by people with a long history of rejecting the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change.
Other than climate change, there are numerous environmental issues that he has never talked about and that he might be content to leave untouched. And once agency heads are in place, they may choose very different tactics from those discussed during Mr. Trump's campaign or by his advisers. Two people considered to be in the running to head theÊEnvironmental Protection AgencyÊ-- Jeffrey R. Holmstead, an energy lobbyist, and Robert E. Grady, a venture capitalist -- also have experience in the complex machinations of the federal government.
""Every new administration comes in with an overestimation of what it can accomplish and how quickly it can accomplish it,"" said Kevin Ewing, a partner at Bracewell, a Washington law firm.
If Mr. Trump does decide to withdraw from the Paris agreement, he will find it difficult: The accord went into force this month. He would also encounter tremendous obstacles were he to try to dismantle the E.P.A., another campaign threat.
But he may have an easier time abandoning other climate initiatives, including aÊUnited Nations-backed program to reduce the environmental impact of international air travel beginning in 2020. The United States has only informally committed to participate in the program, and the new administration could refuse to make that commitment legally binding.
One of the most powerful methods to hobble Mr.ÊObama's domestic environmental initiatives would be to block financing for the E.P.A. and other agencies.
""Congress can always pass an appropriations rider that for one year prevents any funding for the implementation or enforcement of a particular regulation,"" said Scott H. Segal, a partner and director of the policy resolution group at Bracewell. Riders can be passed year after year, effectively neutering a specific regulation, Mr. Segal said.
Such an approach can be ""stealthier"" than trying to undo the regulation itself, Professor Freeman said. ""You don't have to repeal these statutes,"" she said. ""You just have to make it impossible to implement them.""
Another opening for Mr. Trump lies in regulations that were proposed by theÊObamaÊadministration but are still technically ""in motion."" In theory, he could pull back or block these rules.
But a departing administration can also use a regulation's ""in motion"" status to its own advantage. Last week, theÊObamaadministration banned drilling in the Alaskan Arctic under theÊInterior Department's proposed five-year plan regulating oil and gas leases. Republicans could kill the plan. But to do so would mean crafting a replacement, a process that could take two years or more.
Last week, the White House unveiled a sweeping plan to try to stiffen environmental regulations before Mr.ÊObamaÊleaves office. Environmental groups can be expected to fight any efforts to undo them.
""Donald TrumpÊcan't just snap his fingers and change climate policy,"" said David Goldston, director of government affairs at theÊNatural Resources Defense Council. ""We have ways to thwart him in Congress and the courts that we could employ.""
The approach the Trump administration takes will depend in part on the status of specific rules and regulations.
Some environmental policies -- like ""guidance"" issued by the White House earlier this year, instructing agencies to consider the effects of climate change when conducting environmental reviews -- do not have the force of law that agency regulations do, and can be abolished with a pen stroke. Undoing a regulation is more complicated. Some of the E.P.A.'s new methane rules are completed, for example, but other rules, both at the E.P.A. and at theÊInterior Department, are not and can simply be abandoned.
If a rule is final, the options are different. The new administration cannot just rescind these regulations, but it can order agencies to revisit them. That reopens the rule-making process, however, including the opportunity for public comment. Any revisions or replacement regulations must have a basis in facts and a cost-benefit analysis, not politics or ideology.
There are other potential options for specific regulations. The Clean Power Plan, for instance, is completed but not yet in effect because of a judicial stay imposed while legal action against it plays out in a federal appeals court in Washington. If there is no ruling by Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, Mr. Trump'sÊJustice DepartmentÊcan ask the court to put the case in abeyance, effectively extending the stay indefinitely.
""In some respects, this is in theÊDepartment ofÊJustice's hands,"" said Tom Lorenzen, a lawyer at Crowell & Moring who argued against the plan before the appeals court. ""They will make a determination of how they want to proceed.""
Mr. Segal said theÊRepublican CongressÊmight also be able to overturn some recently completed regulations under a law that gives both houses up to 60 legislative days to reject them. That law, the Congressional Review Act, usually comes into play only when the party of the incoming president is different from the departing one's and the same party controls both houses, as is the case now.
William K. Reilly, a Republican who was E.P.A. administrator under PresidentÊGeorge Bush, said Mr. Trump needed to be careful about whom he picked for the top jobs in each department.
He cited the Reagan administration's experience with Anne Gorsuch, who incurred the wrath of politicians of both parties when, as administrator of the E.P.A., she cut the agency's budget by more than 20 percent, gutting research and regulatory enforcement. She resigned under fire in 1983 in the midst of accusations that she had mismanaged a hazardous waste cleanup program.
""The administration got badly burned by discounting the sensitivities and public support for what the E.P.A. protects us from,"" Mr. Reilly said. ""It's a public health agency above all.""

States FightÊObama'sÊClimateÊPlan, but Quietly Prepare to Comply
By CORAL DAVENPORT
CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Matt Mead, the governor of Wyoming, the nation's leading coal-producing state, fiercely opposesÊPresident Obama's climate change regulations, which could shutter hundreds of coal plants and deeply wound his state, one of 27 that are suing to block the plan.
Nevertheless, Mr. Mead, a Republican, has ordered his top environmental officials to prepare to comply with the president's effort, known as the Clean Power Plan -- to prepare for a future in which Mr.ÊObama's climate change rules prevail and the country's coal market is nearly frozen. Wyoming is one of at least 20 states that are moving forward with efforts to comply with the rules or to analyze alternative plans. Several of these states are also suing to stop the rules, according to experts who track state climate change policy.
""Obviously we're suing and going to fight,"" Mr. Mead, a former United States attorney for Wyoming, said in an interview in his office here. ""But from my court experience, I know you have to prepare not to win.""
Mr.ÊObama's ambitious climate change plan is in legal limbo. TheÊSupreme CourtÊhas ordered theÊEnvironmental Protection Agencyto halt the plan until after the states' lawsuit is resolved. The case will go before a federal court in September, but it is widely expected to be appealed to theÊSupreme CourtÊand may not be decided until 2018.
RepublicansÊin Congress and their party's presidential nominee,ÊDonald J. Trump, have vowed to scrap the climate change rules. SenatorÊMitch McConnellÊof Kentucky, the majority leader, has urged governors to refuse to comply, and Republican governors in some states, including Indiana, New Jersey and Wisconsin, have issued ""pencils down"" orders to state regulators to stop work on the Clean Power Plan.
But in other states, governors, including someÊRepublicans, and many environmental officials say that because the plan is so sweeping and ambitious, it would be imprudent to ignore it. The climate plan would force states to fundamentally transform their electricity systems, shutting down hundreds of power plants that run on fossil fuels and building new ones powered by the wind, the sun and other low-carbon sources, along with creating a need for hundreds of miles of new transmission lines.
Governors like Mr. Mead and state-level environment officials are making a political calculation: IfÊHillary ClintonÊis elected president and appoints a newÊSupreme CourtÊjustice, Mr.ÊObama's climate plan will probably survive.
In some cases, the governors moving forward with drafting state-level climate change plans areÊDemocratsÊin places that have some form of climate policy in place, like California and New York.
But in some Republican-led states, even those with ""pencils down"" orders, regulators are sketching out how they might eventually comply.
Mr.ÊTrumpÊ""has said what he thinks about climate change, and he's not likely to look favorably on someone who's crossways,"" Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist, said of the wariness of politicians in the party.
""But if you're a state environmental official and you think there's a chance thatÊHillary ClintonÊis going to be president, you'd be unwise not to think about this,"" he continued. ""I feel bad for these state environmental guys. The 'pencils down' order puts them in a lousy spot, where some of what they're doing has to be surreptitious.""
In South Carolina, after theÊSupreme CourtÊhalted the Clean Power Plan, C. Dukes Scott, the top regulator for Gov.ÊNikki R. Haley, a Republican, issued an order to stop all work on the plan -- or even talk about it.
""I'm trying not to expend any resources on the Clean Power Plan, and I'm expending resources just talking to you,"" Mr. Scott said in an interview.
But South Carolina regulators are moving forward with meetings on a new state energy plan -- which, Mr. Scott conceded, will probably include discussion of how to reduce emissions from electric power plants. It will just not be called the Clean Power Plan.
""We're still working on clean air, just not pursuant to the Clean Power Plan,"" Mr. Scott said. He added that if the Clean Power Plan was upheld by the courts, South Carolina's work on an energy plan that includes lower emissions from power plants could be repurposed in its work to comply with the climate plan.
Gov.ÊChris ChristieÊof New Jersey, a finalist in Mr.ÊTrump's vice-presidential search, issued an executive stop-work order on the plan, and environmental regulators in the state said they had frozen all work on the climate change rules.
""New Jersey is strongly opposed to the Clean Power Plan, and we are not developing any compliance plan, nor do we intend to,"" said J. Gregory Reinert, a spokesman for the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
But officials at PJM Interconnection, which manages electric power lines that run among 13 states, including New Jersey, said that a board made up of officials in all its member states, including New Jersey, had asked PJM to perform analyses of how they might comply with the climate plan, because it could create major changes in how electricity is produced and moved across state lines.
""If the rules move forward, that could change the entire way the electric transmission system works,"" said Ray Dotter, a spokesman for PJM. ""States want to be informed about this. If they're not, it could cost them a fortune.""
In Virginia, supporters of Mr.ÊObama's climate change agenda are trying to advance it with the ""by another name"" approach. Gov.ÊTerry McAuliffe, a Democrat, backs the president's climate change agenda, but in May, the Republican-majority Legislature passed a bill blocking the use of public funding for work related to complying with or even analyzing the Clean Power Plan.
So Mr.ÊMcAuliffeÊissued an executive order directing his secretary of natural resources to convene a working group that would put together a plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions in the state, using existing laws or regulations.
""I decided I wasn't going to wait around for the court,"" Mr.ÊMcAuliffeÊsaid. ""I figured I had a way to get creative and do it my own way.""
""We will move forward with our own Virginia plan,"" he added. ""It won't be called the Clean Power Plan, but the goals are similar.""
Because environmental officials in many states are preparing their climate change plans behind closed doors, ascertaining the exact number of states that are moving forward is difficult.
Environmental officials from 14 states, most of which are not taking part in the lawsuit, have sent a letter to the E.P.A. requesting technical help as they prepare for the plan. An analysis by Energy and Environment News, an industry publication, estimates that 20 states, including Republican strongholds like Arizona and Idaho, are moving forward with plans, and that an additional eight states are assessing climate plans but are not yet taking steps to carry them out.
""Other than for political reasons, it doesn't make sense for states to stand down on their preparations,"" said William Becker, the executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies. ""Very few states are just putting down their pencils and waiting.""
Mr. Becker said his association had held informational meetings and conference calls about the plan, including a recent call in which he estimated that officials from 50 state and local governments participated. He declined to identify the officials who had taken part.
""It's difficult for me to out someone on this,"" Mr. Becker said. ""I don't want someone to think they participated in a meeting and now they're being ratted out.""

NYT-6.txt,"Panel Urges Research on Geoengineering as a Tool Against Climate Change

With the planet facing potentially severe impacts from global warming in coming decades, a government-sponsored scientific panel on Tuesday called for more research on geoengineering — technologies to deliberately intervene in nature to counter climate change.

The panel said the research could include small-scale outdoor experiments, which many scientists say are necessary to better understand whether and how geoengineering would work.

Some environmental groups and others say that such projects could have unintended damaging effects, and could set society on an unstoppable path to full-scale deployment of the technologies.

But the National Academy of Sciences panel said that with proper governance, which it said needed to be developed, and other safeguards, such experiments should pose no significant risk.

In two widely anticipated reports, the panel — which was supported by NASA and other federal agencies, including what the reports described as the “U.S. intelligence community” — noted that drastically reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases was by far the best way to mitigate the effects of a warming planet.

But the panel, in making the case for more research into geoengineering, said, “It may be prudent to examine additional options for limiting the risks from climate change.”

“The committee felt that the need for information at this point outweighs the need for shoving this topic under the rug,” Marcia K. McNutt, chairwoman of the panel and the editor in chief of the journal Science, said at a news conference in Washington.

Geoengineering options generally fall into two categories: capturing and storing some of the carbon dioxide that has already been emitted so that the atmosphere traps less heat, or reflecting more sunlight away from the earth so there is less heat to start with. The panel issued separate reports on each.

The panel said that while the first option, called carbon dioxide removal, was relatively low risk, it was expensive, and that even if it was pursued on a planetwide scale, it would take many decades to have a significant impact on the climate. But the group said research was needed to develop efficient and effective methods to both remove the gas and store it so it remains out of the atmosphere indefinitely.

The second option, called solar radiation management, is far more controversial. Most discussions of the concept focus on the idea of dispersing sulfates or other chemicals high in the atmosphere, where they would reflect sunlight, in some ways mimicking the effect of a large volcanic eruption.

The process would be relatively inexpensive and should quickly lower temperatures, but it would have to be repeated indefinitely and would do nothing about another carbon dioxide-related problem: the acidification of oceans.

This approach might also have unintended effects on weather patterns around the world — bringing drought to once-fertile regions, for example. Or it might be used unilaterally as a weapon by governments or even extremely wealthy individuals.

Opponents of geoengineering have long argued that even conducting research on the subject presents a moral hazard that could distract society from the necessary task of reducing the emissions that are causing warming in the first place.

“A geoengineering ‘technofix’ would take us in the wrong direction,” Lisa Archer, food and technology program director of the environmental group Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “Real climate justice requires dealing with root causes of climate change, not launching risky, unproven and unjust schemes.”


But the panel said that society had “reached a point where the severity of the potential risks from climate change appears to outweigh the potential risks from the moral hazard” of conducting research.



Ken Caldeira, a geoengineering researcher at the Carnegie Institution for Science and a member of the committee, said that while the panel felt that it was premature to deploy any sunlight-reflecting technologies today, “it’s worth knowing more about them,” including any problems that might make them unworkable.

“If there’s a real showstopper, we should know about it now,” Dr. Caldeira said, rather than discovering it later when society might be facing a climate emergency and desperate for a solution.

Dr. Caldeira is part of a small community of scientists who have researched solar radiation management concepts. Almost all of the research has been done on computers, simulating the effects of the technique on the climate. One attempt in Britain in 2011 to conduct an outdoor test of some of the engineering concepts provoked a public outcry. The experiment was eventually canceled.

David Keith, a researcher at Harvard University who reviewed the reports before they were released, said in an interview, “I think it’s terrific that they made a stronger call than I expected for research, including field research.” Along with other researchers, Dr. Keith has proposed a field experiment to test the effect of sulfate chemicals on atmospheric ozone.

Unlike some European countries, the United States has never had a separate geoengineering research program. Dr. Caldeira said establishing a separate program was unlikely, especially given the dysfunction in Congress. But he said that because many geoengineering research proposals might also help in general understanding of the climate, agencies that fund climate research might start to look favorably upon them.

Dr. Keith agreed, adding that he hoped the new reports would “break the logjam” and “give program managers the confidence they need to begin funding.”

At the news conference, Waleed Abdalati, a member of the panel and a professor at the University of Colorado, said that geoengineering research would have to be subject to governance that took into account not just the science, “but the human ramifications, as well.”

Dr. Abdalati said that, in general, the governance needed to precede the research. “A framework that addresses what kinds of activities would require governance is a necessary first step,” he said.

Raymond Pierrehumbert, a geophysicist at the University of Chicago and a member of the panel, said in an interview that while he thought that a research program that allowed outdoor experiments was potentially dangerous, “the report allows for enough flexibility in the process to follow that it could be decided that we shouldn’t have a program that goes beyond modeling.”

Above all, he said, “it’s really necessary to have some kind of discussion among broader stakeholders, including the public, to set guidelines for an allowable zone for experimentation.”"

ECONOMIC SCENE
Politics Plagues U.S. onÊClimate
By EDUARDO PORTER
The United States sure knows how to throw cold water on international harmony.
Just two months have passed since the world's top diplomats cobbled together the best plan we've ever had to start curbing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases. Yet already theÊSupreme CourtÊof the United States said no, delaying much of theÊObamaÊadministration's strategy to deliver America's contribution to the collective effort.
The White House claims it will prevail, assuring a fidgety international community it will deliver on the promises made at the climate meeting in Paris in December. Those commitments proved critical to keeping the diplomacy on track and ultimately producing a deal among more than 185 countries representing more than 98 percent of global emissions.
And yet theÊSupreme Court's temporary stay of the administration's Clean Power Plan -- the last decision of global consequence of the right-leaning court on whichÊJusticeÊAntonin ScaliaÊhad sat since theÊReaganÊadministration -- underscores just how far the United States remains from its climate goals.
Consider the administration's own assessments. Even as the American delegation in Paris offered to cut emissions to 26 to 28 percent below their 2005 levels by 2025, the Energy Information Administration of theÊDepartment of EnergyÊwas offering a different outlook.
Its reference case, based on federal policies on the books at the end of 2014, forecast that emissions of carbon dioxide from energy use (the United States' main source of greenhouse gases) would not decline but remain flat through 2025 and beyond.
Methane emissions, which account for under 10 percent of greenhouse gases spewed into the atmosphere but trap much more heat than CO2, could increase 6 percent over the next 10 years, according to theÊEnvironmental Protection Agency. Emissions of highly potent hydrofluorocarbons could increase by half.
What's more, the carbon storage of American forests, which offset as much as 13 percent of the nation's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, could start declining as early as 2020.
These, of course, are not forecasts but projections. Emissions could fall faster because of new regulation, technological breakthroughs, changes in land use and the like. Some of the nation's most critical policies to combat climate change were passed only last year. A case in point is the Clean Power Plan, the crown jewel of the lot, which would require states to come up with plans to reduce the CO2 emissions from their electric power plants.
Still, theÊSupreme Court's decision last week to delay the plan -- until theÊUnited States Court of AppealsÊin Washington decides on the merits of a challenge by 27 mostly Republican-governed states -- underscores just how politically vulnerable the United States' promises truly are.
Because for all the administration's claims that it can deliver on its commitments regardless, the fact remains that even under the most optimistic outlook -- if theÊSupreme Court's stay were to melt away and the Power Plan were to work impeccably -- current policies do not get us there.
Last month, before theÊSupreme Court's decision, the Rhodium Group, a research firm that has performed extensive analysis of climate-change projections, published a report concluding that even if the administration executed all its existing and planned policies with maximum effect, and the most optimistic forecasts for technological development and forest sink capacity were borne out, the United States would still not hit the target.
Using different assumptions -- say, if the economy grew faster or energy technology didn't progress as fast -- it would remain even further behind. Assuming all the administration's current and proposed policies were carried out, the analysis suggests that by 2025 American greenhouse gas emissions would be, at best, 23 percent lower than in 2005. In the worst case they would be only 10 percent lower.
That suggests we should hurry. ""While the U.S. still has nearly a decade to put additional policy in place,"" the report notes, ""it will need to do so relatively quickly for the impact to be felt by the time the 2025 pledge comes due.""
The pledges offered in Paris are not a magic number. They are important nonetheless. Stiff cuts by the United States, the world's second-largest emitter, after China, were crucial to holding the international coalition together. These cuts are supposed to be just the beginning of a process of increasingly stringent emissions limits.
How will the United States get there, then? The Rhodium Group's analysis proposes stricter limits for transportation and for electric power generation, which would remain the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country over the next decade even if the Clean Power Plan were put in place.
One idea would be further tightening the fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. The report suggests looking at emissions by the industrial sector -- the third-largest emitter -- which under current policies are expected to increase by 18 percent by 2025. Land use policies to enhance the forest carbon sink and tighter rules to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas could also help.
But these proposals just underscore how the American problem is first and foremost political. It is critical, the report concludes, ""that policy makers now engage in a broad exploration and frank discussion of what additional steps can help deliver on America's climate goals."" It will be difficult to hold this discussion when Congress is run by a party that rejects climate science.
We have known about these obstacles for some time. TheÊObamaÊadministration's plan to repurpose the Clean Air Act rather than propose new legislation to combat climate change acknowledged that the courts offered a better shot than Congress.
And in that regard, the news is not entirely bad. If the Senate were to confirm whomeverÊPresident ObamaÊnominates to succeedÊJustice Scalia, one of the most conservative justices on the bench, theÊSupreme CourtÊwould probably become more sensitive to the imperative to combat climate change. That's not just good news for the Clean Power Plan. It could open the door to more aggressive policies.
Last month, for instance, scholars from the law schools ofÊColumbia University,ÊNew York UniversityÊand theÊUniversity of California, Los Angeles, released a report that suggested there is a provision in the Clean Air Act that would allow the E.P.A. to require states to reduce emissions that endangered other countries if such countries provided reciprocal protections to the United States.
""E.P.A. and the states could use the provision to establish an economywide, market-based approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" the group wrote. ""Such a program could provide one of the most effective and efficient means to address climate change pollution in the United States.""
Last week, this kind of thinking would have been unlikely to survive a spin through theÊSupreme Court. But perhaps it could survive a different one -- maybe one that placed more weight on international harmony.

EDITORIAL
The Court Enters theÊClimateÊWars
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
TheÊSupreme Court's extraordinary decision on Tuesday to temporarily block theÊObamaÊadministration's effort to combat global warming by regulating emissions from power plants was deeply disturbing on two fronts.
It raised serious questions about America's ability to deliver on Mr.ÊObama's pledge in Paris in December to sharply reduce carbon emissions, and, inevitably, about its willingness to take a leadership role on the issue.
And with all the Republican-appointed justices lining up in a 5-to-4 vote to halt the regulation before a federal appeals court could rule on it, the court also reinforced the belief among many Americans that the court is knee-deep in the partisan politics it claims to stand above. While the court's action was not a ruling on the merits of the case, it will delay efforts to comply with the regulation and sends an ominous signal that Mr.ÊObama's initiative, known as the Clean Power Plan, could ultimately be overturned.
The Clean Power Plan, announced by theÊEnvironmental Protection AgencyÊlast August, requires states to make major cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from their electricity producers, which chiefly use older coal-fired power plants, over the next few years. These plants produce more carbon emissions than any other source, and cutting them is the backbone of Mr.ÊObama's larger goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions over all by at least 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
The rule is based on the Clean Air Act -- which, as the court has already made clear in multiple cases, gives the federal government broad authority to regulate a range of pollutants, including carbon emissions from power plants. Mr.ÊObamaÊis using that authority here. And while the plan sets out aggressive state-by-state goals, it is carefully designed to give states the time and flexibility to meet them. It's inevitable that some, perhaps many, older coal-fired plants will close; but states can also covert to cleaner-burning natural gas, build renewable-energy sources, like wind and solar, or enter into regional ""cap and trade"" programs that allow them to buy and sell permits to pollute.
Efforts like these are broadly popular: A clear majority of Americans, including many Republicans, agree that global warming is or will soon be a serious threat. Nearly two-thirds said they would support domestic policies limiting carbon emissions from power plants.
But flexibility, a generous time frame for compliance and public opinion were not enough to sway 27 states that sued to stop what they call a ""power grab"" by the federal government and Mr.ÊObama's ""war on coal."" Many of these states depend heavily on coal-fired plants for their power and many are run by Republican governors, who either willfully disbelieve well-established climate science or find it politically impossible to take steps necessary to reduce emissions. They also refuse to recognize that, rule or no rule, the nation's energy landscape is already changing, with coal-fired power plants gradually but inexorably succumbing to cheaper natural gas and the emergence of renewable energy sources.
The justices could easily have waited. Last month, a unanimous panel of the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., sided with the administration and refused to block the Clean Power Plan from taking effect. It set an expedited briefing schedule in order to resolve the case well before any significant action is required from the states. Normally, theÊSupreme CourtÊallows this process to play out. But time and again, this court has shown itself to be all too eager to upset longstanding practice or legal precedent.
ChiefÊJusticeÊJohn Roberts Jr. often complains that the court is unfairly viewed as just another political branch. He said so again in an interview just last week, arguing that the nomination process creates the impression that justices are little more than party loyalists. ""When you have a sharply political, divisive hearing process, it increases the danger that whoever comes out of it will be viewed in those terms,"" he said. But, he insisted, ""We don't work asÊDemocratsÊor Republicans.""
If the court wants to be perceived as acting in a judicial capacity, and not as an arm of the conservatives, it has a funny way of showing it.

California Said to Target Exxon inÊClimateÊInquiry
By JOHN SCHWARTZ
California's attorney general is investigating Exxon Mobil on whether the company lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change, and whether the company's statements over the years constitute violations of securities laws and other statutes.
The investigation is similar to one started in November by the New York attorney general,ÊEric T. Schneiderman, for which the company has already produced thousands of documents.
Mr. Schneiderman, calling climate change ""the defining issue of our time,"" applauded the action taken by Kamala D. Harris, the attorney general.
""Just like any other publicly traded company, these energy giants have an obligation to ensure that their disclosures to investors of known and reasonably likely risks are truthful and not misleading, and to disclose to the public the risks associated with their products,"" he said.
The California investigation was first reported by The Los Angeles Times, and was confirmed by people with knowledge of details of the inquiry.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, Rachele Huennekens, said in an email, ""I can't confirm or deny any potential or ongoing investigation.""
Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon, did not confirm the existence of the California investigation, but he denied that the company had covered up climate risks.
""Exxon Mobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders,"" he said in an email response to questions.
The call for an investigation of Exxon Mobil and other fossil fuel companies follows a number of news reports that cast a harsh spotlight on the companies' activities.
In February, several news organizations, including The New York Times, reported that a Smithsonian researcher who had published papers questioning established climate science, Wei-Hock Soon, had received extensive funds from fossil fuel companies, including Exxon Mobil, without disclosing them.
Since then, Inside Climate News and The Los Angeles Times published articles highlighting Exxon Mobil research into the risks of climate change. The company incorporated the research into its planning, even though it funded groups from the 1990s to the mid-2000s that denied serious climate risks.
Mr. Jeffers of Exxon Mobil called accusations of a cover-up ""inaccurate distortions of Exxon Mobil's nearly 40-year history of climate research that was conducted publicly in conjunction with theÊDepartment of Energy, academics and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.""
He said ""activists and media cherry-picked statements attributed to various company employees to wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached by company researchers at the early stages of scientific investigation of the potential for climate change.""
In recent years, the company has publicly stated that it accepts the science of climate change and that it has stepped away from organizations that undercut the overwhelming scientific evidence underlying it. The company has also said that it supports a tax on emissions as a way to further reduce climate risks.
Calls for investigation have grown. Last week, the Los Angeles County Democratic Party adopted a resolution calling on Ms. Harris to pursue an investigation.
News of the investigation was greeted enthusiastically by Representative Ted W. Lieu, a Democrat who represents parts of Los Angeles county and who called in November for investigations of Exxon Mobil by theÊDepartment ofÊJusticeÊand the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Lieu, a former securities lawyer, said, ""In America, because of the First Amendment, corporations get to lie to the American people. But if they lie to their shareholders or investors, that's a crime.""
He added, ""Companies that have omitted far less damaging facts than Exxon Mobil have been prosecuted by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as state attorneys general.""
He also suggested that theÊDepartment ofÊJusticeÊcould, as it did in its fight against the tobacco industry, pursue racketeering charges. Success on any of those legal tracks, however, is far from certain.
On Wednesday, Mr. Lieu and fellow California Congressman Mark DeSaulnier sent a letter to Ms. Harris encouraging her to ""leverage your authorities"" as attorney general ""to actively investigate this important and troubling issue.""
The letter referred to the New York inquiry, and stated, ""While it remains to be determined whether Exxon Mobil's actions violated state law, your office is in a unique position to request the information necessary to make these determinations.""
The two lawmakers expressed the hope that Ms. Harris's actions would spur other state officials and regulators to investigate the company as well, and said that they would add their efforts in Washington, where they said they are requesting that the committee on oversight and government reform conduct hearings.
In an interview, Mr. Lieu acknowledged that under current leadership in theÊHouse of Representatives, getting such a request granted would be ""hard."" But, he said, ""If you don't ask, you don't know. Everything is impossible until it happens.""

Pope's Position on theÊClimateÊTests the G.O.P.
By CORAL DAVENPORT; Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting from New York.
WASHINGTON -- As the steamy hurricane season descends on Miami, the city's Roman Catholic archbishop, Thomas G. Wenski, is planning a summer of sermons, homilies and press events designed to highlight the threat that a warming planet, rising sea levels and more extreme storms pose to his community's poorest and most vulnerable.
His sermons and speeches are meant to amplify the message of Pope Francis' highly anticipated, highly controversial encyclical on the environment, which the Vatican is expected to unveil on Thursday. A papal encyclical, or teaching document, is among the strongest and most authoritative statements made by theÊCatholic Church.
In a draft of the document leaked on Monday, Francis reiterated the established science that burning fossil fuels are warming the planet, said the impact threatened the world's poor and called for government policies to cut fossil fuel use.
Archbishop Wenski will repeat those messages in his sermons, and he hopes that they will resonate with two members of his flock in particular: Florida's junior senator,ÊMarco Rubio, and former Gov.ÊJeb Bush, both Catholics and both Republican presidential candidates.
Like many Republicans, Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels. Both of their campaigns have courted influential and deep-pocketed donors, such as the billionaire brothers Charles G. andÊDavid H. Koch, who vehemently oppose such climate policies.
But the papal encyclical could put Catholics who question that established climate science in a tough position, particularly in a year in which at least five Catholics may run for the Republican presidential nomination. Besides Mr. Bush, Mr. Rubio andÊRick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania who has also declared his candidacy, the field could include Gov.ÊBobby JindalÊof Louisiana and Gov.ÊChris ChristieÊof New Jersey.
The pressure to respond to the pope's position on climate change could be particularly intense for Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio. The 2014 National Climate Assessment, a scientific study by 13 federal agencies, named Miami as one of the United States cities most vulnerable to physical and economic damage as a direct result of human-caused global warming. Archbishop Wenski, who is chairman of the United States Conference of Bishops' committee on domesticÊjusticeÊand human development, is playing a leading role in elevating the pope's climate change message in Florida.
Speaking at a campaign event in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Mr. Bush did not wait for the official release of Francis' encyclical to criticize his foray into climate change policy.
""I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope,"" Mr. Bush said. ""And I'd like to see what he says as it relates to climate change and how that connects to these broader, deeper issues before I pass judgment. But I think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting in the political realm.""
Mr. Rubio has not commented on the encyclical. He has said he believes that the Earth's climate is constantly changing but that ""humans are not responsible for climate change in the way some of these people out there are trying to make us believe.""
Florida is not the only crucial presidential state where Catholic bishops will push the pope's climate message. In Iowa, the bishops of Des Moines and Davenport are planning a news media event at a wind turbine manufacturing facility, where they will highlight findings that climate change drives the drought and floods that plague Iowa farmers. The bishops of Cincinnati and of Las Cruces, N.M., are also planning news conferences and events for the coming weeks. The bishop of Sacramento, in a state in the grips of a record drought, is planning an event highlighting the link to climate change.
The events are being planned in coordination with a Washington advocacy group, the Catholic Climate Covenant. The group's director, Dan Misleh, said the locations were not selected with the presidential campaign map in mind, but to highlight the issue before Francis addresses a joint meeting of Congress in September -- a speech in which he is expected to push lawmakers to enact climate change policies.
""From the moment he steps into that chamber and talks about climate change, it's going to be taken as a political statement,"" said the Rev. Robert Sirico, executive director of the Acton Institute for the Study of Religion and Liberty, a policy group that endorses free-market economics. ""For the conservatives, it's going to be very uncomfortable. Republicans are going to have a hard time on the environment.""
But Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political consultant who described himself as a conservative Catholic, pointed out that there was already a backlash by conservative Catholics against the pope's efforts on climate change and other progressive policies.
""For practicing conservative Catholics, the folks who sit in the pews on Sunday, this is not going to be an indictment of guys like Rubio and Jeb,"" Mr. McKenna said. ""Those guys have already made up their minds on climate change. For the real churchgoers, this is going to be an indictment of the pope.
""This pope is selling a line of Latin American-style socialism,"" he continued. ""This guy is not in sync with the AmericanÊCatholic Church. Guys like Jeb and Rubio are more in line with the AmericanÊCatholic ChurchÊthan the pope.""
A poll this month by theÊPew Research Center, however, found that the views of American Catholics on global warming are broadly reflective of American public opinion and that 86 percent of Catholics in this country say they view the pope favorably.
The poll found that 71 percent of Catholics in the United States believe the planet is getting warmer, but that there is a sharp division along partisan lines.
Half of Catholic Republicans say there is solid evidence that Earth is warming, compared with eight out of 10 Catholic Democrats. And only about a quarter of Catholic Republicans say global warming is man-made and poses a serious problem, while six in 10 Catholic Democrats agree with those statements.
Archbishop Wenski said he intended to use his pulpit to spread Francis' message.
""This is not an issue of right or left,"" Archbishop Wenski said. ""This is more important than an ideological food fight.""
He said he would be paying particular attention to the views of Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio. ""I hope that they will look at the papal encyclical when it comes out, and evaluate their positions with that guidance,"" he said.

Marchers Back Pope for Views onÊClimate
By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO
VATICAN CITY -- When Pope Francis appeared on the balcony of the Apostolic Palace, where he delivers an address each Sunday, he was met by the usual cheers and by an unusual forest of bright green oversized paper leaves.
Had he been able to read what was written on the leaves -- which he could not because he was too far away -- the pope would have found quotes from ""Laudato Si',"" or ""Praise Be to You,"" his encyclical on the environment published this month.
The leaves were among the colorful props carried by a hodgepodge of organizations -- mostly religious or environmental -- that marched to the Vatican on Sunday to thank the pope for his forceful message on climate change, and to demand that world leaders heed his call for environmentalÊjusticeÊand climate action.
""We want the pope to know we're behind him 100 percent,"" said Tafara Dandadzi, a student in environmental law and governance at North-West University in South Africa, who came to Rome for the march and to take part in a seminar convened in part to bring together emerging leaders from various religious and geographic backgrounds to coordinate on climate action.
""There are people here from different backgrounds with a common purpose,"" Mr. Dandadzi added. ""I hope the pope knows that, and I hope that the political leaders meeting in Paris later this year know that too.""
World leaders will meet in Paris in December for aÊUnited NationsÊsummit meeting on climate change that aims to arrive at a comprehensive global accord binding nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The pope's encyclical, which links the environmental crisis to economics and poverty, has been widely read as a call for political action in support of an accord.
The encyclical is hardly the first foray of a religious leader in the realm of the environment, but it comes at a time when there is greater consciousness -- as well as division and debate -- on what to do about climate change.
""Around the world the spirit of humanity is rising to recognize that we have to care for the earth, that there is a deep moral obligation,"" said the Rev. Fletcher Harper, an American Episcopal priest and the coordinator of Our Voices, an interreligious campaign for climate action, which organized the march with an Italian Catholic development nonprofit organization, Focsiv.
Dozens of Italian and international organizations also took part in the demonstration, which brought hundreds of people to St. Peter's Square.
""This pope is giving voice to a sentiment that is growing in all faiths around the world,"" Father Harper said. ""We need all people in leadership positions to go decisively on the record about the need for deep change.""
The encyclical is by far the most forceful contribution on the topic by a pope, who has the ear of more than one billion Roman Catholics. Francis' personal warmth has endeared him to many outside his faith.
""It's an amazing document that brings together environmental science, socialÊjusticeÊand religious teaching and asks us to think about economic policies,"" said Samantha Smith, the leader of the Global Climate and Energy Initiative at World Wildlife Fund International. At the heart of the encyclical is a powerful message ""that the way we are living on the planet is not sustainable or equitable,"" she said. ""But it is also hopeful because it urges global mobilization.""
Sunday's march reprised the spirit, albeit on a much smaller scale, of the People's Climate March that brought 300,000 people to the streets of New York in September. And indeed, though Sunday's march was staged at St. Peter's Square, its message seemed to resonate beyond theÊRoman Catholic Church. Alongside nuns and priests and other Catholics were Buddhists and Hindus. Only Rome's residents were conspicuously absent.
""I encourage the collaboration between people and associations of different religions for the promotion of an integral ecology,"" Francis said, acknowledging the marchers and reprising some of his considerations in the paper.
Rabbi Lawrence Troster, from Teaneck, N.J., one of the organizers of the march, also underscored the universality of the pope's message. "" 'Laudato Si' ' is addressed to everyone,"" he said. ""It is trying to create a consensus among all people, and not leave such an important issues to a small group of policy makers, leaders or diplomats.""

Taking a Call forÊClimateÊChange to the Streets
By LISA W. FODERARO; Reporting was contributed by Annie Correal, Coral Davenport, Colin Moynihan, Sarah Maslin Nir, Kenneth Rosen and Vivian Yee.
Legions of demonstrators frustrated by international inaction on global warming descended on New York City on Sunday, marching through the heart of Manhattan with a message of alarm for world leaders set to gather this week at the United Nations for a summit meeting on climate change.
Coursing through Midtown, from Columbus Circle to Times Square and the Far West Side, the People's Climate March was a spectacle even for a city known for doing things big, and it was joined, in solidarity, by demonstrations on Sunday across the globe, from Paris to Papua New Guinea.
""I'm here because I really feel that every major social movement in this country has come when people get together,"" said Carol Sutton of Norwalk, Conn., the president of a teachers' union. ""It begins in the streets.""
From the scientists holding an oversize chalkboard to the Hurricane Sandy victims toting life preservers, the march was a self-consciously inclusive affair, with the organizers intent on creating a very big tent, which they hoped would hammer home the relevance of climate change and its effects.
The march attracted leading lights in the environmental movement, most notably former Vice President Al Gore. It drew the secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, who will preside over this week's United Nations climate summit meeting. And it included Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, fresh off his announcement that he was committing the city to an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050.
But it was mostly an event for concerned ordinary people, many of them veterans of climate change efforts, others relative newcomers.
From as close as the Bronx and as far as at least Rome, the demonstrators came in vast numbers. At one point early in the afternoon, the march came to a halt because the entire 2.2-mile route was full, and more than two hours into the procession, people were still setting out from the starting point near Columbus Circle.
Organizers, using data provided by 35 crowd spotters and analyzed by a mathematician from Carnegie Mellon University, estimated that 311,000 people marched the route.The signs that marchers held were as varied as the movement: ""There Is No Planet B,"" ""Forests Not for Sale"" and ""Jobs,ÊJustice, Clean Energy.""
The diversity of the demonstrators made for some odd juxtapositions. On West 58th Street, the minaret of an inflatable mosque bobbed next to a wooden replica of Noah's Ark the size of a school bus. Nearby, Capuchin Franciscan monks in flowing brown robes, who were in town from Rome for the march, mingled with nuns, while a group flying a pagan flag beat a drum.
The climax of the march came in the early afternoon. All along the route, crowds had been quieted for a moment of silence. On Avenue of the Americas at 57th Street, there was an eerie silence as marchers raised their arms and looked down.
Then at exactly 1 p.m., a whistle pierced the silence, setting off a minute-long cacophony intended as a collective alarm on climate change. There were the beats of the drums and the blaring of horns, but mostly it was whoops and cries of the marchers.
One of the key organizers of the event, the international advocacy group Avaaz, presented a petition with more than 2.1 million signatures demanding action on climate change. ""It's a testament to how powerful this movement is,"" Ricken Patel, executive director of Avaaz, said. ""People are coming in amazing numbers.""
Like the march, the summit meeting on Tuesday at the United Nations will be flush with speeches intended to build support for addressing climate change. But the gathering of world leaders is not meant to be a formal negotiating session for a potential 2015 agreement.
Behind the scenes, though, the real work toward forging a global deal was underway. A few blocks from the march, in a hotel conference room on Lexington Avenue, Secretary of State John Kerry convened a meeting of foreign ministers of the 17-member Major Economies Forum, focused on climate change, and Todd Stern, the chief United States climate change negotiator, held back-to-back meetings throughout the day.
Mr. Kerry said he intended to keep a focus on climate change throughout the week, despite the pressure of other crises, including insurgent terrorists in Iraq and the Ebola outbreak in Africa. ""The grave threat that climate change poses warrants a prominent position on that list,"" he told reporters. ""Those are immediate. But this has even greater, longer-term consequences that can cost hundreds of billions, trillions of dollars, and lives, and the security of the world.""
Last week, meteorologists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that this summer -- the months of June, July and August -- was the hottest on record for the globe, and that 2014 was on track to break the record for the hottest year, set in 2010.
It was concern about the consequences of that warming that drew people to the march, organized by a dozen environmental, labor and socialÊjusticeÊgroups, and that inspired some of the event's most sober and most outrageous expressions, some of them not even on the route.
In front of the Flatiron Building, on Fifth Avenue, a 3,000-pound ice sculpture spelled out ""The Future."" Dripping onto the sidewalk, it had been carved over two days in Queens by a group of Japanese ice sculptors. ""I would say we are melting down the future,"" said Nora Ligorano, one of the artists who conceived the work. ""It's a comment on what we are doing to the planet.""
At Columbus Circle, there were bare-breasted women and people with dreadlocks and homespun clothing. There were Muslim women wearing hijabs and groups of older women with signs proclaiming they were ""Grandmas Against Global Warming."" and that ""Gray Is Green.""
Two high school seniors from Long Island, Kirsten Cunha and Alexandra Dos Santos, both 17, marched with dust masks over their mouths. ""Wearing masks like this could quite possibly be our children's future,"" Ms. Dos Santos said.

CrazyÊClimateÊEconomics
By PAUL KRUGMAN
Everywhere you look these days, you see Marxism on the rise. Well, O.K., maybe you don't -- but conservatives do. If you so much as mention income inequality, you'll be denounced as the second coming of Joseph Stalin; Rick Santorum has declared that any use of the word ""class"" is ""Marxism talk."" In the right's eyes, sinister motives lurk everywhere -- for example, George Will says the only reason progressives favor trains is their goal of ""diminishing Americans' individualism in order to make them more amenable to collectivism.""
So it goes without saying that Obamacare, based on ideas originally developed at the Heritage Foundation, is a Marxist scheme -- why, requiring that people purchase insurance is practically the same as sending them to gulags.
And just wait until the Environmental Protection Agency announces rules intended to slow the pace of climate change.
Until now, the right's climate craziness has mainly been focused on attacking the science. And it has been quite a spectacle: At this point almost all card-carrying conservatives endorse the view that climate change is a gigantic hoax, that thousands of research papers showing a warming planet -- 97 percent of the literature -- are the product of a vast international conspiracy. But as the Obama administration moves toward actually doing something based on that science, crazy climate economics will come into its own.
You can already get a taste of what's coming in the dissenting opinions from a recent Supreme Court ruling on power-plant pollution. A majority of the justices agreed that the E.P.A. has the right to regulate smog from coal-fired power plants, which drifts across state lines. ButÊJusticeÊScalia didn't just dissent; he suggested that the E.P.A.'s proposed rule -- which would tie the size of required smog reductions to cost -- reflected the Marxist concept of ""from each according to his ability."" Taking cost into consideration is Marxist? Who knew?
And you can just imagine what will happen when the E.P.A., buoyed by the smog ruling, moves on to regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
What do I mean by crazy climate economics?
First, we'll see any effort to limit pollution denounced as a tyrannical act. Pollution wasn't always a deeply partisan issue: Economists in the George W. Bush administration wrote paeans to ""market based"" pollution controls, and in 2008 John McCain made proposals for cap-and-trade limits on greenhouse gases part of his presidential campaign. But when House Democrats actually passed a cap-and-trade bill in 2009, it was attacked as, you guessed it, Marxist. And these days Republicans come out in force to oppose even the most obviously needed regulations, like the plan to reduce the pollution that's killing Chesapeake Bay.
Second, we'll see claims that any effort to limit emissions will have what Senator Marco Rubio is already calling ""a devastating impact on our economy.""
Why is this crazy? Normally, conservatives extol the magic of markets and the adaptability of the private sector, which is supposedly able to transcend with ease any constraints posed by, say, limited supplies of natural resources. But as soon as anyone proposes adding a few limits to reflect environmental issues -- such as a cap on carbon emissions -- those all-capable corporations supposedly lose any ability to cope with change.
Now, the rules the E.P.A. is likely to impose won't give the private sector as much flexibility as it would have had in dealing with an economywide carbon cap or emissions tax. But Republicans have only themselves to blame: Their scorched-earth opposition to any kind of climate policy has left executive action by the White House as the only route forward.
Furthermore, it turns out that focusing climate policy on coal-fired power plants isn't bad as a first step. Such plants aren't the only source of greenhouse gas emissions, but they're a large part of the problem -- and the best estimates we have of the path forward suggest that reducing power-plant emissions will be a large part of any solution.
What about the argument that unilateral U.S. action won't work, because China is the real problem? It's true that we're no longer No. 1 in greenhouse gases -- but we're still a strong No. 2. Furthermore, U.S. action on climate is a necessary first step toward a broader international agreement, which will surely include sanctions on countries that don't participate.
So the coming firestorm over new power-plant regulations won't be a genuine debate -- just as there isn't a genuine debate about climate science. Instead, the airwaves will be filled with conspiracy theories and wild claims about costs, all of which should be ignored. Climate policy may finally be getting somewhere; let's not let crazy climate economics get in the way.

ECONOMIC SCENE
India, FacingÊClimateÊChange, Also Desperately Needs More Energy
By EDUARDO PORTER
Spare a thought for poor India.
India is home to 30 percent of the world's poorest, those living on less than $1.90 a day. Of the 1.3 billion Indians, 304 million do not have access to electricity; 92 million have no access to safe drinking water.
And India is going to be hammered by climate change.
The livelihoods of 600 million Indians are threatened by the expected disruption of the southwest monsoon from July to September, which accounts for 70 percent of India's rainfall. India's rivers depend on the health of thousands of Himalayan glaciers at risk of melting because of a warming climate, while 150 million people are at risk from storm surges associated with rising sea levels.
A lot of damage is already inevitable, a consequence of the emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by richer countries. So, many Indians ask, Why must we pay more? On what grounds can India be asked to temper its use of energy to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide?
""Today, I see the carbon space occupied by the developed world,"" Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister, said in an interview with TheÊAssociated PressÊin September. ""We are asking the developed world to vacate the carbon space to accommodate us. That carbon space demand is climateÊjustice.""
The successful resolution of this confrontation of priorities does not matter just for India's sake. The tension between economic development and the imperative to curb greenhouse gas emissions remains the central challenge of the diplomatic effort to muster a coalition of rich and poor countries to combat climate change.
TheÊUnited NationsÊexpects India's population to reach 1.5 billion by 2030, bigger than China's. If over the next 15 years it follows anything like the fossil-fuel-heavy path out of poverty that China took over the last 15, it could blow any chance the world has of preventing a disaster.
A critical question for anyone with a stake in preventing a climatic catastrophe is how to conceive and finance a development path for 1.5 billion Indians that prevents this outcome.
Scientists and environmentalists, executives and government diplomats packing their bags to attend the climate summit meeting in Paris, starting Nov. 30, must keep the challenge in mind.
After so many failed rounds of diplomacy, everyone involved is eager to declare the coming meeting a success. So far, 129 countries accounting for nearly 90 percent of greenhouse gas emissions have submitted plans to contribute to the cause.
While the progress is undoubtedly real, the central challenge remains unresolved. Countries are not being asked to make legally binding commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. They will show up, instead, with ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"" to the mitigation effort.
Advanced countries will offer absolute cuts in carbon emissions. But the less developed are expected only to reduce their emissions intensity -- a measure of the carbon dioxide released to produce a certain amount of economic activity -- in a recognition that their energy consumption still has a long way to grow.
The new approach was necessary to achieve any progress. But it required putting the tough questions aside. Nearly as populous as China, yet way behind in terms of economic development, India presents one of the tougher ones.
By most accounts, the world's greenhouse gas emissions must be brought close to zero by the end of the century, at the latest. This constrains everyone.
For instance, a recent report by theÊWorld BankÊargues that economies like China and India must totally decarbonize their electricity supply around midcentury and achieve negative emissions from then on, using carbon capture technologies and vastly increased forests, to suck excessive carbon out of the atmosphere.
To put it mildly, that is going to be a challenge.
Jairam Ramesh, who was minister of the environment under the previous prime minister,ÊManmohan Singh, argues that India must continue to grow at 7.5 to 8 percent a year for the next 15 years.
To power this growth, India's electricity consumption -- which accounts for over half its greenhouse gas emissions -- would rise 6 to 7 percent a year. Even under the most ambitious goals for nuclear power and renewable energy, more than half of this power is expected to come from coal, the dirtiest fuel. ""By 2030 India's coal consumption could triple or quadruple,"" Mr. Ramesh told me.
India has come up with a mitigation contribution plan for the Paris meeting. It aims to get 40 percent of its electricity from nonfossil fuels by 2030 and to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 to 35 percent from 2005 to 2030. It also offers to vastly increase its forest cover.
The plan, however, pointedly notes that India's energy consumption amounts to only 0.6 metric tons of oil equivalent per person, about a third of the world average. It explains that ""no country in the world"" has ever achieved the development level of today's advanced nations without consuming at least four tons.
""India has a lot to do to provide a dignified life to its population and meet their rightful aspirations,"" it states.
Some analysts say there is a way to thread the needle. Development can be decoupled from carbon emissions, theÊWorld Bankinsists.
Moreover, economists at theÊWorld BankÊargued in a separate report released last Sunday that emissions reduction policies could be structured to benefit the poor in the next 15 years -- for instance by using revenue from carbon taxes to pay for social insurance.
""The goals are extremely ambitious; only a minority of scenarios get us there,"" said Stephane Hallegatte, who led the study. ""But they are achievable.""
Under the right set of policies, theÊWorld BankÊprojects, even the most disruptive climate change would add only three million people to India's extreme poor in 2030. Bad choices, by contrast, would add 42 million to that number.
Some in India seem convinced by the logic. ""Our traditional defensive stance has simply not been in the enlightened national interest,"" Mr. Ramesh argued in an address last year to the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore.
""India must view the era of the green economy not as a threat to its developmental plans,"" he said. ""Instead, it must be viewed as an opportunity to build and demonstrate technological capability to the world.""
And yet, there is still a significant risk that India will say no to the West's climate change agenda. ""It plays hugely well domestically,"" Mr. Ramesh told me. ""One should never discount that possibility.""

Protesters Are in Agreement as Well: Pact Is Too Weak
By ALISSA J. RUBIN and ELIAN PELTIERDEC. 12, 2015

PARIS — Several thousand climate activists from across Europe and many from farther afield gathered peacefully near the Arc de Triomphe on Saturday to protest the outcome of the COP 21 climate conference about 12 miles away.

The demonstration was an official exception to a ban on public gatherings across France after the Paris terrorist attacks in November.

What Does a Climate Deal Mean for the World?
A group of 195 nations reached a landmark climate agreement on Saturday. Here is what it means for the planet, business, politics and other areas.


Even as the delegates at the official conference center reached a landmark accord and applauded their achievement, the crowds on the street made clear their belief that it would take much more than the measures in the deal to halt global climate change.

“We don’t like the COP 21,” said Joseph Purugganan, who came from the Philippines to participate in the demonstration with other activists from a coalition called Focus on the Global South.


“The message here is that the real solution will come from the people,” he said. “After 20 years of COPs, look at where we are.”

 
He added that slowing the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, the goal set in the agreement, was not enough. In the Philippines, there have been record typhoons, and fishermen in Southeast Asia are being driven from their homes by rising oceans, he said.

Stuart Basden, 33, who came from Toronto, sounded even more disappointed. “We knew that it would be a failure,” he said. “They just decided in which decade we will become extinct.”

In contrast to an earlier protest during the conference, a banned one at the Place de la République on Nov. 29 that turned violent and resulted in arrests, the mood at the Arc de Triomphe was cheerful, even festive. Almost everyone carried a red tulip, and many waved flags or carried banners, or had more creative props.

A group of Danes dressed as polar bears took off their headgear periodically to get some air and see the events around them, while a group from Peru waved flags, one of which said “Nuclear Power, Non Gracias.”

At two locations, the Arc de Triomphe and the Champ de Mars, the climate demonstrators unfolded and carried two 100-meter red ribbons — red to symbolize that the climate situation is an emergency, and to communicate their skepticism toward the agreement. The Arc de Triomphe demonstration was organized by 350.org, a United States-based climate change nonprofit. The one at the Champs de Mars was organized by a coalition of 16 environmental groups, including the French chapters of Friends of the Earth and Attac. Many participants said that the event and even the conference had energized many climate change activists, regardless of its outcome.

There was also an unofficial demonstration earlier Saturday in which about 3,000 climate activists in Paris managed to use geo-localization technology to spell out the words “Climate Justice Peace” on a virtual map.

“The climate movement is growing, and climate policies now have a huge mainstream support,” said Daniel Smith, 29, who bicycled from London to join the demonstration.

Standing next to his bike, which had a globe strapped to the back, he added, “And now it’s not green anymore, it’s red.”

A group of climate activists from the Netherlands had come by bus. One, Willemyn Kadyk, 19, a college student and aspiring environmental lawyer, said that while many might not care much about demonstrations, such events were an important counterpoint to the official conference.

Chasing a Climate Deal
We’re tracking developments from the COP21 climate conference in Paris.

 

“People might think it’s not worth it to come, but if everybody thinks that way, nothing changes,” she said. “Groups will make this change.”


Many French activists were there, as well, including Corine Lefort, an elementary school principal who came from Marseille with her husband. They carried a banner that read “Save the Climate.”

“This is to put pressure on those officials responsible that things need to change more quickly,” she said. “It’s urgent. This is a real crime against humanity.”

She added that on the Mediterranean coast there were already villages where people living close to the water had deserted their homes because the sea had risen.

“This is not something for the future,” she said. “The future is already here.”

OPINION
The Missing CampusÊClimateÊDebate
By EVAN J. MANDERY
CLIMATE CHANGE is our era's defining challenge, but most of America's universities are planning to sit this one out. Though students and faculty members at more than 400 colleges have called for administrators to divest from fossil-fuel energy companies, fewer than 20 have committed to doing so. Stanford recently divested from coal, but none of the other schools had endowments within the 150 largest in 2013.
The principal justification schools offer is that endowments should be reserved to advance an academic mission. As Cornell's president, David J. Skorton, put it, ""We must resist, in almost all cases, the temptation to manage these precious funds to further social or political causes, no matter how worthy."" Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's president, said, ""The endowment is a resource, not an instrument to impel social or political change.""
These statements stunned me. Academics are a liberal lot. Research -- much of which is conducted at universities -- overwhelmingly supports the fact that climate change is man-made. How can it be that so few universities are willing to take on global warming? How can they defend their position by saying they have an obligation not to consider morality when they invest?
Let's separate what universities say from what they mean. Their appeal to the image of university as ivory tower, where objective research is conducted in social isolation, rings hollow. Universities have cultivated relationships with businesses, governments and donors for commercial and political purposes. Derek C. Bok, a former Harvard president, wrote, ""The 'ivory tower' has been breached at so many points and the connections with the outside world have grown so numerous and close that the term no longer has descriptive value."" Every university president knows this.
Every university president also knows that endowment managers don't have unfettered discretion. Would anyone defend a university that bought stock in a company known to employ child laborers? Moral considerations have altered investment policies in the past. More than 150 schools divested from South Africa during apartheid -- albeit reluctantly. Others divested from the tobacco industry and select Sudanese companies.
What presidents really mean is something more nuanced, like ""divestment should be considered only in extraordinary cases about which there is broad consensus."" You can see why they might feel this way. Causes abound. Portuguese colonialism in Africa was the outrage in 1972 when Harvard students occupied university buildings and the word ""divestiture"" first emerged. Today, students are calling for divestment from prison companies, China and Israel. It's easy to see how taking sides in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would undermine universities' role as a forum for open debate.
Divestment is a slippery slope. Where do universities draw the line? Columbia's president, Lee C. Bollinger, says, ""The bar has to be very high, and the reason is there are lots of things that people don't like about the world.""
But what better forum than the university could there be for distinguishing among competing moral claims? Knowing students and professors, these debates would be prolonged, but it's easy enough to structure the questions that would be asked and how they'd be answered regarding fossil fuels.
First, what is the significance of the social cause? University presidents have overwhelmingly acknowledged the harm caused by fossil fuels, though some, including Brown's president, Christina H. Paxson, have argued that ""this harm is moderated by the fact that coal is currently necessary for the functioning of the global economy.""
Then we'd ask about the school's mission. Perhaps investments in fossil fuel are justified if profits are used for social good, like financial aid programs, which are supported by endowments. But most elite private colleges remain bastions of privilege. Public universities -- especially community colleges, which have better track records on access -- have a more compelling claim on this defense.
Next, how much would divestment cost? Not much. According to a 2012 report sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute, oil and natural gas constituted merely 2.1 percent of endowment holdings. Some research suggests that endowments would have performed better over the past decade had they excluded fossil-fuel companies.
Finally, how would divestment advance the cause? Defending Western Washington University's decision to remain invested in fossil fuels, the president, Bruce Shepard, wrote, ""Everybody understands that divestment by our foundation would have no material effect on climate change."" More constructive, wrote Ms. Faust, would be to ""think about how we might use our voice not to ostracize such companies but to encourage them to be a positive force."" This recalls South African divestment campaigns, when presidents argued universities could exert more leverage if they remained invested. But Nelson Mandela and the South African president, F. W. de Klerk, each cited divestment as influential. Endowments have quadrupled in size since 1990, in real dollars.
Of course, the National Party had the power to end apartheid. Even the most optimistic environmentalist cannot envision fossil-fuel usage ending immediately. ""I also find a troubling inconsistency,"" wrote Ms. Faust, ""in the notion that, as an investor, we should boycott a whole class of companies at the same time that, as individuals and as a community, we are extensively relying on those companies' products and services for so much of what we do every day.""
It's a valid point, but if presidents think it relieves them of all duty, they aren't listening to the distinction students and faculty have drawn between driving corporations out of business and changing their behavior. For fossil-fuel companies don't just extract and sell energy. They also spend on elections and oppose renewable energy standards. Investment could be contingent on a company's agreeing to curtail its political spending, report on climate change or include environmental experts on its board. Universities could distinguish among fossil-fuel companies and industries, as Stanford did in divesting from coal.
It's impossible to imagine that after a fair debate only a handful of universities would choose to do anything. But it's not a fair debate. Shared governance -- students, teachers and administrators making decisions together -- is a defining feature of the university. This unique issue is being decided by trustees, who see their responsibility as maximizing returns. Gofossilfree.org has identified only 41 schools with investor responsibility committees, but they are advisory, with authority reserved to the fiduciaries.
Of course, global warming is at bottom a dilemma about the nature of fiduciary duty -- about whether that duty is solely to make money or whether we also owe an ethical obligation to endangered species, the inhabitants of low-lying islands and our children. If this debate included more voices, one can't help but imagine that our universities might construe their obligation more broadly.

ClimateÊRevelations Prompt Calls for Federal Investigation of Exxon Mobil
By JUSTIN GILLIS and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Matt Apuzzo and Clifford Krauss contributed reporting.
More than 40 of the nation's leading environmental and socialÊjusticeÊgroups demanded a federal investigation of Exxon Mobil on Friday, accusing the huge oil and gas company of deceiving the American public about the risks of climate change to protect its profits.
In a letter to Attorney GeneralÊLoretta Lynch, the groups, citing recent news reports, suggested that Exxon Mobil might be guilty of the same kind of fraud that the tobacco companies were found to have perpetrated when they hid the risks of smoking. Those violations ultimately cost the companies tens of billions of dollars in penalties.
The call for an investigation echoes demands made in recent days by three Democratic presidential candidates, includingÊHillary Rodham ClintonÊand Bernie Sanders, and by severalÊDemocratsÊin Congress.
Exxon Mobil rejected the comparison to the tobacco industry, declaring that it had helped to finance accurate scientific research about climate change and that it had made its research public from the 1970s to the present.
""There is a definite risk from climate change,"" the company's vice president for public affairs, Kenneth P. Cohen, said on Friday in an interview. ""We have an unbroken record of participation in significant and serious scientific inquiry into this problem.""
A spokesman for theÊJustice Department, Wyn Hornbuckle, said the department was reviewing the letter from the advocacy groups, but had no additional comment on it.
An investigation of Exxon Mobil on the climate issue would be politically touchy, given that manyÊRepublicansÊin Congress oppose action on climate change and would most likely come to the company's defense. The administration has walked a fine line in recent years, pushing stronger climate policies but avoiding overt battles with the oil companies, and continuing to approve drilling leases and permits.
The letter from the groups follows recent articles from two news organizations, Inside Climate News andÊThe Los Angeles Times, about Exxon Mobil's role in blocking political action on global warming.
The broad outlines of the company's activities have been known for years. From the time the scientific community first began worrying about the climate issue in the 1970s, the company financed research on the topic, with its scientists generally supporting an emerging consensus that fossil fuel emissions could pose risks for society. Company scientists have contributed to dozens of scientific papers that supported this view and explored the extent of the risks.
But in the late 1990s -- under a new chairman and chief executive, Lee R. Raymond -- Exxon also joined with many business groups to try to block American participation in an international climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol.
For at least a decade, it helped to finance right-leaning ideological organizations that not only fought the treaty, but also mounted attacks on climate science, raising lingering doubts in the public mind about whether the situation was as serious as most scientists believed it to be.
The recent news reporting has found, for example, that Exxon's senior leaders and board decided to go forward with their political activities even though they had been briefed extensively on the risks of global warming by the company's own scientists. (Exxon merged with Mobil in 1999.)
The letter sent on Friday drew a comparison to the activities of the major tobacco companies. In the 1950s and '60s, they financed internal research showing tobacco to be harmful and addictive, but mounted a public campaign that said otherwise, and helped finance scientific research later shown to be dubious. In 2006, the companies were found guilty of ""a massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public.""
From what is publicly known so far, the Exxon situation appears to differ from the activities of the tobacco companies.
The science conducted by its in-house researchers has never been kept secret -- company scientists have appeared as authors on more than 50 published papers on climate change -- and has generally lined up with the findings of other climatologists. Exxon scientists have also participated extensively in the reports of theÊUnited NationsÊpanel that periodically reviews and summarizes climate science, theÊIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
At least two company scientists, Haroon Kheshgi and William Landuyt, played active roles in the most recent series of I.P.C.C. reports, published in 2013 and 2014. Those reports warned of profound risks from climate change and an urgent need to rein in emissions.
Exxon has on occasion funded science that mainstream researchers considered to be dubious. It was, for example, one of several fossil fuel companies that financed the research of Wei-Hock Soon, known as Willie, a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who tried to show that recent climate change could be explained by solar variations. Dr. Soon's failure to disclose these ties was recently exposed in documents made public by environmental advocates.
Under rising criticism for its role in funding organizations that promulgated climate denialism, Exxon Mobil began scaling back such ties late in the last decade, and awarded its last grant to Dr. Soon in 2010. In a major shift, the company endorsed a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide in 2009.
Any effort to convict the company of fraud might involve trying to hold it responsible for the scientific statements of the advocacy groups it helped to finance, or for its own public statements about the Kyoto treaty or other government policies. Several experts said in interviews on Friday that, without compelling evidence of an intent to deceive, such advocacy would most likely be protected as free speech.
""A leading obstacle would be the First Amendment, as climate change is a matter of robust public debate,"" said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor atÊColumbia University, who added that he was ""not assuming that Exxon behaved honorably.""
The letter to theÊJustice DepartmentÊwas signed by numerous environmental,ÊjusticeÊand indigenous groups, including theÊSierra Club,ÊGreenpeace, and the League of Conservation Voters. Among them was Fred Krupp, president of theÊEnvironmental Defense Fund, who has a track record of working closely with corporate leaders.
""We don't have all the facts about what Exxon knew, and we're not prejudging what happened,"" Mr. Krupp said in a statement. ""But what several teams of journalists have reported is detailed, troubling, and deserving of further investigation.""

Solar and Wind, but Not Coal: WhereÊEnergyÊJobs Are Growing
By NADJA POPOVICH
President Trump has promised to revive the coal industry and double down on fossil fuels, creating ""so many energy jobs,"" but he has not focused on the increasingly important role of renewable power in America's energy economy.
Last year, the solar industry employed many more Americans than coal, while wind power topped 100,000 jobs.
Those numbers come from aÊDepartment of EnergyÊreport published in January by the Obama administration that provides the most complete picture available of American energy employment.
AÊDepartment of EnergyÊspokesman for the current administration declined to discuss the report on the record.
In 2016, 1.9 million Americans were employed in electric power generation, mining and other fuel extraction activities, according to the report -- a field we'll call power creation for short.
More than 373,000 Americans worked part time or full time in solar energy, and just over 260,000 of them -- or about 70 percent -- spent a majority of their time on solar projects.
Most solar energy jobs were in installation, construction and manufacturing, as the relatively new industry continued to add capacity. Solar power still generated a small share of United States energy output last year.
The coal industry, which has shed jobs since 2012, primarily as a result of competition from cheap natural gas, employed just over 160,000 workers nationwide. About 54,000 coal jobs were in mining.
It's important to note that power creation isn't the only source of energy employment. TheÊEnergy DepartmentÊreport found an additional 2.3 million jobs in energy transmission, storage andÊdistribution, a number that includes power line and pipeline workers and more than 900,000 retail jobs, such as gas station workers and fuel dealers. If nontraditional energy workers are included in the mix -- those involved in manufacturing and installing energy-efficient products -- the total number of energy-related jobs swells to 6.4 million.
Of course, energy jobs aren't equally distributed throughout the country. California, a state with robust renewable energy standards and installation incentives, had the highest rate of solar power jobs per capita last year. Roughly 84 of every 10,000 workers in the state held part- or full-time jobs in the solar industry. Nevada came in a close second, followed by Hawaii, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Midwest and Great Plains states had the highest rates of wind energy employment. The region has been leading the way on renewable power generation thanks to its strong wind resources.
Though supporting fewer total jobs, the coal industry still employed an outsize share of workers in two states: Wyoming and West Virginia.
In Wyoming, nearly 300 of every 10,000 workers -- or 3 percent -- were employed in coal power generation and mining last year. In West Virginia, the coal industry accounted for 2 percent of employment. Those states had many fewer jobs in solar and wind energy.

Brown Begins Last Term With a BoldÊEnergyÊPlan
By ADAM NAGOURNEY
LOS ANGELES -- Gov. Jerry Brown began his fourth and final term on Monday proposing a broad reduction in California's energy consumption over the next 15 years -- including a call to slash gas consumption by cars and trucks by as much as 50 percent -- as part of what he said would be a sweeping campaign to heighten the state's role in the fight against global warming.
Mr. Brown, a longtime champion of electric cars and limiting greenhouse gas emissions, called in his inauguration speech for 50 percent of California's electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030, up from the current goal of one-third by 2020, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings.
Mr. Brown was in effect proposing that California, which is already viewed as at the forefront in the battle to curb emissions, greatly expand cutbacks put in place in the state's landmark 2006 greenhouse gas emission bills. And he made clear that he would use his final years in office to try to make this happen.
""Taking significant amounts of carbon out of our economy without harming its vibrancy is exactly the sort of challenge at which California excels,"" Mr. Brown, 76, said as he was sworn in. ""This is exciting, it is bold and it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of stopping potentially catastrophic changes to our climate system.""
His speech, delivered to a joint session of the Legislature in Sacramento, looked to the past and to the future, and brimmed with references to his family's long history in California governance.
Mr. Brown's goals drew opposition from some Republicans, who warned that the kind of things the governor was discussing could worsen the business climate here by imposing new regulations and potentially taxes.
""At what point does being on the leading edge of environmental reform impact our ability to create jobs?"" said Bob Huff, a Republican and the Senate minority leader.
But the governor, a Democrat, will be working with a Legislature controlled by Democrats that has historically embraced these kinds of aggressive environmental programs. On this topic, at least, he was speaking to a friendly crowd.
""California has been leading the country in building the low-carbon economy of tomorrow,"" said Kevin de Len, a Democrat who is president pro tem of the State Senate. ""The ambitious goals the governor stated today are admirable, but we need to make the necessary investments in advanced technology to get us there.""
Indeed, Democrats, at least in their initial response to the speech, seemed more intent on trying to push Mr. Brown away from his pledge of austerity and toward restoring cuts that the state had made during a long, difficult fiscal period.
""Not all Californians have come back from the recession,"" said Toni G. Atkins, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly. ""We have to make sure that we are looking out for them.""
Alex Jackson, the legal director for the California Climate Project with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called Mr. Brown's goals achievable, noting that the state already seemed well on its way toward surpassing the 2020 deadline for drawing one-third of its electricity from renewable resources. ""This is a big deal,"" he said. ""The beacon of climate and clean energy emanates from the West.""
The governor used broad brushes to describe how the state might accomplish what he acknowledged was an aggressive -- and potentially costly -- plan. Mr. Brown has repeatedly been an advocate of electric cars, signing legislation to support them and promoting them in a series of speeches devoted to global warming, and on Monday he said he saw that as one of a number of ways to achieve his goals.
""I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro-grids, an energy imbalance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electricalÊdistribution, and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles,"" Mr. Brown said.
""All of this is a very tall order,"" he added. ""How we achieve these goals and at what pace will take great thought and imagination mixed with pragmatic caution. It will require enormous innovation, research and investment.""

Fissures in G.O.P. as Some Conservatives Embrace RenewableÊEnergy
By JOHN SCHWARTZ; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- In conservative politics, solar power is often dismissed as an affectation, part of a liberal agenda to funnel money to ""solar cronies"" of the Obama administration and further the ""global warming hoax.""
So one would not expect to see Barry Goldwater Jr., the very picture of modern conservatism and son of the 1964 Republican nominee for president, arguing passionately on behalf of solar energy customers. But there he was last fall, very publicly opposing a push by Arizona's biggest utility to charge as much as $100 a month to people who put solar panels on their roofs.
The utilities, backed by conservative business interests, argue that solar users who have lower power bills because of government subsidies are not paying their fair share to maintain the power grid. Mr. Goldwater and other advocates have struck back by calling the proposed fees a ""solar tax,"" and have pushed their message in ads on Fox News and the Drudge Report.
Similar conflicts are going on in California and Colorado, with many more to come. And as the issue pops up, conservatives are even joining forces with environmental groups. In Georgia, a Tea Party activist and the Sierra Club formed a ""Green Tea Coalition.""
As a result, solar power is fast becoming one of the fracture lines dividing the conservative movement's corporate and libertarian sides. The American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC, which helps pro-business Republicans across the country write legislation, has successfully urged several states to fight federal mandates for adopting renewable energy like solar power. This month, it published a resolution calling for states to ""require that everyone who uses the grid helps pay to maintain it and to keep it operating reliably at all times.""
To Mr. Goldwater, the true conservative path lies elsewhere. ""Utilities are working off of a business plan that's 100 years old,"" he said in an interview, ""kind of like the typewriter and the bookstore."" On the website for his campaign, Tell Utilities Solar Won't Be Killed, Mr. Goldwater, a former congressman, says, ""Republicans want the freedom to make the best choice.""
He says conservatives are the original environmentalists, especially in the West. ""They came out here and fell in love with the land,"" he said, and added that his father used to tell him, ""There's more decency in one pine tree than you'll find in most people.""
Tom Morrissey, a former state Republican Party chairman in Arizona who was embraced by the state's Tea Party groups, called the party's national leaders ""knuckleheads"" on this issue. Domestically produced energy is a national security issue, he said, adding, ""If we can keep one dollar from going to people who are killing our kids in Afghanistan, it's a good thing -- and I feel that's what solar energy does.""
He and others consider the utilities to be regulated monopolies whose rates are set by bureaucrats -- the opposite of a free-market economy. In Georgia, Debbie Dooley, the national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots and a co-founder of the Green Tea Coalition, said the fact that some conservatives denounced the favorable treatment that solar power got from the federal government was immaterial.
""They neglect to mention billions of dollars that the fossil-fuel industries have received,"" she said. ""They cherry-pick their principles.""
Seth Gunning, an organizer in Georgia with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign who teamed up with Ms. Dooley, said that although ideals differ, ""we can find common ground."" Ms. Dooley said she was working with pro-solar activists in Colorado, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. ""It's spreading,"" she said. ""People respond to free-market energy.""
She said that in the work with Mr. Gunning and other activists on the left, everyone tried to keep things civil. ""We just don't talk about Obamacare,"" she said.
Sometimes she will call Mr. Gunning a tree-hugger. Her liberal partners ""call me a 'right-wing radical.' But we'll joke about it,"" Ms. Dooley said. ""We're on each other's Christmas card list.""
In Hawaii, where high electricity costs have led to enormous private investment in rooftop solar panels, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, a Republican, in cooperation with the local Sierra Club chapter, has been battling Hawaiian Electric over policies that she says discourage adoption of solar power. Like other utilities, Hawaiian Electric has argued that the boon in solar has put a strain on the grid and could even cause safety problems.
The fight in Arizona led to a vote in November that allowed both sides to claim victory. The all-Republican commission that regulates utilities voted for an average fee of $5 per month, much lower than the original request from the utility, but accepted the utilities' argument that solar subsidies are inappropriately disrupting their bottom line.
In many states, the conflict focuses on so-called net metering subsidies that utilities give rooftop solar owners for the excess energy they feed back onto the grid -- an important incentive for consumers to adopt solar power. As solar power has boomed, the companies have argued that customers who put solar panels on their roofs might be shifting the cost of maintaining the energy grid to nonsolar ratepayers.
In any case, the rise of solar, like other forms of independent power generation, has caused headaches for the industry.
Lisa Wood, vice president of the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington sponsored by investor-owned utilities, argued that for the typical residential customer, the cost of making the electricity accounted for only about 45 percent of the bill. Most of the rest wasÊdistribution, transmission and maintenance of equipment that might be called on for only part of the year, when demand was high. Her argument that rooftop solar users shift costs to other ratepayers pits homeowners against apartment dwellers and those who do not have the kind of credit rating that the solar companies like to do business with.
David Leeper, an electrical engineer and solar rooftop user in Phoenix, ridiculed the power industry's arguments as ""high-tech chutzpah."" Mr. Leeper, a Republican who cites his core values as ""limited government, free markets and fiscal responsibility,"" said the notion that he was some kind of free rider made him wonder whether he should owe the utility money if he conserved energy by using his air conditioner more sparingly. ""Does that mean I took money from them?""
But he said he was satisfied with the vote for a small monthly charge since he needs the power grid to reliably provide power in the evenings, or when clouds pass across the face of the sun.
""I owe you guys something for being there when I need you,"" he said. ""That's the fee for backup service.""

Storing the Surge in RenewableÊEnergy
By HENRY FOUNTAIN
POMONA, Calif. -- The future of American energy, according to one widely held view, will include solar panels and wind turbines continuing to proliferate, churning out ever more electricity and eventually eclipsing fossil fuels to help offset the forces of climate change.
With the cost of renewable technologies falling sharply, that vision is starting to take shape, especially in areas with abundant sunshine or steady wind. Here in California, the state is making such quick progress toward its goal of getting 33 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020 that Gov.ÊJerry BrownÊraised the ante earlier this year, setting a target of 50 percent by 2030.
The shift sounds simple in theory -- plug more solar and wind into the mix, and unplug more coal- or gas-burning power plants, sparing the world millions of tons of greenhouse gases.
But the reality is more complex. Because of the variable nature of these renewable sources -- no electricity is generated when the sun goes down or the air is still -- they add strains to the system of transmitting and distributing power.
Batteries have long been seen as one of the main ways to work more renewables into the electrical grid, by storing electricity during times of excess generation and releasing it when needed. Now, spurred by mandates in California and other states to deploy storage, by the rise of rooftop solar systems, and by falling prices asÊTesla MotorsÊand other companies make plans to produce vast numbers of lithium-ion cells, batteries are set to play a significant part in the nation's power supply.
""We can see the role of batteries playing out in different locations around the grid,"" said Ravi Manghani, an analyst with GTM Media and author of a recent forecast for the energy storage industry over the next five years. ""We expect that every year, we're going to see on average 100 to 250 percent growth,"" he added. ""And most of that will be in batteries.""
Challenges remain, however. Despite plummeting prices, large battery systems generally are not yet economical for helping to integrate renewables on a broad scale. Instead, utilities and other companies are using them for different purposes.
""Let's call it a stretch goal,"" Imre Gyuk, who directs aÊDepartment of EnergyÊprogram that has sponsored demonstration projects for energy storage, said of plans for vast deployment of batteries for integrating renewables. Costs still have to come down more, he said, and not just for the cells, but for the control equipment as well.
There are several ways that the electrical grid can cope with more renewables -- by large consumers of electricity agreeing to have their power reduced at critical times, for example, a concept called demand response. And there are other ways to store electricity, such as pumping water, compressing air, spinning flywheels, or even making ice.
Battery systems, which feature racks of cells wired together, and are capable of storing large amounts of power and releasing it over an hour or longer, have some advantages over other storage methods. They can supply power nearly instantaneously and handle continual cycling between charging and discharging. And as the manufacturing of batteries and control systems scales up, it will be easier and cheaper to deploy ""plug and play"" systems, rather than designs that are unique to each situation.
A large battery storage project in Notrees, Tex., illustrates the current economics. Built in 2013 for about $44 million by Duke Energy Renewables (with theÊDepartment of EnergyÊcontributing half of the amount), the project consists of thousands of lead-acid battery cells near a large wind farm.
Greg Wolf, the president of Duke Energy Renewables, said the company found it hard to sell large electricity users so-called firmed wind, in which stored power from the battery is used to supplement the wind turbines to provide assured blocks of electricity at certain times. ""There was little interest from customers willing to pay for that,"" Mr. Wolf said. ""That has not evolved as much as some folks, including ourselves, thought.""
Instead, he said, the grid operator in Texas was interested in the Notrees battery as a fast-response source to regulate the frequency of the electrical current, which keeps the grid stable.
Maintaining a reliable grid is a high-wire act for operators, who struggle to keep a balance between the supply of electricity from generation sources and demand for it from customers. Batteries are especially valuable because they can respond quickly, adding more power to the system in a second or less.
Fossil-fuel plants that are often kept on standby for this purpose can take a few minutes or more to reach a level where they can provide the same service, Dr. Gyuk said. And all the while, fossil-fuel plants are emitting greenhouse gases.
Here at a Southern California Edison laboratory in the shadow of the San Gabriel Mountains, scientists and engineers are doing some of the fundamental work to help make widespread battery storage happen.
Accompanied by the steady thrum of electric current, batteries -- lithium-ion cells like those used in electric cars and other types -- sit in rows of sealed testing chambers. The batteries are undergoing continuous charge-discharge cycles in heat and cold, dripping humidity and desert dryness, to simulate the conditions they may face when deployed on the electrical grid.
""We're trying to better understand their performance,"" said Loic A. Gaillac, who manages the utility's advanced energy storage group. ""Ultimately, we want to get a sense of what degradation you see on the system and how long they last in the field.""
In 2013, California mandated that by 2020, Southern California Edison and the state's two other large investor-owned utilities add a huge amount of storage -- about 1.3 gigawatts, or more than 10 times the amount of storage deployed worldwide in 2011.
""We felt there were enough opportunities now where storage could be cost effective,"" said Carla Peterman, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees implementation of the mandate. ""But we still recognized that this was a nascent industry.""
Mark E. Irwin, Southern California Edison's director of technology energy storage, said that for now, the utility is most likely to use batteries to relieve itsÊdistributionÊsystem of peak loads that would otherwise require expensive improvement of wires and other equipment.
California has also set a priority to develop distributed generation, in particular moving away from large centralized solar farms and toward residential or neighborhood-scale solar power. Batteries will no doubt play a greater role in this, Mr. Irwin said. ""It will make it easier for people to put renewable systems out on the local grid,"" he said.
""But in the meantime, storage has to find a way to first walk,"" he added. Helping to defer upgrading costs, he said, is one way to get storage started.
""It's the first business case,"" Mr. Irwin said. ""But it won't be the last.""

BloombergÊSays Cities Will FightÊClimateÊChange, With or Without Trump
By EDWARD WONG
Donald J. TrumpÊhas said climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese to get the United States to suppress its manufacturing sector. That prompted a public rebuttal last week from a Chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to back away from the strict climate-denier viewpoint embraced by manyÊRepublicansÊin an interview withÊThe New York Times, saying that there was ""some connectivity"" between human activity and climate change. He also said he wanted to keep an ""open mind"" about whether to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the main global climate change accord.
Mr. Trump's opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in January. But officials from China, which has surpassed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gas, have said they will move forward on climate policies without the Americans, if it comes to that.
On Tuesday,ÊMichael R. Bloomberg, the media tycoon and former mayor of New York City, said that American cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what Mr. Trump and the federal government decided to do.
Mr.ÊBloombergÊmade his remarks in Washington at a talk hosted by the China General Chamber of Commerce. They were adapted for an op-ed article published Tuesday byÊBloombergÊView under the headline, ""Washington Won't Have Last Word on Climate Change.""
Mr.ÊBloomberg, a longtime advocate for action on climate change, praised Xie Zhenhua, China's climate envoy, for saying China remained committed to tackling the issue. ""That's a responsible thing to do for the Chinese people and the world,"" he said.
Mr.ÊBloombergÊadded that if Mr. Trump decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the United States who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement.
Following is a central passage from Mr.ÊBloomberg's op-ed article:
""I can't tell you whatÊDonald Trump's administration will do -- and in allÊfairness, they will need time to figure it out themselves. What's said on the campaign trail is one thing; actually carrying out a specific policy is another. I hope they'll recognize the importance of the issue. But I am confident that no matter what happens in Washington, no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds, no matter what laws the next Congress may pass, we will meet the pledges that the U.S. made in Paris.
""The reason is simple: Cities, businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions, because they have concluded -- just as China has -- that doing so is in their own self-interest.
""The U.S.'s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on Washington. Bear in mind: Over the past decade, Congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change. Yet at the same time, the U.S. has led the world in reducing emissions.
""That progress has been driven by cities, businesses and citizens -- and none of them are letting up now. Just the opposite: All are looking for ways to expand their efforts. Mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change.""
Mr.ÊBloomberg's remarks dovetail with recent ones made by American mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from Mr. Trump on critical issues. Among others, the mayors of New York, Chicago, Seattle, Philadelphia and Washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In his visit with reporters and editors atÊThe New York TimesÊon Tuesday, Mr. Trump said of the Paris Agreement: ""I'm looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it."" In addressing the climate issue, he also said, ""Clean air is vitally important.""
Mr. Trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog. It is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air, a severe problem in Chinese cities. Greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source -- in many cases, industrial coal-burning -- so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues. The United States and China have made pledges to curb the use of coal.
Mr.ÊBloombergÊconcluded the op-ed article published Tuesday with this thought: ""Washington will not have the last word on the fate of the Paris Agreement in the U.S. -- mayors will, together with business leaders and citizens.""

Adapting toÊClimateÊChange
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that global temperatures last year were the highest on record -- and that this year is likely to be hotter still. That is a powerful reason for rich countries to begin making good on their promises to help low-lying island nations, some of the poorest countries in the world, build their defenses against the disastrous effects of climate change, which some are already experiencing.
In the Solomon Islands, receding shorelines have destroyed some villages and rising sea levels have submerged five uninhabited islands, according to a study published in May. Drinking water is becoming increasingly scarce in Kiribati, another Pacific Ocean nation, as wells run dry or become contaminated by saltwater. And droughts appear to have become more intense in Africa and the Middle East and are probably a contributing factor to the migration of millions of people to Europe in recent years.
At last year'sÊUnited NationsÊclimate summit meeting in Paris, countries agreed to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, a point beyond which the widespread drought, flooding and extinctions of species are expected to kick in. But even if the world meets that target -- and the various national plans offered in Paris to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are still not strong enough to get there -- many poor countries will still be vulnerable to warmer temperatures, higher sea levels and more frequent natural disasters. Some small island nations could disappear entirely in the coming decades.
While it's hard to connect any single natural disaster to climate change, weather-related calamities worldwide have increased in recent years. There were an average of 335 such disasters a year between 2005 and 2014 -- nearly twice the yearly average from 1985 to 1994, according to a report by theÊUnited NationsÊand the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. And these disasters are more severe and more likely to displace people, according to a 2015 report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center and the Norwegian Refugee Council. Last year, about 19.2 million people fled their homes because of disasters.
Developing countries will not be able to make the investments needed to survive conditions brought on by global warming -- nor should they have to do so alone, as a matter ofÊfairness. Poor countries are responsible for only a small share of all greenhouse gas emissions. Industrialized nations bear the greatest responsibility for climate change. It is also in their interest to help the rest of the world adapt, because experts expect that tens of millions to several hundred million people will be displaced by climate change. Most will move within their countries, but some of them inevitably will seek refuge in developed nations because they have no other place to go.
In 2014, the world's leading powers and institutions, like theÊWorld Bank, committed about $25 billion to help developing nations adapt to climate change, according to aÊUnited NationsÊreport published in May. Developed countries have said that they will increase their support, to $100 billion a year starting in 2020, to help developing countries reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. That promise was made at the climate meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 and reaffirmed in Paris. (Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, was a major force behind the 2009 pledge.) But that falls far short of theÊUnited NationsÊreport's estimate that between $140 billion and $300 billion a year will be needed for adaptation by 2030.
Some of that spending would go toward building warning systems like those that exist for tsunamis, as well as stronger barriers against storm surges. Developing countries will also need to improve water conservation and flood management, restore wetlands and strengthen building codes.
Increases in temperatures and sea levels are likely to reduce agricultural yields, forcing more people to migrate to crowded cities. That's why political leaders need to start making policy changes that could take years to have an impact -- like helping farmers switch to other crops and investing in infrastructure and housing in urban areas. While the world ponders ways to reduce emissions, the consequences of climate change are already underway.

Busy Days Precede Protest on Climate
By LISA W. FODERARO
In a three-story warehouse in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, hundreds of people are working to turn the People's Climate March planned for Sunday into a visual spectacle.
There were victims of Hurricane Sandy from the Rockaways toiling with artists on a 30-foot inflatable life preserver, and immigrant artists constructing a papier-mch tree embedded with axes. Elsewhere, religious leaders were building an ark and scientists were constructing a chalkboard covered with calculations about carbon.
The run-up to what organizers say will be the largest protest about climate change in the history of the United States has transformed New York City into a beehive of planning and creativity, drawing graying local activists and young artists from as far away as Germany.
""This is the final crunch, the product of six months of work to make the People's March a big, beautiful expression of the climate movement,"" said Rachel Schragis, a Brooklyn-based artist and activist who is coordinating the production of floats, banners and signs.
The march, organized by more than a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, is planned to wend its way through Midtown Manhattan along a two-mile route approved by the city's Police Department last month. It will start at 11:30 a.m. at Columbus Circle, then move east along 59th Street, south on Avenue of the Americas and west on 42nd Street, finishing at 11th Avenue and West 34th Street.
Unlike the nuclear disarmament demonstration that drew more than 500,000 people to Central Park for speeches in 1982, the event on Sunday will rely on the marchers themselves to broadcast a message of frustration and anger at what organizers describe as a lack of action by American and world leaders.
At 1 p.m., after a moment of silence, marchers will be encouraged to use instruments, cellphone alarms and whistles to make as much noise as possible, helped by at least 20 marching bands and the tolling of church bells across the city.
""We're going to sound the burglar alarm on people who are stealing the future,"" said Bill McKibben, co-founder of the group 350.org, which is helping to organize the march, and the author of several books about climate change, notably ""The End of Nature,"" published 25 years ago.
""Since then we've watched the summer Arctic disappear and the ocean turn steadily acidic,"" Mr. McKibben said in a phone interview on Wednesday. ""It's not just that things are not getting better. They are getting horribly worse. Unlike any other issue we have faced, this one comes with a time limit. If we don't get it right soon, we'll never get it right.""
Organizers say it is impossible to predict how many people could show up. But 1,400 ""partner organizations"" have signed on, ranging from small groups to international coalitions. In addition, students have mobilized marchers at more than 300 college campuses, and more than 2,700 climate events in 158 countries are planned to coincide with the New York march, including rallies in Delhi, Jakarta, London, Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro.
In New York, organizers are expecting 496 buses from as far away as Minnesota and Kansas to bring marchers.
""The most useful gallon of gasoline anyone will ever burn is the one that gets them to the march,"" Mr. McKibben said. (By contrast, all floats will be pulled by biodeisel-powered cars and trucks or by hand, organizers said.)
The forecast called for mostly sunny weather with a high temperature of 81, which would encourage a larger turnout. In February 2013, more than 40,000 protesters turned out in Washington to demand action on climate change and to challenge the contentious Keystone XL pipeline.
The police are closing off Central Park West north of Columbus Circle, and organizers are asking marchers to gather from West 65th to West 86th Street, before the start of the march.
Leslie Cagan, a longtime New York activist who coordinated the nuclear disarmament demonstration in 1982, has met numerous times with the Police Department to iron out the logistics of Sunday's march. ""That area on Central Park West can hold a lot of people -- we believe between 80,000 and 100,000,"" she said. The police would not provide estimates of the number of expected attendees.
Organizers have asked marchers to go to various themed staging areas along Central Park West depending on their leanings.
For example, a contingent of labor, families, students and older adults can congregate north of West 65th Street under the rubric ""We Can Build the Future.""
Organizers have run phone banks, blanketed subway stations with fliers and issued weekly news releases.
They also produced a 52-minute documentary, ""Disruption,"" about planning the march. The film, released on Sept. 7, includes footage of meetings and pre-march rallies -- interspersed with lessons on climate change and the lagging efforts so far to stop it.
Organizers say they chose Sunday because it comes ahead of a climate summit at the United Nations on Tuesday. World delegates are expected to hold high-level discussions about climate change that will lay the groundwork for a potential global agreement on emissions next year in Paris. (Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced on Tuesday that he planned to join the march.)
""When the secretary general invited world leaders to this summit, all of us in theÊclimateÊjusticeÊmovement thought, 'Left to their own devices, these guys will do the same thing they've done for 25 years -- i.e., nothing,' "" Mr. McKibben said. ""So we thought, we better go to New York, too.""

ECONOMIC SCENE
Blueprints for Taming theÊClimateÊCrisis
By EDUARDO PORTER
Here's what your future will look like if we are to have a shot at preventing devastating climate change.
Within about 15 years every new car sold in the United States will be electric. In fact, by midcentury more than half of the American economy will run on electricity. Up to 60 percent of power might come from nuclear sources. And coal's footprint will shrink drastically, perhaps even disappear from the power supply.
This course, created by a team of energy experts, was unveiled on Tuesday in a report for the United Nations that explores the technological paths available for the world's 15 main economies to both maintain reasonable rates of growth and cut their carbon emissions enough by 2050 to prevent climatic havoc.
It offers a sobering conclusion. We might be able to pull it off. But it will take an overhaul of the way we use energy, and a huge investment in the development and deployment of new energy technologies. Significantly, it calls for an entirely different approach to international diplomacy on the issue of how to combat climate change.
""This will require a heroic cooperative effort,"" said Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist who directs the Sustainable Development Solutions Network at the United Nations, which convened the multinational teams.
The teams, one in each of the 15 countries, looked at what would be necessary to keep the atmosphere from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above the preindustrial average of the late 19th century, a target that most of the world committed to at the climate summit meeting in Copenhagen five years ago. To do so, CO2 emissions from industry and energy use would have to fall to at most 1.6 tons a year for every person on the planet by midcentury.
That is less than a tenth of annual American emissions per person today and less than a third of the world average. And we haven't quite figured out how to get from here to there.
The American team built several paths that would hit the target, using different mixes of nuclear power, renewable energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage technology. So did the Russian team, aided by the expected shrinking of the Russian population.
But the Chinese team was stymied by the country's vast heavy industry -- its steel makers and cement plants, which use enormous amounts of energy. The best it could do was chart a path that took CO2 emissions to some 3.4 tons per person by midcentury. ""We have shipped a lot of industry to China,"" Mr. Sachs said. ""Industry is hard to decarbonize.""
Over all, the teams built plausible technological paths to cut annual emissions across the 15 countries only to about 2.3 tons per person.
The analysis, however, offers solid ground for hope. The teams expect to improve on these paths in coming months. Faster deployment of some technologies than assumed could provide for deeper decarbonization in several countries. What's more, likely changes in economic structure in coming decades -- such as China's expected shift away from heavy industry -- could further shrink the carbon footprint.
Most important, the assessment offers an opportunity to end decades of inconsequential horse-trading over climate change and to start addressing the problem for real.
Five years since political leaders from countries around the world committed to do whatever it took to keep global temperatures from rising more than two degrees above the preindustrial average, no one had taken the trouble, until now, to evaluate how that might be achieved.
Lacking any understanding of the feasibility of the exercise, governments postured and jockeyed over which country should be responsible for what, offering as little as they could get away with in actual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, whether the collective effort met the two-degree commitment or not.
""If governments don't have any idea of what two degrees means in their countries, how can they commit to two degrees?"" asked Guido Schmidt-Traub, executive director of the Sustainable Development Network.
The report commissioned by the United Nations could end the jockeying: to stick to the two-degree limit every country, rich and poor, must reduce annual CO2 emissions to 1.6 tons per person, whether it is responsible for a lot or a little of the climate change so far.
This is dictated not byÊfairness, but by our technological frontier. There is wiggle room for negotiation. China's emissions from manufacturing would look smaller if they were allocated to consuming rather than producing countries. Still, we know of no feasible technology that would allow, say, the United States to have negative emissions in 2050 so India or China could emit more.
The new assessment also underscores the pointlessness of small, incremental emissions cuts. Under the path, the United States decarbonizes its energy supply at an average pace of almost 4 percent a year over the next four decades. That is more than 10 times faster than the Energy Information Administration's forecast last year. China takes CO2 out of its energy about six times as fast as the E.I.A.'s forecast.
This is not achievable by going after low-hanging fruit, such as replacing coal with natural gas in power plants. Doing so could even be counterproductive, locking the country's energy infrastructure into a high-carbon path.
Most important, perhaps, the new assessment suggests that deep decarbonization can be done without breaking any economy. Chinese incomes, for instance, are assumed to grow about 4.6 percent a year until midcentury.
The decarbonization paths rely on aggressive assumptions about our ability to deploy new technologies on a commercial scale economically. For instance, carbon capture and storage is supposed to be available starting in about 10 years. Second-generation biofuels are assumed to come into play by 2020. Hydrogen fuel cells and power storage technology are deployed starting around 2030.
But these technologies all exist today and seem reasonably scalable. The teams did not rely on more speculative technologies, like cold fusion, to make their numbers.
The new approach -- which the United Nations hopes will inform the debate up to the next climate summit in Paris in fall 2015 -- could offer a path out of the stalemate that international climate negotiations have become.
No country will commit legally to slash its CO2 emissions by 80 percent over the next 40 years. But if there is a map, many might offer their best effort to follow it. Absent a legal commitment, a long-term path could encourage the large investments ultimately required to address the problem.
""Governments won't precommit to huge technological revolutions on a legal basis,"" Professor Sachs said. ""Countries might be willing to aspire more on a conditional basis.""
What's more, countries are more likely to participate if they understand what everybody else is trying. ""The Chinese want to see an American pathway to two degrees,"" Mr. Schmidt-Traub said.
Big challenges remain. Any 40-year forecast must be taken with some skepticism. Technologies that seem feasible and economic today might turn out not to be. And it bears repeating that though the teams contend they can get to 1.6 tons per person, they have not yet.
Russia, for instance, hit the target. But Oleg Lugovoy of the Environmental Defense Fund, who worked on the Russian plan, observed that ""if we don't have carbon capture and storage we would have to reconsider.""
And while sketching a technological path toward a low carbon economy will certainly help ground in reality the abstract negotiations over the future of climate, it does not do away with the main hitch that has stumped progress for decades: How much will this all cost and who will pay for it?
The team purposefully did not assess the costs of their paths to prevent distributional arguments from flaring up immediately. That gives policy makers space to consider the implications without having to stake out a negotiating stance.
An assessment of costs and how they could be distributed will be added in a next iteration to be published next spring. Debates over cost allocation and technology transfer could still hamstring prospects of substantive international collaboration.
But despite these risks, the report offers a promising new path to overcome the decades-old logjam of climate change negotiations. For the first time, when we say we can stop the climate from heating we will more or less know what we are talking about.

Coal Rush in India Could Tip Balance onÊClimateÊChange
By GARDINER HARRIS; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.
DHANBAD, India -- Decades of strip mining have left this town in the heart of India's coal fields a fiery moonscape, with mountains of black slag, sulfurous air and sickened residents.
But rather than reclaim these hills or rethink their exploitation, the government is digging deeper in a coal rush that could push the world into irreversible climate change and make India's cities, already among the world's most polluted, even more unlivable, scientists say.
""If India goes deeper and deeper into coal, we're all doomed,"" said Veerabhadran Ramanathan, director of the Center for Atmospheric Sciences at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and one of the world's top climate scientists. ""And no place will suffer more than India.""
India's coal mining plans may represent the biggest obstacle to a global climate pact to be negotiated at a conference in Paris next year. While the United States and China announced a landmark agreement that includes new targets for carbon emissions, and Europe has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent, India, the world's third-largest emitter, has shown no appetite for such a pledge.
""India's development imperatives cannot be sacrificed at the altar of potential climate changes many years in the future,"" India's power minister, Piyush Goyal, said at a recent conference in New Delhi in response to a question. ""The West will have to recognize we have the needs of the poor.""
Mr. Goyal has promised to double India's use of domestic coal from 565 million tons last year to more than a billion tons by 2019, and he is trying to sell coal-mining licenses as swiftly as possible after years of delay. The government has signaled that it may denationalize commercial coal mining to accelerate extraction.
""India is the biggest challenge in global climate negotiations, not China,"" said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also vowed to build a vast array of solar power stations, and projects are already springing up in India's sun-scorched west.
But India's coal rush could push the world past the brink of irreversible climate change, with India among the worst affected, scientists say.
Indian cities are already the world's most polluted, with Delhi's air almost three times more toxic than Beijing's by one crucial measure. An estimated 37 million Indians could be displaced by rising seas by 2050, far more than in any other country. India's megacities are among the world's hottest, with springtime temperatures in Delhi reaching 120 degrees. Traffic, which will only increase with new mining activity, is already the world's most deadly. And half of Indians are farmers who rely on water from melting Himalayan glaciers and an increasingly fitful monsoons.
India's coal is mostly of poor quality with a high ash content that makes it roughly twice as polluting as coal from the West. And while China gets 90 percent of its coal from underground mines, 90 percent of India's coal is from strip mines, which are far more environmentally costly. In a country three times more densely populated than China, India's mines and power plants directly affect millions of residents. Mercury poisoning has cursed generations of villagers in places like Bagesati, in Uttar Pradesh, with contorted bodies, decaying teeth and mental disorders.
The city of Dhanbad resembles a postapocalyptic movie set, with villages surrounded by barren slag heaps half-obscured by acrid smoke spewing from a century-old fire slowly burning through buried coal seams. Mining and fire cause subsidence that swallows homes, with inhabitants' bodies sometimes never found.
Suffering widespread respiratory and skin disorders, residents accuse the government of allowing fires to burn and allowing pollution to poison them as a way of pushing people off land needed for India's coal rush.
""The government wants more coal, but they are throwing their own people away to get it,"" said Ashok Agarwal of the Save Jharia Coal Field Committee, a citizens' group.
T. K. Lahiry, chairman of Bharat Coking Coal, a government-owned company that controls much of the Jharia region, denied neglecting fires and pollution but readily agreed that tens of thousands of residents must be displaced for India to realize its coal needs. Evictions are done too slowly, he said.
""We need to shift these people to corporate villages far from the coal fields,"" Mr. Lahiry said during an interview in his large office.
With land scarce, Bharat Coking is digging deeper at mines it already controls. On a tour of one huge strip mine, officials said they had recently purchased two mammoth Russian mining shovels to more than triple annual production to 10 million tons. The shovels are clawing coal from a 420-foot-deep pit, with huge trucks piling slag in flat-topped mountains. The deeper the mine goes, the more polluting the coal produced.
India has the world's fifth-largest reserves of coal but little domestic oil or natural gas production. The country went on a coal-fired power plant building spree over the last five years, increasing capacity by 73 percent. But coal mining grew just 6 percent, leading to expensive coal imports, idle plants and widespread blackouts. Nearly 300 million Indians do not have access to electricity, and millions more get it only sporadically.
""India is going to use coal because that's what it has,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director of the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, a prominent environmental group. ""Its strategy is 'all of the above,' just like in the U.S.""
Each Indian consumes on average 7 percent of the energy used by an American, and Indian officials dismiss critics from wealthy countries.
""I don't want to use the word 'pontificate' when talking about these people, but it would be reasonable to expect moreÊfairnessÊin the discussion and a recognition of India's need to reach the development of the West,"" Mr. Goyal said with a tight smile.
One reason for the widespread domestic support for India's coal rush is the lack of awareness of just how bad the air has already become, scientists say. Smog levels that would lead to highway shutdowns and near-panic in Beijing go largely unnoticed in Delhi. Pediatric respiratory clinics are overrun, but parents largely shrug when asked about the cause of their children's suffering. Face masks and air purifiers, ubiquitous among China's elite, are rare here. And there are signs Indian air is rapidly worsening.
""People need to wake up to just how awful the air already is,"" said Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading intergovernmental organization for the assessment of climate change.
India's great hope to save both itself and the world from possible environmental dystopia can be found in the scrub grass outside the village of Neemuch, in India's western state of Madhya Pradesh. Welspun Energy has constructed what for the moment is Asia's largest solar plant, a $148 million silent farm of photovoltaic panels on 800 acres of barren soil.
Welspun harvests some of the most focused solar radiation in the world. Dust is so intense that workers must wash each panel every two weeks.
Under Mr. Modi, India is expected to soon underwrite a vast solar building program, and Welspun alone has plans to produce within two years more than 10 times the renewable energy it gets from its facility in Neemuch.
The benefits of solar and the environmental costs of coal are so profound that India has no other choice but to rely more on renewables, said Dr. Pachauri.
""India cannot go down China's pathway, because the consequences for the public welfare are too horrendous,"" he said.

Obama on Obama onÊClimate
By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN
WHEN it comes to dealing with the world's climate and energy challenges I have a simple rule: change America, change the world.
If America raises its clean energy standards, not only will others follow -- others who have hid behind our inaction -- we'll also stimulate our industry to invent more of the clean air, clean power and energy efficiency systems, and move them down the cost curve faster, so U.S. companies will be leaders in this next great global industry and American consumers will be the first to benefit. That is why the new Environmental Protection Agency rules President Obama proposed last week to curb carbon emissions from power plants are so pivotal. You can't make power systems greener without making them smarter -- smarter materials, software or design. One new ruling will not change the world -- and we have to be careful that this one doesn't replace our addiction to coal with an addiction to natural gas alone. But coming at a time when clean energy technologies are becoming more competitive, and when awareness of climate change is becoming more pervasive, this E.P.A. ruling should give a real boost to clean power and efficiency innovation and make our country more resilient, healthy, secure -- and respected.
Several weeks ago, as he was drawing up these new emission rules, I interviewed President Obama in the White House library about climate and energy. Following are highlights. (The interview is also featured in the final episode of Showtime's climate series, ""Years of Living Dangerously"" airing on Monday.)
For starters, Obama is aware that we can't just keep burning oil, coal and gas until they run out. As the International Energy Agency warned, ""no more than one-third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050"" -- unless carbon capture and storage technology is widely deployed -- otherwise we'll bust through the limit of a 2 degree Celsius rise in average temperature that climate scientists believe will unleash truly disruptive ice melt, sea level rise and weather extremes. The rest has to stay in the ground, and we need to steadily find cleaner alternatives and more energy efficiency. I asked Obama if he agreed with that analysis.
""Science is science,"" he said. ""And there is no doubt that if we burned all the fossil fuel that's in the ground right now that the planet's going to get too hot and the consequences could be dire.""
So we can't burn it all?
""We're not going to be able to burn it all. Over the course of the next several decades, we're going to have to build a ramp from how we currently use energy to where we need to use energy. And we're not going to suddenly turn off a switch and suddenly we're no longer using fossil fuels, but we have to use this time wisely, so that you have a tapering off of fossil fuels replaced by clean energy sources that are not releasing carbon. ... But I very much believe in keeping that 2 [degree] Celsius target as a goal.""
If that is so, your environmental supporters wonder why you keep touting how much we're still exploring for oil, coal and natural gas?
""We have got to meet folks where they are,"" said Obama. ""We've gone through, obviously, in the last five years, a tough economic crisis. ... I don't always lead with the climate change issue because if you right now are worried about whether you've got a job or if you can pay the bills, the first thing you want to hear is how do I meet the immediate problem? One of the hardest things in politics is getting a democracy to deal with something now where the payoff is long term or the price of inaction is decades away. What we've tried to do is continually find ways in which we can make progress, recognizing that we're not immediately going to get people to abandon the old gas-guzzler"" [because] ""they can't afford an electric car.""
Every morning you get a security briefing from the intelligence community on global threats; do you now also get the same on environmental threats?
""I do,"" said Obama. Science adviser ""John Holdren typically makes presentations when there are new findings,"" and his reports show that environmental stresses are now impacting both foreign and domestic policy. For instance, wildfires are now ""consuming a larger and larger portion of the Department of Interior budget. And if we continue to fund fighting fires the same way we've done in the past, all the money for everything else -- for conservation, for maintenance of forests -- all that money gets used up.""
But the area he's just as worried about, said Obama, ""is how climate change could end up having profound national security implications in poorer countries. We're obviously concerned about drought in California or hurricanes and floods along our coastlines and the possibility of more powerful storms or more severe droughts. All of those things are bread-and-butter issues that touch on American families. But when you start seeing how these shifts can displace people -- entire countries can be finding themselves unable to feed themselves and the potential incidence of conflict that arises out of that -- that gets your attention. There's a reason why the quadrennial defense review -- [which] the secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work on -- identified climate change as one of our most significant national security problems. It's not just the actual disasters that might arise, it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a lot of different countries and the possibility of war, conflict, refugees, displacement that arise from a changing climate.""
Syria couldn't manage a four-year drought when it had a government, and that drought helped fuel the uprising there, because the government did nothing for the people. Imagine what will happen if they have another prolonged drought and they've destroyed half their country?
""Which gives you a sense of what happens in a lot of these countries that are just barely hanging on,"" said Obama. ""They don't have a lot of margin for error, and that has national security implications. When people are hungry, when people are displaced, when there are a lot of young people, particularly young men, who are drifting without prospects for the future, the fertility of the soil for terrorism ends up being significant. And it can have an impact on us.""
What is the one thing you would still like to see us do to address climate change? Said Obama: put a price on carbon.
The way we've solved previous problems, like acid rain, he noted, ""was that we said: 'We're going to charge you if you're releasing this stuff into the atmosphere, but we're going to let you figure out -- with the marketplace and with the technology' "" how best to mitigate it. But ""you can't keep dumping it out in the atmosphere and making everybody else pay for it. So if there's one thing I would like to see, it'd be for us to be able to price the cost of carbon emissions. ... We've obviously seen resistance from the Republican side of the aisle on that. And out ofÊfairness, there's some Democrats who've been concerned about it as well, because regionally they're very reliant on heavy industry and old-power plants. ... I still believe, though, that the more we can show the price of inaction -- that billions and potentially trillions of dollars are going to be lost because we do not do something about it -- ultimately leads us to be able to say, 'Let's go ahead and help the marketplace discourage this kind of activity.' ""
Where does natural gas fit in?
After all, it can be a blessing and a curse. Natural gas emits only half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned, but if methane leaks when oil companies extract it from the ground in a sloppy manner -- methane is far more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide -- it can wipe out all the advantages of natural gas over coal.
Natural gas, the president said, ""is a useful bridge"" to span ""where we are right now and where we hope to be -- where we've got entirely clean energy economies based around the world."" Environmentalists, he added, ""are right, though, to be concerned if it's done badly, then you end up having methane gas emitted. And we know how to do it properly. But right now what we've got to do is make sure that there are industry standards that everybody is observing."" That doesn't ""necessarily mean that it has to be a national law,"" he said. ""You could have a series of states working together -- and, hopefully, industry working together -- to make sure that the extraction of natural gas is done safely.""
Do you ever want to just go off on the climate deniers in Congress?
""Yeah, absolutely,"" the president said with a laugh. ""Look, it's frustrating when the science is in front of us. ... We can argue about how. But let's not argue about what's going on. The science is compelling. ... The baseline fact of climate change is not something we can afford to deny. And if you profess leadership in this country at this moment in our history, then you've got to recognize this is going to be one of the most significant long-term challenges, if not the most significant long-term challenge, that this country faces and that the planet faces. The good news is that the public may get out ahead of some of their politicians"" -- as people start to see the cost of cleaning up for hurricanes like Sandy or the drought in California -- and when ""those start multiplying, then people start thinking, 'You know what? We're going to reward politicians who talk to us honestly and seriously about this problem.' ""
The president added: ""The person who I consider to be the greatest president of all time, Abraham Lincoln, was pretty consistent in saying, 'With public opinion there's nothing I cannot do, and without public opinion there's nothing I can get done,' and so part of my job over these next two and a half years and beyond is trying to shift public opinion. And the way to shift public opinion is to really focus in on the fact that if we do nothing our kids are going to be worse off.""
The trick, I argued, is to find that fine line between making people feel the problem is urgent, but not insoluble so they just say: If the end is nigh, let's party.
""The most important thing is to guard against cynicism,"" responded the president. ""I want to make sure that everybody who's been watching this program or listening to this interview doesn't start concluding that, well, we're all doomed, there's nothing we can do about it. There's a lot we can do about it. It's not going to happen as fast or as smoothly or as elegantly as we like, but, if we are persistent, we will make progress.""

What California's Dam Crisis Says About the ChangingÊClimate
By NOAH S. DIFFENBAUGH
STANFORD, Calif. -- After five years of record-setting drought, much of California is being pummeled by an extremely wet winter. The disaster unfolding at Oroville, where precipitation is more than double the average, is the latest reminder that the United States needs a climate-smart upgrade of our water management systems.
In the West, much of our water infrastructure is old. Oroville Dam, north of Sacramento, was completed in 1968, nearly a half a century ago. Other major components of our water system are generations older, and maintenance has not been a priority. The damage to Oroville Dam, where the primary spillway developed a giant gash and the emergency spillway threatened to erode, illustrates the hazard of relying on aging infrastructure to protect us from extreme weather.
But age and upkeep are not the only problems. Our water system was designed and built in an old climate, one in which extremely warm years were less common and snowpack was more reliable. Here in the West, we use the same dams and reservoirs for both water storage and flood control, so during the wet season, reservoir managers continuously balance the dual pressures of storing as much water as possible for the dry summer and releasing sufficient water to create room for the next storm.
This system relies on the natural reservoir of mountain snowpack, which melts gradually over the spring and summer. While it is well known that much of the West relies on snowpack for water storage, the vital role of snowpack in flood control is considerably less appreciated. When precipitation falls as snow, it stays in the mountains rather than flowing into reservoirs. This leaves more room in reservoirs to prevent flooding downstream during heavy rainfall.
The recent drought has highlighted the pressure that a changing climate puts on a snowpack-dependent water system. With the shift toward more rain rather than snow, and the earlier melting of the snowpack, water managers need to release water more frequently for flood control. This dynamic is playing out in Oroville now, with the state's water managers racing to empty water from the dam's reservoir in advance of storms forecast to arrive Wednesday. Because these storms are relatively warm, they are likely to bring rain to the surrounding mountains, speeding the flow of water behind the dam.
The juxtaposition of five years of hot, dry conditions followed by more rain than reservoirs can store may seem incongruous. However, this is exactly what climate scientists have predicted for California since at least the 1980s: protracted periods of warm, dry conditions punctuated by intense wet spells, with more rain and less snow, causing both drought and floods. Recent work from my lab shows that in fact this pattern is already emerging, with the conditions that create extremely warm dry years and extremely wet years both becoming more frequent.
The other bitter reality is that this extremely wet winter will not wash away the drought. Depending where one looks, California lost out on one to three full years of precipitation from 2012 to 2016. That is a lot of water to make up in one year, and as of last week almost half of California was still in a state of drought. The moisture deficits that have accumulated during the drought have not been seen in our lifetimes. They have caused thousands of California residents to go without running water, resulted in groundwater contamination and permanent loss of aquifer storage capacity, and have severely stressed tens of millions of trees. As a result, even after this wet year, rural communities, groundwater aquifers and forest ecosystems will still feel the effects of the drought.
As the last five years illustrate, California's water system is not equipped for climate change's ""new normal."" That water system must simultaneously provide for the country's largest population and agricultural sector, and one of its most diverse natural environments. Although California has greatly improved water-use efficiency in the last half-century, climate change is pushing our water system to the limit. Investments in ""climate smart"" infrastructure can ensure the safety and security of Americans in the face of climate stresses now and in the future. These investments in infrastructure upgrades and expansion would create jobs, protect communities from disasters and help prepare us for changes in the climate. This effort would have several key elements:
First, given the new climate normal in which protracted hot, dry periods are far more common, we need to deploy technologies that can increase water supply. While expensive, energy-intensive desalination options have received considerable attention, wastewater recycling technologies have improved to the point that clean, safe water can now be delivered at reduced energy cost and can even be an energy source by using the organic matter in wastewater to produce energy. Investments in infrastructure to capture, store and clean urban storm water will also create new sources of water supply.
Second, we need to acknowledge that a water system that relies on snowpack for both water storage and flood control is increasingly risky. To make up for loss of snowpack, we need to build infrastructure that enables us to use excess runoff to recharge groundwater aquifers. This will have the dual benefit of replenishing groundwater that is drawn down during hot dry spells and capturing storm water that is lost when water is released for flood control.
Third, we need to prioritize infrastructure that helps us reliably supply safe water to both urban and rural communities while also ensuring that our vibrant agricultural sector and treasured ecosystems have the water that they need. Creating new supply and storage will help, but ensuringÊequityÊwill require that infrastructure investments simultaneously provide for all of these constituencies.
Fourth, although California has made tremendous progress in improving efficiency, this drought shows that there is still more room to improve. New technologies such as ""smart"" sensors, coupled with expanded water markets, offer opportunities to further increase water efficiency.
Each of these infrastructure investments would increase the safety and security of Americans right now. That each would also help us to prepare for further climate change shouldn't be a reason not to make those investments.

Uncharted Paths on Global Health andÊClimate
By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.
The United States is the pillar of global health aid, donating billions of dollars annually -- more than any other country -- to fighting disease in the world's poorest countries.
But even as the faltering battles against AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases hang in the balance, advocates for the poor, health experts and government officials admit that they have no idea what direction the incomingÊTrumpÊadministration is going to take.
President-electÊDonald J. TrumpÊhas almost never addressed the issue, and many of the leadership posts central to the global health mission, such as theÊUnited States Agency for International DevelopmentÊand theÊCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, are still in the hands of Obama administration appointees.
The Agency for International Development oversees giving to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and vaccine-preventable diseases. The C.D.C. gives scientific advice and battles foreign epidemics before they reach these shores.
Perhaps the most optimistic outlook was voiced, half-jokingly, at a recent medical conference by Dr. Michele Barry, head ofÊStanford University's Center for Innovation in Global Health.
""Well, he's a germophobe,"" she said of Mr.ÊTrump. ""So that's got to be good for the C.D.C.""
Americans blow hot and cold on global health. Many go for years without thinking about the fate of rural Africans or Latin Americans -- and then convulse with fear when an outbreak of Ebola, Zika or swine flu emerges, upset that there was so little warning and no vaccine.
Americans also have an extraordinarily inaccurate view of how much is spent on global health. When pollsters ask Americans to estimate what percentage of their tax dollar goes to foreign aid, the answers average 25 percent -- and most say it's too much.
In truth, foreign aid is just 1 percent of the federal budget, and health -- as opposed to military or development aid -- is only about a quarter of that. It totals about $9 billion a year out of a $4 trillion budget.
When poll respondents are told it is that small, their feelings shift sharply. Only 26 percent say it's too much; 27 percent believe it's too little. The latter say they favor spending more chiefly for two reasons: to protect America from epidemics and to improve the nation's image abroad.
""We need to get better at telling that story -- what a relatively small amount of the budget is spent to produce such big returns for the U.S.,"" said Chris Collins, president of Friends of the Global Fight, an advocacy group for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
On the campaign trail, Mr.ÊTrumpÊwas rarely asked for his thoughts on global health. On foreign aid in general, he usually voiced an ""America first"" agenda, saying tax dollars should go to rebuilding this country.
""It is necessary that we invest in our infrastructure and stop sending foreign aid to countries that hate us,"" Mr.ÊTrumpÊsaid when announcing his candidacy in 2015.
But a few months later, he was asked by a college student at a New Hampshire forum whether he would commit to doubling the number of people on AIDS treatment around the world.
""The answer is yes,"" Mr.ÊTrumpÊsaid. ""I believe so strongly in that, and we are going to lead the way.""
By contrast, Vice President-elect Mike Pence has a long record of voting for global health spending.
In 2003, he voted forÊGeorge W. Bush's Pepfar, which provided $15 billion to fight AIDS and tuberculosis in Africa. It united foreign-aid-favoring liberals and evangelical conservatives with ties to missionary hospitals. In 2008, Mr. Pence backed legislation that authorized $50 billion more for Pepfar and for the President's Malaria Initiative.
""The Bible tells us to whom much is given, much is expected,"" Mr. Pence said then. ""I believe the United States has a moral obligation to lead the world in confronting the pandemic of H.I.V.-AIDS.""
Yet Mr. Pence's conservatism worries some health advocates.
""TrumpÊhas no record, Pence does,"" said Serra Sippel, president of the Center for Health and GenderÊEquity, which advocates expanding women's rights, including abortion. ""I'd say it's not only hostile to women, but hostile to science.""
Support for global health spending is bipartisan but it varies by disease. Some ills are more controversial than others.
Saving mothers and babies is always popular, so the United States is a major supporter of GAVI, the vaccine alliance, which provides shots against tetanus, measles and many other diseases.
Stopping malaria is also widely supported. Funding for the President's Malaria Initiative has risen to $619 million today from $30 million in 2006, in part because it has been so remarkably effective. Worldwide, malaria deaths have dropped 60 percent.
The malaria initiative has been quietly run for 10 years by the same man PresidentÊBushÊfirst appointed to run it: R. Timothy Ziemer, a retired Navy admiral who is also an evangelical Christian. (He was born in Vietnam to medical missionaries.)
The effort also has theÊPentagon's support, because the Army and Navy have researched mosquito-borne illnesses since the Spanish-American War. The campaign also gets billions of dollars from Bill and Melinda Gates, who in 2007 made malaria elimination one of their goals.
(Mr. Gates met Mr.ÊTrumpÊin Manhattan last week, but a foundation spokeswoman declined to say what they discussed, other than ""innovation,"" which she said could include medical innovations like an AIDS vaccine, for example.)
Also uncontroversial are efforts to turn back pneumonia, diarrhea and the ""neglected diseases,"" many of which are caused by worms. But little foreign aid money is devoted to them, even though the first two kill many newborns and worm diseases make toddlers anemic and stunted.
Containing polio is somewhat controversial because it's so expensive. There are now only about 100 cases in the world each year, but the effort to eradicate it consumes $1 billion a year.
Much of that comes from private donors, including Rotary International and the Gates Foundation. Had the eradication drive never happened, it is estimated that polio would have crippled 16 million children by now.
Treatment of tuberculosis is politically touchier, because it often arrives in the United States with immigrants, whom Mr.ÊTrumpÊis famously hostile to.
Aware of that, some groups are shading their messages. For example, the C.D.C. built an exhibit about refugee health for a recent tropical medicine conference. Its overall tone was sympathetic; it included a heart-rending video of Syrian families screaming for help as their boats sank.
But the exhibit also featured a walk-through diagnostic clinic that emphasized how the C.D.C. keeps America safe by helpingÊUnited NationsÊagencies screen refugees for tuberculosis.
The most controversial disease is the one that gets the most money and attention: AIDS. Four global AIDS coordinators have come and gone in the last decades, liberal and conservative advocates for AIDS are constantly at one another's throats, and spending on AIDS was essentially flat during the Obama administration.
Some advocates, like Ms. Sippel, come from the gay-rights and abortion-rights movements. They fear that Mr. Pence will reinstateÊBush-era restrictions, some of which had recently been relaxed or overlooked.
They include bans on funding health clinics abroad that perform abortions, the requirement that funds be earmarked for teaching abstinence, and a requirement that all fund recipients pledge to oppose legalizing prostitution.
Advocates on the left argue that those provisions backfire: Abstinence lessons do not reduce H.I.V. infection rates, prenatal clinics overseas that offer abortions also serve H.I.V.-positive women who need help to avoid infecting their babies, and some of the most effective anti-AIDS organizations overseas are run by and for prostitutes.
Yet Mr. Pence has been known to change his mind based on scientific evidence. As Indiana governor, he strongly opposed clean needle swaps, even though they have been shown to reduce H.I.V. infections among drug users.
When needle sharing among addicts triggered a sudden AIDS outbreak in Indiana last year, however, Mr. Pence allowed needle swaps in the most-affected counties.
Funding decisions for H.I.V. prevention have long been mired in an ideological battle pitting condoms versus abstinence. But experts note that the conflict is fading: Neither condoms nor abstinence has stopped the AIDS epidemic among gay Americans or heterosexual Africans.
Now more emphasis is being placed on getting all the infected on treatment, which reduces infectiousness, and getting all the vulnerable on prophylactic drugs. In Africa, circumcision is also emphasized.
Some advocates hope that the large circle of military men consulted by Mr.ÊTrumpÊwill push him to spend more on health. Besides its historical interest in tropical diseases, the military maintains laboratories in Egypt, Indonesia, Peru and elsewhere that often act as an early warning system for epidemics.
""Department of DefenseÊand national security people know that no wall will keep disease out,"" said Amanda Glassman, director for global health security at the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank. ""They care about biosecurity, and about monitoring outbreaks and antibiotic resistance and things like that.""
Experts also note that regions where the United States spends the most on health -- Africa and Southeast Asia -- produce few Islamic State recruits or suicide bombers, and that ""sending foreign aid to countries that hate us,"" as Mr.ÊTrumpÊonce put it, actually worked pretty well in Germany and Japan after World War II.
America's image still shines in some parts of the world because of what the country has done for the poor. In Uganda, recipients of AIDS drugs sing a chorus: ""Thank you America, for saving my life.""

OPINION
TheÊClimateÊPath Ahead
By ANDREW C. REVKIN
At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro 23 years ago, the world's nations adopted a treaty that pledged, but ultimately failed, to cut the emissions driving global warming. In Paris over the last two weeks, negotiators from around the world met for the 21st time since then in an effort to move from aspiration to action.
As legions of bleary-eyed diplomats, environmentalists and lobbyists make their way home across the planet, you'll hear proclamations that COP 21, as the meeting was called, was a historic turning point, and a profound failure.
Both will be right, depending on the scale of reference.
For the first time, even before the opening gavel, more than 180 nations, large and small, submitted plans -- yes, voluntary ones -- to divert from their carbon-based business as usual. The United States and China guaranteed progress by stepping together a year ago in Beijing after more than a decade of ""you first"" fights, laying out detailed domestic plans to curb emissions.
The momentum created by such commitments spurred dozens of nations, joined by theÊWorld BankÊand other influential institutions, to pledge to cut subsidies for fossil fuels. Also, while poor nations see the amounts as insufficient, powerful countries, including China (which long hid behind its status as a developing country), have pledged money and technical aid to help shield the world's most vulnerable communities from climatic and coastal hazards.
And for the first time, 20 governments and a passel of billionaires led by Bill Gates announced plans to ramp up long-lagging investments in basic research and development on clean energy -- like advancing cheap, extensive battery storage to maximize the potential of solar power, safer nuclear plant designs and even technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
The need for a research boost was long played down by climate campaigners. They argued that the only missing factor had been the political will to move forward. But the scale and complexity of making a rapid shift from fossil fuels to clean energy will require much more than marches and votes.
After two decades of false starts and dead ends, including the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the task has become to work steadily at limiting the odds of worst-case outcomes rather than ""solving the climate crisis"" -- which was once the central meme of climate campaigners. Urgency is being melded with patience as we confront the journey ahead.
One reason for patience is that infrastructure and energy systems are slow to change. A 2013 report by the Bloomberg administration offered this data point, which underscores the reality of what we face: ""Energy use in buildings accounts for 75 percent of New York City's greenhouse gas emissions, and 80 percent of the buildings that will exist in 2050 are already here today.""
On the scale of the world's intertwined climate and energy challenges, the language emerging from Paris is grossly insufficient. Because heat-trapping carbon dioxide, emitted in the tens of billions of tons each year, can persist for centuries once released, the warming effect builds unless emissions are ultimately greatly reduced, not just slowed.
Nearly all of the Paris commitments on emissions are restricted to the period between 2020 and 2030, while cresting energy needs and populations in developing countries guarantee that more greenhouse gases will flow into the atmosphere in the decades beyond, unless nonpolluting energy technologies become far cheaper far faster.
In the end, despite diplomacy's implicit inadequacy, there is merit to the argument that Paris constitutes a momentous turning point. In sharp contrast to past ""seal the deal"" rhetoric and visions of some magical top-down accord, what is emerging is a process that will accommodate the scale of the challenge, not an outcome -- a rough guide to our climate future.
As President Obama put it on the first day of the Paris conference, the goal is ""an enduring framework for human progress, not a stopgap solution.""
Over the next few years, negotiators will continue to shape a rule book and timeline through which nations can, with increasing trust and ambition in years to come, share what they are doing to cut emissions given particular economic and geographic realities, conserve carbon-sopping forests and help the world's poorest places gain access to energy and boost resilience to the inevitable warming and coastal retreats already baked into the climate's trajectory.
With some colleagues, a young doctoral candidate at Yale, Kelly Levin, wrote a prescient paper in 2007 on the ""Super Wicked Problem of Climate Change"" that perfectly described the dizzying obstacles to action and why ""progressive incrementalism"" is actually the best path to success.
On Friday I asked Dr. Levin, now at theÊWorld Resources Institute, what needs to come next in this process.
""To ensure that it is indeed transformational,"" she said, ""decision makers will need to think how the policies we put in place today will lead to transformation over time -- making them hard to reverse, entrenching support over time and expanding the population they cover.""
What will drive leaders to act for the sake of future generations even when their constituents are largely focused on the near and now?
Pope Francis, acting in large part because of the climate treaty timeline, provided the answer in his encyclical on the environment and poverty and in speeches on ecology,Êequity, energy and climate. He has made it clear that the decisions ahead, while informed by data, will be shaped by values.
Francis was variously embraced and attacked for his critique of consumptive capitalism in his encyclical. But what was missed was his important call for accepting a diversity of approaches to addressing the climate problem.
""[T]here is no one path to a solution,"" Francis wrote. ""This makes a variety of proposals possible, all capable of entering into dialogue with a view to developing comprehensive solutions.""
That is precisely how the Paris outcome has been framed and how the world will, with urgency and patience, success and failure, forge ahead.

9 cities to live in if you're worried aboutÊclimateÊchange
By JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH
It's hard to imagine that any city in North America will escape the effects of climate change within the next 25 years.
But some will be better positioned than others to escape the brunt of ""drought, wildfire, extreme heat, extreme precipitation, extreme weather and hurricanes.""
Those were some of the climate change-related threats listed by Benjamin Strauss, who focuses on climate impacts at Climate Central, an independent nonprofit research collaboration of scientists and journalists.
Dr. Strauss, 44, identified cities where people could settle in the next two decades if they are aiming to avoid those threats.
""Cities are certainly all going to be livable over the next 25 years, but they'll be increasingly feeling the heat,"" Dr. Strauss said, adding that political action could help cities mitigate the effects of climate change.
I also spoke with David W. Titley, 58, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University, and Katharine Hayhoe, 44, a professor of political science atÊTexas TechÊUniversity who works with cities to build resilience to climate risks.
Just because a city isn't mentioned within this piece does not mean it is not a good bet. My advice: If you're looking for a place to live, pay attention to the qualities of the cities more than the specific locations.
All three emphasized that while certain cities were better bets, their safety was relative.
""I don't care if you found the safest place in the U.S.,"" Dr. Titley said. ""We're all going to pay, we're all going to suffer that economic disruption, we're all going to pay for that relocation.""
Portland, Me.
My gut feeling before I talked to the scientists was that landlocked cities would be safer than those on the coasts. But Dr. Strauss set me straight.
""I don't think that I would restrict myself to only landlocked cities,"" he said. ""There certainly are some coastal cities that are better positioned to weather rising seas than others.""
One, he said, is Portland, which is well situated in the north and has a hilly topography.
Dr. Titley agreed that Portland was a solid option.
""Portland is high enough that certainly for the next few centuries it not going to have significant sea-level rise,"" he said. ""In general, cities north of 40 degrees latitude are not going to have the same type of systemic drought issues as cities further to the south.""
A Midwestern trifecta: Detroit, Chicago and Madison, Wis.
Cities near the Great Lakes are reasonable options, all three scientists said.
""That region is probably one of the safest from a climate perspective,"" Dr. Strauss said.
""The Northeast and Midwest are going to have plenty of water, and they're not going to be subject to coastal flood issues,"" he said. ""The Great Lakes are very much an advantage as a water supply.""
He said that Midwestern cities would have to invest in more air-conditioning and would probably experience more extreme rainfall than other regions. But he said that they would not see the ""dangerous heat that we'll be seeing in the southwest and the southeast.""
But Dr. Hayhoe said that in the Midwestern cities, particularly Chicago, flooding will be a risk.
""We've seen a 45 percent increase in heavy precipitation events in the Midwest since the 1950s,"" she said.
San Francisco
Dr. Strauss was bullish on San Francisco and other cities along the northwest coast, saying that they would be insulated against ""miserable hot weather"" and wouldn't have much of a problem with sea level rise.
Dr. Titley said he was a ""little less sanguine about the West Coast as a place to 'escape climate change.""'
He said that San Francisco, which already struggles with economicÊinequality, would be far more welcoming to those in a better position financially.
""People with resources have more adaptive capability,"" he said. ""So the people with fewer resources are the ones that, unless we have a system to take care of them, are going to suffer disproportional impacts.""
""That is a very legitimate policy and political decision,"" he said, ""as opposed to the silliness of arguing whether climate change is happening.""
Boise, Idaho
Dr. Titley said Boise might be a safer bet than some of the West Coast cities.
But he also warned of wildfires in the Boise region, adding that the city itself was likely safer from that risk.
""If somebody pointed a gun at me and said, 'Boise or Denver, choose one on a climate-related basis,' I would choose Boise,"" he said. ""That would be pretty easy.""
Dr. Strauss agreed that from a climate perspective, Boise outranked Denver and other Southwestern cities like Tucson and Phoenix.
""The drought risk is lower, the heat risk is lower,"" he said.
Forest fires don't often affect large cities directly, but they do affect air quality, something that Dr. Strauss said was ""not to be understated as an issue.""
New York City
Perhaps the biggest surprise to me during my conversations with the scientists was their general enthusiasm for New York City. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Titley said the city seemed serious about evaluating the risks of climate change.
Dr. Strauss mentioned a comprehensive environmental program, PlaNYC, proposed byÊMayor Michael R. BloombergÊin 2007, and said that the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio had embraced that path.
""New York City has some landscape advantages and has some landscape challenges,"" he said. ""But it also has a lot of resources and is beginning to invest in preparing for higher seas. It has a long way to go, but it recognizes that and is beginning the journey. ""
Dr. Titley said the city would remain relatively safe from climate change except in the lowest-lying areas, like Lower Manhattan.
""I would argue that the governance in New York City has been more progressive than in many places on this issue,"" he said.
State College, Pa.
Dr. Titley recommended State College, which is home toÊPennsylvania State University. He said that the city's climate resistance was a consideration when he and his wife moved there three years ago.
""Our average temperatures, in the summertime, we'll get maybe a few days above 90 degrees,"" he said. ""Our winter times are mild compared to New York State and New England. We'll probably be O.K. with water.""
Toronto
Dr. Hayhoe said Toronto's developed infrastructure, financial system and public services were not likely to be affected by rising sea levels or water shortages.
And she made a final point about cities' vulnerability to climate change.
""Two-thirds of the world's biggest cities are within a few feet of sea level,"" she said. ""If sea level were rising a thousand years ago, when people lived in tents, then if you lived in Houston, New Orleans, New York, Mumbai or Shanghai, you'd pick up your tents and you'd move.
""Today we have seven and a half billion people living in an increasingly urbanized environment within reach of the sea level rise that will occur this century. That is one of the biggest reasons we care about a changing climate.""

Pope to ExploreÊClimate's Effect on World's Poor
By JIM YARDLEY; Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting from Buenos Aires, Gaia Pianigiani from Vatican City, and Laurie Goodstein from New York.
VATICAN CITY --ÊBan Ki-moonÊarrived at the Vatican with his own college of cardinals. Mr. Ban, theÊUnited NationsÊsecretary general, had brought the leaders of all his major agencies to see Pope Francis, a show of organizational muscle and respect for a meeting between two global institutions that had sometimes shared a bumpy past but now had a mutual interest.
The agenda was poverty, and Francis inveighed against the ""economy of exclusion"" as he addressed Mr. Ban's delegation at the Apostolic Palace. But in an informal meeting with Mr. Ban and his advisers, Francis shifted the discussion to the environment and how environmental degradation weighed heaviest on the poor.
""This is the pope of the poor,"" said Robert Orr, who attended the May 2014 meeting as Mr. Ban's special adviser on climate change and described the informal conversation with Francis. ""The fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant.""
On Thursday, Francis will release his first major teaching letter, known as an encyclical, on the theme of the environment and the poor. Given the pope's widespread popularity, and his penchant for speaking out on major global issues, the encyclical is being treated as a milestone that could place theÊRoman Catholic ChurchÊat the forefront of a new coalition of religion and science.
Francis, the first pope from the developing world, clearly wants the document to have an impact: Its release comes during a year with three major international policy meetings, most notably aÊUnited NationsÊclimate change conference in Paris in December. This month, the Vatican sent notifications to bishops around the world with instructions for spreading the pope's environmental message to the more than one billion Catholics worldwide.
By wading into the environment debate, Francis is seeking to redefine a secular topic, one usually framed by scientific data, using theology and faith. And based on Francis' prior comments, and those of influential cardinals, the encyclical is also likely to include an economic critique of how global capitalism, while helping lift millions out of poverty, has also exploited nature and created vast inequities.
""We clearly need a fundamental change of course, to protect the earth and its people -- which in turn will allow us to dignify humanity,"" Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana, who oversaw the drafting of the encyclical, said at a conference on climate change this spring at the Vatican.
Vatican officials say that the encyclical is a theological document, not a political one, and have refused to divulge the contents. But there is already much speculation about how Francis will comment on humans' role in causing climate change, a link he has spoken about in the past. The Vatican's scientific academy recently attributed climate change to ""unsustainable consumption"" and called it ""a dominant moral and ethical issue for society.""
This stance has rankled some conservative Catholics, as well as climate change skeptics, who have suggested that Francis is being misled by scientists and that he could veer into contentious subjects like population control. Others have argued that papal infallibility does not apply to matters of science. In April, a group of self-described climate skeptics, led by the Heartland Institute, a libertarian group, came to Rome to protest.
""The Vatican and the pope should be arguing that fossil fuels are the moral choice for the developing world,"" said Marc Morano, who runs the website Climate Depot and once worked as an aide to Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican and climate change skeptic.
Bishop Marcelo Snchez Sorondo of Argentina, who is also chancellor of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, has sharply rebutted the criticism and postulated that many of the attacks have been underwritten by oil companies or influenced by conservative American interests, including the Tea Party. ""This is a ridiculous thing, completely,"" Bishop Sorondo said in an interview at the Vatican.
The first clue of the pope's interest in the environment came when he chose his name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, the 13th century friar who dedicated himself to the poor and is considered the patron saint of animals and the environment. Francis had shown interest from his days in Argentina, when he was CardinalÊJorge Mario Bergoglio, the archbishop of Buenos Aires.
There, he played a major role in convening different leaders to seek solutions for Argentina's social ills. Francesca Ambrogetti, who co-wrote a biography of Francis, said he pushed for scientists at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina to investigate the impact of environmental issues on humanity. As far back as September 2004, Cardinal Bergoglio cited the ""destruction of the environment"" as contributing toÊinequalityÊand the need for social reforms. At a 2007 meeting of Latin American bishops in Aparecida, Brazil, he oversaw the drafting of a broad mission statement that included an emphasis on the environment.
Pablo Canziani, an atmospheric physicist who researches climate change, said Francis, who had once trained as a chemist, became very interested in the links between environmental destruction and social ills, including a dispute over paper pulp mills on the border with Uruguay, which Argentina claimed were polluting local drinking water.
The pope, Professor Canziani added, has stayed in touch. Last year, the Vatican invited professors at his university to contribute ideas for the encyclical. He said they sent a memo focused on legal issues, sustainability, civic responsibility and governance.
""I'm pretty certain Francis will be requesting a change in the paradigms of development,"" he said. ""The encyclical will focus on why we're suffering environmental degradation, then focus on links to social issues.""
The final document seems certain to bear the fingerprints of scientists and theologians from around the world. The Rev. Sean McDonagh, an Irish priest who has worked on environmental issues and climate change for decades, said that Cardinal Turkson contacted him more than a year ago and asked if he would write a comprehensive document about the theological and ethical aspects of environmental issues.
Father McDonagh said he had spent two or three months writing about climate change, biodiversity, oceans, sustainable food ""and a section at the end on hope."" Then he sent it to the Vatican. ""At the time, they didn't say there would be an encyclical,"" he recalled, adding that he was eager to see it.
The hoopla over Francis' encyclical confounds some Vatican experts, who note that both of Francis' predecessors,ÊPope John Paul IIÊandÊPope Benedict XVI, wrote about the role of industrial pollution in destroying the environment. Benedict was called the ""green pope"" after he initiated projects to make the Vatican carbon-neutral. Other religious groups, including evangelical Christians, have spoken about the impact of environmental destruction on the poor.
But many analysts argue that Francis has a singular status, partly because of his global popularity. And in placing the issue at the center of an encyclical, especially at a moment when sustainable development is atop the international agenda, Francis is placing the Catholic Church -- and the morality of economic development -- at the center of the debate. In January, while traveling to the Philippines, Francis told reporters accompanying him that he was convinced that global warming was ""mostly"" a human-made phenomenon.
""It is man who has slapped nature in the face,"" he said, adding: ""I think we have exploited nature too much.""
Francis will travel in July to South America, and in September to Cuba and the United States, where he will speak about his encyclical at theÊUnited Nations.
""He is certainly going on the road,"" said the Rev. Michael Czerny, a Jesuit priest who works under Cardinal Turkson and has been involved in drafting the encyclical. ""This is certainly an agenda-setting document.""
Helen Clark, administrator of theÊUnited NationsÊDevelopment Program, said Francis had an ""emerging agenda"" on social issues and seemed determined ""to make his period in office one related to the great concerns affecting humanity."" She added: ""He is a man in a hurry.""
Ms. Clark and other development officials can tick off myriad ways that the global poor bear the brunt of environmental damage and changing weather patterns, whether they are African farmers whose crops are destroyed by drought or South Asian farmers threatened by rising sea levels. In this context, Vatican officials say, Francis is likely to see moral injustice.
""Rich people are more prepared,"" said Bishop Sorondo, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. ""Poor people are not prepared and have suffered the consequences.""
The May 2014 meeting at the Vatican between Francis and theÊUnited NationsÊdelegation came at a propitious moment. The Vatican had just held a major symposium that brought together scientists, theologians, economists and others to discuss climate change and the social impact of environmental damage.
Partha Dasgupta, a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences who helped organize the symposium, said many scientists -- having dedicated their careers to raising awareness and trying to influence policy -- were perplexed at the seeming lack of broad political response. Mr. Dasgupta, an agnostic, said he hoped that Francis could capture public attention by speaking in the language of faith.
""The pope has moral authority,"" said Mr. Dasgupta, a prominent expert on development economics and climate change. ""It could change the game in a fundamental way.""

ClimateÊChange and Responsibility
By BARTHOLOMEW and JUSTIN WELBY
On Tuesday, the British medical journal The Lancet will publish a landmark report highlighting the inalienable and undeniable link between climate change and human health. We warmly welcome the report's message of hope, which confirms the fact that climate change is more than just a technical or financial challenge (as Pope Francis did in his encyclical letter on June 18) and confirms the voice of health in the discussion on climate change. Indeed, the central premise of the Lancet commission's work is that tackling climate change could be the single greatest health opportunity of the 21st century.
It is no surprise that climate change has the potential to set back global health. The greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet come from industrial activity that pollutes our air and water, and the temperature changes may lead to drought that brings malnutrition. Those with little or no access to health care -- children and the elderly in particular -- are more vulnerable to such predicaments.
However, health is symptomatic of a larger problem, which undermines and fragments our broader worldview. In addition to highlighting the effects of climate change, we must address the root of the problem. In so doing, we will discover how the benefits of assuming moral responsibility and taking immediate action -- not just on matters related to health, but also world economy and global policy -- far outweigh the cost of remaining indifferent and passive.
It is this vital link that The Lancet's report conclusively and authoritatively demonstrates. In short, it proves that our response to climate change -- both in terms of mitigation and adaptation -- will reduce human suffering, while preserving the diversity and beauty of God's creation for our children. God's generous and plentiful creation, which we so often take for granted, is a gift to all living creatures and all living things. We must, therefore, ensure that the resources of our planet are -- and continue to be -- enough for all to live abundant lives.
The report could not appear at a more significant and sensitive time in history. This year, as all eyes look ahead to the Paris climate negotiations and as governments prepare to sign a universal commitment to limit global temperature rises, we have reached a critical turning point. We are -- as never before -- in a position to choose charity over greed and frugality over wastefulness in order to affirm our moral commitment to our neighbor and our respect for the Earth. Basic human rights -- such as access to safe water, clean air and sufficient food -- should be available to everyone without distinction or discrimination.
Because of our faith in God as creator, redeemer and sustainer, we have a mission to protect nature as well as human beings. The obligation of all human beings is to work together for a better world, one in which all human beings can flourish; our Christian vocation is to proclaim the Gospel inclusively and comprehensively.
To this purpose, as early as the mid-1980s, when the faith-based environmental movement that has come to be known as creation care was neither political nor fashionable, the Ecumenical Patriarchate initiated pioneering environmental initiatives. In 1989, it established a day of prayer for the protection of the natural environment and, from 1991 to this day, instigated a series of symposia and summits on an international, interfaith and interdisciplinary basis. Its ecumenical and ecological vision has been embraced in parishes and communities throughout the world.
In 1984, the Anglican Consultative Council adopted the Five Marks of Mission, the fifth of which is: ""To strive to safeguard the integrity of creation, and sustain and renew the life of the earth."" In 2006, theÊChurch of EnglandÊstarted a national environmental campaign, Shrinking the Footprint, to enable the whole church to address -- in faith, practice and mission -- the issue of climate change. In 2015, a clear direction has been set for theÊChurch of England's national investing bodies in support of the transition to a low-carbon economy that brings its investments into line with the church's witness.
As representatives of two major Christian communions, we appeal to the world's governments to act decisively and conscientiously by signing an ambitious and hopeful agreement in Paris during theÊUnited Nations' climate conference, COP 21, at the end of this year. We hope and pray that this covenant will contain a clear and convincing long-term goal that will chart the course of decarbonization in the coming years. Only in this way can we reduce theÊinequalityÊthat flows directly from climate injustice within and between countries.
The Lancet report is further proof that all of us must act with generosity and compassion toward our fellow human beings by acting on climate change now. This is a shared moral responsibility and urgent requirement. Civil society, governmental authorities and religious leaders have an opportunity to make a difference in a way that bridges our diverse opinions and nationalities.

A Group Shout onÊClimateÊChange
By THE EDITORIAL BOARD
The marchers and mayors, the ministers and presidents, have come and gone. So what is the verdict on Climate Week, the summit meeting on global warming convened by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, in New York?
The meeting was not intended to reach a global agreement or to extract tangible commitments from individual nations to reduce the greenhouse gases that are changing the world's ecosystems and could well spin out of control. Its purpose was to build momentum for a new global deal to be completed in December 2015, in Paris.
In that respect, it clearly moved the ball forward, not so much in the official speeches but on the streets and in the meeting rooms where corporate leaders, investors, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and state and local officials pressed the case for stronger action.
It was important to put climate change back on the radar screen of world leaders, whose last effort to strike a deal, in Copenhagen five years ago, ended in acrimonious disaster. President Obama, for one, was as eloquent as he has ever been on the subject: ""For all the immediate challenges that we gather to address this week -- terrorism, instability,Êinequality, disease -- there's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other, and that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate.""
But most of the positive energy at this gathering came from people closer to the ground, like the 300,000 activists who marched last Sunday. They included mayors like New York's Michael Bloomberg and his successor, Bill de Blasio, who both spoke of the critical role that cities can play in reducing emissions. They included governors like California's Jerry Brown, who is justly proud of his state's pathbreaking efforts to control automobile and power plant pollution. And they included institutions like Bank of America, which said it would invest in renewable energy, and companies like Kellogg and Nestle, which pledged to help stem the destruction of tropical forests by changing the way they buy commodities like soybeans and palm oil.
Underlying all these declarations was a palpable conviction that tackling climate change could be an opportunity and not a burden, that the way to approach the task of harnessing greenhouse gas emissions was not to ask how much it would cost but how much nations stood to gain by investing in new technologies and energy efficiency.
This burst of activity comes at a crucial time. A tracking initiative called the Global Carbon Project recently reported that greenhouse gas emissions jumped 2.3 percent in 2013, mainly because of big increases in China and India. This means it is becoming increasingly difficult to limit global warming to an upper boundary of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. Beyond that point, scientists say, a world already suffering from disappearing glaciers, rising seas and persistent droughts could face even more alarming consequences.
Avoiding such a fate is going to require a revolution in the way the world produces and consumes energy, which clearly has to involve national governments, no matter how much commitment there is on the streets and in the boardrooms. The odds are long that a legally binding treaty will emerge from Paris. Congress is unlikely to ratify one anyway. The smart money now is on a softer agreement that brings all the big polluters on board with national emissions caps, and there are reasons for hope that this can be done.
Mr. Obama is in a much stronger leadership position than he was at Copenhagen, having engineered a huge increase in automobile fuel efficiency and proposed rules that will greatly reduce the United States' reliance on dirty coal. The Chinese, in part because their own air is so dirty, have been investing heavily in alternative energy sources like wind and solar, and they are giving serious consideration to a national cap on coal consumption. The cooperation of these two countries could by itself create the conditions for a breakthrough agreement. But what might really do the trick -- if Climate Week is any guide -- is the emergence of a growing bottom-up movement for change.

Draft of Pope'sÊClimateÊEncyclical Calls for Action
By JIM YARDLEY; Laurie Goodstein contributed reporting from New York.
ROME -- Pope Francis offers a broad vision of an endangered planet, partly blaming human activity and fossil fuels for climate change while calling for people of all religions to take swift action, according to a leaked draft of his much-awaited environmental encyclical that was posted online Monday by an Italian magazine.
The unauthorized release of the 192-page draft, published by L'Espresso, angered officials at the Vatican, who warned that the document did not represent the final version of Francis' encyclical, which remains embargoed from publication until Thursday.
In the leaked document, Francis often writes eloquently, citing scientific evidence about the human role in global warming. He repeats some of his familiar themes in calling on people to move away from a consumerist model that he says is depleting resources, to the detriment of the poor, and live simpler lives. He also calls on governments to work together for solutions at the global, national and local level -- while at times focusing on specifics, like his opposition to carbon credits.
""In this encyclical,"" he writes, ""I intend especially to engage in a dialogue with everyone about our common home.""
Encyclicals, papal teaching letters to the Roman Catholic faithful, often fail to generate much outside attention. But Francis' pronouncement on the environment and the poor has been eagerly awaited, especially by scientists and environmentalists, as a major event.
Seizing on the global interest, the Vatican prepared a careful rollout of the encyclical, which is titled ""Laudato Sii,"" or ""Be Praised."" Bishops around the world have been sent instructions on how to spread the pope's message to the world's more than one billion Catholics.
Journalists accredited with the Vatican are supposed to receive official copies on Thursday morning so they can review the contents before the embargo is lifted at midday, after a news conference.
It was unclear how similar, or not, the final, official document will be to the leaked draft -- or at what stage of the process the draft was written. The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, released a short statement calling on the embargo to be respected, adding, ""Please note that it is not the final text.""
The drafting process has taken more than a year, as Vatican officials elicited contributions from priests, theologians, scientists, economists and others from around the world. In the interim, Francis has spoken about the need to protect ""creation.""
Speaking to reporters in January, Francis described global warming as ""mostly"" a human-made phenomenon and said that ""man has slapped nature in the face.""
Environmentalists have wondered how Francis would address humans' role in climate change, a point contested by many climate skeptics and some conservative Catholics. In one section, Francis writes: ""Numerous scientific studies indicate that most of the global warming of the past decades is due to the concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxide and others), emitted especially because of human activities.""
He adds that the problem is compounded ""by the development model based on the intensive use of fossil fuels that is at the core of the global energy model.""
In the draft, Francis begins with a hymn, ""Canticle of the Creatures,"" written by the man whose name he took, St. Francis of Assisi, the 13th-century friar who dedicated his life to the poor and who is the patron saint of the environment.
The document is then divided into six chapters, with the first titled ""What Is Happening in Our House?"" It deals with a wide variety of issues, including climate change, pollution, water rights, the loss of biodiversity and globalÊinequality.
In other chapters, Francis writes about the ""wisdom of biblical accounts"" (in a chapter titled the ""Gospel of Creation"") and pointedly disputes the idea that population control and contraception are solutions to the planet's limited resources.
In the third chapter, ""The Human Root of the Ecological Crisis,"" Francis explores how technology has changed the world, often in positive ways, but also has contributed to exploitation of the environment.
""An economic and technological development that does not leave the world a better place and with an integral superior quality of life cannot be considered progress,"" he writes in the fifth chapter.
Many analysts have expected the encyclical to double as an economic critique. In the draft, Francis describes the maximization of profit as a ""conceptual distortion of the economy"" that fails to consider the long-term damage to the environment. He also describes the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2007-8 as a missed opportunity ""to develop a new economy, more careful to ethical principles, and for a new regulation of speculative financial activities and virtual wealth.""
He also calls for assertive government action, as well as better cooperation between governments, while saying progress has been too slow in addressing climate change. He notes that poorer countries will need help in confronting the challenge.
""With regard to climate change, progress has been deplorably scarce,"" he says. ""The reduction of greenhouse gases requires honesty, courage and responsibility, especially by the most powerful and the most polluting countries.""
Massimo Faggioli, an associate professor of theology and the director of the Institute for Catholicism and Citizenship at the University of St. Thomas, a Catholic college in St. Paul, Minn., said Francis ""has always been very consistent that there is a role for citizens, but there is also a role for government in solving problems, and even for global governance.""
He added, ""This will be particularly difficult for American Catholics,"" referring to those Catholics who believe that the church teaches against relying on governments to solve social problems.

Pope Offers Radical Vision to AddressÊClimateÊChange
By JIM YARDLEY and LAURIE GOODSTEIN; Jim Yardley reported from Vatican City, and Laurie Goodstein from New York. Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome, Coral Davenport from Washington, and Justin Gillis from New York.
VATICAN CITY -- Pope Francis on Thursday called for a radical transformation of politics, economics and individual lifestyles to confront environmental degradation and climate change, blending a biting critique of consumerism and irresponsible development with a plea for swift and unified global action.
The vision that Francis outlined in a 184-page papal encyclical is sweeping in ambition and scope: He describes relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment and says apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness are to blame.
The most vulnerable victims, he declares, are the world's poorest people, who are being dislocated and disregarded.
Francis, the first pope from the developing world, used the encyclical -- titled ""Laudato Si',"" or ""Praise Be to You"" -- to highlight the crisis posed by climate change. He places most of the blame on fossil fuels and human activity, while warning of an ""unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us"" if corrective action is not taken swiftly. Developed, industrialized countries were mostly responsible, he says, and are obligated to help poorer nations confront the crisis.
""Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods,"" he writes. ""It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day.""
The Vatican released the encyclical at noon on Thursday, three days after an Italian magazine posted a leaked draft online, to the fury of Vatican officials. The breach led to speculation that opponents of Francis in the Vatican wanted to embarrass him by undermining the release.
Even so, religious figures, environmentalists, scientists, executives and elected officials around the world awaited the official release, and scheduled news conferences or issued statements afterward. News media interest was enormous, in part because of Francis' global popularity, but also because of the intriguing coalition he is proposing between faith and science.
""Humanity is faced with a crucial challenge that requires the development of adequate policies, which, moreover, are currently being discussed on the global agenda,"" Cardinal Peter Turkson said at a news conference at the Vatican. ""Certainly, 'Laudato Si' ' can and must have an impact on important and urgent decisions to be made in this area.""
Francis has made it clear that he hopes the encyclical will influence energy and economic policy and stir a global movement. He calls on ordinary people to press politicians for change. Catholic bishops and priests around the world are expected to discuss the encyclical in services on Sunday. But Francis is also reaching for a wider audience, asking in the document ""to address every person living on this planet.""
Even before the encyclical, the pope's stance against environmental destruction and his demand for global action had already thrilled many scientists. Advocates of policies to combat climate change have said they hoped that Francis could lend a ""moral dimension"" to the debate.
""Within the scientific community, there is almost a code of honor that you will never transgress the red line between pure analysis and moral issues,"" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founder and chairman of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""But we are now in a situation where we have to think about the consequences of our insight for society.""
Francis has been sharply criticized by those who question or deny the established science of human-caused climate change, and also by some conservative Roman Catholics, who see the encyclical as an attack on capitalism and as political meddling.
Governments are now developing domestic climate-change plans to prepare for a United Nations summit meeting on the issue in Paris in December. The meeting's goal is to achieve a sweeping accord in which every nation would commit to new policies to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. Many governments have yet to present plans, including major emitters like Brazil, which has a large Catholic population. The encyclical is seen as an unsubtle nudge for action.
""It gives a lot of cover to political and economic leaders in those countries, as they make decisions on climate change policy,"" said Timothy Wirth, vice chairman of the United Nations Foundation.
Catholic theologians say the overarching theme of the encyclical is ""integral ecology,"" which links care for the environment with a notion already well developed in Catholic teaching: that economic development, to be morally good and just, must take into account people's need for things like freedom, education and meaningful work.
""The basic idea is, in order to love God, you have to love your fellow human beings, and you have to love and care for the rest of creation,"" said Vincent Miller, who holds a chair in Catholic theology and culture at the University of Dayton, a Catholic college in Ohio. ""It gives Francis a very traditional basis to argue for the inclusion of environmental concern at the center of Christian faith.""
He added: ""Critics will say the church can't teach policy, the church can't teach politics. And Francis is saying, 'No, these things are at the core of the church's teaching.' ""
Francis tapped a wide variety of sources in his encyclical, partly to underscore the universality of his message. He cites passages from his two papal predecessors,ÊJohn Paul IIÊandÊBenedict XVI, and draws prominently from a religious ally, Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church. He also cites a ninth-century Sufi mystic, Ali al-Khawas.
The pope begins the encyclical with a hymn by St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals and the environment. He used the Book of Genesis to underpin his theological argument. But in a passage certain to rankle some Christians, he chastises those who cite Genesis as evidence that man has ""dominion"" over the earth that justifies practices like mountaintop mining or fishing with gill nets.
""This is not a correct interpretation of the Bible as understood by the Church,"" Francis writes. The Bible teaches human beings to ""till and keep"" the garden of the world, he says. "" 'Tilling' refers to cultivating, plowing or working, while 'keeping' means caring, protecting, overseeing and preserving.""
His most stinging rebuke is a broad critique of profit-seeking and the undue influence of technology on society. He praises achievements in medicine, science and engineering, but says that ""our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience.""
Central to Francis' theme is the link between poverty and the planet's fragility. The pope rejects the belief that technology and ""current economics"" will solve environmental problems, or ""that the problems of global hunger and poverty will be resolved simply by market growth.""
""A huge indictment I see in this encyclical is that people have lost their sense of ultimate and proper goals of technology and economics,"" said Christiana Z. Peppard, an assistant professor of theology, science and ethics atÊFordham UniversityÊin New York. ""We are focused on short-term, consumerist patterns.""
Encyclicals are letters to the clergy and laity of the church that are considered authoritative. Catholics are expected to try to sincerely embrace their teachings. But more specific assertions in them can be categorized as ""prudential judgments,"" a phrase that some critics have invoked to reject Francis' positions on issues like climate change or economicÊinequality.
Many conservatives will be pleased with the encyclical's strong criticism of abortion, and its dismissal of arguments that population control can be an answer to poverty. However, Francis sharply criticizes the trading of carbon credits -- a market-based system central to theÊEuropean Union's climate policy -- and says it ""may simply become a ploy which permits maintaining the excessive consumption of some countries and sectors.""
Above all, Francis frames the encyclical as a call to action. He praises young people for being ready for change, and said ""enforceable international agreements are urgently needed."" He cites Benedict in saying that advanced societies ""must be prepared to encourage more sober lifestyles, while reducing their energy consumption and improving its efficiency.""
""All is not lost,"" he writes. ""Human beings, while capable of the worst, are also capable of rising above themselves, choosing again what is good, and making a new start.""

Green thinking: what’s the meaning of sustainability? CREDIT: ALAMY
15 DECEMBER 2016 • 1:30PM
Nicholas Newman
Sustainability is not a dirty word; being in business in 100 years’ time is what being sustainable really means.

Nowadays it is good PR to run a sustainable business. Nevertheless, sustainability is much more than the continued pursuance of a green agenda. Rather, it is the ability of a business to thrive continuously in a fast-changing, competitive environment.

David Lewis, managing director at the energy management company Matrix, an E.ON business, says: “Sustainability is about operating a good business. That means it targets reduction in operating costs that have benefits to the bottom line. Those reductions should benefit and enhance shareholder value and they should be reinvested in the business to help its top-line growth”.

It’s an approach that applies across the business, whether it is in reducing costs in operations, sourcing raw materials or energy supply.

Nearly half of senior business leaders do not know how much their business spends on energy
A prerequisite for a sustainable business is to use energy suppliers who are trusted partners, with consistent costs and quality in their delivery. As a result, access to energy-efficient technology, developing a greater understanding of the costs of energy and how to reduce them, and dialogue with an energy supplier about unit prices in the short and long term help businesses equip themselves against the potential risks of changing energy costs in an unstable market.

Innovation doesn’t stop

“Introducing innovation in the business and seeking competitive advantage is the key to real sustainability, but this comes with many challenges,” says Mr Lewis. Developing anything new almost always incurs costs, even if it promises savings in the future. As a result, any innovation that offers upfront savings is a real bonus.

Research by the Telegraph and YouGov on behalf of E.ON has shown that nearly half of senior business leaders do not know how much their business spends on energy.

As a result, many are unaware how much they could be overpaying because of outdated, inefficient equipment or a poor understanding of energy-efficient practices that could save their businesses thousands of pounds and dramatically reduce their exposure to the risks of energy price rises.

Understanding energy

One easy route to finding sustainable energy solutions is through a self-financing energy performance contract (EPC). This is a partnership between a third-party provider of funding and a customer and is designed to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and facilities.

The benefit of an EPC is that the contract guarantees the energy-conservation measures it implements will generate sufficient savings to pay for any changes identified and adopted during the partnership. Moreover, any savings from new policies and technology will continue to benefit the customer, whether the EPC is continued or not.

A prerequisite for a sustainable business is to use energy suppliers who are trusted partners
Another, more heavyweight option for customers seeking to save energy, reduce costs and lower their carbon emissions is to install on-site renewable microgeneration technologies. These might include solar, heat pumps and combined heat and power (CHP) plants, which can be far more efficient and flexible than simply buying energy from the grid.

These approaches are not restricted to traditionally energy-intensive industries such as manufacturing or agriculture. Indeed, they could apply whatever business you are in. An increasingly important source of demand for energy stems from the continuing expansion and expected growth in IT capacity, says Mr Lewis.

A typical solution to satisfy the demands of increased IT capacity is just to invest in more of the same. “However, a more sustainable solution would be to take the opportunity to work with an expert on cooling systems, building control or power supply to optimise and upgrade the existing infrastructure,” he says.

Whether you are buying in new IT, energy or anything else, a good relationship with a supplier is one that has your business’s long-term interests in mind. “A sustainable supplier who is well managed and producing services efficiently is, as a natural consequence, usually a more beneficial supplier,” Mr Lewis says.

The Arctic apocalypse that failed to arrive
Cambridge scientist accused of 'crying wolf ' onÊclimateÊchange with claim that sea ice would vanish
Sarah Knapton SCIENCE EDITOR
DIRE predictions that the Arctic would be free of sea ice by September have proved unfounded after satellite images showed there is far more ice now than in 2012.
Scientists including Prof Peter Wadhams, ofÊCambridge University, and Prof Wieslaw Maslowski, of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, have regularly forecast the loss of ice by 2016, a warning that has been widely reported by theÊBBCÊand other media outlets.
Prof Wadhams, who is considered a leading expert on Arctic sea ice loss, has recently published a book entitled A Farewell To Ice in which he repeated the assertion that the Arctic would be free of ice in the middle of this decade.
As late as this summer he was still predicting an ice-free September.
Yet when figures were released for the yearly minimum on Sept 10, they showed that there was still 1.6 million square miles of sea ice (4.14 million sq km), which was 21 per cent more than the lowest point in 2012.
For the month of September overall there was 31 per cent more ice than in 2012, figures released this week by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) show, amounting to an extra 421,000 square miles (1.09 million sq km) of sea ice.
Although NSIDC satellite data going back to 1981 show an undeniable downward trend in sea ice over the past 35 years, scientists have accused Prof Wadhams and others of ""crying wolf "" and harming the message ofÊclimateÊchange through ""dramatic"", ""incorrect"" and ""confusing"" predictions.
Dr Ed Hawkins, associate professor in the department of meteorology at the University of Reading, said: ""There has been one prominent scientist who has regularly made more dramatic, and incorrect, in my view predictions suggesting that we would by now be in icefree conditions.
""There are very serious risks from continued climatic changes and a melting Arctic but we do not serve the public and policy-makers well by exaggerating those risks.
""We will soon see an ice-free summer in the Arctic but there is a real danger of 'crying wolf ' and that does not help anyone.
""As global temperatures rise we will see a continuing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, although this will happen somewhat erratically, rather like a ball bouncing down a bumpy hill.
""Without substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the ball will reach the bottom of the hill, meaning the Arctic is 'ice-free', starting with a few days one summer, a few weeks another summer and gradually becoming more and more frequent.""
It is the latest example of experts making alarming predictions which do not come to pass. Earlier this week environmentalists were accused of misleading the public about the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" after aerial shots proved there was no ""island of rubbish"" in the middle of the ocean.
Likewise, warnings that the hole in the ozone layer would never close were debunked in June.
Scientists said that such claims risked detracting from the real issue.
Losing Arctic sea ice is a major problem because ice reflects 85 per cent of sunlight while open water reflects just seven per cent, meaning the rest is absorbed by the planet, which speeds up global warming. A massive melt of freshwater could also disrupt global ocean currents, and change weather systems.
For more than a decade most scientists have accepted that the Arctic will be free of ice by 2050, while theÊIntergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChangeÊ(IPCC) calculates there is a 66 per cent chance of no ice by the middle of the century if emissions continue to increase annually.
Yet in 2007 Prof Wadhams predicted that sea ice would be lost by 2013 after levels fell 27 per cent in a single year.
By 2013 ice levels were actually 25 per cent higher than they had been six years before. In 2012, following another record low Prof Wadhams changed his prediction to 2016.
The view was supported by Prof Maslowski who in 2013 published a paper in the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences also claiming that the Arctic would be ice-free by 2016, plus or minus three years.
Instead of record lows, this year the Arctic has seen the quickest refreeze on record with the extent of sea ice growing 405,000 square miles (1.05 million sq km) in just three weeks since the Sept 10 minimum. The Danish Meteorological Institute said that refreezing was happening at the fastest rate since its daily records began in 1987.
Andrew Shepherd, professor of earth observation atÊUniversity College London, said that there was now ""overwhelming consensus"" that the Arctic would be free of ice within the next few decades, but warned that earlier predictions were based on poor extrapolation.
""A decade or so ago,ÊclimateÊmodels often failed to reproduce the decline in Arctic sea ice extent revealed by satellite observations,"" he said.
""One upshot of this was that outlier predictions based on extrapolation alone were able to receive wide publicity. ButÊclimateÊmodels have improved considerably since then, and they now do a much better job of simulating historical events.
""This means we have greater confidence in their predictive skill, and the overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that the Arctic Ocean will be effectively free of sea ice in a couple of decades should the present rate of decline continue.""
Prof Myles Allen, ofÊOxford University, added: ""The Arctic was only predicted to be close to ice-free in September by mid-century.""
Scientists said it was clear that sea ice was shrinking but there were large fluctuations between years. For example 2013 showed a 50 per cent increase from the previous year.
Prof Jonathan Bamber, of theÊUniversity of Bristol, said: ""This year's low was the second lowest on record and not as low as 2012 but there is always variability in any part of theÊclimateÊsystem so you would not expect a monotonic decline year on year, whatever was going on.
""The signal of Arctic sea ice decline is possibly the clearest we have ofÊclimateÊchange. That does not mean, by definition, it is manmade but there is no question that sea ice volume has been declining, on average, over the past 40 years and that all the indications fromÊclimateÊdata, satellite observations etc. are that the decline will continue.""
Bob Ward, of the Grantham Institute onÊClimateÊChange and the Environment, added: ""Peter Wadhams has made predictions of the imminent disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice, which have not been fulfilled, but the evidence still shows a rapid decline.
""The trend in Arctic sea ice extent is definitely downwards for every single month of the year. The most recentÊIPCCÊforecast is that the Arctic has up to a 66 per cent chance of being icefree in September by 2050 for the highest emissions scenario.""
Speaking to TheÊDaily Telegraph, Prof Wadhams accepted that sea ice decline had not happened as quickly as he had predicted. However, he still believes that an ice-free Arctic is still only a ""very small number of years"" away.
""My view is that the trend of summer sea ice volume is relentlessly downward, such that the volume (and thus area) will come to a low value very soon - in a very small number of years,"" he said. ""This is to be contrasted with some of the bizarre predictions made by computer modellers, who have the summer sea ice remaining until late this century, which is quite impossible.""
'There are serious risks, but we do not serve the public and policymakers by exaggerating those risks'
'Consensus among scientists is that the Arctic will be free of sea ice within a couple of decades'

Australia attacks Obama climate speech
World Bulletin

The Australian government has launched an attack on Barack Obama over the president's concerns about the future of the Great Barrier Reef. Julie Bishop, the Australian foreign minister, said she had ""an issue"" with Mr Obama over a speech he gave in Brisbane last weekend in which he said that climate change threatened ""the incredible natural glory"" of the reef.

The speech was seen as a rebuke for Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, a climate change sceptic who has reversed the nation's efforts to address global warming, including repealing Labour's tax on carbon emissions and scaling back renewable energy targets."

Nobel Prize winner charged with sex assault
By Andrew Marszal in New Delhi
EIGHT years ago, he stood alongside former US vice-presidentÊAl GoreÊon an Oslo balcony, waving to the adoring crowds who had come to see him collect a Nobel Peace Prize.
Yesterday, Rajendra Pachauri, the former head of the UNÊclimateÊchange panel, was charged with the sexual assault of a female employee less than half his age at an environmental think-tank.
Pachauri, 75, who as chairman of the influentialÊIntergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChangeÊ(IPCC) once advised world leaders on how to tackle global warming, is also charged with criminal intimidation, harassment and ""insulting the modesty of a woman"".
The charge sheet includes the names of 23 prosecution witnesses including former colleagues who are ready to testify against him. The sexual harassment claims, all denied by Mr Pachauri, came to light in February last year, when a 29-year-old research assistant filed a police complaint accusing him of sending her inappropriate texts and emails. Amid a police inquiry, he resigned as chairman of theÊIPCC, citing health reasons. In July, he was relieved of his leadership of The Energy and Resources Institute, the Delhi think tank where the harassment claims originated. A second woman also alleges she was subject to his sexual advances.
Mr Pachauri claims lewd messages received by the first woman followed his email and phone being hacked.

Look on bright side ofÊclimateÊchange
UN scientist says that by staying positive about the future, the most intelligent students will be attracted to finding a solution to save the world
By Emily Gosden
DOOM and gloom about the impact ofÊclimateÊchange risks preventing effective action being taken to tackle it, one of the lead scientists in a major UN report into the impact of global warming has said.
Chris Field, coÐchairman of the working group of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC), called for more positivity about the ""really exciting opportunities"" to adapt to the impact ofÊclimateÊchange.
In a report to be released today, theÊIPCCÊwarns of flooding, droughts, heatwaves and food shortages that are likely to result from rising temperatures and extreme weather patterns.
The document calls for governments to take action to prepare for and adapt to the increased risks thatÊclimateÊchange brings.
Mr Field acknowledged that the impacts ofÊclimateÊchange set out in the report were overwhelmingly negative.
""It's true we couldn't find very many benefits ofÊclimateÊchange,"" he said. ""I believe that's because there aren't that many.""
However, he urged policymakers to approach the issue with more positive thinking.
""ClimateÊchange is as rich with opportunity as it is with danger,"" he said.
""One of the things that made it so difÐficult for individuals and countries to be serious aboutÊclimateÊis that the agenda is such a downer,"" he said.
""IfÊclimateÊchange is a total downer because everything looks so serious, and the only ways to cope effectively are to give up all good things in life, it's going to be really hard to take action.
""If dealing effectively is taking an innovative, creative, entrepreneurial approach, building great businesses and communities, then it's a problem that we can deal with."" He said that many of the real opportunities for innovation this century were going to be in the energy industries, building sustainable housing and creating new transportation systems.
Too much negativity aboutÊclimateÊchange would mean ""we are not going to be able to attract the creative people who build the solutions,"" he warned.
He made his comments after Richard Tol, one of the authors of the report, claimed that a summary document for policymakers was too ""alarmist"".
Benny Peiser, the director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that questions current efforts to tackleÊ , welcomed the report's focus on adaptation.
""The signal they are sending out is adaptation: prepare forÊclimateÊchange,"" he said, arguing that this was a more ""costÐeffective approach"" than trying to stop emissions rising when there was ""no chance of international agreement"" on such green policies.
TheÊIPCCÊreport finds that the world is ""in many cases illÐprepared for risks from a changingÊclimate"".
It says that while there are ""opportunities to respond to such risks"", it stresses that the risks will be ""difficult to manage with high levels of warming"", such as 4C (7.2F) above preÐindustrial levels. The UN has previously set a target of limiting global warming to 2C (3.6F) by cutting emissions to minimise the impacts.
The risks the report warns of include:
Food
Wheat, rice and maize crops in tropical regions will be harmed by increases of 2C (3.6F) or more unless action is taken to adapt. However, some locations may benefit from improved growing conditions. ""All aspects of food security are potentially affected byÊclimateÊchange, including food access, utilisation, and price stability,"" theÊIPCCÊsays.
If average temperature increases were to increase further, to 4C (7.2F) or more than, combined with increasing food demand from a growing population, it would ""pose large risks to food security globally and regionally"".
Species extinction
TheÊIPCCÊwarns: ""A large fraction of both terrestrial and freshwater species faces increased extinction risk under projectedÊ  during and beyond the 21st century, especially asÊclimateÊchange interacts with other stressors, such as habitat modification, overÐexploitation, pollution, and invasive species."" Many species will be unable to relocate quickly enough to keep up with the changes to their habitats as a result ofÊclimateÊchange. Trees will die, leading to fewer forests, due to increased temperatures and drought.
Marine life is also at risk, with polar ecosystems and coral reefs deemed to be especially vulnerable from ocean acidifiÐcation, it says.
Floods
TheÊIPCCÊsays it has ""very high confiÐdence"" that ""coastal systems and lowlying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding, and coastal erosion"" as sea levels rise.
Simultaneously more and more people and infrastructure will become exposed to the risks of coastal erosion due to population growth and urbanisation.
""The relative costs of coastal adaptation vary strongly among and within regions and countries for the 21st century. Some lowÐlying developing countries and small island states are expected to face very high impacts,"" it says.
War and peace
ClimateÊchange will increase the displacement of people who move to escape inhospitable climates. It can also ""indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts"" such as civil war by increasing poverty and economic shocks.
Water supplies
The more theÊclimateÊwarms, the more people will experience ""water scarcity"", theÊIPCCÊfinds. If carbon emissions remain high, droughts will become more frequent in dry regions by the end of the century Ð although ""water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes"".
Health
""Throughout the 21st century,ÊclimateÊchange is expected to lead to increases in ill health in many regions and especially in developing countries with low income,"" theÊIPCCÊsays.
Heatwaves and fires will increase risks of direct loss of life, while declines in crops in some regions will contribute to underÐnutrition. There could also be some positive effects including ""modest reductions in coldÐrelated mortality and morbidity in some areas due to fewer cold extremes"" but globally the negatives will increasingly outweigh the positives.
It finds that by the year 2100, in a highemissions scenario, high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year is likely to ""compromise normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors"".
Editorial Comment: Page 21
Stormy weather Scientists disagree
TheÊIPCC's report into the impact ofÊclimateÊchange threatens to be overshadowed by a row between its authors over its findings.
Richard Tol, a scientist who was a lead author on a section of the report dealing with the economic effects of global warming, last week claimed the report's conclusions were ""too alarmist"".
But Chris Field, the cochairman of the report, hit back yesterday, saying that Tol's own analysis was ""oldfashioned"" and had contained ""errors"".
A leaked draft of the advice to policymakers said that ""global mean temperature increases of 2.5C above preindustrial levels may lead to global aggregate economic losses between 0.2 and 2 per cent of income"", in line with Tol's views.
But critics argued the prediction underplayed the likely impact. In the final version, the section has been significantly rewritten.
It now says that ""global economic impacts fromÊclimateÊchange are difficult to estimate"" and issues a strong caveat against the 0.2 to 2pc forecast.
Flood response Dredging starts today at the Somerset Levels
Dredging of the River Parrett in the floodÐhit Somerset Levels will begin today.
The Environment Agency, which was widely criticised for its response to the floods and a lack of dredging in the area, said it would begin work on a 200Ðmetre stretch of the river near Burrowbridge.
""Today's preliminary work is on a key part of the river that has been specifically identified for dredging and where significant amounts of silt have built up,"" it said. Work will then be extended along an 8km stretch of river.
In January, at the height of the flooding crisis, David Cameron, the Prime Minister, announced that the rivers would be dredged once the floodwater had subsided.
Some of the material removed will be used to repair flood banks, the agency said.
Dr Paul Leinster, chief executive at the agency, said the dredging had become possible because of additional funding from Government.
Many in the area had called for the rivers to be dredged, but some experts have cast doubt on the benefits, saying it is expensive and can be ineffective.

National Trust calls for urgent action to save Britain's battered coastline
A CLEAR national strategy is ""urgently needed"" to help ""future-proof"" coastal areas from rising sea levels and extreme weather, according to a report by the National Trust.
The charity, one of the UK's biggest coastal owners, said many of its sites had been ""battered"" by storms and ""hit hard"" by high tides during the winter.
Birling Gap, part of the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs in East Sussex, experienced the equivalent of seven years of erosion in a matter of months, leaving its caf and shop teetering yards from the edge. Part of the footpath down to the golden sands of Rhossili on Gower, in South Wales, which was recently voted the UK's best beach, was washed away by storms.
The National Trust said it had been forced to ""fasttrack"" decisions over how to adapt coastal areas in the months ahead, rather than the years or decades. Simon Pryor, natural environment director at the trust, called on the Government to ensure that strategies to future-proof the coastline are implemented.
""There is a natural inclination to want to defend the coastline with concrete, but our coastline is dynamic and the forces of nature that have formed it are part of its beauty,"" he said. ""Hard defences will always have their place, but the winter storms that hit many coastal places hard have provided a valuable reminder that they have a limited life.
""Where we can, we need to give natural processes that have formed our coast the space to work, and create areas where the coastline can realign as the sea levels rise. Natural habitats such as sand dunes and salt marshes can act as buffer zones that absorb the impact of storms and very high tides.""
Dr Pryor said a report, Shifting Shores - adapting to change, published last Friday by the Intergovernmental Panel onÊ  (IPCC) reinforced the urgency of having a ""workable plan"" for long-term coastline management. He said there was a ""clear need"" to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to avoid further acceleratingÊclimateÊchange and the risk of more dramatic damage.
""Communities living on the coast, landowners, government agencies and local and central government need to work together now to find solutions based around an adaptation approach to help future-proof the coastline,"" Dr Pryor said.
""Much of the framework to make this happen is in place, but government needs to act now to make sure that it's implemented and the support is there for coastal communities to begin planning to adapt.""
The National Trust cares for 742 miles of coast in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Winter deluges may become the norm
Flooding
By Gordon Rayner, Chief Reporter
BRITAIN should brace itself for even soggier winters in future, according toÊclimateÊchange projections which show that the country will get warmer and wetter over the next 20 years.
Average winter temperatures will rise by as much as 5.4F (3C) by 2035, with rainfall increasing by up to 12 per cent, the first projections for regionalÊclimateÊchange suggested.
As more heavy rain, high tides and gale force winds were forecast to bring further flooding to parts of Britain this weekend, the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange published its final report breaking down the impact of global warming for individual areas. It is the first time it has broughtÊclimateÊmodels together to make seasonal and regional projections.
For northern Europe the maximum rise projected by models suggested a maximum 5.4F (3C) rise for the winter months of December, January and February. However it is more likely temperatures will rise by the mean of 2.3F (1.3C) by 2035. The summer months could also warm by a maximum of 4.6F (2.6C), although a mean of 1.6F (0.9C) is more likely, theÊIPCCÊsaid.
Britain will also see greater rainfall in the next two decades, with a maximum of 12 per cent more rainfall and an average rise of 4 per cent.
Dr Peter Stott, the head ofÊclimateÊmonitoring and attribution at the Met OfÐfice Hadley Centre, agreed that Britain is likely to see wetter and warmer temperatures in future.
""We are seeing more extreme temperatures and more intense rainfall events around the world,"" he said.
""The expectation in a warming world is for an increased frequency of heatwaves and greater moisture in a warmer atmosphere is expected to lead extreme precipitation events, more intense and more frequent.""
Yesterday forecasters warned that there was no end to the current spell of wet weather. Coastal areas of the South West and Wales, and parts of the Midlands near the River Severn, will be worst affected this weekend, with well over an inch of rain expected in some areas today and more to follow tomorrow.
Winds gusting up to 70mph could cause damage to properties in western areas.
The Environment Agency had 37 flood warnings (flooding is expected) and 163 flood alerts (flooding is possible) in place.
Helen Chivers, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: ""Because the rain over the next few days comes on top of the recordbreaking rain we have had in January, it brings the risk of more flooding.
""In coastal areas we are asking people to be aware of very big waves crashing into promenades. There will be high tides, combined with tidal surges and strong winds which can be really dangerous. People should stay away from the coast. And I'm afraid there's another band of rain coming in on Monday, with this really unsettled weather continuing next week.""
As members of the Armed Forces went to the Somerset Levels to help people cut off by flood water, the Met Office conÐfirmed that January has been the wettest on record for parts of southern England.
The UK as a whole has received 6.5in (164.6mm) of rain in January, 35 per cent above the longÐterm average, with 6.9in (175.2mm) in South East and Central England, more than twice the regional average and the highest since records began in 1910. Today a band of heavy rain will sweep across the country from west to east, with 0.8 to 1.2 inches (20mm to 30mm) falling on some areas, including Dartmoor, and as much as 1.6 inches (40mm) on high ground.
The Environment Agency said coastal and tidal areas of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol and South Gloucestershire were all at an increased risk of flooding. The rest of Gloucestershire, parts of the South East, the North West and the Yorkshire coast will also be affected by wind, rain and high tides in the next few days. Of the 37 flood warnings, 17 were in the Midlands, all but one of those along the River Severn.

Fracking 'could help avoidÊclimateÊchange'
Emily Gosden, Energy Editor
UNÊCLIMATEÊchiefs say fracking could be part of the solution to global warming Ð but a massive expansion of green energy is still needed to prevent devastating extremes ofÊclimateÊchange.
A report by the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) found it was still just possible to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 3.6F (2C) by 2100, the level beyond which experts say the effects will be ""dangerous"".
TheÊIPCCÊwarns that sticking within the limit will be a ""huge challenge"", requiring urgent global action.
Energy production, industry and transport systems must be transformed to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which have been rising everÐfaster despite policies supposed to tackleÊclimateÊchange.
The world must at least treble its use of green and lowÐcarbon sources of power, such as solar farms, wind farms and nuclear reactors by 2050. However, the report finds there is also a role for gas to replace dirtier coal plants.
Ottmar Edenhofer, the coÐchairman of the working group that drew up the report, said it was ""quite clear"" that shale gas, extracted through the controversial process of fracking, can be ""consistent with low carbon development"".
The comments are likely to be seized upon by British proponents of fracking, including George Osborne.
However, environmental groups believe that fossil fuels should be left in the ground.
TheÊIPCCÊreport says greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by replacing coalÐfired power plants with modern, natural gas power plants.
Mr Edenhofer said the shale gas revolution could be ""very helpful"" but only if world leaders were determined to tackleÊ  and did not simply burn more gas as well as coal.
In the long term, burning gas for power will only help to tackleÊclimateÊchange if power plants are fitted with ""carbon capture and storage"" (CCS) technology to trap and bury the harmful emissions. ""What a 2C (3.6F) scenario means is the phaseÐout of fossil fuel without CCS entirely, [at the] latest in the next few decades,"" Mr Edenhofer said.
However, the viability of carbon capture is not yet proven. Critics fear that building a new wave of gas plants would see Britain ""locked in"" to higher emissions for much longer.
TheÊIPCCÊsays that global greenhouse gas emissions must be lowered by 40 to 70 per cent compared with 2010 by the middle of the century, and reduced to almost zero by the end of this century.
Carbon dioxide may also need to be sucked out of the atmosphere to achieve a sustainable balance.
Rajendra K Pachuari, the chairman of theÊIPCC, said the report showed that to meet the 2C target the world must unite to reduce emissions.
Without any action, global temperatures might increase by 8.6F (4.8C). Critics say green energy is too expensive, with wind, solar and nuclear power currently all dependent on huge subsidies paid for by consumers.
The report acknowledges that the costs of tacklingÊclimateÊchange would hit economic growth, causing global consumption in 2050 to be about 3.4 per cent lower than without the changes.
However, Pete Smith, of the University of Aberdeen, one of the report's authors, said this equated to the growth that might have been expected by 2050 being delayed to 2051 or 2052.
The report does not try to compare the costs of going green with the benefits of avoiding the disastrous impacts ofÊclimateÊchange.
An earlier report by theÊIPCCÊwarned of floods, food shortages and deadly heatwaves that were likely to result if emissions continued to rise.
The report finds that delaying efforts to tackleÊclimateÊchange now would only make it more expensive to do so later.
Mr Edenhofer said: ""Achieving this goal is a huge technological, institutional challenge.""

ClimateÊchange threat to British food prices
By Emily Gosden, Energy Editor
BRITAIN faces water shortages and food price increases as well as floods and deadly heatwaves as a result ofÊclimateÊchange, a report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) finds today.
Other parts of the world will be even harder hit and less able to adapt, theÊIPCCÊwarns.
Food shortages and poverty could lead to the outbreak of war, the report says. It also suggests that people will be forced to flee areas that become too warm, while some species of wildlife face the risk of extinction.
The more temperatures rise, the more severe the consequences will be and the harder it will become for people to adapt, the report finds.
Warming by 4C (7.2F) from preindustrial levels will lead to a ""fundamentally different"" world from today, whereas limiting warming to 2C (3.6F) by cutting emissions will result in a world ""not dramatically different"", said Chris Field, of theÊIPCCÊworking group which wrote the report.
""With high levels of warming that result from continued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, risks will be challenging to manage, and even serious, sustained investments in adaptation will face limits,"" he said.
Ed Davey, Britain's Energy andÊClimateÊChange Secretary, said that ""left unchecked,ÊclimateÊchange will have far reaching consequences for our society"".
""This evidence builds the case for early action in the UK and around the world to lessen the risks posed byÊclimateÊchange,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to wait.""

Act onÊClimateÊchange, demands US
By Sarah Knapton and Danielle Demetriou in Yokohama
CLIMATEÊchange is jeopardising our way of life in the West and the cost of inaction will be ""catastrophic"", John Kerry, the US secretary of state warned yesterday.
In the strongest indication yet that the US is fully committed to tacking manmade global warming, Mr Kerry claimed that any ""denial of the science"" would be ""malpractice"".
He was responding to a major report by the United Nations which described the impacts of global warming as ""severe, pervasive and irreversible"". The study from the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) stated that many impacts of rising temperatures were already being felt and warned of increasing floods, droughts, threats to food security, increased conflict and economic losses.
In a statement, Mr Kerry said: ""Unless we act dramatically and quickly, science tells us ourÊclimateÊand our way of life are literally in jeopardy. Denial of the science is malpractice. There are those who say we can't afford to act. But waiting is truly unaffordable. The costs of inaction are catastrophic.""
One of the report authors, Prof Neil Adger, of Exeter University, warned that global warming will fuel a surge in British ""- refugees"", including families forced out of their homes due to flooding, as well as increasing fatalities due to extreme heatwaves. ""The impacts ofÊclimateÊchange are already here and they're being felt everywhere in the world,"" he said. ""There's no country, no region that's actually immune fromÊclimateÊchange.""
Professor Adger's comments were made as the UK emerged from its wettest winter on record, resulting in 7,000 homes across the country flooded, 11 deaths and a cost to small businesses of around £830 million.
He was speaking in Yokohama, Japan, where the comprehensiveÊIPCCÊWorking Group II report examining the impact of global warming was published yesterday, compiled by more than 300 authors from 70 different countries.
""The records already show that there's been an increase in precipitation,"" said Professor Adger. ""Rainfall is coming in shorter periods so we have an increase in rainfall intensity. That's what leads to increased risk of flooding.
""The biggest single movement of people in the world is still into cities,"" he added. ""These cities are growing Ð and that's where the crucible of impacts is going to be felt.""
William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, said: ""It is clear from theÊIPCC's report that a twoÐdegree increase in the world's temperature would be dangerous, and four degrees would be catastrophic. But that is the likely trajectory, unless there is unprecedented global cooperation. No country would be left unaffected. Governments everywhere have to act.""
The latestÊIPCCÊreport, the first update in seven years, confirms thatÊclimateÊscientists appear more certain than ever before that human behaviour is the key culprit for global warming.
Declaring the warming trend ""unequivocal"", it highlights how temperatures could rise as much as 4.8C by the end of the century Ð with a minimum increase of around 0.3C if governments succeed in sharply cutting greenhouse emission rates.

Changing planet
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC) yesterday released its first ""Synthesis Report"" since 2007, and it made for typically grim reading. Global warming is set to inflict ""severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts"" on both humanity and the natural world. Carbon emissions must be cut sharply and swiftly, ultimately to zero. Fossil fuels should be phased out by the end of the century.
ClimateÊchange is undoubtedly a serious problem. Yet the difficulty theÊIPCCÊfaces, in convincing us to tackle it, is that it has hardly covered itself with glory before. Its reports are the result of endless wrangling between experts and governments, resulting in an uneasy fusion of spin and science. Its previous work has contained glaring errors Ð such as the hyperbolic prediction of vanishing Himalayan glaciers. And previous efforts by governments to take action, especially Ed Miliband'sÊClimateÊChange Act, have had unforeseen and damaging consequences, not least raising electricity prices and imposing huge extra burdens on industry and consumers.
Too often, the green movement has been synonymous with a LeftÐwing mentality that sees progress as a bad thing Ð that looks at the millions of Chinese moving up the income scale, or Africans getting access to heating and electricity, and sees only the environmental cost. But in fact, the most encouraging statistic in theÊIPCC's report has nothing to do with theÊclimate. It is that over the same century in which the challenge of global warming will be confronted, global GDP is expected to treble. A richer world is not a curse, but a blessing Ð especially since it will be able to invest in the kind of technological innovation that minimises carbon emissions without damaging growth.

ExxonMobil on the rack overÊclimateÊclaims
US prosecutors demand decades of documents as oil company is accused of covering up what it knew

NEW YORK prosecutors have subpoenaed emails and company documents from ExxonMobil in a test case over alleged climate crimes, the most dramatic step yet in an escalating legal assault on the fossil fuel industry.
The state is investigating whether the $360 billion US petroleum group, the world's biggest traded oil company and the parent of Esso, withheld information from investors on the financial risks of climate change and conspired to manipulate the public debate.
It has demanded documents going back 40 years, when Exxon's own scientists first warned that C02 emissions were likely to drive up temperatures and ""destroy"" agriculture in vulnerable regions of the world.
Exxon officials said they had received the subpoena on Wednesday from the New York attorney-general,ÊEric Schneiderman, a Left-leaning crusader with a taste for quixotic cases. ""We unequivocally reject allegations that ExxonMobil suppressed climate change research,"" said the company's spokesman Scott Silvestri.
Exxon said it had worked closely with the US energy department and the UN climate panel (IPCC) over the years, and accused hostile elements in the media of cherry-picking snippets from old documents to paint a false picture.
The probe has been running discreetly for months but has clearly shifted to a higher gear after Inside Climate News revealed in September that Exxon had developed a ""brain trust"" in the early 1980s to evaluate the dire implications of climate change for the company, only to switch tack later and lobby hard to head off curbs on C02 emissions.
Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, has called on the US Justice Department to launch a probe into possible ""corporate fraud"" by the company.
""ExxonMobil knew the truth about fossil fuels and climate change and lied to protect their business model at the expense of the planet,"" he said, comparing it to efforts by tobacco companies to cover up the health risk of smoking. He invoked the nuclear option of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO) used against the Mafia. Twenty top scientists have demanded a full RICO probe of the fossil industry for allegedly plotting to ""forestall America's response to climate change"".
The New York state investigation is retroactive. Exxon has not been in the denial camp for several years. The company includes warnings about climate risk in shareholder reports and regulatory filings.
Rex Tillerson, the chief executive, supports a carbon tax and has endorsed action to curb emissions - although this reporter heard him accuse theÊObamaÊadministration of straying from ""sound science"" this April at an energy conference in Texas.
Clearly, the trail of past actions haunts the company. The Royal Society accused Exxon Mobil as recently as 2006 of propagating an ""inaccurate and misleading view of climate science"".
Green activists say the company bankrolled efforts to sow doubt about the risks of greenhouse gases through the 1990s, leading the Global Climate Coalition and working through think tanks opposed to emission limits.
This is a grey area since there are legitimate reasons for questioning the exact relationship between C02 levels and global temperature, and whether warming is the result of human action. But the company may be vulnerable if internal records show a pattern of cynical deception.
Oil, gas, and coal companies are already facing massive pressure from a worldwide divestment movement, ranging from the Norwegian pension fund to Cambridge University. They risk being left with trillions of pounds of ""stranded assets"" if world leaders clinch a far-reaching climate deal at the COP21 summit in Paris next month.
TheÊInternational Energy AgencyÊwarns that the two thirds of fossil fuel reserves booked by energy companies can never be burned if the world is to cap the rise in temperatures to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, deemed the safe limit by climate scientists.
The Exxon case is in some respects troubling. Judicial authorities must be careful not to vilify energy companies and encourage a witch hunt.
Defenders of the fossil fuel industry protest that oil, gas, and coal have powered the world's industrial revolutions, lifted billions out of poverty, and made the affluent society possible.
Yet however unfair it may be, the ExxonMobil investigation will surely not be the last.

Veteran investor Jerome Booth, who has long extolled the virtues of emerging markets, is to launch a new investment fund that will focus on renewable and conventional energy projects in Africa.
New Sparta Asset Management plans to invest in at least three power stations, each of which will need at least £50m of equity. The group, which has a number of economists on its board, including Sunday Telegraph columnist Liam Halligan, is about to launch a fundraising round for investors.
""There is a huge amount of untapped opportunity in emerging markets, particularly with companies in the private, pre-IPO stage,” said Dr Booth. “Our strategy is not only to bring the funds, but also find areas where we can add value by using our expertise to help companies, and nations, grow rapidly but sustainably.”
Only a small percentage of sub-Saharan Africa has access to energy, while South Africa, one of the major economies in Africa, regularly suffers from electricity blackouts.
Many foreign investors have recently taken an interest in the continent, following years of underinvestment into Africa’s power infrastructure. Last month, Dubai-based investment firm Abraaj Group raised $375m for a fund focusing on North Africa."

Plus ga change...
THE DAILY TELEGRAPH Established 1855

Another city; pretty much the same outcome. The great climate change debate has rumbled along from Rio to Kyoto, through Copenhagen and on to Lima, without the breakthrough that campaigners have sought. There was an agreement of sorts in Peru, but nothing that lived up to the billing.

This gathering was supposed to clear away the obstacles blocking the way to a formal agreement, in Paris a year from now, to combat climate change. Instead, after overrunning by two days, all delegates managed to approve was a framework for setting national pledges to be submitted to the Paris meeting.

Once again, there were divisions between rich and poor countries over how to spread the burden of pledges to cut carbon emissions, which will have to be resolved over the next 12 months  or in Paris itself  making success much less likely.

With 194 countries involved in the talks, each with its own interests to defend, expectations of a comprehensive deal need to be far more realistic. The fact is that the emerging economies will be reluctant to agree to legally binding caps on emissions that they, with some justice, feel were never imposed on advanced countries at the same stage of their development. They want richer nations to do more.

To that end, much more important than the pursuit of unachievable goals, was the recent pact between the world's two biggest energy users, America and China, to work towards a common position on the reduction in fossil fuel use. Although they, too, disagreed in Lima over how emission cuts should be shared between rich and poor countries, such voluntary and bilateral agreements are the basis of the way forward. Otherwise, Paris will be added to the lengthening list of cities associated with false promises on climate change."

China and America clear the air
Geoffrey Lean
Just a patch of blue sky big enough ""to make a sailor a pair of trousers"", my parents' generation would say, may herald a break in dismal weather. Against all expectation, rather more than that seems to be opening up amid the dark clouds that have so far shrouded the prospects of the world agreeing a new treaty to combat climate change.

China and the United States  by far the world's greatest emitters of carbon dioxide  have started farreaching, if littlenoticed, talks on how to cut the pollution, in what is being described as the most hopeful single development in tackling global warming for almost 20 years.

Both are accelerating their efforts to control their own emissions, a considerable change for the two nations, which together account for more than two in every five tons of the greenhouse gas spewed into the atmosphere worldwide each year. The US's refusal to join the Kyoto Protocol was long the major obstacle to progress, while China  exempted from that limited treaty  has increased its emissions to exceed those of the US and the EU combined.

What's more, it was a clash between the two countries that did more than anything to cause the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit to end in disappointment. So the prospect of them cooperating in paving the way to the next one, in Paris at the end of next year, is significant.

This week, moreover, another unexpected development brightened the skies even further. The conservativemajority US Supreme Court  which has generally opposed Barack Obama's environmental policies  backed, by a surprisingly large 62 majority, his attempt to crack down on pollution from the power stations that emit 40 per cent of the nation's greenhouse gases.

Chief Justice John Roberts and his fellow conservative, Anthony Kennedy, joined the court's four liberals to reject a vigorous challenge by polluters to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations designed to clamp down on smog from coalfired plants that drifts across state boundaries, helping to cause an estimated 34,000 deaths a year.

True, the measure does not directly address global warming. But it is expected to cause the closure of the most polluting plants, which are also the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. And, much more importantly, the court's decision appears to endorse Obama's strategy of making combating climate change one of the main themes of his second term of office.

Frustrated by Congress in his attempt to introduce climate legislation, the President dropped his issue in his first four years, while privately regarding it as his biggest firstterm failure. Now  partly at the prompting of his daughters  he is making a much more determined bid to tackle it, this time by trying to bypass Capitol Hill.

His strategy is to rely on executive presidential orders to reduce emissions, implemented by the EPA; next month he is due to issue some to cut carbon dioxide from power plants. His opponents have been hoping the courts would stop him, hence the significance of the Supreme Court's decision. If it had ruled against Obama, his climate strategy would have seemed severely damaged; instead it appears to have cleared the path for it to progress.

In China, too, action against conventional pollution, largely from power plants, is presaging measures on climate change. So called ""airpocalypses"" in Chinese cities, with concentrations of deadly particles up to 20 times higher than international safety limits, are causing the country increasingly to move away from coal, which provides 70 per cent of its electricity. Most of the new Chinese generating capacity installed last year relies on renewable energy; old coal plants are being closed, and some experts expect national carbon emissions to peak by the next decade.

A year ago China and the US agreed to phase out production and use of hydrofluorocarbons, potent greenhouse gases used in refrigeration, and the world's fastestgrowing climate threat. The hope was that this would presage wider cooperation, and the signs that this is beginning are being hailed as the most important development since the Kyoto Protocol was concluded in 1997.

It does, however, leave Europe  hitherto leading the attack on global warming  on the sidelines, perhaps deservedly so, as its leaders have grown increasingly timid since failing to make enough of a difference in Copenhagen.

David Cameron, however, has  since the winter floods  begun to reemphasise the importance of what he initially made his trademark issue. This September he will have a chance to show whether he means it at a special summit called by UN Secretary General Ban KiMoon to try to put momentum behind a new international treaty. And, since voters formed their first impressions of him as environmentally concerned, crucial credibility  in an election year  may hang on his performance.

Time for a patch of bluesky thinking in Downing Street?"

Church calls for day of fasting each month in drive for greener worship
By John Bingham Religious Affairs Editor
THE Church of England is to urge worshippers to dedicate the first day of every month to fasting and prayer ""for planet Earth"" as part of a drive to instill green ideas in its followers.

Candidates for ordination as priests will also be trained in ""eco-theology, while plans are being considered to install solar farms across parts of the Church's extensive land holdings, in addition to existing wind farms.

Details of the green initiatives emerged in papers sent to members of the Church's ruling General Synod, which is due to hold its annual gathering in York next month. Pope Francis this week published a long-awaited encyclical on the environment, throwing the weight of the 1.2billion-strong Roman Catholic Church behind the fight against climate change and calling for fossil fuels to be phased out.

The Church of England, whose financial arms control investments worth about ?8billion, recently announced it is to jettison stakes in companies involved in the most carbon-intensive forms of fossil fuel. One senior Church of England official said the new plans meant that ""you would struggle to put a cigarette paper between"" the stance of the two churches on environmental issues. The Synod is to debate a motion tabled by the Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Rev Nicholas Holtam, to put pressure on world leaders to reach a deal on limiting carbon dioxide emissions in Paris later this year.

It also calls for dioceses and individual parishes to ""encourage prayer and fasting for climate justice on the first day of every month"" and backs the inclusion of ""eco-theology"" and ""eco-justice"" courses in training for new clergy.

Bishop Holtam said this would mean that in addition to looking after their own flock, future clerics could be linchpins of the green movement. ""Creating options and pathways for including environmental ethics and 'eco-theology' in the training curriculum could encourage and support the Church leaders of the future — especially younger candidates — to be enablers for others in seeking change and a sustainable future,"" he wrote in a background paper sent to Synod members.

The paper says a network of Christian green activists had already set aside the first day of each month for fasting and prayer for the climate talks and suggested the Church of England could adopt the idea en-masse.

""This is one way in which every member of the Church can play a constructive role in movement for change and for the safeguarding of God's creation,"" he said.

Asked what training clerics in ""ecotheology"" would entail, William Fittall, secretary general of the Synod and the Church's most senior lay official, suggested it was about caring for creation.

A separate paper sent to Synod members discloses how the Church Commissioners, its main investment arm, and other bodies such as its Pensions Board are ploughing ""hundreds of millions"" into green energy. Two windpower schemes are already running on Church Commissioners land.

The document also shows the Commissioners have signed a preliminary agreement with Lightsource, a solar power firm, to develop solar farms on Church-owned land in rural areas. The Commissioners have 105,000 acres of agricultural land, 32,000 acres of forestry and half a million acres of minerals interests in the UK.

'This is one way in which every member of the curuch can play a role in safeguarding God's creation' "

Against nature
In her latest polemic, Naomi Klein shows how capitalism has fuelled climate change. Stanley Johnson hails a hero

Stanley Johnson
This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs the Climate

by Naomi Klein

566PP, ALLEN LANE, T ?18 (PLUS ?1.95 P&P) 0844 871 1515 (RRP ?20, EBOOK ?6.99) ****

The Canadian author and political activist Naomi Klein is a formidable debater, as anyone watching her being interviewed recently by Jeremy Paxman will attest. Her previous books (for example, No Logo and The Shock Doctrine: the Rise of Disaster Capitalism) have earned her a well–deserved reputation as one of the foremost critics of neoliberalism, as promoted by Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics.

In her new book, she turns her guns on capitalism's role in climate change. She argues that ""we have not done the things that are necessary to lower emissions because these things fundamentally conflict with deregulatwed capitalism... We are stuck because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting catastrophe – and would benefit the vast majority – are extremely threatening to an elite minority that has a stranglehold over our economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets.""

On this central point, Klein is undoubtedly right. Corporate America, led particularly by the oil and gas industry, fought tooth and nail to ensure that the flimsy accord known as the Kyoto protocol (which dealt only with emissions from developed countries) was effectively neutered when the US Senate ""resolved"" in July 1997 by 95 votes to 0 that the United States should not sign up to the protocol unless developing countries were covered, too.

When George W Bush became President in 2001, the US officially abandoned the Kyoto process. The link between political donations by the concerned industries and Congressional voting records is well documented. Just as important, perhaps, are the millions of dollars from the extractive industries that flowed to foundations and think tanks, such as the American Enterprise Institute, which, as Klein puts it, have ""over a period of years stoked the flames of climate–change denial"".

The Kyoto protocol having now expired, the world's attention is focused on next year's international climate meeting in Paris. With hopes of keeping a global temperature rise to a maximum of 2 degrees C fast disappearing, the talk now is of ""adaptation"", rather than ""mitigation"". How convenient that is, especially for the industries (the extractive, the consumer, the transportation industries) which have so much at stake. For them it means, basically, business as usual.

I would have liked to have seen more in Klein's book about the impact of unbridled capitalism on nature and wildlife. Even if the ""climate change deniers"" are somehow proved right, and global warming turns out to be a myth, the economic system we have today, with its mad emphasis on growth at all costs, spells doom for the world's wildlife and wild places. According to a recent Zoological Society of London study, wildlife populations ""from elephants to otters"" have halved in 40 years. Rich countries are ""outsourcing biodiversity loss"" to the developing world by importing products such as palm oil, which is grown in poorer countries where forests are cleared for agriculture.

Klein may be politically on the Left of the spectrum but she is no advocate of socialism. She points out that Eastern Bloc carbon emissions in Soviet times were some of the highest in the world. But she does insist that governments, too, have ""skin in the game"", having spent billions of dollars in recent years rescuing the private sector from the consequences of its own greed and stupidity.

We emerged from the last, financial, disaster by the barest of margins. Why should we allow unbridled capitalism to lead us to a new planetary–scale breakdown? If this means that Congress should at last mandate the US Environment Protection Agency to set carbon limits industry by industry and even plant by plant, so be it.

Most important, Klein believes in local activism, in financial ""disinvestment"" in the earth–destroying corporations, and in respect for the rights of indigenous people whose land all over the world is being raped and pillaged. The production systems that Klein advocates would, she argues, help ""solve"" global warming and so much else besides.

She writes: ""Vandana Shiva, the Indian author and activist, points out that shifting to an agriculture based on agroecological models would not only sequester large amounts of carbon, it would reduce emissions and increase food security.""

Are businesses such as Monsanto, Cargill, BP and Mobil, and the big banks such as RBS and HSBC that finance the activities of the corporate world, actually listening to people such as Vandana Shiva and Naomi Klein? Probably not, though some of them have learnt by now to talk a good game. But while there's life, there's hope.

The Pope's climate message will affect us all
Francis's popularity will ensure that his views about global warming are taken seriously

PETER STANFORD
As a young man, Pope Francis may have qualified as a chemist before entering the seminary, but he would be the first to admit that he has no claim to being a climate change scientist. So whatever impact his muchheralded encyclical on environment and development has when it is released tomorrow, it is unlikely to have sufficient academic weight to carry the argument about made-made global warming.

Francis has, to be fair, listened to wellqualified advisers at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and leaks of Laudato Si - ""Praised Be"" - make it plain that he endorses the majority view that most climate change is caused by humans. Yet any eco-campaigner who imagines that such a clear papal verdict will settle anything with the vocal climate change sceptics is expecting a miracle.

At best, the Pope's words may put some Catholic politicians on the rack. The encyclical's publication has been timed to pave the way for his visit to the United States in September. There, as well as attending a UN meeting on new sustainable development goals, he will address both Houses of Congress - the first pontiff ever to be accorded the honour. And among those greeting him will be self-avowedly devout Catholic John Boehner, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives and a noted climate change sceptic.

Boehner's discomfiture at reconciling his loyalty to his Church leader with his political opinions will, however, find no ready echo in China and India, the world's first and third biggest greenhouse gas emitters. In both countries, Catholics of any variety are thin on the ground, and are persecuted in China precisely because they listen to the Pope on such matters as the appointment of bishops.

So what impact will this unapologetically faith-based document really have on any impact on the climate change debate? Or is it just another opportunity for headlines and photos of Papa Francesco, the pope the world has fallen in love with, rather than about his stated opinions?

Well, Francis is undeniably pitching for a change of heart. He addresses the encyclical not just to fellow Catholics - as is usually the style - but to the whole planet. He wants his moral authority on this issue to extend well beyond the 1.2 billion members of his own Church in order to effect the change of behaviour he believes is necessary to mitigate the worst effects of global warming.

In the developing world, Francis seems likely to carry the day. The Argentinian pope will find a ready audience among believers and non-believers in those swathes of Africa, Latin America as well as some parts of Asia (notably the Philippines, which he visited earlier this year), where he is widely regarded as the most powerful voice of the voiceless on the global stage.

From the first moments of his papacy, out on the balcony high above Saint Peter's, Francis has presented himself as someone ""from the ends of the earth"". His oft-stated aim is to lead ""a poor church, for the poor"".

Seen through the eyes of the poor, environmental degradation hits hardest those with least. They are the ones, the encyclical argues, whose livelihoods depend on harvesting natural resources in fisheries, agriculture and forestry, and who are most vulnerable to a changing eco-system.

This, then, is a bottom-up view of the impact of climate change by a Church and its leader speaking up for the poor and marginalised. But where will publication leave Francis's popularity in the developed world? The leaks from the encyclical make for uncomfortable reading for well-heeled fans of the Pope. Take his remarks about carbon credits, a favoured scheme in the West to enable us to pay extra so we can carry on polluting with a clear conscience. No longer, insists Pope Francis. The only purpose of carbon credits, he scolds, is to ""support the super-consumption of certain countries and sectors"".

In issuing such a telling-off, Francis appears to be banking on the credit he has amassed these past two years, with his easy, open manner, his unmissable warmth and his lived-out principles of simplicity and humility, to help him touch a core morality that politicians and scientists cannot reach.

In that sense, Laudato Si sits in a long tradition, usually referred to as Catholic social teaching, that stretches back to the 1890s, when Pope Leo XIII argued in the encyclical Rerum Novarum in favour of trade unions and workers' rights. In that case, too, the pontiff was stepping beyond the usual subjects of scripture, sin and sex, but it is a document still widely quoted with approval by those who otherwise want nothing to do with Catholicism.

Will Laudato Si achieve something similar? Its contents, as some are pointing out, largely build on what previous popes have already said. But it is Pope Francis who is surely the new and unpredictable factor. When even a familiar message is delivered in such passionate terms by the ""People's Pope"", Time magazine's 2013 ""person of the year"", it is going to be pretty hard to ignore."

Get your act together to save planet, Geldof urges young entrepreneurs
LIVE Aid founder and activist Sir Bob Geldof has joined calls for today's young entrepreneurs and leaders to solve the climate change problem to create a sustainable future for all.

The activist, who spoke after Mary Robinson, the former Irish president, said we ""need brave, young leadership that encourages us to change course and work for a world where we can live ordinary, healthy lives"". Ms Robinson, a special envoy for climate change at the United Nations, was addressing young delegates at the start of the One Young World conference in Dublin on Wednesday.

""We're destroying any possibility of life for the future,"" added Sir Bob. ""We're at a critical moment. Our time is gone. If you don't do it, there's a problem.""

Ms Robinson criticised business leaders and politicians for failing to address climate change. ""We can't have business as usual with a bit of green added,"" she said. ""We need to transform economies and how we travel, how we live in cities and even climate–smart agriculture.""

Sir Bob criticised the world's leading technology businesses: ""Think of the great new companies of this supposed golden age, your Facebook, your Googles, your Amazons. They are no different from the companies of the past, who seek to sell you if you let them.""

Young entrepreneurs must disrupt the energy industry to save the planet, said Ms Robinson. ""We have to move from fossil fuels to renewables and do it fairly,"" she said.

In August, an MIT report entitled Expectations for a New Climate Agreement found that the planet is on course to warm by 4C within the next century, which would create a global disaster for humanity.

""We need to change before 2050 in order to stay below two degrees but we're not even spreading the right message yet,"" said Ms Robinson. ""If we reach four degrees, there will be an estimated 200m migrants, climate displaced people.""

Sir Bob said he was an entrepreneurial front–runner working towards political and environmental change when he launched Live Aid. ""Back in the eighties, myself and a bunch of us got together to talk about the great African famines,"" he said. ""They were not dying of hunger; they were dying because they had no money to get food.""

He drew parallels with today's Ebola pandemic. ""They are not dying of this filthy little virus in west Africa, they are dying because they do not have doctors, nurses, medicare, they are dying because they are poor. I don't like that.""

The fifth One Young World conference has brought together 1,300 young delegates from 190 countries to debate the issues of the day, including peace and conflict; global business; human rights; and sustainable development."

Anti–fracking MPs accused of listening to 'ill–informed' green groups
By Emily Gosden, Energy Editor
MPS have been accused of listening to ""ill–informed"" green groups instead of evidence–based science after they called for a ban on fracking over health and environmental fears.

The Environmental Audit Committee today calls for fracking to be put on hold indefinitely, and at a minimum banned in national parks, amid ""huge uncertainties"" surrounding its impact on water, air and public health. Developing shale gas is also ""incompatible"" with the UK's legally binding climate change targets, it claims.

Eight committee members, including Caroline Spelman, the former environment secretary, have cited this as grounds for a moratorium on fracking, in an amendment to the Infrastructure Bill, due to be debated today.

But Government sources dismissed the report as ""total rubbish"", while academics criticised the committee's findings. Quentin Fisher, professor of petroleum geoengineering at the University of Leeds, said: ""It is disappointing to see a … committee putting the ill–informed views of anti–fracking groups ahead of evidencebased scientific studies.""

Ministers are facing a mounting backlash against their support for fracking as they today attempt to change the law to strip landowners of the power to block fracking beneath their homes.

The report says the proposed change undermines citizens' rights, while a group of senior Tory MPs, including former minister Nick Herbert and Sir Nicholas Soames, has tabled an amendment demanding compulsory compensation for affected landowners.

Labour has also filed an amendment calling for a ban on fracking in national parks and for more regulation to be put in place before the process can take place at all.

Today's report acknowledges that the Environment Agency had said no hazardous substances will be permitted if they might pollute groundwater. But the MPs said that ""despite this assurance, concerns remain"", citing evidence from Greenpeace.

The EAC also noted that Public Health England (PHE ) had found potential risks from fracking ""will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated"", but contrasted this with concerns from the Green Party and from a doctor living near a proposed fracking site in Lancashire, who claimed PHE had failed to look at potential long–term cancer risks. However, the committee on climate change, the Government's official advisers, and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have both said that shale gas can be used to help tackle climate change.

A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ""We disagree with the conclusion of this report. We have one of the most robust regulatory regimes for shale gas. UK shale development is compatible with our goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions."""

India's priority is poverty, not climate change
There's a huge cost in switching to new methods and greener technologies - we will need some help

ARUN JAITLEY
Even though India has among the lowest per capita contributions to overall global emissions, we are attending the Paris Climate Summit intent on doing our fair share. Our ambitious pledges to tackle climate change - our Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) - show our commitment to addressing the problem, as do our actions: we have introduced a carbon tax on fossil fuel and cut petroleum subsidies.

Yet we cannot commit, as some want, to a common global objective of restricting carbon and greenhouse gas emissions without an affordable means of doing so. There is still a huge cost involved in switching to new processes and greener technologies and we simply cannot afford to do it alone.

India is a developing nation, and we must first acknowledge her needs; the eradication of poverty must remain our priority. This is why India's climate change commitments have been designed to address environmental concerns while also enabling us to meet the growth aspirations of our citizens and our overall development ambitions.

The effects of climate change are already chipping away at those aspirations and ambitions. India is more vulnerable to the global temperature fluctuations and hard-topredict seasonal changes because they affect our agricultural output, impoverish our rural communities and burden our economy. It is for this reason that India continues to increase her commitment to reducing emissions and adopting cleaner technologies; we may not be part of the problem, but we want to be part of the solution.

This is why we have set up two dedicated funds at national level to address the cost of adopting cleaner technology in sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, water and forestry. To encourage a more considered consumption of fossil fuels, we have cut the petroleum subsidy by about 26 percent. We have also introduced a carbon tax on gasoline and diesel. To encourage energy generation through cleaner sources and to fund renewable energy projects, we have introduced tax-free infrastructure bonds of $794 million for the year 2015-16. Meanwhile, we have allocated $1.4 billion to the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, which aims to target the construction of 100 GW of solar generation by 2022. It should help us reduce CO2 volume by almost 85 million tons per year. We have also allocated $31 million for the period 2012-17 under the National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency, which will save around 23 million tonnes of oil equivalent (TOE) and 98.5 million tons of CO2.

All these efforts stand to make a huge impact but we do require international support to prioritise and accelerate our initiatives in accordance with the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR). If we are to replace coal, we need access to cleaner energy sources and technology at a viable cost. Even with the huge strides we are making in the direction of renewables, to do more, at a faster pace, we need help from developed nations. That's why international contributions towards the development and generation of greener technologies should be increased at the earliest possible opportunity through global carbon pricing, and by incentivising companies in the developed world to invest and share their research and development in this area. Our preliminary assessment indicates that the implementation of our climate change pledges up to 2030 would cost approximately $2.5 trillion. India stands ready to meet this commitment, but if we are to accelerate our efforts, then further financial support should be extended to poorer countries via the Green Climate Fund.

India's approach to its INDCs has been anchored in the vision of equity inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's famous exhortation: ""Earth has enough resources to meet people's needs, but will never have enough to satisfy people's greed."" India is still working to meet its people's basic needs - which is why we are looking to those countries whose populations no longer face existential questions for help. I am hoping for a positive outcome from the 2015 Paris Climate Conference which allows for such equitable sharing of responsibilities and will therefore enable more of us to do more to tackle climate change.

It is one of the biggest energy policy challenges facing the UK: how can we heat our homes without burning natural gas? The fossil fuel currently provides 85pc of our domestic heating needs, yet if we are to meet climate change targets we must drastically curtail its use within a few decades.

According to National Grid, at least part of the answer could be found in a surprising location: your dustbin. Last week, the FTSE 100 utility giant announced a ?6.3m investment in the world's first commercially-operating plant to produce ""green"" gas from black bag rubbish.

From dirty nappies to unrecyclable packaging, the new ?25m plant developed by Advanced Plasma Power (APP) in Swindon will take household and commercial waste and process it into gas pure enough to be used in your existing gas boiler or hob. National Grid claims enough gas could one day be made this way to heat a third of UK homes.

On a sprawling industrial estate on the outskirts of the Wiltshire town, a ?5m pilot plant completed this summer with funding from energy regulator Ofgem has already proven that it is technically possible.

In the corner of a warehouse, Andy Cornell, finance director of APP, points to a large open bag full of scraps of rubbish known as ""refuse derived fuel"" - essentially waste that has been dried and shredded. ""This includes dog poo - anything that's going into black bags,"" he explains. ""Don't stand too close.""

The waste is fed up a conveyor belt into a tall metal cylinder: the gasifier, where sand heated to 800C, oxygen and steam together break it down into synthetic gas. This ""syngas"" passes into a ""plasma converter"", where it is heated to 1200C, to break down remaining tar-like residues. Outside, the cooled syngas feeds into a metal hut where a maze of pipework converts it into methane and carbon dioxide, or ""biogas"". Further processing extracts the carbon dioxide to leave a predominantly methane gas, essentially identical to natural gas.

It is hard to reconcile this small, rough-and-ready prototype with lofty aims of transforming Britain's energy mix. Even the ?25m, larger-scale project to be built here by 2018 will produce enough gas to heat just 1,500 homes. Heating 9m homes? It's a long way off.

Yet National Grid, which has declared itself at the ""forefront of a green gas revolution"" by backing this project, claims that if we are to clean up Britain's heating this represents both the easiest and cheapest option.

Although gas from waste still produces climate-harming carbon dioxide when burnt, the fact it is derived primarily from biomass plant matter, which absorbs carbon from the atmosphere as it grows, makes it renewable. By avoiding releasing carbon from fossil fuel reserves, the emissions are estimated to be at least 80pc lower than from natural gas.

The main alternative would be electrification of heating - using technologies like heat pumps. But these would require existing household gas appliances and pipe networks to be ripped out and replaced, with billions of pounds of new power plants and networks needed for added electricity demand.

Using greener gas means we can keep using existing infrastructure. ""It's not disruptive in terms of the roads and our urban environments,"" says Chris Train OBE, chief executive of National Grid Gas Distribution Limited. ""It's also not disruptive in the home, for customers. It allows us to use existing appliances.""

It would clearly also be less disruptive for the business model of National Grid, which owns and operates gas transmission and four gas distribution networks. It is currently selling a 51pc stake in the latter, valuing them at more than ?11bn.

Backing renewable gas ""reinforces the future role of gas in the energy mix"", says Train. ""That's good sense for us as a gas company.""

For the benefit of customers, he insists, it is also ""by far the lowest cost pathway"" to decarbonise heat - while helping deal with Britain's waste too.

The idea of getting energy from waste is not new. The UK's rising tax on landfill rubbish means councils and businesses are willing to pay for waste to be disposed of in alternative ways. Encouraged also by renewable energy subsidies, companies like Suez, Veolia and Viridor have built or are building 55 incinerators that produce electricity by burning black bag waste.

There is also an existing landfill gas industry, which extracts methane from dumps and burns it for power, and about 540 anaerobic digestion (AD) plants, which take food and agricultural waste or sewage and use bacteria to digest them into gas.

Although some then purify the gas and inject it into the grid, most just burn it for electricity.

The Swindon project's backers say the key advantages of their technology are that it can use a far broader range of waste types than AD plants and, by producing green gas rather than green electricity, it is solving a much trickier policy challenge.

The economics of the Swindon green gas project are underpinned by getting paid for disposing of waste otherwise destined for landfill - and also, for now at least, renewable energy subsidies. The new ?25m plant will be able to claim Renewable Transport Fuel Certificate subsidies for the gas it injects into the grid.

But APP chief executive Rolf Stein insists that, once established, it will ""absolutely"" be able to compete with natural gas without subsidy, assuming continued landfill taxes and a modest recovery in gas prices. ""If we take the government gas price projections we can see us being commercially viable without subsidy by 2025,"" he says.

Forcing the taxpayer to pay for wind farms
Letters to the Editor

SIR - The wind farm industry (report, April 15) is a mare's nest of exploitation. Not only are the promoters and landowners getting rich at the electricity consumer's expense, but they are undermining our continuity of power supply, wrecking the landscape and leaving a legacy of rusty stumps in the ground, to be removed at taxpayers' expense.

And then there really will be no electricity, and we will have to start again and build nuclear power stations, which is what we should have been doing in the first place.

Malcolm Parkin Kinnesswood, Kinross-shire

SIR - The T-pylons illustrated in Friday's Telegraph seem to offer a less obtrusive solution for power distribution, particularly as they would be lower in height than normal pylons, and they seem to be a sort of silvery grey. This leads me to wonder why wind turbines are always painted white. They would be far less noticeable if they were a neutral grey.

John Duke Winchester

SIR - The Greens may rule out fracking, but their policy on nuclear power makes it certain that the country would need to rely on a large increase in gas to cover phasedout coal power. Demand-side management cannot make up the shortfall.

This has long been the logical conclusion of decarbonisation. And socalled green groups - through opposition to nuclear power - have done as much to frustrate the practical roll-out of lowcarbon technology over the last 50 years as any large oil and gas companies. This direct contribution of green groups to climate change is a tragedy.

The Sahara and Somerset don’t strike one as obvious doppelgangers: you’re as unlikely to find date palms in the Mendips as to come across a cider brewery on a sand dune. But now they find themselves curiously connected when it comes to the future of electricity generation, representing two possible paths ahead.

The £18.5 billion nuclear plant at Hinkley Point given the green light by the government last week will be the most expensive nuclear site ever built. With a guaranteed reward to the operators of £92.50 per megawatt hour, it could significantly raise UK energy bills, not to mention the costs in long-term waste storage and security; but backing out would have risked a diplomatic cataclysm, with China and France heavily invested in the project.

Greenpeace: Hinkley Point is 'monumentally bad deal'

Following the 1973 oil crisis, French leaders seeking a form of cheap fuel in bulk supply settled on nuclear, exploiting it so successfully that it now supplies 75 per cent of French electricity, and so lucratively that France is currently the world’s largest net exporter of electricity, with an estimated $3billion annual turnover. France’s biggest supplier of uranium, after Canada (which provides 43 per cent) is the Saharan country of Niger (30 per cent).

Niger is the world’s fourth largest uranium producer, with two major mines and several smaller ones, but its uranium wealth has failed to lift the vast majority of the population out of grinding poverty (nor answer its own domestic energy needs - most of its electricity is imported from Nigeria). In Niger, 72.2 per cent of the working population survives on wages no higher than $2 per day; the country came bottom out of 188 territories ranked in the 2014 UN Human Development Index.

Since the armed struggle that has swamped neighbouring Mali since 2012, Niger has witnessed protests and strikes, a diplomatic wrangle over royalty rates, kidnappings and bomb attacks by jihadists. But it hasn’t fragmented, thanks partly to the 3,000-strong French force deployed to Niger and four other southern Saharan countries in 2014 in support of French operations in Mali. Critically for the French energy giant Areva, the uranium supply has been maintained. Whenever the tensions reach a worrying pitch, they can send for the special forces.

Is this a realistic long-term solution for France? It’s a matter of economic common sense, as much as ethics: if France wishes to have real security in the countries whose resources it exploits, it must help them answer their own energy needs, through the kind of resource responsibility and technology transfer last year's COP21 talks in Paris talks were supposed to enshrine.

Nuclear power cannot do this. Quite apart from its technical exclusivity, it is impractical in North Africa: there isn’t enough water to cool the installations, and the storage of radioactive waste would be problematic in such an under-developed region. But Africa doesn’t need nuclear, when it has plentiful access to the greatest energy resource available – the sun.

1,500 miles south of Hinkley in the southern Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant. The first phase, Noor One, went live in February, and the site is expected to reach a generating capacity of 580 megawatts by 2018 - enough to power a million homes. 500,000 crescent-shaped mirrors gleam across the desert, following the turn of the sun, sucking the heat down through steel pipes into steam-driven, energy-generating turbines.

The $9 billion Ouarzazate project hasn't lacked criticism. Its technical complexity prevented local companies from bidding to supply the units; and its physical size took away traditional grazing land. There have also been concerns about the high volumes of water needed to cool and fill the turbines. However, organisers have paid heed to local interests, giving 700 out of 1800 construction jobs to locals, and a further 850 to Moroccans from other parts of the country, and implementing a training programme linked to the local university.

Ouarzazate doesn’t offer a template, so much as an inspiration. In Niger, which has even more sunlight than Morocco, but less stability, infrastructure or water, a different model is needed. Smaller-scale installations, built in multiple locations, using photovoltaic panels, would reduce the cost, the need for water and the risk of sabotage. Rather than hindering local herders, these units could work to their advantage, providing shade for the growth of vegetation. These are tangible benefits, and along with the prospects of employment and energy self-sufficiency, they need to be taken seriously.

Greater access to energy would kickstart failing economies and help develop them; in tandem, larger plants could be built in the desert, supplying energy to Europe. African solar could be a source of stabilisation and prosperity on a local level, paying itself back and reducing some of the issues (such as jihadism, migration and narco-trafficking) that are having an increasing impact in Europe.

With improvements to interconnectors, and more widespread proliferation, the UK could soon be receiving solar energy from the Sahara  (perhaps sooner than it would take to build the three nuclear sites in southern England). The construction of a submarine cable through the Bay of Biscay is key; already a transmission line has been strung through the Pyrenees.

With improvements to interconnectors, the UK could soon be receiving solar energy from the Sahara (perhaps sooner than it would take to build three nuclear sites in southern England)
These are safe, clean, sustainable projects. There would be logistical and diplomatic obstacles, of course, but in terms of marrying political progress with economic farsightedness, they represent a far brighter future than nuclear, with its threat of radioactive waste, dangerous installations and the continued one-way exploitation of African resources.

Instead of a nuclear site at Hinkley Point, why not a solar one near Agadez, Niger? Instead of Bradwell, how about Timbuktu? Nuclear can’t do a lot for Africa, but solar can do a lot for everyone. It’s time to stop the waste and clean up our act.

Winners and losers in our warming world
British wildlife may escape lightly as temperatures rise - but there's no room for complacency

GEOFFREY LEAN
It has long been a harbinger of spring, but now its decline is set to herald a warmer world. For the cuckoo has been identified in a study as one of the English wildlife species most at risk from climate change.

The rare Dartford Warbler and iconic avocet, by contrast, are set to gain as temperatures rise. So, less happily, are wasps and ants, while the Glorious Twelfth may lose some of its lustre as the red grouse decline.

As Andrew Sells, chairman of Natural England, which carried out the study into likely winners and losers among 3,048 English species (the first on such a scale worldwide) says, ""the natural world is changing before our eyes"".

But not as much as elsewhere, since climate change is not fair. Though ours is one of the countries that has emitted most greenhouse gases per capita since the start of the Industrial Revolution, our wildlife is likely to get off lightly - while lands that have contributed little pollution, such as increasingly-awash Pacific atolls and drought-hit African states, are hit hard. The report concludes that twice as many of our species stand to flourish than decline as the world warms up.

Our luck is that more British animals and plants are closer to the northern, than the southern, limits of their ranges. And as temperatures increase, wildlife is pushed northwards and uphill. Those lower down and to the south benefit from the opening up of new territories, while those already there are squeezed into smaller spaces, or out.

Despite claims of a ""pause"" in global warming, this is already happening. The Dartford Warbler, down to just 20 birds in England some 50 years ago, has been increasing in southern England and East Anglia, while the great white egret, little egret and spoonbill have all started breeding regularly here.

Previous reports have shown something similar happening at sea, where temperatures in British waters have risen four times as fast as the global average over the past quarter of a century, partly because they are relatively shallow and partly because the North and Irish seas, and the English Channel, are all largely enclosed. Many fish species have shifted some 300km northward, with cod and haddock increasingly displaced by sea bass, hake, red mullet and John Dory.

It's less dramatic on land, but it still seems that nature has not been listening to the sceptics. Natural England's chief scientist, Dr Tim Hill, predicts ""wholesale changes in the distribution of our wild animals and plants."" Potential winners include the corncrake, chough, nightjar, cirl bunting, roseate tern, emperor dragonfly and many butterflies. But upland birds such as the hen harrier, ring ouzel, wheatear and twite are particularly at risk, as are seabirds like the kittiwake, fulmar, shag and Arctic tern - whose food supplies may also be disappearing northwards. Plants, which cannot move except through their seeds, are most vulnerable of all.

Unfortunately the picture is less sunny than the two-to-one ratio of winners to losers suggests. Wildlife areas are often so fragmented by that it is hard for many species to move; when this was taken into account, the gap between the two groups narrows to 42 to 35 per cent. There are limited habitats for some species that would otherwise arrive, or expand here, such as the purple heron, black-tailed godwit, avocet and Kentish plover.

Algal growth in warmer weather could make life harder for species - such as egrets, herons, pochard and coot - that spot food underwater. And sea-level rise (not covered by the study) can turn coastal fresh water brackish, hitting the bittern, another potential winner.

Worse, perhaps, opportunist species - such as ants and wasps - are likely to do better than many more specialised, rarer ones, causing ecosystems to become more homogenous.

Much can be done. New wetlands and other suitable habitats can be created. ""Green corridors"" of vegetation can be established to help species to move. Motorway verges and railway embankments can be better managed for wildlife. Relatively lucky as we are, we still need to adapt to climate change. Failing to prepare for its impact on our wildlife and countryside would be, as they say, cuckoo."

Stephen Tindale
Director of Greenpeace who later rejected its opposition to nuclear power, GM crops and fracking

STEPHEN TINDALE, who has taken his own life aged 54, was a former Foreign Office diplomat and adviser to Labour ministers who served as executive director of Greenpeace UK from 2001 to 2005; he resigned from the organisation, however, after experiencing a dramatic change of heart over its opposition to nuclear power, later distancing himself further from former allies by supporting GM crops and fracking.

As director of the most swashbuckling of all the environmental pressure groups, Tindale continued the activist approach of his predecessor Lord (Peter) Melchett, who became a national figure in 2000 when he led a raid on a field of GM crops in Norfolk. Among other things Tindale directed Greenpeace invasions of an American spy base in North Yorkshire and the Sizewell B site in Suffolk - a protest designed ""to expose the government's mad desire to build more nuclear power plants''.

In 2005, he was arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass after he and 35 other protesters chained themselves to Range Rover's 4x4 production line in Solihull in protest at the manufacture of gas-guzzling SUVs.

""My aim,"" Tindale declared on becoming director, ""is to get to the stage in five years' time when everyone recognises Greenpeace immediately as a fearless confronter of wrongs, but at the same time an enthusiastic and innovative presenter of solutions."" It was this last ambition, however, that led Tindale to question many of Greenpeace's most cherished slogans.

As he recalled in an interview last year, his disenchantment with the organisation's opposition to nuclear power began in August 2005 when it was reported that large parts of the Siberian permafrost were melting, giving off huge quantities of methane - a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. ""That was when I came to the gradual conclusion that nuclear power needed to be reconsidered,"" he recalled.

Tindale had the intellectual honesty to admit that ""green"" renewable technologies alone could not be the whole answer to the challenge of tackling climate change while still keeping the lights on: ""Now I believe the climate crisis is so great we must do all we can to try to control it … Some people still argue against evolution, 150 years after Darwin's discovery. But right now, if we are to survive, we cannot afford to waste even the next 150 months debating whether humanity is causing climate change.""

In 2013 Tindale recalled that he had felt unable to raise doubts about Greenpeace's anti-nuclear policy while working for it.

""When I began to question my opposition to nuclear, I knew it was time to leave Greenpeace because being anti-nuclear is central to its DNA. If I had questioned nuclear opposition I'd probably have been out of a job.""

In 2009 he joined with the chairman of the Environment Agency, Lord Smith of Finsbury, the author Mark Lynas, and the Green Party activist Chris Goodall, all former opponents of nuclear energy, to announce that they would lobby for nuclear power.

But that was only the beginning of what some diehards regarded as Tindale's apostasy. In 2015, speaking on BBC Panorama, Tindale accused groups like Greenpeace of ""putting ideology before the need for humanitarian action"" by targeting the development of GM crops in the UK. ""The overwhelming majority of scientists think that it is safe,"" he observed. ""It is, in my view, morally unacceptable to stand out against these new technologies.""

Last year he threw his weight behind the argument for fracking for natural gas as a ""central part of the answer"" to tackling climate change.

Stephen Christopher Tindale was born on March 29 1963 in Baghdad, where his father was working for the British Council, and spent his early childhood in the Middle East and Africa. He was educated at the Leys School, Cambridge, then, after working for a while in Zambia, at St Anne's College, Oxford, where he read PPE. He went on to Birkbeck College, London, to take an MSc, joined the Foreign Office in 1985 and served as third secretary in the British Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. A radical since his teens, while a diplomat he was - openly - a member of both CND and the Labour Party.

He left the Foreign Office in 1989 to join the environment movement as assistant air pollution campaigner at Friends of the Earth, then spent most of the 1990s working for the Institute for Public Policy Research and the Labour opposition as an environmental expert. In 1996 he was appointed director of the Green Alliance.

After the Labour landslide of 1997, he worked as an adviser to Labour's first environment minister, Michael Meacher, but found himself becoming increasingly disillusioned. ""Michael was battling to do the right thing, but he wasn't getting much support,"" he recalled.

Later he observed that while he always came away from meetings with Tony Blair ""thinking he's somebody you can do business with"", on the environment ""he has not delivered and is apparently incapable of delivery.""

Tindale moved to Greenpeace in 2000, initially as its chief policy adviser, upsetting some of his former Labour colleagues by publicly criticising Blair's support for nuclear reprocessing and GM crops. He had his first taste of direct action when he was arrested in December 2000 after protesting outside Nato's headquarters in Belgium against President Bush's proposals for ""star wars"" and spent half a day in a dirty cell.

Tindale tried to practise what he preached, avoiding taking holiday flights. Instead he holidayed in Britain, taking the train to indulge his great passion, hillwalking. It was important, he said, to make people see ""that you can do the right thing, be responsible, and still have fun"".

A friendly man and a lifelong Spurs fan, Tindale suffered throughout his adult life from bouts of severe depression. He first attempted suicide in 2006, and although he survived, he never fully recovered.

Stephen Tindale was twice married and divorced. He is survived by a son and daughter of his first marriage.

Stephen Tindale, born March 29 1963, died July 1 2017

Top 100 emitters of greenhouse gases urged to 'be part of solution'
By Jon Yeomans
THE Chinese coal industry and stock market debutant Saudi Aramco have been named as the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide.

As new data claims to have identified the top 100 emitters of greenhouse gases over the last three decades, a leading NGO has warned that natural resources companies need to transform their business models to adapt to a lowcarbon future.

Just 100 firms are responsible for 71pc of carbon dioxide gases released into the atmosphere since 1988, the year that climate change was first recognised as an international problem, according a report by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

Despite growing awareness of the role of fossil fuels in global warming, the CDP points out that the industry has ""expanded prodigiously"" since 1988, with coal use becoming even more prevalent. Approximately 833 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were emitted between 1988 and 2015, compared to 820 gigatonnes between 1988 and the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century.

The Chinese coal industry is by far the biggest culprit in CDP's list, responsible for 14pc of emissions, followed by oil giant Saudi Aramco, on 4.5pc, and Russian company Gazprom, on 3.9pc. London-listed giants Shell and BP chart ninth and eleventh, with responsibility for 1.7pc and 1.5pc of emissions respectively.

The CDP is part-funded by private benefactors, governments and companies and counts former Financial Services Authority boss Lord Adair Turner as an adviser.

""Our purpose is not to name and shame firms. Our purpose is to provide transparency and call attention to the quite extraordinary fact that just 100 companies played a crucial role in the problem,"" said Pedro Faria, technical director of the Carbon Majors Database.

""It's obvious they have a share of responsibility in the solution.""

While corporate transparency and self-reporting around emissions had improved, Mr Faria said that oil giants and mining companies needed transition plans in place for the shift to a lowcarbon economy.

He suggested that companies needed to think about diversifying their portfolios away from fossil fuels, adopt more renewable energy, and invest in carbon capture and storage facilities.

A spokesman for BP said that it was ""determined to be part of the solution"" to climate change. ""Specifically, we're calling for a price on carbon, increasing the proportion of natural gas in our business, investing in renewables and low-carbon innovation, and pursuing increasing energy efficiency,"" he said.

A spokesman for Shell said it backed the goal of a ""net-zero emissions world by 2050"".

""The greatest contribution we can make in the near term is providing more natural gas to replace coal in power generation, which reduces overall emissions in the global energy system,"" he said."

How green finance can change the world
Paul Fisher
As Germany hosts the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Angela Merkel has put some challenging and complex global issues at the top of her agenda, namely climate change, free trade and mass migration. And there is one crucial topic that connects all these issues - green finance.

In China last year, the G20 leaders - supported by analysis commissioned from the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) - specifically called for a scaling up of green financing to drive environmentally sustainable growth. Noting the challenges in doing so, they also called for greater collaboration with the private sector to harness the financial system's potential to mobilise private capital for green investments.

One year on, private industry has heeded this call and is ramping up efforts to support the world's sluggish economic recovery now and to de-risk future growth from the extent and impact of climate change. These actions are particularly relevant given that the theme of this year's G20 Summit is ""Shaping an interconnected world"".

Since the Paris climate agreement, I have seen a noticeable shift in focus towards the business opportunities that exist if appropriate action is taken and the right policy support is in place.

Global acquisitions in clean energy have already broken the $100bn (?77.5bn) level. India has announced that it plans to switch to 100pc electric vehicles by 2030, while the government of Emmanuel Macron, France's new president, has recently stopped granting licences for any new oil and gas exploration. Meanwhile, the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (of which CISL is a member) is focused on leveraging opportunities for green finance by determining how to integrate sustainability into the bloc's rules for the financial sector.

The issuance of green bonds doubled in 2016, and it looks set to break another record this year. Investors are actively assessing the mechanisms needed to spur green financing, including clearer long-term mandates to asset managers and more robust reporting toolkits, which can measure investment impact. In short, the emerging opportunities for finance to drive the scale and direction of reforms being discussed at the G20 Summit this year are profound.

And they will only continue to grow as the potential for bigger, better data is harnessed to inform the way environmental risks are analysed and to create a better alignment with the more traditional financial-risk tools that are already routinely used throughout the system.

Mrs Merkel has even applied this logic to stemming the tide of migration that is expected into Europe as a result of poor employment opportunities and climate-related disasters across the African continent. Africa has the opportunity to leapfrog into a ""green growth"" economy, but only if the financing is available to enable it to do so. This is not to say that the many challenges have all been met. The structure of our financial system is still too short-term in its approach, making it more difficult to invest in ideas with a longer time horizon. There is still a struggle to understand the way in which we can maximise the sustainable growth of employment and output. And we still need further consensus at the political level for how to prioritise, sequence and support the measures needed to operate within our planet's natural capacity.

A leading group of insurance businesses (known as ClimateWise) recently warned that their sector is struggling to stem the growing ""protection gap"", which is increasing the proportion of physical assets exposed to uninsurable climate risks.

The G20 leaders have a unique chance to extend the commitments they made in 2016 and harness the power of green financing as a crosscutting solution to address the many other concerns on their agenda as the global economy transitions into a new era. The business community is eagerly waiting for their commitment for the innovation, entrepreneurship and investments needed to support our collective future.

Shell boss first of 'Big Oil' executives to call for financial transparency on climate change
By Jillian Ambrose
BEN Van Beurden, boss of Royal Dutch Shell, has joined more than 100 major businesses to back calls from a G20 taskforce for the world's largest companies to come clean on the financial impact of climate change.

The taskforce, set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board (FSB), is chaired by Michael Bloomberg and aims to cast a light on climate-related financial risk to avoid incubating future global market shocks by mis-pricing companies and assets.

The world's largest oil and coal companies, including Shell, are at the heart of these concerns due to their vast reserves of fossil fuels, which could be left stranded if demand for cleaner fuels accelerates faster than expected. Mr Van Beurden is the only ""Big Oil"" boss to back the recommendations.

""I believe it is right that it should be transparent which companies are truly on firm foundations over the longterm. The details matter and I look forward to Shell working with the taskforce on those details,"" he said. More than 100 companies, with assets worth more than $11 trillion (?8.4 trillion), have committed to support the recommendations, including AXA, Aviva and BHP Billiton.

""Climate change presents global markets with risks and opportunities that cannot be ignored, which is why a framework around climate-related disclosures is so important,"" Mr Bloomberg said. ""The taskforce brings that framework to the table, helping investors evaluate the risks and rewards of a transition to a lower carbon economy.""

The challenge of reporting on climate-linked preparedness is fraught with complexity and concerns. Chief among these is the risk of disclosing commercially sensitive information. Companies are also concerned about presenting forward-looking information that is subject to myriad uncertain assumptions.

Mark Carney, Bank of England Governor and FSB chairman, said the recommendations ""have been developed by the market for the market"".

The recommendations are voluntary, but some within the 32-strong group have called for mandatory adoption of climate-risk disclosure."

Task force turns heat on high-carbon industries
Proposals for tougher disclosure rules on climate risk are spurring nervous investors into action, writes Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

Ambrose Evans-Pritchard
The G20's super-regulator has called for sweeping new disclosures on climate risks, warning that up to $43 trillion of assets could ultimately be at risk for the fossil-fuel industry and a raft of other companies exposed to global warming.

The proposals by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) amount to a radical change in the doctrine of ""materiality"" that has governed corporate reporting for almost 80 years, eroding the scope for firms to make their own judgment over what constitutes material risk.

While the regime is voluntary for now, G20 officials see it as the precursor to legally binding rules in the future. Listed companies or those with public debt are already obliged to tackle climate risk in their annual reports. This would go much further.

The FSB's Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures said companies should do more to inform investors and stakeholders about potential perils, and to explain what they intend to do about them.

Chief financial officers and audit committees should oversee the process directly, starting at companies with $1bn a year in revenue. They should weigh up the cost of what will happen if - and when - world authorities ratchet up the price of carbon to levels that really bite.

""The task force's recommendations have been developed by the market for the market,"" said Mark Carney, the FSB chairman and Governor of the Bank of England.

Mr Carney has been leading the charge on climate risk. He warns that carnage among coal companies over the last three years is a foretaste of what could happen to much bigger players in oil and gas if they fail to adapt in time to shifting political and social currents. A radical change in policy by China has shattered assumptions about coal demand almost overnight.

The task force flagged ""litigation risk"" and ""reputational risk"" building up for those vested interests that dig their heels in and brush off global concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the dangers of planetary havoc.

Mr Carney has in the past compared this to the ""long-tail"" risk that caught up with asbestos companies years later, when they and their insurers faced crippling damage suits in US courts. Tobacco companies face the same threat.

New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the task force, said the new policies, which are needed to prevent global warming exceeding two degrees above preindustrial levels by 2100, will hit markets with volcanic force, throwing up a whole new set of winners and losers. ""It is difficult for investors to know which companies are most at risk, which are best prepared, and which are taking action,"" he said.

The task force said the move to a low-carbon future will require $1 trillion of fresh investment each year. While this is often viewed as a cost by laymen, it is seen in an entirely different light by economists and market players. The demands may help to soak the glut of global savings and lift the anaemic global economy out of the doldrums with turbocharged growth.

""You have to go back to the industrial revolution to find anything like this for scale,"" said Mark Lewis, utilities chief at Barclays and a task force member. ""No doubt people are going to make a lot of money out of the new technologies. But more important, we are moving to an era when energy is going to be much cheaper and more predictable. The whole world economy is going to benefit,"" he said.

US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement under President Donald Trump may slow the switch slightly but renewable energy is becoming so competitive that markets are taking matters into their own hands.

Wind in west Texas and the north China plain, or new solar plants in Abu Dhabi, are already among the cheapest forms of energy in the world, and the cost curve is going only one way. The dash for renewables is likely to become unstoppable as energy storage comes of age in the 2020s.

Shell executive chief Ben Van Beurden backed the calls for tougher disclosure, as did BHP Billiton, Glencore and host of heavyweights in other sectors such as Dow Chemical, Unilever, Allianz, AXA, Bank of America and even the the Industrial Bank of China. Nervous shareholders are taking action. This month they rebelled and forced Exxon to draw up a report on how it will fare if the climate noose tightens. Occidental Petroleum had a similar mutiny in May.

The movement to divest from fossil fuels has clearly begun to rattle corporate boardrooms. The decision by the Church of England to pull out of coal and tar sands may have been symbolic but it becomes more serious when likes of the Norwegian Pension Fund - with almost a $1 trillion of assets - cut down on fossil exposure systematically. France's Caisse Des Depots is doing so, as is the teachers retirement fund Calpers in California.

The International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds will issue its guidelines in September. ""You may or may not believe man-made climate change is real or dismiss the science behind it. No matter. Climate change risk has arrived as an investment issue,"" said the $4 trillion investment group BlackRock.

FSB officials had hoped to crown their new regime with the G20 approval at next week's summit of world leaders in Hamburg but Mr Trump is almost certain to veto this.

The task force is ruffling many feathers in the US because the reporting and disclosure culture is so different. Daniel Yergin from IHS Markit said the measures could ""obscure material information, create a false sense of certainty, and distort markets"".

""The FSB approach, at its core, represents a radical departure from the concept of 'materiality' in financial reporting,"" he said.

""The task force has singled out one type of risk - climate change - for separate treatment, using a universal disclosure framework. In so doing, it sets aside managerial judgment. It risks politicising financial disclosure.""

The fossil fuel industry feels it has become the whipping boy for political correctness. In a sense it has.

G7 partners to continue with climate targets without the US
THE US's partners in the G7 club of wealthy democracies have vowed to pursue efforts to curb climate change despite the rift caused by the its withdrawal from the Paris accord.

""G7 countries have crucial roles and responsibilities to our own public opinion, to developing countries and to the planet,"" Italy's environment minister Gian Luca Galletti said yesterday, at the start of a two-day meeting of environmental chiefs in Bologna.

""The international community awaits our message.""

The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, attended the meeting but was due to fly home after the first day.

Despite criticising Mr Trump for his decision, Germany's environment minister, Dr Barbara Hendricks, also departed early and France's Nicolas Hulot did not arrive until today because of legislative elections.

Adding to the frustration of the Italian hosts, Britain was represented by a junior minister as efforts to form a new government in London continued.

Patricia Espinosa, the UN official in charge of implementing the Paris accord, stressed that the US's pullout would not make any difference in the short-term.

""We've all registered with regret the US decision but at the same time the US remains a party to the agreement because it foresees a three-year period before any party can withdraw,"" she said.

""So for us it is really clear that what we need to do is to go forward with implementing the accord and helping countries translate their national programme into their development policies so we can get to 2018 and have a first assessment of where we stand.""

Trump accepts truth of climate change as angry defiance grows at home
By Harriet Alexander in New York
PRESIDENT Donald Trump does believe in climate change, his ambassador to the United Nations insisted, amid widespread anger over Washington's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement on global warming.

Nikki Haley said that Mr Trump ""believes the climate is changing"" - thus ending days of dodging the issue by the administration, which refused repeatedly to state whether the president rejected the body of science.

Mr Trump has described notions of man-made climate change repeatedly as a hoax invented by the Chinese to damage American manufacturing.

However, Ms Haley said Mr Trump ""knows that it's changing and that the US has to be responsible for it, and that's what we're going to do"".

In an interview with CNN yesterday she said: ""President Trump believes the climate is changing. And he believes pollutants are part of that equation. So that is the fact. That is where we are.""

Last Thursday, tapping into his ""America First"" campaign theme, Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change deal to reduce individual nations' carbon emissions to 26 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025.

He said participating in the agreement would undermine the US economy, wipe out American jobs, weaken national sovereignty and put the US at a permanent disadvantage.

However Ms Haley said: ""Just because the US got out of a club doesn't mean we aren't going to care about the environment.""

Scott Pruitt, the head of the US environmental protection agency, also said the president did believe in climate change but insisted yesterday that Mr Trump's decision - condemned by world leaders, a host of business chief executives, Wall Street leaders and even oil executives - was good for the US.

""This is a decision that was right for this country from a jobs perspective, an economy perspective, and an environmental perspective,"" he said. ""It was not a political decision."" Confusion about the President's position was added to earlier in the week after his White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, said he did not know the president's views. ""Honestly, I haven't asked him that,"" he said. ""I can get back to you.""

Al Gore, the former Democrat vicepresident, made a scathing attack on the White House, describing the administration as appearing ""tongue-tied and confused"" about their strategy. ""Promising to recreate the 19th century is not a visionary strategy for a successful 21st-century strategy,"" he added.

Today, the mayor of the District of Columbia will become the latest of dozens to insist her city will continue its climate change policies. Muriel Bowser will sign an executive order reaffirming Washington DC's support for the agreement. A statement issued yesterday said the order will ""renew the District's commitment to the historic agreement to reduce global carbon emissions"".

Her stance follows equal defiance by the mayors of New York, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh."

Renewables industry has become too big to be destroyed by the US
JULIET SAMUEL
It seems, on the face of it, bizarre.Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the most significant international climate deal ever struck, and shares in the world's biggest listed renewable energy companies did, well, almost nothing. One of the biggest movers, wind turbine manufacturer Vestas, lost about 2pc, but, within a week, it had bounced back. For those certain that the Paris agreement was the only thing standing between us and apocalypse, the markets' resilience must be hard to explain.

For followers of the renewables industry, it's less surprising. Less than a week after Trump's announcement, Britain's renewable electricity generators had their best day ever, supplying 70pc of the country's power and sending prices into negative territory. The blustery weather helped, but it's not unusual, nowadays, for wind to generate a fifth of our electricity - compared to the negligible amount generated by Trump's favourite fuel, coal.

This isn't just a British phenomenon. The renewables industry has been growing everywhere. Last year, globally, it expanded at its fastest rate ever, increasing capacity by 9pc to 2,017 gigawatts, according to Ren21's annual status report. Even just the increase in capacity is enough to meet California's peak electricity demand more than three times over. Between 1990 and 2015, generating capacity in the OECD rose at an annual rate of 44pc for liquid biofuels and solar and 22pc for wind, according to the International Energy Agency.

Renewable energy investment is now seriously big business. Data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance show that $287.5bn (?222bn) in new money was ploughed into clean energy last year. The industry employs nearly 10million people, two thirds of them in Asia

It's no mystery why renewables are growing: they are becoming competitive. Costs are falling at a staggering rate. The cost of onshore wind has dropped by more than 35pc since 2008, IEA figures show, while the cost of solar is down about 80pc. So fast has the transformation been that solar and onshore wind projects will actually start helping to dampen power prices in Britain in the future.

UK government estimates suggest that solar and onshore wind plants set to come online in 2020 will, over their lifetime, generate electricity at a levelised cost of about ?60 per megawatt hour, a similar level to the generation cost of new combined cycle gas plants and less than half the levelised generation cost of new open cycle gas plants. Admittedly, this levelised cost doesn't include the cost of balancing the grid to take account of solar and wind's intermittent nature, but even accounting for that they are highly competitive. They might still be expensive to construct compared to gas plants, but they operate at a fraction of the cost because they do not have to buy in fuel.

Developing markets have also finally established policy frameworks and are putting investment towards renewables. China, trying to get on top of its spiralling coal pollution problems, has become the single biggest developer of renewable power and heat. Forests of wind turbines are popping up in Egypt and fields of solar panels are spreading across India.

The US's withdrawal from the Paris climate deal is not an unnoticeable event, but it will have less of an effect than outraged environmentalists think. The US had been expected to be the fastest growing market for renewables in the coming years and Trump's move might stall that. His rollback of several Obama measures, like provisions encouraging power users and grids to link up with renewable producers, is a setback for the industry.

Renewable energy has gained political as well as financial momentum, however. It's true that the industry receives about $8.8bn (?6.8bn) in US federal tax advantages each year, but because most of them are temporary, they have been falling fast over recent years, seemingly without stopping the growth in generating capacity. The fossil fuels industry receives about $3.8bn a year in federal tax breaks, but they are on a more permanent basis. Many additional tax breaks are decided by states, not the federal government, and the Paris decision will therefore have no direct bearing on them.

Trump's move was greeted by a chorus of complaints not only from non-federal politicians (not least, the mayor of Pittsburgh, once a major coal production centre) but also from major US corporations. Many see an advantage for their brand in supporting renewables - Apple boasts that its servers run off 100pc renewable power and Google has vowed to do the same. Others, like GE, have invested huge sums in clean power and resent the uncertainty Trump is creating. And it won't be as easy as it looks for Trump to bin the effects of the Paris deal. Attempts to upend regulatory arrangements for renewables will no doubt be met with lawsuits every step of the way.

For the US economy as a whole, a retreat from renewables would be something of an own goal. Europe and Asia show little sign of following suit and might instead look for ways to retaliate or create barriers to American exports produced, they might argue, under unduly loose and therefore unfair environmental conditions.American renewables companies with a less supportive home market will also be at a disadvantage compared to international rivals.

It might surprise Trump's supporters, but the industry is now simply too big and established to crumble. Climate change scepticism ebbs and flows, but for investors and companies allocating capital for the long term, it makes sense to bet on a growing presence for clean energy. With solar and onshore wind now competitive with other power sources, investment is even shifting into generating methods that were until recently seen as loony, like offshore wind. The UK is leading this field: Dong Energy recently signed up to make the biggest ever investment - a $5.7bn deal to build an enormous offshore wind farm in the North Sea.

Renewables aren't yet making inroads everywhere - heat generation and powering cars are both still heavily reliant on fossil fuels - but in electricity generation, whatever Trump may think of Paris, they are here to stay.

Brighter days lie ahead for the Paris Agreement
PAUL POLMAN
For those present at the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, this week's events will prompt similar feelings of disappointment, anger and even disbelief that in the face of all the evidence, politicians sometimes get it wrong.

But the doomed Copenhagen summit spurred on a new generation of climate advocates. People in every sector from national governments, cities, states, youth movements, faith groups and businesses, became more determined than ever to continue the fight for a global programme of climate action that would protect economic growth, create jobs, improve air quality and public health and secure a stable climate for generations to come.

The result was the historic Paris Agreement. A legally binding framework for countries to cooperate in their pursuit of these goals. Its near universal adoption was a sign that around the word people finally understood that accelerated climate action was merely a form of enlightened self-interest. We reached a point where the costs of inaction were higher than the costs of action, and everyone could see it.

That's what makes this week's decision by the US president so incomprehensible, and I remain hopeful he will reconsider his position as more evidence of the impacts on the US economy come to light.

Thanks to the direction set by Paris, the markets for innovative clean energy and energy efficient technologies are expected to expand rapidly. In fact, the agreement is expected to unlock a $13.5trillion growth opportunity by 2030 as nearly 200 countries seek to accelerate their efforts to address climate change.

The US is home to many leading businesses well placed to capture a growing share of this global market, already supporting over 3million clean energy jobs and with the potential to deliver many more. This opportunity, however, becomes harder to realise from outside the agreement.

Meanwhile, many of the jobs that the naysayers say are under threat from economic transition to a low carbon economy remain at risk because of other unstoppable factors. Increasing mechanisation and automation in many industries - including the US coal-mining industry - is the underlying driver of these shifts, not our efforts to tackle climate change.

As economies have evolved, the nature of work has always changed. Our role as leaders is to ensure a just transition, one where those who lose out for no fault of their own are provided with alternative livelihoods in the new economy. And prioritising sustainable development and climate action, and capturing the economic benefits of doing so, is our best shot at building a new kind of economy that works for everyone, everywhere.

I grew up in a small town in the Netherlands which for years had been a centre of textile production. Few there work in textiles now, as jobs have moved overseas and new industries have been established. And while the transition was undoubtedly difficult at the time, the future for the overwhelming majority has proved brighter than the past.

But this is about more than personal anecdotes. The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate has shown that a low carbon transition, with increased investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean cities, better land use and low carbon infrastructure offers us our best chance of higher quality economic growth in the decades ahead, with $90trillion needed to be spent on sustainable infrastructure globally by 2030.

And that's to say nothing of the moral arguments and our responsibility to protect vulnerable communities now as well as future generations. Any action that seeks to slow our efforts to address climate change can only hurt those most vulnerable to rising sea levels and extreme weather events, whether in New Orleans or Papua New Guinea. Even in the developed world, climate instability would leave our children and grandchildren with a level of increased resource scarcity and economic hardship that they have done nothing to deserve.

That's why the response from thousands of business leaders, city mayors and state governors has been so immediate and so potent. It's why the response of the European and Chinese political leaders has been so robust. And it's why our resolve to carry on regardless is so strengthened.

Today, therefore, I believe we should celebrate the Paris Agreement; the agreement we all helped to create. One which is more than a legal document but rather a shared global commitment to action, to chart a better direction for our businesses, our cities and our world. A global movement of this strength is bigger than any one nation state, any one person. And it's why together we will succeed in tackling climate change and building a brighter future for all.

Worthwhile move: even a modest switch to renewables could make a big difference
8 MARCH 2017 • 11:15AM
The business sector is the largest consumer of power in the country, buying around 56 per cent of all the UK’s electricity.

At this level it is clear that even a modest switch to renewable power could take a big step towards the government’s target of securing 3pc of the UK’s electricity supply from renewables by 20201. And doing so could be very good for business.

A report from management consultancy Bain & Company, Hidden Treasure2, clearly shows that switching to renewable power is the quickest and most cost-effective way for most organisations to cut their carbon footprint3.

That’s a two-for-the-price of one deal, because uptake of renewables helps quoted companies to meet investor’s sustainability criteria and compels companies to make transparent their energy consumption. But what about profits? Here are the key reasons why considering renewables makes sense.

It reduces carbon footprints

Thanks to a change in government guidelines, switching to renewable power can very quickly reduce a firm’s carbon footprint and its energy bills4. Companies can now set the renewable power they buy against their carbon targets. Businesses generating their own renewable power may offset this against the number of allowances they are required to buy under the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme5.

Switching to renewable power is the quickest and most cost-effective way for most organisations to cut their carbon footprint
These government incentives have encouraged large-scale consumers from all sectors to begin to switch to renewables, including the University of London, the real estate company Land Securities and retailer Arcadia6. Marks & Spencer’s sustainability programme improved energy efficiency in its stores by 34pc per square foot, helping save £22m from its energy bill between 2007 and 20147.

It costs less than you think and returns outweigh costs

The switch to renewables is relatively inexpensive, adding less than 1pc to power bills, according to Bain & Co. It is an investment that brings far more in benefits than it costs and particularly opens the door to demonstrate that a business is engaged in the environmentally friendly approaches at the heart of many CSR and employee engagement campaigns.

These campaigns have an increasing resonance among staff and customers, and a sustainable energy supply subsequently often forms the basis of a company-wide energy saving programme8. According to the Carbon Trust, investing 1-2pc of your energy spend on an employee energy-saving campaign can save up to 10pc of your energy bill.

British-Dutch multinational consumer goods company Unilever says it has saved more than £280m since 2008 by adopting eco-friendly measures. It plans to continue its path towards a 100pc renewable-powered business by 20309. In addition, Nordic owned furniture retailer IKEA’s Sustainability Report 2015 showed a saving of €133m (£115m) through energy efficiency measures since 201010.

It ensures energy security

“Because we want to be energy independent, we’re making the switch to renewable energy” states IKEA’s website. In its 2015 Financial Year report11 nearly 76pc of the energy used in its 19 UK and Ireland stores came from renewable sources.

With solar panels on the roofs of 10 of its stores and ownership of two wind farms, IKEA sells any surplus to the grid. It aims for “100pc renewable energy – producing as much as we consume – by 2020”. This would give IKEA cost-free energy for its business – and as anyone who has ever set foot in IKEA knows, they own some fairly large premises.

It could make energy a profit centre

A business can now be an energy generator as well as a consumer. Self-generation of renewable power to cover a firm’s own needs and selling the surplus to the grid in effect makes energy a profit centre rather than a cost.

Across Europe, E.ON has had the technology to flexibly manage large power plants for some time. The next step that the company is taking is to offer consumers decentralised generators that can be managed through a ‘Virtual Power Plant’ (VPP) digital interface, allowing unused energy to be sold back to the grid.

E.ON teams in Germany have developed a project with Bioenergie Gellersen, a group of 11 farmers around Kirchgellersen in Northern Germany.

British-Dutch multinational consumer goods company Unilever says it has saved more than £280m since 2008 by adopting eco-friendly measures
Together the farmers own and operate a 1MW biogas combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This produces more energy than the group needs, so E.ON has been helping the farmers generate revenue from spare capacity – the first time that E.ON has been able to provide a VPP developed in-house to small onsite generators.

As the German government offers a renewable energy subsidy, Bioenergie Gellersen will benefit from this reward for renewable generation and the provision of flexible energy.

E.ON hopes that the project will form the basis for an array of VPP tools, including IT systems, customer portals, communication hardware, trading interfaces, products and contracts that could be rolled out to customers with their own on-site needs, those demanding flexible industrial energy loads, or interested in investing in wind or solar PV.

While the equipment to tap into solar, wind or other alternative energy sources isn’t free to install, prices are falling quickly, and the potential contribution towards shrinking energy bills and even profitability makes renewable power an attractive proposition that ticks all the boxes of corporate, social and civic responsibilities.

It helps with corporate social responsibility

Indeed, being seen to be environmentally friendly yields commercial benefits. It builds investor confidence and supports company valuations.

Companies that buy renewable power demonstrate to stakeholders that they support regulatory and public policy initiatives towards a low-carbon economy. Corporate investments in sustainability retain and win new customers.  A survey of 1,000 UK consumers found that two thirds would recommend a brand either because it invested in its own renewable energy projects or bought most of its energy from renewable sources, reports Cleantechnica.

Being seen to invest and use renewable energy enhances corporate reputations and may save money by opening access to energy subsidies such as feed- in-tariffs. Such benefits should be hard to ignore.

Our low-carbon obsession is costing us dear
The next government must prioritise energy that is cheap and reliable if it is to mend public trust

nigel lawson
Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement has dealt a hammer blow to an elite consensus which has built up around the issue of climate change. That consensus has placed cutting carbon dioxide emissions above people's jobs and protecting the environment. With US industry already enjoying a substantial competitive advantage over European firms, this decision will make European climate policies all the more unsustainable. If Britain is to keep up with the rest of the world, it is essential that the next government rethinks energy policy to prioritise competitiveness and affordability.

The 2017 Conservative manifesto has promised to do just that, and sets a target for Britain to have the lowest energy prices in Europe. This is a striking change of tone compared with previous manifestos, but this objective will only be achieved through extensive reforms to existing policies, alongside the political will to fight powerful vested interests.

The next government will first need to acknowledge what has gone wrong. Britain's obsession with unilateral decarbonisation has taken precedence over relieving fuel poverty and keeping prices competitive. It is inconceivable how political parties can reconcile being on the side of working people while at the same time driving up their cost of living. The Climate Change Act is set to cost the UK economy approximately ?320 billion by 2030 - equivalent to funding the NHS in England for three years.

Existing energy policies that claim to be ""environmental"" are nothing of the sort. Bjorn Lomborg, the head of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre, has estimated that even if every nation meets its pledges under the Paris climate change agreement, the total reduction in the planet's temperature will only be 0.17C by 2100. With America's exit, even this paltry figure may not be achieved.

By contrast, the bad environmental consequences of energy policies have been tangible and significant. Commitments to bioenergy are damaging biodiversity and have distorted international food markets. The rare earth metals used in wind turbines come from poorly regulated mines in China which leak toxic and radioactive waste into nearby lakes on an industrial scale, perfectly illustrating the vacuity of the ""out of sight, out of mind"" attitude of virtuesignalling ""clean"" energy advocates.

But the harmful consequences of low-carbon policies are harder to ignore when they are right on your doorstep, or even inside your home. Britain's air pollution crisis is the result of misguided low-carbon policies that incentivised diesel cars. People have died because politicians couldn't resist the desire to ""save the planet"". Recent research also suggests that biomass power stations may not have lower CO2 emissions than coal and gas. What will it take for politicians to question the wisdom of spending hundreds of billions on failing policies instead of putting the needs of ordinary families first? Flexibility will be crucial to a more competitive approach. The current programme of five-yearly decarbonisation targets guarantees prohibitive costs for consumers today, and prevents the UK from taking full advantage of the falling costs of various technologies. Renewable energy lobbyists often claim that costs have come down to competitive levels; this should be put to the test by the removal of subsidies after 2020.

The manifesto also described ""the discovery and extraction of shale gas in the US"" as ""a revolution"". As a result, US manufacturers have done even better and investors are flocking back to North America; perhaps $160 billion has been earmarked for petrochemical plants alone since 2012. Proposals to change the planning law for shale applications could not come soon enough.

Energy policy in recent years has been marked out by an unhealthy relationship between government and lobbyists from large renewable energy firms. After leaving office, former energy secretary Ed Davey walked into three advisory roles with firms with links to renewable energy companies: unmistakable evidence of a ""revolving door"" between big business and government, even if no rules were broken. The power of lobbying interests can be seen clearly in the fiasco surrounding the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon. This project, promoted by another former energy minister, is expected to be formally rubber-stamped by government in the next few weeks despite being a completely uneconomic technology. If expensive projects like this continue to get the green light, the full benefits of the shale gas revolution are unlikely to be realised. Stronger safeguards against corporate lobbying will lead to better value for the taxpayer and a more competitive energy sector.

Britain's decision to leave the EU has illustrated a deep disconnect between the political elite and many people in the rest of the country who feel ignored and left behind. By leaving the Paris Agreement, Trump has delivered on his pledge to the left-behind in America. We too must now look beyond a narrow obsession with renewables to a fairer alternative that prioritises cheap and reliable energy. This will help mend broken public trust, boost the economy and put Britain on a secure footing as we look outward to trade with the rest of the world."

EU and China chastise Trump over climate
Unprecedented rebuke for president after reports that he will pull US out of Paris deal to cut global warming

By Harriet Alexander in New York
THE European Union and China will deliver an unprecedented rebuke to Donald Trump tomorrow, after reports emerged yesterday that he planned to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The United Nations deal, backed by 195 countries, aims to cap global warming at two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels through cuts to carbon emissions. The EU and China will declare that they have ""the highest political commitment"" to the Paris Agreement and ""call on all parties to uphold it"", in a united stance aimed at isolating the US on the world stage.

In a veiled condemnation of the US president, the EU and China will demand an even lower cap than two degrees. They will also promise to work together on global strategies including cooperation on green legislation, according to documents obtained by The Daily Telegraph.

""[We] are determined to forge ahead with further policies and measures,"" the statement will say.

Climate change and the shift to clean energy is ""an imperative more important now than ever"", a threat to national security, and a contributing factor to instability and the displacement of people, according to the document.

The statement yokes together climate change and free trade - two of Mr Trump's biggest bugbears - in what is, despite the diplomatic language, a clear criticism of his policies.

It calls for more free trade to allow the development of an economy low in greenhouse gas emissions. The statement is a major concession from the EU, which has trade defence measures on imports of Chinese solar panels.

""The world can count on Europe to keep global climate leadership,"" tweeted Miguel Arias Canete, EU Climate Commissioner, who was the chief EU negotiator in talks with China. ""Together, we will stand by Paris.""

Tomorrow's statement was originally planned as a way of heaping pressure on Mr Trump to observe the legally binding deal, but it will take on added significance after reports of Mr Trump's decision.

The president, who in 2012 described climate change as a hoax invented by China, campaigned on a promise to take America out of the agreement.

After the website Axios reported that he was about to pull the US out of the agreement, he tweeted that he had not yet made up his mind, adding last night that he would announce his decision ""very soon"".

He said he had been hearing from people on both sides of the issue, but did not indicate whether he had made up his mind. ""I'm hearing from a lot of people, both ways. Both ways,"" he said.

If the US does withdraw, it would join Syria and Nicaragua as the world's only non-participants in the Paris Agreement. Russia has signed the deal, but has not ratified it.

Mr Trump has argued the deal will cost the US economy trillions of dollars without tangible benefit. It would also reflect his ""America First"" approach to policy. A week ago, 20 Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell, senator for the coal state of Kentucky, wrote to Mr Trump urging him to withdraw from the deal. They said it would create ""burdensome regulations"".

But it will also set him against public opinion - 61 per cent of Americans said the US should uphold the agreement, according to a Huffington Post/You-Gov poll on May 17.

Antonio Guterres, the UN secretarygeneral, warned in New York on Tuesday about the perils of undermining the deal. ""The world is in a mess,"" he said. ""It is essential that the world implements the Paris Agreement."" Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was an enthusiastic cheerleaders for the Paris deal. On signing it last September, he said: ""We've transformed the United States into a global leader in the fight against climate change.""

Trump pulls out of Paris climate pact 'to put US workers first'
By Rob Crilly in Washington
DONALD TRUMP said last night that his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate change agreement was part of fulfilling his promise to put American workers first.

The decision was condemned immediately by environmental campaigners and by the president's political opponents who said it heralded the death of America's position as a global leader.

Speaking in the White House rose garden, Mr Trump promised to abandon an agreement that ""front-loads costs on American people"" and was damaging to the US economy.

He said he ""cares deeply about the environment"", but ""cannot support a deal which punishes the United States"".

Mr Trump's move makes good on a campaign promise to fight for the jobs of US workers but makes it harder to achieve the pact's objective of limiting global warming to less than 2C.

""The Paris Accord is a bad deal for Americans, and the president's action today is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first,"" officials said. ""The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration and signed out of desperation.""

The decision deepens a rift with allies and leaves the US standing alongside only Syria and Nicaragua as nations who are not part of the deal.

Environmental campaigners said the American absence will make it considerably harder for the remaining 190 or so countries to reach their agreed goals, given that the US is responsible for about 15 per cent of global emissions of carbon and had promised $3 billion to help other nations.

Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth US, said: ""By denying climate change and failing to act, Trump has put us on a path beset with increased famine, poverty, disease and death for millions of people in the US and across the globe.""

The US came under a last-minute flurry of pressure not to abandon the deal even as new data revealed that the Paris agreement had failed to stop greenhouse gas emissions rising in the European Union in 2015.

""Higher emissions were caused mainly by increasing road transport, both passenger and freight, and slightly colder winter conditions in Europe, compared to 2014, leading to higher demand for heating,"" the European Environment Agency said, as it reported a rise of 0.5 per cent in 2015 despite the international accord.

Other nations insist they will continue their efforts to fight global warming. The EU and China are due to unveil an alliance to tackle the problem today.

Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, said Britain would continue to press the US for action. ""We will continue to lobby the Americans and the White House to show the leadership they have shown in the past on reducing CO2,"" he told Sky News.

The Pope is among those who have cautioned Mr Trump against the move."

Merkel turns fire on 'blinkered' Trump's climate change inaction
America accused of weakening the West with its short-sighted policies and focus on the past

By Helen Nianias and Nick Allen
GERMANY stepped up its criticism of Donald Trump yesterday a day after Angela Merkel declared that the US and the UK were no longer ""reliable partners"".

Mrs Merkel, speaking at a conference on sustainable development in Berlin, reinforced Germany's commitment to tackling climate change and said it was vital not to varnish over differences with allies.

The German chancellor did not mention Mr Trump by name but quoted a 1963 speech by former US president John F Kennedy in Frankfurt, where he told his audience ""those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future"".

""With change comes insecurity, scepticism... and, not infrequently, the glorification of the supposedly good old days,"" Mrs Merkel said. ""Particularly in view of the complexity of global contexts, a wish for simple answers spreads.

""But anyone who puts on national blinkers and has no view of the world around him will ultimately get lost.""

Sigmar Gabriel, the German foreign minister, yesterday further stepped up the rhetoric, criticising Mr Trump's ""short-sighted"" policies that have ""weakened the West"".

Mr Gabriel said that ""anyone who accelerates climate change by weakening environmental protection, who sells more weapons in conflict zones and who does not want to politically resolve religious conflicts is putting peace in Europe at risk"".

""The short-sighted policies of the American government stand against the interests of the European Union,"" he said, judging that ""the West has become smaller, at least it has become weaker"".

Mr Trump has said he will make his ""final decision"" this week on whether to withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris climate accord.

Steffen Seibert, Mrs Merkel's spokesman, said the chancellor was ""a convinced transatlanticist"" and USGerman relations ""are a strong pillar of our foreign and security policy"".

""Precisely because they are so important, it's right to name differences honestly,"" he said.

It came as Theresa May said she wanted to maintain a strong partnership with the European Union over security and trade after Mrs Merkel's suggestion that the Continent could no longer completely rely on Britain.

Mrs May said it was right for the rest of the bloc to look to its future but made it clear that Britain wanted to remain a key partner.

""We are not leaving Europe. We are leaving the European Union,"" she told a campaign event in London.

""We continue to want a deep and special partnership with the remaining 27 countries in the European Union and we will continue to be committed to working with others in Europe both in terms of... a comprehensive free trade agreement but also in terms of our security.""

The Paris agreement calls for ""holding the increase in the global average temperature this century to well below 2C (35.6F) above pre-industrial levels"".

It has been signed by nearly 200 countries and was considered by President Barack Obama to be a major part of his legacy.

Mr Trump repeatedly expressed scepticism about climate change on the campaign trail last year, although later said he had an ""open mind"" on it.

Editorial Comment: Page 17

Donald Trump expressed his nation's 'boundless and undying' gratitude yesterday to Americans who have fallen in battle, hailing as heroes those buried at Arlington National Cemetery. In his first Memorial Day speech, Mr Trump said: 'Words cannot measure the depth of their devotion, the purity of their love or the totality of their courage.'"

Trump's decision is a chance to think again
The Paris Treaty, which the US is leaving, is hugely expensive and ineffective. We need a new approach

BJORN LOMBORG
Hours before Donald Trump announced that the US will quit the Paris carbon-cutting treaty, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres took to Twitter to declare that climate action is ""unstoppable"". The clear message, reinforced by European Union and Chinese leaders, is that the rest of the world will continue the Paris Treaty without US involvement. Their resolve is quickly going to smash into three incontrovertible truths.

First, the Paris Treaty will be the most expensive global agreement ever. Cutting emissions without affordable, effective replacements for fossil fuel means more expensive power and less economic growth. Calculations using the best peer-reviewed economic models show that the global price-tag of all the Treaty's promises would reach $1-$2trillion every year from 2030. Without US involvement, the rest of the world must cough up between $800billion and $1.6trillion annually. The Treaty also hinges on the delivery of $100billion a year in ""climate aid"" to developing nations from 2020 - a vow that, awkwardly, came originally from the US.

These huge costs have imperilled the Treaty since its signing. It is not hard to imagine other leaders balking.

Secondly, the agreement was always going to have a tiny impact on temperatures - but without the US it will achieve even less.

The little that any of us remember of the Paris Treaty is the bold rhetoric from leaders who said that they were committed to keeping temperature rises to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was a startling pledge.

But the rhetoric masked the reality: that the Treaty's actual carboncutting promises - which are not legally binding - only go up to 2030 and only commit the world to achieve less than 1 per cent of the carbon cuts that would be needed to keep temperature rises to less than 2 degrees Celsius. In other words, the Paris Treaty leaves 99 per cent of the problem in place.

Undoubtedly, we will hear lots of politicians talk a big game about future cuts, but experience doesn't bode well for such promises. The Kyoto Protocol was sold to the world in 1998 as the fix for global warming, and started falling apart almost as quickly as Paris.

Third, and most problematically, green energy is nowhere near ready to take over from fossil fuel.

The rhetoric is relentlessly optimistic: a typical quote, from Bloomberg New Energy Finance chairman, Michael Liebreich, is that ""renewables are robustly entering the era of undercutting"" fossil fuel prices. We have heard this for decades, but it remains wishful thinking.

Green energy is so inefficient that its deployment is almost entirely reliant on subsidies. When the UK cut solar power subsidies, installations plummeted. Spain was paying almost 1 per cent of its GDP in subsidies for renewables, more than it spends on higher education. When it reduced subsidies, new wind energy production entirely collapsed.

Subsidising the deployment of renewable energy to reduce our CO2 emissions has been a dead end. After spending hundreds of billions of dollars on annual subsidies, we only get, according to the International Energy Agency, 0.5 per cent of the world's energy needs from wind, and 0.1 per cent from solar PV. Even by 2040, if the Paris Treaty had stayed fully in place, after spending $3trillion in direct subsidies, the IEA expects wind and solar to provide just 1.9 and 1 per cent respectively of global energy.

All this means it is foolish for world leaders to stay fixated on Paris - not only will it likely falter, but it will be hugely costly and do almost nothing to fix climate change.

President Trump's decision offers an opportunity to re-think the approach. What is desperately needed is significantly higher investment in green energy research and development, so renewable technology can compete with fossil fuels.

Initiatives like the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which Bill Gates has invested $2 billion into, are a good start. But a panel of Nobel laureates, for the Copenhagen Consensus on Climate project, found that we should not just double research funding but increase it more than six times over, to $100 billion a year.

A commitment to green energy research and development is what the planet needs now from world leaders, much more than bravado.

Green energy leaves bill-payers better off
Letters to the Editor

sir - Charles Moore couldn't have got it more wrong in writing (April 29) that climate change fears are elitist and limited to those in metropolitan areas.

MPs up and down the country report increasing numbers of constituents raising this issue with them. There is in fact huge public backing for action on climate change, and in particular support for energy efficiency and renewables.

Moreover, it is a myth that climate policies are driving up energy bills: wind and gas are now demonstrably the cheapest sources of electricity in Britain. Bill-payers are better off as a result of green policy measures which drive greater efficiency. And, ultimately, our economy is stronger because of the world-leading contribution our country makes to green industries.

As we leave the European Union, we must continue to show leadership, encourage innovation, work towards energy self-sufficiency and invest in long-term sustainable energy solutions - no matter what the ever-shrinking collection of climate naysayers do to try to hinder such progress.

Theresa May can send a wind of change through the great environment debate
What the 'just about managing' need is cheap energy, not theories about saving the planet

charles moore
In October 2008, the House of Commons passed the Climate Change Act. It was snowing - the first October snow in London for 74 years - yet only five MPs took note of this divine portent and dared oppose the Bill. Under the leadership of the then Labour Environment Secretary, Ed Miliband, Britain became committed by law to reducing carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, the only country to do so.

Nearly a decade later, the Climate Change Act can be seen as the last spasm of that strange ""things can only get better"" era when, in fact, they got markedly worse. The collapse of Lehman Brothers had come in the previous month - part of a chain of events which still discredits the Western political class. It is a wellknown paradox that people only go really green when they are so confident of economic growth that they no longer fear getting poorer. From 2008, that confidence vanished and has still not returned.

That is why Theresa May is Prime Minister. Without the revolt against the elites, there would have been no Brexit, no change of Tory leadership, and therefore no need for this election. Sure-footedly, Mrs May has put herself on the side of the discontented without losing the trust of the more comfortably off.

The issue of energy and the environment ought to be perfect territory for her. London, where the ""metropolitan"" elites are, by definition, centred, is one of the warmest parts of the United Kingdom. The further out of it - especially north - you go, the colder it gets, the more you need a car, and the higher the energy element in household and commercial bills. Anyone in Mrs May's ""just about managing"" category vividly recognises this.

So it is very disappointing that the Conservative's only electoral response to this problem is to talk about capping energy prices. The impact assessments of the Climate Change Act predicted ever-increasing price rises of oil and gas, making renewables look good. The opposite has happened: oil and gas prices have almost halved since 2014, yet our bills keep going up. Today's high energy bills are the result of government policy much more than of wholesale prices or producer scams. Caps crush investment without remedying the problem.

In 2010, environment and social costs amounted to 4 per cent of the average electricity bill. Today, they amount to nearly 15 per cent. The current European spot price for carbon is €4.70 a tonne, but in Britain the carbon price floor is ?18 a tonne. Subsidies for renewables, which now stand at ?4.5 billion, are set to double by 2020. Even if we are reducing our emissions, we are not reducing the global amount of carbon. We are simply importing from other, less squeamish countries the high-energyproduced goods we used to make ourselves. We lose jobs, but don't save even our little scrap of the planet.

Not for nothing is ""energy"" the word we use to describe what oil, gas etc produce. It is what drives things on wheels or with wings, what keeps some things hot and other things cold in our houses, what makes computers work and lights shine. It is the active principle of all prosperity and therefore of any modern civilisation.

Greens understand this, and hate it.

They don't see higher prices as a regrettably necessary side-effect, but as a good thing. They actively wish to drive energy costs up to punish our evil civilisation. Peter Lilley, one of the should-be Famous Five who voted against the Climate Change Bill, refers to the torture that environmental activists want to inflict upon us as ""50 shades of green"". This is no earthly reason why a Conservative government should assist them.

The greens are right in one thing - this is a global, not just a national question. Our Government needs to learn from what is happening in the United States. America will soon be the world's largest oil and gas producer, thanks to shale. Terminals built 10 years ago for imports are now needed for exports. Donald Trump regards Obama's 2016 growth rate of 1.6 per cent as pitifully low. He sees cheap fossil fuels as the way of bringing manufacturing home to America. He will either withdraw from the Paris climate treaty altogether, or renegotiate. Russia and the Middle East will weaken as America rises.

Out of the EU, Britain could copy Trump's bonfire of controls, igniting it with good old fossil fuels. Even before we leave, we should clear the way for investors to exploit our own huge shale basins. In Scotland, where the Tories are now clearly the second party, many who have worked for fossil fuels offshore would benefit from onshore exploration. Just now, though, as American industry prospers, big chemical companies like BASF mutter about stopping investment in Britain because our energy costs are exploding.

Obviously, Mrs May cannot reverse overnight the cross-party elite orthodoxy of the 21st century. Almost nothing has so far been done to re-assess its basic assumptions. Two generations of schoolchildren have been fervently taught that climate change means the end is nigh, just as they were once told that the world was created in seven days. But Mrs May, in her low-key manner, could shift the debate with electoral success.

First, perhaps foremost, she could make it a debate about cost and secure supply. As today's joint letter on the page opposite by four think tanks, including the Global Warming Policy Forum and the Institute of Economic Affairs, argues: ""The aim must be a cheap and reliable supply of gas and electricity to cut household bills and give Britain an edge over rivals who currently pay significantly less."" She should integrate this with her ""Industrial Strategy"", which at present, as summarised on the party website, mentions neither costs nor energy. The people who dig things, build things, burn things and drive things for a living - and the people who operate the computers without whom so little can now be done - cannot thrive without competitive energy. She needs a mandate from them. This is much, much more important than workers on boards.

Second, the Tories should have another look at the evidence base. At present, the Bible of climate change economics is still Lord Stern's report of 2006. We live by his some would say preposterous assertion that ""if we don't act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be the equivalent of losing at least 5 per cent of global GDP each year, now and for ever."" More than 10 years later, it is time to announce a formal review of what the real costs are - particularly the difference between the costs of fossil-fuel and renewable options.

Finally, it is time to shift the subject-matter of environmentalism. This week, the Government was caught out in the High Court trying to delay publishing its plans for reducing the nitrogen dioxide produced by diesel engines which - let it never be forgotten - we were bribed to switch to because diesel contains less carbon. Climate change is often a highly speculative debate about what might one day happen. Pollution, on the other hand, is often a problem about something which is making millions of people ill right now. Tories should look coolly at the former, and turn up the heat against the latter.

So wind power - strictly in its metaphorical sense - is what this election needs. If Mrs May does not deploy hers on the environment, she misses a unique chance."

Cutting fuel bills
Letters to the Editor

sir - Brexit and the election provide a major opportunity to reset energy policy, but what we've heard so far has not been encouraging.

Capping prices for some consumers will lead to higher costs for others, discourage much-needed investment, and reduce competition. Government intervention has already contributed significantly to higher energy bills.

The principal culprit is the Climate Change Act, which forces deployment of unproven technologies at scale. The fossil fuel price forecasts used for the Act in 2008 have proved woefully inaccurate, making a review of the underlying economics a necessity.

The Carbon Price Floor (proof of the failure of the EU Emissions Trading System) places a unilateral burden on British industry. It should be scrapped.

It is also time to put the renewables industry's claim that they are cheaper than conventional energy to the test by removing subsidies in 2020.

While America has reaped the rewards of a booming onshore shale industry, Britain is still waiting. Rapid action should be taken to accelerate its development.

The aim must be a cheap, reliable supply of gas and electricity to cut household bills and give Britain an edge over rivals who now pay less.

UK to axe EU's green targets
EU green energy targets to go after Brexit

By Steven Swinford DEPUTY POLITICAL EDITOR
BRITAIN is preparing to scrap EU green energy targets that will add more than ?100 to the average energy bill as part of a bonfire of red tape after Brexit.

The UK is currently committed to getting 15 per cent of all energy from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2020.

Ministers have long been critical of the targets because they exclude nuclear power, carbon capture or gains from energy efficiency. The UK is currently on course to miss the target and incur millions of pounds in fines from the EU.

Government sources told The Daily Telegraph that the target, under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, is likely to be scrapped after Brexit.

The Telegraph has called on the Conservative Party to promise a bonfire of EU red tape in its 2020 manifesto to put Britain on a radically different course.

Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary, has ""applauded"" the campaign and he backed calls to sweep away decades of ""burdensome"" EU regulations after Brexit. It comes after civil service documents, photographed on a train, revealed Britain plans to scale down concern on climate change after Brexit. Details of the policy change were contained in the papers of a senior civil servant at the Department for International Trade photographed by a passenger this month.

The notes say: ""Trade and growth are now priorities for all posts - you will all need to prioritise developing capability in this area. Some economic security-related work like climate change and illegal wildlife trade will be scaled down.""

Earlier this month Bloomberg, the news agency, revealed that officials at the Treasury and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been discussing axing the renewables target.

The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires the UK to generate 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. The target has led to billions of pounds of government subsidies for renewable power sources such as wind, solar and biomass power plants, which are ultimately paid for by customers through their energy bills.

The National Audit Office estimated that green energy subsidies will cost every household ?110 a year by 2020.

Owen Paterson, a Conservative MP and former environment secretary, said: ""It's distorting the whole energy market. It's like the Sheriff of Nottingham - it transfers money from my poorest constituents to my wealthiest constituents who are putting up pointless wind turbines heavily subsidised. I would be happy to see the back of it.""

According to a Commons report, ministers will have to import 19,000 EU rules and regulations on to our statute books as part of the Great Repeal Bill, which will take shape in a white paper published on Thursday.

Telegraph-5.txt,"1.1 billion reasons why light poverty must be eradicated
Across the globe the combined populations of Birmingham and Bristol die needlessly every year through light poverty, says Eric Rondolat of Philips Lighting
A child does homework by candleight 
A child does homework by candleight  
By Eric Rondolat, Chief Executive Officer, Philips Lighting3:50PM BST 11 Sep 2015
The resourcefulness of the human race never ceases to surprise. We’re learning how to 3D print human organs; travelling in self-driving cars; and recently landed a spacecraft on the surface of a comet more than 500 million kilometers away.
Yet, for all of these triumphs of ingenuity, we live in a world where 1.1 billion people – more than one in seven – still do not have access to electric light.
The lack of this most fundamental service puts a stranglehold on human development. Without artificial light, life as we know it grinds to a halt at sunset. Communal life stops, children are unable to study, and businesses are forced to close.
Deprived of electric light, people resort to candles, kerosene lamps and fires to counter darkness – all too often with devastating consequences. These primitive light sources claim the lives of 1.5million people every year through fires and respiratory illnesses – the same number killed annually by HIV related illnesses.
Light poverty and the millions of associated deaths are avoidable – the technology to balance this inequality is all around us and taken for granted across most of the world. In those countries blighted by light poverty, the difficulty lies in administering the cure, not in creating it.
At first glance, the obvious solution might appear to be for affected countries to invest in electric grids and power plants to provide a reliable energy supply – and thus light – to all their citizens. However, the geography of many developing nations makes this simply unfeasible both logistically and financially. Furthermore, in many of those communities deemed to have access to electricity, erratic grid connections regularly plunge homes and businesses into darkness without warning.

Instead, the focus should be on developing off-grid solutions that give communities – particularly in rural areas – a dependable and sustainable energy source. As recent research by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) suggests, solar-powered LED lighting provides a low-cost alternative that not only alleviates light poverty but also reduces carbon emissions, indoor air pollution, and health risks.
The economic argument for solar-powered LED systems is irresistible too. For example, families in the Democratic Republic of Congo spend up to 30 per cent of their annual income on fuel for kerosene lamps. And some African households are buying lighting at the equivalent of £65 per kilowatt-hour, more than 100 times the amount paid by people in developed countries.
A single solar-powered LED lantern uses zero energy and can fill a room with electric light without any carbon emissions or noxious fumes for a one-off cost of less than £15 – compared to the £33 average annual fuel bill of running a kerosene lamp.
On a larger scale, community light centers that combine energy-efficient LED luminaires with solar panels can produce sustainable lighting for public places such as markets and sports grounds, without the need for costly infrastructure. These centers are relatively inexpensive, easy to install and maintain, and far more reliable than electric grids, which can suffer from outages in remote areas. Philips will have installed more than 100 of them in rural Africa by the end of this year.
These and other projects and initiatives, such as the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association, are helping drive down the proportion of people trapped in light poverty. The latest research by the World Bank suggests that the number of people without access to electric power fell from 1.2 billion to 1.1 billion between 2010 and 2012.
A solar lantern 
A solar lantern
But progress is simply too slow, particularly in the worst affected areas. In Africa, the latest projections suggest that the number of people with no access to electricity is likely to rise from 600 million to 700 million by 2030.
Part of the problem lies in red tape. Inadequate and outdated regulations and subsidy schemes stifle the adoption of off-grid solutions in many parts of Africa. The introduction of VAT and tariff exemptions, together with minimum quality standards can create an environment conducive to helping cheaper off-grid technologies thrive.
Such measures, according to research by UNEP, have helped millions of low-income households beyond the grid to gain access to clean and sustainable lighting. In Ethiopia, for example, collaboration between the World Bank, the Government of Ethiopia and Lighting Africa established a US$20 million financing facility for off-grid solutions. Within 18 months, the scheme enabled more than 300,000 quality-verified solar lighting products to be imported, providing one million Ethiopians with access to electric light.
The benefits of intervention extend beyond those communities affected. Bringing one-seventh of the world population out of the dark would deliver a huge boost to global GDP by promoting education and business growth.
Recognizing the scale of the problem and its impact on social and economic development, the United Nations proclaimed 2015 the International Year of Light. It aims to bring together governments, private sector partners and scientific bodies, and raise awareness of the power of light-based technologies in solving global challenges in energy, education, agriculture, public infrastructure and health.
But with more than half the year gone, governments and businesses must seize this moment to embrace the technology at their disposal and immediately begin delivering lasting change to communities left in darkness.
The combined pledges from the European Commission, individual European countries and the USA during the UN Climate Summit, can halve energy poverty by 2030. But I believe we need to go further still. 60 per cent of the global population will be living in cities by the time we reach the year 2030, increasing the world population by a little over 1 billion, challenging access to secure, more sustainable, safe energy such as electricity for lighting.
Political will, combined with entrepreneurial drive, can snuff out this injustice if cemented by shared determination and vision. Without a concerted effort, the equivalent of the combined populations of Birmingham and Bristol will continue to die needlessly every year through light poverty. The time to act is now."

Absurd targets

Government sources say that the Tories will scrap the EU's green energy targets when legislation is repatriated to Britain. This is excellent news and one of the very best reasons to have supported Brexit. Leaving the EU must result in a more competitive economy - it would be ridiculous to swap Brussels bureaucracy for Westminster meddling.

The targets are absurd: 15 per cent of energy must be met by renewable sources by 2020, excluding even nuclear. The only way to accomplish this is via public subsidy, which, it is estimated, will cost the average household an extra ?100 per year. Renewable energy will be part of the future mix, for sure, but let it serve human need, not green ideology. Why rob the consumers only to provide them with technology that is often inefficient and unreliable? If the Government scraps the target then it will be a victory for our campaign to cut EU red tape. That said, there is a great deal of UK red tape that needs looking at, too. The Climate Change Act 2008 was a unilateral decision to commit Britain to cutting carbon emissions by 80 per cent within five decades. It proved that the British are capable of making mistakes all by themselves."

Trump puts an axe to Obama's climate legacy by lifting coal curbs
By Nick Allen in Washington
PRESIDENT Donald Trump set out to obliterate his predecessor Barack Obama's legacy on climate change yesterday as part of a bid to unleash America's energy potential.

Mr Trump last night signed a sweeping executive order slashing measures from the Obama era, a move that was welcomed by the oil and coal industries as a bold step to end regulations that were ""choking"" the economy.

Environmentalists condemned the move, accusing Mr Trump of wanting to ""travel back to when smokestacks damaged our health"", and said they would take his administration to court.

The president specifically targeted the Clean Power Plan, Mr Obama's signature effort to tackle global warming. Signing the order, Mr Trump said: ""My administration is putting an end to the war on coal. With today's executive action I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion and to cancel job-killing regulations.""

Standing next to a group of miners at the Environmental Protection Agency, he said it marked a ""new era in American energy"". Mr Trump said: ""We are going to start a new American energy revolution, one that celebrates American production on American soil.""

He added: ""This is about bringing back our jobs, bringing back our dreams, and making America wealthy again. We love our coal miners.""

Mr Obama's plan required states in the US to cut carbon emissions from power plants collectively by 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.

That measure was introduced in 2014, but has been stalled in the courts following challenges in Republican states. It was key for the US to meet obligations under the 2015 Paris climate accord, which has been signed by nearly 200 countries. In the election campaign Mr Trump promised to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, but since taking office he has not mentioned it and neither did the executive order. The issue was believed to be still under discussion at the White House.

Last night ExxonMobil, the giant oil company, urged the Trump administration to stay in the Paris agreement, calling it an ""effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change"".

Scott Pruitt, Mr Trump's administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the president was ""setting a new course"". He added: ""It's going to create jobs in the oil and gas sector. For too long, over the last several years, you've had certain industries, certain sectors of our economy, that were within the cross hairs of the EPA. That is not going to happen any more.""

Mr Pruitt caused controversy recently by saying he was not convinced that carbon emissions from human activity are the primary driver of global warming.

In all, Mr Trump's ""Energy Independence"" order blocked half a dozen anti-global warming executive orders signed by Mr Obama. It included ending a moratorium on leasing government-controlled land for coal mining and eased limits on methane emissions from oil and gas production.

The president also made clear that the issue of carbon emissions would be less of a consideration in future when making decisions about infrastructure projects.

A White House official said: ""The previous administration devalued workers with their policies. We can protect the environment while providing people with work.""

During the election campaign, Mr Trump repeatedly vowed to ""put coal miners back to work"" and criticised Mr Obama for waging a ""war on coal,"" a stance that helped him win key states like Pennsylvania.

Tyler White, president of the Kentucky Coal Association, said: ""I cannot tell you how many jobs the executive order is going to create, but I can tell you that it provides confidence in this administration's commitment to the coal industry.""

However, Tom Steyer, the billionaire head of activist group NextGen Climate, said: ""These actions endanger the health, safety and prosperity of every American."""

False claims on low-carbon energy are damaging UK
RUPERT DARWALL
The Committee on Climate Change was established by the 2008 Climate Change Act to act as the climate policy equivalent of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. Ministers and Parliament are required by law to rely on its advice. Arguably this role gives the committee more influence over Britain's long-term prosperity than anyone else. A public body, funded by the taxpayer to the tune of ?3.8m a year, discharging such a crucial role requires competence, honesty and objectivity.

The committee's recent report on energy prices is deficient in all three, instead displaying similar ethical standards to Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth. Yes, low carbon electricity is more expensive than burning fossil fuels, the report conceded, but overall, low carbon policies were making people better off because energy efficiency policies meant that people were consuming less electricity.

That might come as news to people shelling out for LED lighting, as the report assumes investment in energy efficiency costs nothing, and it recycles a claim made by the disgraced energy and climate change secretary, Chris Huhne. As Peter Lilley wrote last year, this was a graver distortion of the truth than the dishonesty over who was driving a speeding car that landed Huhne in jail. It now forms the centrepiece of the climate committee's spin that meeting Britain's emissions cuts is not costing consumers a penny because the cost of green policies is more than offset by energy efficiency. But, as Lilley showed, it ignores the fact that industry bears two thirds of the cost of low carbon policies, with all that means for jobs, living standards and exports.

The climate committee's report attempts to rebut this. British firms do pay more for electricity than virtually all their overseas competitors, the committee concedes. However, it claims the culprit is not green policies, but wholesale and network costs. Lord Deben, the Tory peer who chairs the committee, claims to be baffled. Even though other European countries have similar low-carbon policies, industrial electricity prices in Britain are higher, ""and that is not the result of green measures."" He gets ""pretty annoyed"" when power utilities claim otherwise.

But Deben's claim is demonstrably false. Contrary to what the Committee on Climate Change asserts, Britain's decarbonisation policies are not the same as other European countries. They are much more aggressive. When, in 2007, Germany proposed the EU adopt renewable energy targets, to the horror of the Treasury and Alistair Darling's Department of Trade and Industry, Tony Blair gave Britain the most aggressive wind and solar targets of any member state. With Blair gone, Gordon Brown's government rejected proposals for a unilateral carbon price floor. The idea was to prop up the price of carbon allowances credits under the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme. This sensible approach was abandoned by the Coalition government. To show climate leadership, the Coalition Agreement promised a carbon price floor, which duly came in George Osborne's 2011 budget. It was criticised by the energy committee, which argued in 2012 that unless the price of carbon was increased across the EU, ""taking action on our own will have no overall effect on emissions other than to outsource them.""

Of the ?1.9bn the Treasury is raising this year from the climate change levy, around three quarters comes from the carbon price floor at ?18 per tonne and the rest from auctioning off new emissions allowances at around ?5.20 a tonne.

In fact, the impact of the carbon price floor on electricity costs is greater than the sums reaped by the Exchequer, as it gives investors in low-carbon capacity, especially nuclear, the ability to price up to the floor. Rather like airport duty-free shops, it turns them into quasi-tax collectors lining their own pockets.

This huge annual windfall helps explain how in 2015 the owners of Britain's nuclear power stations collected ?994m in operating profits. Over the same period, the Big Six's gas and coal-fired power stations, which generated 65pc more electricity than nuclear, racked up ?405m in operating losses. The carbon price floor is the principle reason why coal generation, Britain's cheapest source of electricity, is being forced off the grid, even though Germany expects to keep operating its coal-fired power stations until 2040.

Driving down energy consumption and pushing up high-fixed-cost generating capacity is a formula for ever-rising electricity prices. Between 2013 and 2015, the price of fossil fuels used by the Big Six to generate a megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity fell by 20.1pc. Network costs rose by 9.8pc and green and other government levies rose by a whopping 26.6pc per MWh of electricity supplied by the Big Six. While the rest of the world enjoyed the benefits of plunging fossil fuel prices, electricity prices in the UK rose by 4.2pc. This is not the fault of the Big Six. The blame rests fairly and squarely on government policies.

Dismissing industry's concerns about the impact on competitiveness and trade, the Committee on Climate Change's answer to manufacturers and exporters is worthy of Marie Antoinette: Let them eat energy efficiency. If Britain is to continue down this road to ruin, at least it should be done in full knowledge of the economic and social consequences and not on falsehoods pumped out by the Committee on Climate Change.

Foreign aid 'wasted' on green energy plans
Energy funds 'scandalously wasteful'

By Robert Mendick Chief RepoRteR
SERIOUS questions are raised today over hundreds of millions of pounds of British taxpayers' money being ""wasted"" on climate change projects such as an Ethiopian wind farm and Kenyan solar power plant.

A Daily Telegraph investigation shows little benefit so far from a ?2 billion foreign aid programme to tackle climate change that was established eight years ago. One scheme, costing ?260million of UK taxpayers' money, has produced only enough renewable electricity to power the equivalent of 100 British households.

Projects including solar parks in Kenya and Mali, a rubbish-burning power plant in the Maldives and wind farming project in Ethiopia are all earmarked for funding from the scheme.

The investigation raises major concerns over the use of international aid money to fund complex renewable energy schemes in some of the world's poorest countries. It will also reignite the row over the Government's commitment, championed by David Cameron, to ring fence the ?12billion annual foreign aid budget, which is fixed at 0.7 per cent of national income.

Critics have accused the Government of ""scandalously wasting"" taxpayers' money on the schemes.

While officials insist publicly the climate change schemes are working and should only be judged in 2023 at its end point, the Department for International Development (Dfid) has expressed concern over delays to projects and the management of them.

One senior source said ministers inside Dfid are questioning whether the money would have been better spent on humanitarian causes instead. The complex set of schemes - known as Climate Investment Funds - are run by the World Bank, with almost one-third of the ?6.75billion total funding provided by the UK Government. No other country has put in so much cash.

The funds, consisting of four separate schemes, are intended to kick-start green energy projects such as the building of large-scale wind and solar farms in poorer countries and environmentally friendly public transport.

One of the four schemes - the ?630million Scaling Up Renewable Energy Project (SREP) - was set up with the help of ?268 million from the Dfid and the now defunct Department for Energy and Climate Change.

But at the halfway point of the project to provide renewable energy and improve energy access in 28 of the world's poorest countries, including Haiti, Ethiopia and Bangladesh, little appears to have been achieved by way of effective results. To date, just three SREP-funded projects - two in Honduras and one in Nepal - are producing either green electricity or improving access to it. A further 20 approved projects are not making any positive impact, according to an annual report published at the end of last year.

A second scheme - The Climate Technology Fund (CTF) - to which the UK has contributed ?1.2billion, is intended to deliver green electricity and reduce emissions in ""middle income"" countries including gas and oil rich Kazakhstan as well as India, Turkey and Morocco. More than halfway through the scheme, set up in 2009, it is supplying about seven per cent of the renew-able energy expected by 2023. To date, only 26 projects out of 70 approved schemes under the CTF have reported any benefit. The vast majority of the projects do not record any figures at all.

A senior Dfid source said: ""Ministers have called in a number of climate programmes for close scrutiny to ensure they are on track and delivering.""

The insider added: ""The money would be better spent on our humanitarian response with proven results than some of the incredibly complex climate programmes.""

Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a charity strongly critical of British green energy policy, said: ""Overseas development projects have long been plagued with expensive failures, but the current crop of climate change and renewable energy initiatives are showing strong signs of being the most negligently conducted and scandalously wasteful to date.""

The Government defended the performance of the funds. A spokesman said: ""The Climate Investment Fund is helping provide the world's poorest people with stronger defences to extreme weather which can cause lifethreatening crises such as floods, droughts and famine.

""The UK's investment is already delivering results by producing reliable sources of food, improving infrastructure and giving people access to clean energy, and all programmes are on course to meet the published performance targets for 2023.""

Money mountain Where the millions are being spent

Upcoming projects earmarked for funding under SREP: Ethiopia: Assela wind farm project Kenya: Kopere solar park Mali: Solar park Solomon Islands: Renewable energy project Maldives: Waste-to-energy project to burn rubbish on Thilafushi island Kenya: Menegai geothermal project Cambodia: Biomass project These projects are up and running: Nepal: ?9.7million project to improve access to renewable energy providing benefits for 6,600 people Honduras: ?2.4 million project to promote clean cook stoves benefitting 795 people.

Also a ?4.5 million 'renewable energy' programme that will provide 276MWh via solar panels"

Brace for fall in oil use, says Shell chief
Ben van Beurden warns energy providers to expect rapid changes amid fears over climate change

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Houston
SHELL'S chief executive Ben van Beurden has warned global energy leaders to brace for the shock of falling oil use as soon as the 2020s, warning that those who trivialise the threat of climate change will exhaust public tolerance for fossil fuel companies if they are not careful.

""We have to acknowledge that oil demand will peak and it could already be in the next decade. It could happen. There are people who believe it will grow forever but I don't subscribe to that,"" he told the CERAWeek energy forum of IHS Markit.

Mr van Beurden said the industry is skating on thin political ice - notwithstanding the election of Donald Trump in the US - and needs to shore up its flank. ""Social acceptance is just disappearing. I do think trust has been eroded to the point that it is becoming a serious issue for our long-term future,"" he said. ""This is the biggest challenge of my career. We're under a lot scrutiny and pressure. It is not a rational discussion any more, it's emotional,"" he said. Regulators are starting to demand that fossil fuel companies account for ""stranded assets"" and financial risks from climate change, leading in turn to shareholder pressure.

Claims of peak demand are anathema in the US oil capital of Houston. ""Wishful thinking,"" said Chevron's chief John Watson. Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih said talk of peak demand is dangerous, discouraging investment before alternatives are on offer. Mr van Beurden advised the oil and gas industry to take an activist approach to show it takes the threat of global warming seriously. Shell is already the biggest provider of renewable energy in the US through its wind farms. It is planning to invest $1bn a year in green technologies, and carbon capture and storage. Shell can afford its ""moral"" position because it has already made the switch to natural gas, the lone fossil fuel winner of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Gas emits roughly half the C02 of coal in power generation.

""The largest contribution Shell can make to reducing emissions globally in the near term is to continue to grow the role of natural gas,"" he said. The company has finished integrating BG following the $52bn takeover in 2016, creating a gas giant and $4bn of synergies this year.

The BG merger is one prong of the strategy. The recent sale of $8.5bn of oil sands acreage in Canada is another. Shell is today far less exposed to the political risk of climate change.

The group has not abandoned oil, although it has pulled out of Alaska where it wasted $9bn on a ""dry well"". The company has a deepwater megaproject in the Gulf of Mexico, and is expanding shale operations in Argentina. Shell's free cash flow at $60 oil prices will soon be more than twice as high as it was in the era of $90 oil. ""We can make projects work at $40, with many at break-evens below that,"" he said.

Despite new fossil forays, Mr van Beurden is positioning himself as ""Mr Green"", pushing for a meaningful tax on carbon emissions. Such pieties raise eyebrows in Houston.

""People may think we are an NGO from the Hague in this city. In the Netherlands we're still know as one of the dinosaurs,"" he said."

Unloved green energy scheme axed after it failed to curb bills
By Jillian Ambrose
THE UK will give up on the controversial scheme that was meant to limit the cost of supporting green energy projects and keep a lid on consumers' bills.

The Treasury pledged to replace the cost control scheme, known as the Levy Control Framework, after a scathing report by the National Audit Office (NAO) criticised problems that left consumers' facing much higher bills than expected.

The LCF was created in 2011 by the now defunct Department of Energy and Climate Change to manage the subsidies paid to projects such as wind and solar farms. It was supposed to cap the cost of supporting renewable energy, which is ultimately paid for by consumers through their bills. However, the NAO said the department bungled the LCF's management and failed to spot overspending on subsidies because they were using out-of-date assumptions.

Originally, the Government said the LCF would cap costs at ?7.6bn by 2020-21 but within four years it admitted that costs had spiralled to over ?9bn.

The overspending sparked a swath of sudden subsidy cuts for onshore wind and solar power projects, which reduced the cost forecast to ?8.7bn, according to the NAO. This will translate to ?110 on the average energy bill by the end of decade.

Richard Black, director of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, branded the LCF ""a blunt instrument"" and said ""few people will be sorry to see it go"".

""Whatever replaces it needs to lead the UK towards the smart, flexible power network that, according to the National Infrastructure Commission, will lop ?8bn off our national energy bill,"" he said.

The renewable energy sector is eager for certainty over the future of government support in order to attract fresh investment into the sector and help to drive technology costs lower.

Instead the Renewable Energy Association said the Budget had created new uncertainty by failing to outline the new plans for renewable energy or the future cost of carbon emissions.

""The industry was expecting an announcement regarding the future budget levels and structure but this has been delayed and instead we face a new regime and no clarity on the proposed new 'set of controls',"" said policy director James Court.

Emma Pinchbeck, the executive director of RenewableUK, added: ""Energy infrastructure takes time to build. Projects being thought about today will come online in the 2020s.

""We need to ensure that developers and investors in wind, wave and tidal energy projects have certainty so that projects can be built.""

SNP's rates rise puts green energy firms' futures in doubt
By Auslan Cramb SCOTTISH CORRESPONDENT
THE Scottish Government has been accused of abandoning its green agenda after research found that small-scale renewable projects could face business rates rises of up to 650 per cent.

Scottish Renewables warned that the huge increases could threaten future investment in smaller hydro, wind and solar projects.

Hannah Smith, its policy manager, said it was ""unrealistic"" to expect a company of any size to absorb increases on that scale overnight.

She added: ""Projects which are affected are not only contributing to meeting our energy and carbon reduction targets but are also supporting jobs and investment in communities across Scotland."" The group has called on Derek Mackay, the finance minister, to intervene and extend the government's renewable energy rates relief scheme to cover small-scale renewable installations and district heating schemes. Alba Energy, representing hydro operators across the country, said the new regime of business rates marked out hydropower for ""special punishment"".

It added that an average scheme such as the 500kW Buckny Hydro in Perthshire had seen its draft valuation rise from ?32,000 to ?93,000, representing 29 per cent of its turnover. The worst-hit schemes have seen increases up to seven times their original value, with rateable valuations of up to 50 per cent of turnover. A spokesman said that many in the hydro industry fear ""the Scottish Government has abandoned its green agenda"".

Martin Foster, chairman of Alba Energy, said: ""Hydro is the original renewable energy source: the cleanest, most efficient, least obtrusive and longest-lasting.

""Yet the Scottish Government has facilitated a rates regime that will cripple the independent hydro industry it once claimed to support - while leaving the big energy companies unaffected.""

Liam McArthur, Scottish Liberal Democrat energy spokesman, said any loss of investment in smaller projects would make the government's climate change targets harder to achieve.

He added: ""The situation is not helped by the Scottish Government's decision, as in previous years, to ignore calls for transitional rates relief, which would allow changes to be introduced more gradually.""

A spokesman for the Scottish Government said the rating valuation of business properties was undertaken by independent assessors, and business rate payers could appeal against their valuation.

He said the government had announced a package of action to reduce business rates as part of Mr Mackay's draft budget, and was committed to expanding renewables relief.

Ministers aim to produce 50 per cent of the energy required for the country's heat, transport and electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030."

Prince: Climate is wolf at the door
Charles urges leaders to meet challenge of global warming in foreward to his new Ladybird book

By Gordon Rayner CHIEF REPORTER
THE Prince of Wales has described climate change as the ""wolf at the door"" as he urged world leaders to take immediate steps to combat what he sees as the biggest threat to the planet's future.

In his bleakest comments on the subject to date, the Prince says action on climate change ""must be urgently scaled up, and scaled up now"".

The Prince's warning, which will be interpreted as a direct message to Theresa May and Donald Trump among others, is contained in the foreword to a new Ladybird book he has co-authored, called Climate Change, which is published next week.

Intriguingly, Mr Trump has said he plans to meet the Prince ""in the coming weeks"", which would give the Prince an early chance to press home his point to the man who will be inaugurated as US president today.

Mr Trump has previously said that ""the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive"".

Clarence House said no meeting had been scheduled, but conceded that the two men were likely to meet at a State visit for Mr Trump which is already being planned. A spokesman for the Prince said: ""It is the thing he is most concerned about. He regards climate change as the No 1 threat to the planet and it is the thing he cares most passionately about.""

In his foreword, he says: ""I hope this modest attempt to alert a global public to the 'wolf at the door' will make some small contribution towards encouraging requisite action; action that must be urgently scaled up, and scaled up now."" In 2015 the Prince addressed world leaders with a seven-minute speech at the climate change summit in Paris, saying: ""We must act now.""

He has also raised the subject in his so-called ""black spider memos"" to ministers. In 2005 he wrote in a letter to the then prime minister Tony Blair in which he raised ""the enormous problem of climate change"" and suggested: ""You might find it worthwhile to explore not just what industry can do to cut emissions, but also ... energy efficiency could make a huge difference."" The Ladybird Expert series book was co-written by Tony Juniper, a fellow of the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and Emily Shuckburgh, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.

In an interview that will appear in tomorrow's Telegraph Magazine, Mr Juniper said: ""He wanted to present something everybody can read that cuts through some of the deliberately confusing misinformation that's been put out there over the years, which I know he is very frustrated about."" He said the Prince had been ""deeply involved at every stage"" of the book's production and insisted on it being peer-reviewed to make sure nothing in the text could be disputed.

After it was checked by seven academics, Mr Juniper said: ""These must be among the most thoroughly crawledover 5,000 words in any book anywhere."" This weekend the Prince will promote the book through a newspaper article and a television interview, an unusual move that reflects the urgency with which he views the subject.

The Prince has been expressing his concerns about climate change for decades and has become increasingly dismayed by the inaction of world leaders who have persistently failed to meet internationally agreed targets for reducing the causes of global warming. He will no doubt relish the chance to talk to Mr Trump, who discussed his plans for meeting the Prince when having his photograph taken for the cover of Time magazine at the end of last year. He noticed that the photographer, Nadav Kander, had also taken a portrait of the Prince for a 2013 cover of Time, and, according to Michael Scherer, who wrote a profile of Mr Trump, ""Trump was excited because he plans to meet with Prince Charles in the coming weeks, and offered to take him a copy of the Nadav portrait"".

A royal source said there was ""no meeting planned at this stage""."

Move to cut pollution with first low emission zone in Scottish city
By Hamish Macdonell
DRIVERS of highly polluting vehicles could be charged to go into the centre of one of Scotland's cities from next year, the Scottish Government announced yesterday. Ministers want to pilot a ""low emission zone"" to keep the worst polluters out of one of Scotland's cities. The plan, an SNP pledge in its manifesto, was included in the Scottish Government's climate change strategy published yesterday.

The document stated that ministers would ""collaborate with a local authority to put in place a pilot low emission zone by 2018"". The aim would be to prevent lorries from polluting the most congested streets, but will also be likely to catch vans, some taxis and older diesel cars, particularly 4 x 4 vehicles.

Edinburgh's St John's Road and Glasgow's Hope Street were named this month as Scotland's most polluted streets. Hugh Bladon, a spokesman for the Alliance of British Drivers, said politicians appeared to have a ""hatred"" of car drivers.

The pilot was announced by Roseanna Cunningham, Scotland's climate change minister, as she set out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 66 per cent by 2032. She said Scotland had exceeded an interim target of delivering a 42 per cent cut in 2014 six years early.

Ministers have since committed to bring forward a new Climate Change Bill, including cutting emissions by more than 50 per cent by 2020 and on the way to an 80 per cent cut by 2050.

The Scottish Government said it wanted to reduce transport emissions by around a third by 2032, partly by the introduction of low-emissions zones but also with low-emission lorries and an increasing uptake of low-carbon cars.

The plan also aims for a drop in industrial emissions of about 19 per cent."

By Chinadaily.com11:47AM GMT 07 Dec 2015
President Xi Jinping has presented China’s position on tackling global climate change in a keynote address at the start of a crucial United Nations summit in Paris.
The Conference of the Parties (COP21), attended by representatives from 195 countries and organisations, is aimed at reaching a historic, balanced and fair agreement on managing global carbon emissions after 2020. The meeting continues until 11 December.
China announced a series of objectives for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 when Premier Li Keqiang met French President François Hollande during his visit to Paris in July.
The country’s carbon dioxide emissions will peak by around 2030; carbon dioxide emissions in relation to GDP will decrease by 60 to 65 per cent compared with those of 2005; non-fossil fuel use will account for around 20 per cent of primary energy consumption; and forest stock will increase by 4.5 billion cubic meters compared with 2005.
The announcement served as strong support to French efforts in hosting the climate change meeting and showed China's resolution to deal with the issue.

China announced it would make available 20bn yuan to support other developing countries
China's effort won recognition from officials at the UN. When asked “Which country sets a good example of combating climate change?”, Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that China's actions were ""very impressive"".
A series of communiqués, including the China-US joint presidential statement on Climate Change and the China-Britain joint declaration on building a global comprehensive strategic partnership for the 21st century, were issued during Xi's visits to the US and UK this year, which achieved acknowledgement worldwide.
Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, also gave credit to China for what it did. He was impressed by the country’s emissions trading system created to curb internal demand for coal.
China announced it would make available 20bn yuan ($3.1bn) to establish the South-South Co-operation Fund on Climate Change to support other developing countries coping with climate change as Xi attended the UN anniversary in September.
Additionally, the country is willing to take on responsibilities and it regards coping with climate change as a major opportunity for transforming its pattern of development, Xi said."

I won't prosecute Hillary, says Trump as he shifts stance on climate change
President-elect upsets supporters as he moves away from key campaign policies in interview

By Nick Allen and David Lawler in Washington
DONALD TRUMP will not seek to pursue a criminal investigation against Hillary Clinton over her email scandal and charitable foundation, and wants to help her ""heal"" following their brutal election battle.

His decision not to encourage a prosecution was a clear break with what had been a cornerstone of his campaign, and some of Mr Trump's own supporters attacked him for a ""broken promise"".

During the election Mr Trump told his rival during a televised debate that she was ""going to jail"" if he was elected. He said: ""If I win I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.""

He announced his reversal in an interview with The New York Times, saying: ""I don't want to hurt the Clintons, I really don't. She went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways. I think it would be very very divisive for the country. This has been looked at for so long, ad nauseum.""

In the interview Mr Trump also appeared to change his stance on climate change, saying he now had an ""open mind"" on the issue.

He also defended himself over accusations of conflicts of interest in his business dealings, disavowed far right supporters, defended his controversial chief strategist Steve Bannon, and predicted his son-in-law Jared Kushner could bring peace to the Middle East.

The meeting took place in the Churchill Room at The New York Times office. After criticising the newspaper throughout his campaign, and as recently as yesterday morning, as ""failing"" and ""nasty"", Mr Trump ended the meeting by calling it ""a great, great American jewel, a world jewel"". He also said of the publication: ""I do read it. Unfortunately. I'd live about 20 years longer if I didn't.""

What Mr Trump said: Climate change Mr Trump, who has previously called climate change a ""Chinese hoax,"" yesterday said he believed there was ""some"" connection between humans and changes to the Earth's climate.

He said: ""I'm looking at it very closely. I have an open mind to it. I think there is some connectivity.

Some, something. It depends on how much.""

Business dealings Mr Trump has been criticised for failing to put his business interests in a blind trust, and his plans to hand them over to his children when he is in the White House. But he said: ""The law's totally on my side, the president can't have a conflict of interest.""

He said critics were being too harsh on him over the issue, adding: ""If it were up to some people I would never, ever see my daughter Ivanka again.""

The property mogul said: ""I'd assumed that you'd have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you don't. But I would like to do something. I don't want to influence anything.

""In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly. There's never been a case like this.""

'Alt-right' Mr Trump denied having intentionally galvanised the so-called alt-right, a loosely organised group that embraces far-right ideologies including white nationalism. He said: ""It's not a group I want to energise. And if they are energised I want to look into it and find out why.""

The billionaire disavowed an altright gathering in Washington on Saturday in which attendees were captured on video shouting ""Heil Trump"" and giving the Nazi salute.

The president-elect also defended Steve Bannon, his recently-named chief strategist and the former chairman of Breitbart, the right-wing website. Mr Bannon himself once described as the ""platform of the alt-right"".

""I've known Steve Bannon for a long time. If I thought he was racist or altright or any of the things, the terms we could use, I wouldn't even think about hiring him,"" Mr Trump said.

The Middle East Mr Trump offered little in terms of detail in discussing his foreign policy, though he did say the US should not act as a ""nation-builder"". He also said he would like to ""end that craziness"" in Syria, and reach a Middle East peace deal.

""I would love to be the one who made peace with Israel and the Palestinians, that would be such a great achievement,"" he said.

Mr Trump said Jared Kushner, his 35-year-old son-in-law, could serve a key role in the peace negotiations.But he added that Mr Kushner was unlikely to take on a formal position in his Administration. As husband to Ivanka Trump, any role for Mr Kushner could be limited by anti-nepotism laws

Kerry 'confident' of US climate commitments
JOHN KERRY said yesterday he was ""confident"" Washington's climate commitments cannot be reversed ""regardless of what policy may be chosen"" after Donald Trump's election victory.

The United States is on its way to meeting its targets under a global climate rescue pact, and ""I do not believe that that can or will be reversed"", the Secretary of State said at a UN climate meeting in Marrakesh.

Market forces, not politics, will dictate the world's energy future, Mr Kerry added.

""That's why I'm confident for the future regardless of what policy might be chosen, because of the marketplace.""

Mr Trump has called climate change a ""hoax"" perpetrated by China and has promised to ""cancel"" the Paris Agreement that was concluded last year to limit dangerous global warming.

The Marrakesh meeting has started drafting a roadmap for putting the agreement's goals into action, but many fear Mr Trump will fulfil his promise to withdraw from the process. Mr Kerry said the clear global trend in energy use was away from fossil fuels, which emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, to renewable sources."

Oil demand to grow for decades despite push for alternative energy
By Emily Gosden
OIL demand will keep growing until at least 2040 as increasing fuel needs for shipping, aviation, trucks and plastics manufacturing more than offset the impact of electric cars and climate targets, the International Energy Agency has forecast.

The current investment slump due to lower oil prices is setting the stage for a fresh cycle of boom and bust, with supply shortages likely to cause rapid price increases by the early 2020s unless companies start developing new projects again next year, the IEA warned.

In its annual World Energy Outlook report, the Paris-based agency said there was ""no peak yet in sight"" for oil demand, countering suggestions by companies such as Royal Dutch Shell which has said demand could peak in as little as five years' time.

For the first time, the IEA is projecting a decline in oil demand for passenger car fuels - despite also forecasting that the number of vehicles will double to 2 billion by 2040 - due to a combination of fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.

Yet it projected that overall oil demand would keep growing for decades, due to increased demand for fuels for the maritime and shipping industry, road freight trucks and aviation, as well as oil for use in the manufacture of plastics and other petrochemical-based products.

Despite the push to tackle climate change, these were areas in which efficiency policies were not widespread and alternative fuel sources were ""often not readily available"", Tim Gould, head of the IEA's energy supply outlook division, said.

With demand forecast to continue rising, the IEA warned that the world could soon face another supply crunch that would send prices rising again.

Oil giants have slashed investment since prices crashed in summer 2014 amid a global supply glut. Investment levels in conventional oil projects in 2015 and 2016 have been at lows not seen since the 1950s, the IEA said.

If project approvals remain at current low levels through 2017, it is ""increasingly unlikely that supply will be able to meet the rising demand without rapid price increases"", Mr Gould said.

Some market commentators have suggested that oil projects which can be brought into production rapidly, will be able to ramp up in the event of shortages to help dampen price spikes."

Trump urged to stick with UN climate deal
By Our Foreign Staff
FRANCE and the United Nations yesterday stepped up warnings to Donald Trump about the risks of quitting a 2015 global plan to combat climate change, saying a historic shift from fossil fuels is unstoppable.

Francois Hollande, the French president, addressing almost 200 nations meeting in Morocco on ways to slow global warming, said that inaction would be ""disastrous for future generations and it would be dangerous for peace"".

Both he and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on Mr Trump, who has called man-made global warming a hoax, to drop his campaign pledge to cancel the 2015 Paris Agreement that aims to shift from fossil fuels to cleaner energies.

""The United States, the largest economic power in the world, the second largest greenhouse gas emitter, must respect the commitments it has undertaken,"" Mr Hollande said. The agreement was ""irreversible"", he said.

In such meetings, it is very rare for leaders to single out others for even veiled criticism. Both Mr Hollande and Mr Ban were among the architects of the Paris Agreement.

Mr Ban said Mr Trump, as a ""very successful business person"", would understand that market forces were driving the world economy towards cleaner energies such as wind and solar power, which are becoming cheaper.

""I am sure he [Trump] will make a fast and wise decision"" on the Paris Agreement, Mr Ban said, saying he had spoken to Trump by telephone after his victory and planned to meet him.

Mr Trump has said he wants to boost US coal, oil and shale industries, abandoning Barack Obama's plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025."

Green power is working and doubters are being proved wrong, says Clark
By Emily Gosden
FEARS over intermittent solar and wind power were ""overblown"" and those who said they would jeopardise Britain's ability to keep the lights on have been ""proved wrong"", Greg Clark, the new Business and Energy Secretary, has claimed.

In his first major speech on energy since his appointment in July, Mr Clark set out his stall firmly in favour of green technologies, vowing it was ""imperative"" that Britain used ""every industrial policy lever that we have"" to hit its climate change targets.

While he acknowledged that the intermittent nature of wind and solar farms - which only generate power when the wind blows or the sun shines - was ""creating new challenges for the system"", he insisted that ""the fears we had, even less than a decade ago, of the impact of intermittency, those fears were overblown.

""It was said our power system couldn't cope with a significant percentage of our power coming from renewables. The doubters are being proved wrong,"" he told Energy UK's annual conference this week.

""We now get 14pc of electricity from intermittent sources and yet our electricity supply remains the most reliable in Europe.""

His rhetoric is markedly more positive than that of his predecessor Amber Rudd, who used her flagship energy policy speech a year ago to announce plans to make wind and solar generators pay their ""full costs"" and ""be responsible for the pressures they add to the system when the wind does not blow or the sun does not shine"".

By contrast, Mr Clark said that while ""we must recognise this intermittency does add some costs"", the onus was on government and regulators to cope.

They should ""design a system that can both better manage intermittency and take advantage of innovations in storage, demand-side response, interconnection and IT to create a truly smart energy system in response to new sources of generation,"" he said.

The Government and Ofgem on Thursday launched a consultation into how to create such a system, claiming that doing so could save consumers up to ?50bn by 2050. Speaking the day after America elected climate sceptic Donald Trump as its president, Mr Clark gave a forthright commitment to tackling climate change, saying it had an important role in ""securing our economic future"". An emissions reductions plan would be a ""central part"" of the new industrial strategy.

Mr Clark also used his speech to warn energy suppliers that they must ""treat all customers fairly"". He said the Competition and Markets Authority's findings that loyal customers were overpaying by more than ?1bn a year was a challenge ""that needs to be addressed"".

However, in a hint that the Government may be reticent to act, Mr Clark said he thought it was always best if companies ""act themselves rather than require regulatory intervention""."

Opec gambles on failure of climate deal
Fears that Opec is burying its head in the sand

AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD
THE Opec cartel is taking a brave bet that global oil demand will keep rising fast for another 25 years, convinced that fossil fuels will retain their overwhelming dominance over world energy deep into the 21st century.

The Gulf-led group has based its strategic planning on assumptions that the Paris climate accords that came into force last week will largely fail.

It brushes aside warnings that fastmoving technology for electric vehicles and power storage may soon transform the energy landscape beyond recognition.

The 2016 World Oil Outlook released yesterday estimates that crude demand will rise by a further 16.4m barrels per day (b/d) to over 109m b/d by 2040, driven by economic booms in China, India, and the emerging economies.

Opec will enjoy the lion's share of the expanding market, boosting its output of oil and liquids by 12.6m b/d. Production from the rest of the world will peak within a decade and then go into gentle decline.

The long-range forecast shows the Middle East strengthening its position at the epicentre of the oil industry, as outputs from US shale and Russian fields reach a plateau, and high-cost drilling in the Arctic and ultra-deep waters disappoints.

Oil prices will double to $92 in today's money by 2040.

The outlook is a far cry from the bombshell warnings by Shell last week that global crude demand could peak within five years, chiefly due to vaulting gains in fuel efficiency and the switch to zero-emission vehicles. There is already a move in the German parliament with cross-party support to ban sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030. That could set off an avalanche. VW, Mercedes, and BMW are already joining the race for the electric car market.

Opec says it welcomes the climate deal and will play a part in delivering its goals, but the report's base case explicitly assumes that countries will not meet their pledges - or even come close - and that business will continue more or less as usual for the oil sector.

It estimates that fossil fuels will make up 77pc of total energy demand in 2040, with solar, wind, and geothermal accounting for a still risible 4.7pc. Coal will lose some share due to the Paris climate push, but oil and gas together will retain a 52.7pc share, exactly the same as today.

The assumption is a highrisk gamble for the oil states. There is already a G20 Task Force studying the global financial risks posed by the fossil industry. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England and chairman of Basel's Financial Stability Board, has warned repeatedly that fossil energy companies are booking assets that can never be burned under the maximum ""carbon budget"" of 1,000 gigatonnes stipulated by the Paris deal.

In a recent speech, he said the energy sector faces a ""technology revolution"" that threatens to sweep aside the old order, noting that three of the four largest coal companies had abruptly gone bust. He suggested other fossil companies could face the same fate if they fail to adapt in time, potentially leading to a ""Minsky moment"" or full-blown financial crisis for the world.

The past two years have been a bruising ordeal for Opec. Saudi Arabia's decision to flood an oversupplied crude market ultimately sent prices down by four fifths to a low of $22 in January, the deepest peak-to-trough fall in modern times. It has pushed Venezuela, Angola, Nigeria, and Iraq into serious difficulties.

Nothing has gone to plan.The report said cheaper oil did not lead to the usual jump in global demand. This time over-leveraged consumers in the West preferred to boost savings. The cartel was badly caught out by the rise of shale fracking in the US a decade ago, dismissing it as an irrelevancy until it was staring them in the face. The calculation by some in the Gulf region in 2014 that a short sharp shock would cripple the US shale industry has proved wide of the mark.

Frackers have adapted fast, slashing costs so far in the Texas Permian Basin that many can produce in ranges once thought impossible. They took out hedging contracts when crude recovered to $50 over the summer, locking into forward sale through 2017 and 2018. This means that it will take even longer for the market to rebalance.

""The resilience of supply in the lower oil price environment caught the industry by surprise, particularly tight oil in America,"" said the report. Opec acknowledges that shale will act as a headwind. The recovery of prices will be painfully slow, with $65 not in sight until 2021.

Michael Tran and Helima Croft from RBC says the cartel has misjudged badly: ""The Saudi-led market share battle of the last two years has left the kingdom with little to show for its trouble besides burning through a quarter trillion dollars of foreign reserves, rising domestic tensions, and a deteriorating market share position. In short, its oil policy has turned out to be a failed experiment.""

Opec nevertheless assumes that shale will fade over the long term. The report does lay out a possible worst-case scenario in which oil demand rises by just 5m b/d to 98m by 2040. But even this is based on extrapolated forecasts of economic growth in India and China that ignore the real danger of middleincome traps.

This ""B scenario"" sketches a partial switch to electric vehicles - taking 22pc of the market for passenger vehicles by 2040 - but seems to be an afterthought and does not fully confront the cliff-edge risks of galloping technology or climate laws.

Michael Liebreich, chairman of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, says the Paris agreement implies a sweeping change for the fossil industry, through government regulation or by some sort of carbon pricing that ratchets up the sanction on emissions. ""I cannot see how Opec think they are helping by discounting the likely actions,"" he said. ""There comes a point when it is negligent."""

Sturgeon's bluff called on fracking
By Simon Johnson
LABOUR will today attempt to force Nicola Sturgeon's government to get off the fence about fracking by launching a Bill to outlaw the practice.

Claudia Beamish, the party's environment and climate change spokeswoman, will announce her Members' Bill calling for a ban outside Holyrood today, and will launch a public consultation.

SNP ministers last year imposed a moratorium on fracking pending further scientific tests and public consultation.

Although ministers say they have yet to decide whether to impose a permanent ban, a majority of SNP members are hostile to it.

The First Minister has also said she is highly ""sceptical"" but pressure on her to make a decision increased in September when the owners of the Grangemouth refinery started shipping in shale gas from America.

Jim Ratcliffe, chief executive of chemicals giant Ineos which owns the plant and has fracking exploration licences for Scotland, claims shale gas extraction could transform communities blighted by a collapse in manufacturing.

Ms Beamish said: ""The climate science and evidence is clear - the last thing we need is another fossil fuel.

""SNP ministers now face an urgent choice - they can work with Labour to ban fracking, or they can work with the Tories to allow drilling under family homes."""

Failed flood defence system needs reform, MPs warn
Report urges creation of accountable body and says too many people are 'a downpour from disaster'

By Sarah Knapton SCIENCE EDITOR
THE Environment Agency should be stripped of powers to deal with flooding, MPs have said, following years of criticism of the organisation.

In a report, published today, the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee calls for an overhaul of the system and recommends the creation of a National Floods Commissioner for England and a new England Rivers and Coastal Authority. Committee chair, Neil Parish, also warned flood prevention is ""fragmented, inefficient and ineffective"" and has ""repeatedly let people down"".

In January, the agency's chairman Sir Philip Dilley resigned after coming under fire for taking a holiday in Barbados as devastating floods hit northern England. It has also faced criticism for failing to dredge waterways, cancelling flood defence schemes and not deploying pumps to deluged regions.

In recent years, floods have wrecked properties and destroyed livelihoods from Somerset to North Yorkshire. Last winter alone saw record rainfall in Britain while Storm Desmond is estimated to have cost ?5 billion.

The MPs said housing developers should be forced to pay for flood damage if they ignored regulations and built in risky areas, or without adequate protection. Farmers should also be given cash incentives to allow fields to flood to prevent water pouring into urban areas, and local authorities should be forced to publish lists of building work that was allowed in flood plains.

Mr Parish said: ""Our systems for managing flood risk are failing. Many communities will be going into this winter fearing that disaster could be just a downpour away. We're calling on the Government to undertake a complete overhaul of the roles and responsibilities of bodies responsible for managing flood risk."" Around five million Britons live in flood-risk areas and climate change is likely to put more families at risk.

The committee report says that rather than building more flood defences, agencies must ""work with nature"" on schemes such as tree-planting, restoring wetlands and allowing natural floodplains to do their job.

MPs said Brexit should make it easier to compensate farmers for letting fields flood, once the EU's Common Agricultural Policy no longer applies. The committee also said a grant scheme should be set up to help small businesses secure affordable insurance to install flood-resilient measures.

Emma Howard Boyd, chairman of the Environment Agency, said it ""builds, maintains and operates flood defences all over the country"". She added: ""Since 2003 we have better protected 570,000 properties through new flood schemes.""

The Department for the Environment said it saw no need for structural change."

Protests as wind farm is given go-ahead in 'wild land area'
By Auslan Cramb SCOTTISH CORRESPONDENT
MINISTERS have been condemned by conservationists for approving a wind farm in the far north of Scotland that will see giant turbines built inside the boundary of a ""wild land area"" for the first time.

The areas were drawn up just two years ago amid concerns about wind turbines spoiling some of the country's finest mountain scenery, and the John Muir Trust said it was disappointed and concerned by the move.

It said the 22 turbines, up to 125m (410ft) high, would be roughly the height of Scotland's tallest structure, the Glasgow Tower (417ft), but situated in remote north-west Sutherland.

It added that five turbines on the Creag Riabhach wind farm on Altnaharra estate would be inside the boundary of one of the wild land areas identified on a special map agreed in 2014. Stuart Brooks, chief executive of the wild land charity, said: ""This is the first such development to be consented within the boundaries of the Wild Land Areas map since it was agreed in 2014.

""The decision flies in the face of a series of previous decisions by the Scottish Government, refusing consent to similar applications impacting on these areas. This is not a few small community-owned turbines. It is a major industrial development, including giant turbines, access roads and transmission infrastructure.""

Mr Brooks added that the charity, one of more than 200 objectors, was concerned the project could become a ""Trojan Horse"" and attract further large scale projects. Ministers have previously rejected other applications on wild land areas elsewhere.

The announcement was made by Paul Wheelhouse, the energy minister, who said the 72MW development could generate enough power for 36,000 homes. The government also said it expected the development to benefit the community to the tune of more than ?9 million.

Mr Wheelhouse added: ""Renewable energy sources accounted for over 56 per cent of gross electricity consumption in Scotland in 2015 and onshore wind is a key driver for the growth in both our renewable electricity supply and wider renewable energy sector, and in the delivery of our vision for a greener Scotland and statutory climate change targets by enabling decarbonisation of electricity production."" The project has been developed by a private company in partnership with the estate. Tim Philpot, director of Creag Riabhach wind farm, said it would help secure jobs for local people.

He added: ""The voices of the local communities in Sutherland have been heard, and we can now take this opportunity to invest in our future."""

The old fossil order is on borrowed time as China and even India join the drive for dramatic cuts in CO2 emissions
'One of the most ridiculous schemes ever dreamed up', said Lord Marland, an energy minister, about the solar panel subsidies - Solar power incentives lose their shine

Ambrose Evans-Pritchard By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard8:49PM GMT 28 Oct 2015
The fossil fuel industry has taken a very cavalier bet that China, India and the developing world will continue to block any serious effort to curb greenhouse emissions, and that there is, in any case, no viable alternative to oil, gas or coal for decades to come.
Both assumptions were still credible six years ago when the Copenhagen climate summit ended in acrimony, poisoned by a North-South split over CO2 legacy guilt and the allegedly prohibitive costs of green virtue.
At that point the International Energy Agency (IEA) was still predicting that solar power would struggle to reach 20 gigawatts by now. Few could have foretold that it would in fact explode to 180 gigawatts - over three times Britain’s total power output - as costs plummeted, and that almost half of all new electricity installed in the US in 2013 and 2014 would come from solar.

Any suggestion that a quantum leap in the technology of energy storage might soon conquer the curse of wind and solar intermittency was dismissed as wishful thinking, if not fantasy.
Six years later there can be no such excuses. As The Telegraph reported yesterday, 155 countries have submitted plans so far for the COP21 climate summit to be held by the United Nations in Paris this December. These already cover 88pc of global CO2 emissions and include the submissions of China and India.
""No amount of lobbying at this point is going to change the direction""
Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official
Taken together, they commit the world to a reduction in fossil fuel demand by 30pc to 40pc over the next 20 years, and this is just the start of a revolutionary shift to net zero emissions by 2080 or thereabouts. “It is unstoppable. No amount of lobbying at this point is going to change the direction,” said Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official.
Yet the energy industry is still banking on ever-rising demand for its products as if nothing has changed. BP is projecting a 43pc increase in fossil fuel use by 2035, Exxon expects 35pc by 2040, Shell 43pc and Opec is clinging valiantly to 55pc. These are pure fiction.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) may or may not be correct in arguing that we cannot safely burn more than 800bn tonnes of carbon (two-thirds has been used already) if we are to stop global temperatures rising two degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. I take no view on the science.

But this is the goal accepted by world leaders. It is solemnly enshrined in international accords, and while it might once have been possible for energy companies to dismiss these utterings as empty pieties, to persist now is to trifle with fate.
“This is a world apart from where we were going into Copenhagen. The centre of gravity has fundamentally and irreversibly shifted,” said Mark Kenber, head of the Climate Group.
China switched sides several years ago, not least because it faces a middle class insurrection that has shaken the Communist Party to its core. An estimated 100m people viewed the anti-pollution video ""Under the Dome"" in just 24 hours before it was shut down by horrified officials in February.
China considers itself “among those countries that are most severely affected by the adverse impacts of climate change”
Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official
The IEA says China invested $80bn in renewable energy last year, as much as the US and the EU combined. It is blanketing chunks of the Gobi Desert with solar panels, necessary to absorb the massive surplus production of its own solar companies. The party’s Energy Research Institute has floated the idea of raising the renewable share of electricity to 86pc by 2050.
It is patently obvious that China is not about to sabotage a climate deal. Its submission to the COP21 summit aims for peak greenhouse emissions by 2030, if not before. It plans 200 gigawatts (GW) of wind and 100GW of solar by then, and a reduction in coal use from 2020 onwards. There will be a carbon emissions trading scheme as soon as 2017.
The panels have led to big electricity savings for the 1.4 million householders who have installed them,

The text makes it very clear that China considers itself “among those countries that are most severely affected by the adverse impacts of climate change” and is pushing for a far-reaching COP21 deal in its own defence. Going green with a vengeance is one way that China wishes to reposition itself as a global “soft power” force, as will become clear during its presidency of the G20 next year.
The last hold-outs are increasingly lonely as China, the US, Europe, Japan and Mexico all flaunt their good intentions. India has shifted safely into the middle ground, dashing the last hopes of those who thought COP21 would wither on the vine.

India invoked ""our planet Mother Earth"", Mahatma Gandhi, and the ancient practices of yoga in its poetic submission, pledging to raise renewables to 40pc of power output by 2030 (mostly solar) and to soak up three billion turns of carbon dioxide in new forests.
It plans to cut the energy intensity of GDP by a third from 2005 levels, no easy task for an economy on the cusp of an industrial surge. India’s green think-tank TERI called it an “unprecedented” shift.

There is still a North-South haggle over money - erupting in terse words last week in Bonn - but this dispute has become ritualistic, increasingly hollow in a world where China is now a creditor. It revolves around $100bn of annual funds pledged by the rich countries long ago. “It’s peanuts,” said Mrs Figueres.
The sums are trivial set against the $90 trillion of new energy investment that the IEA deems necessary by 2030 just to keep the global juggernaut on the road.
The IEA says the COP21 pledges imply will require $13.5 trillion of energy-saving and low carbon investments alone over the next fifteen years. New emissions will ""slow to a crawl"" by 2030.
Global energy intensity will rise three times faster than hitherto, and 70pc of all new power added will come from low-carbon sources.
Carbon capture and storage can perhaps save large parts of the fossil industry if it moves in time
Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official
Markets will do the job under the right terms and they are already making the switch as they discover a potentially lucrative new home for the world’s glut of excess savings and capital.
A Carbon Tracker forum in the City this week was packed with bankers and fund managers itching to find a way into the biggest investment boom of all time, which is what the Paris accord promises to ignite.

The COP21 emission targets imply an assault on multiple fronts at once. Fossil subsidies worth $600bn a year - or $5.3 trillion under the International Monetary Fund's elastic definition - are already sliding fast. They will inevitably fade away.
There will have to be a carbon price, whether a tax or a trading scheme, and it will have to rise over time as the “year zero” of negative CO2 emissions comes closer.
Carbon capture and storage can perhaps save large parts of the fossil industry if it moves in time, which is why the World Coal Association has belatedly become a cheerleader for what was once an outlandish idea of the greens.
The last hold-outs are increasingly lonely as China, the US, Europe, Japan and Mexico all flaunt their good intentions
Christiana Figueres, the UN’s top climate official
Shell says a carbon price of $40 would bring CCS into play under current technology - some say $80 - but that in itself would shift the balance of advantage further in favour of renewables just as the cross-over point arrives. In large parts of Africa it already has: it is cheaper and quicker to install micro-grids based on solar power than to bother with power stations.
The old energy order is living on borrowed time. You can, in a sense, compare what is happening to the decline of Britain’s canals in the mid-19th century when railways burst onto the scene and drove down cargo tolls, destroying the business model.
Technology takes no prisoners. Nor does politics. World leaders have repeatedly stated that they would defend the line of a 'two degree planet’, and now they are taking the concrete steps to do so. Fossil investors have been warned."

Protectionism 'could undermine global climate accord'
By Jon Yeomans
A GROWING trend towards protectionist policies around the world could threaten progress on tackling climate change, resources giant BHP Billiton has warned.

The Paris climate change agreement, struck in December and ratified by 75 countries, was a ""great step forward"", said Fiona Wild, BHP's senior vice-president for sustainability and climate change, but ""isolationist"" national policies could trump global agreements.

""We've seen an emerging alignment of climate policy, and we've also seen a more protectionist approach that may act as a brake in terms of this international collaboration on policy making,"" said Dr Wild. ""Anything which tends to isolate individual countries or regions is unlikely to facilitate international cooperation on climate policy.""

BHP Billiton is betting on copper and gas as two commodities that will remain in long-term demand, with Dr Wild arguing that there would be an ""ongoing role for fossil fuels in the energy mix for decades"" to come.

Dr Wild was speaking in London as BHP presented investors with an update on how different climate change scenarios could affect its portfolio. It has calculated that rising global temperatures would reduce demand for coal but boost that for gas. BHP is also investing in technology such as carbon capture and storage and batteries that can store energy from solar power.

""I think all companies need to identify, assess and manage climate risk and increasingly they're going to have to disclose how they do that to their stakeholders,"" said Dr Wild, who also serves on the Financial Stability Board's taskforce for climate change, which was set up by Mark Carney and Michael Bloomberg last year. ""There is a thirst for information [from investors] and there's only going to be increasing interest over time."""

Trials urged to test the use of hydrogen for heating homes
Government's climate advisers say technology is feasible and could help UK meet green targets by 2050

By Emily Gosden
RADICAL plans to use hydrogen to heat UK homes and businesses have moved a step closer after the Government's official climate advisers said the plan was ""technically feasible"" and called for major trials to be undertaken.

In a report, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) identified using hydrogen in place of natural gas in the UK's existing gas grid as one of the two ""main options"" for greening Britain's heating supplies. The second was the use of heat pumps, which use a reverse refrigeration process to draw heat from the air, ground or a water source.

The Government must decide by 2025 what role hydrogen will play, to implement its chosen plan in time to hit its 2050 climate targets, Matthew Bell, the CCC chief executive, said.

About 80pc of UK homes are heated using natural gas from the grid, which produces carbon dioxide when burnt.

The CCC estimates that if the UK is to comply with the Climate Change Act, which requires greenhouse gas emissions to be slashed to 20pc of their 1990 levels by 2050, the majority of homes and almost all businesses will need to cease burning natural gas.

However, the CCC said attempts at green heating so far had ""been unsuccessful"" and called for the Government to devise ""a proper strategy"". This included doubling the rate of installation of heat pumps during this parliament in homes not on the gas grid, many of which use heating oil, as well as conducting ""sizeable trials of hydrogen for heating"".

""The main options for the decarbonisation of buildings on the gas grid in the 2030s and 2040s are heat pumps and low-carbon hydrogen,"" the CCC said in a report. In addition, the UK could also use some district heating networks in urban areas, taking heat from a central source through insulated pipes to homes and businesses. Previously, heat pumps have been the focus of greater attention from the CCC and from the Government.

However, influential voices including energy giant Centrica and the think tank Policy Exchange have recently questioned the idea of widespread use of heat pumps, which can be disruptive to install in homes and require electricity to produce heat - potentially increasing the strain and cost on the UK's power infrastructure.

Distribution grid owner Northern Gas Networks has proposed the use of hydrogen, which would require new household appliances but could be distributed in existing gas grids. It has drawn up plans to convert the city of Leeds to run on hydrogen as a precursor to a ?50bn national roll-out.

The CCC said ""a large-scale shift to a hydrogen gas supply is technically feasible for existing gas distribution networks"" and that ""the difficulty to-date in deploying heat pumps more widely means this option merits attention"". It was ""vital to undertake pilots and demonstrations in the next decade"" to understand whether hydrogen usage was desirable. Major questions remained over cost, consumer acceptability and the mechanics of a roll-out, it said.

Hydrogen can be produced by extracting it from natural gas, which is primarily methane, leaving carbon dioxide as a by-product. In order for hydrogen to represent a low carbon fuel source, the carbon dioxide would need to be disposed of using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which is not yet operational in the UK.

The Government last year scrapped a ?1bn CCS competition despite the committee's warning that the technology was likely to be crucial to hitting climate targets. ""Before a decision to proceed with hydrogen, it would be essential that CCS is under active development in the UK… to provide a low-carbon route to producing hydrogen at scale,"" the CCC said. ""This should be part of the Government's new strategy on CCS.""

A Government spokesman said it would ""carefully consider the valuable advice"" from the CCC and was working on plans for how the UK would continue to decarbonise through the 2020s.

SNP 'no' to fracking wrecks project worth 5.7bn
By Simon Johnson SCOTTISH POLITICAL EDITOR
SCOTLAND has lost the chance to be a ""world leader"" in a specialist form of gas extraction at the Firth of Forth, an energy company claimed yesterday after SNP ministers blocked the move. Paul Wheelhouse, the Energy Minister, said an independent review commissioned by the Scottish Government into Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) found that a ""step change"" in information would be needed before it could be reliably assessed.

He said the review, conducted by Prof Campbell Gemmell, advised ministers to take a ""precautionary"" approach and argued it would be ""logical"" to turn a moratorium on the technique into an outright ban.

Cluff Natural Resources, which had planned to spend more than ?250 million building the UK's first deep offshore UCG plant at Kincardine in Fife, argued the risks could have been managed with appropriate regulations. The company, which switched its focus to the North of England after the moratorium was imposed last year, said Scotland had lost ""first mover advantage"". Its economic analysis had claimed that the process could have been worth ?5.7 billion to Scotland.

The Conservatives said UCG could have provided thousands of jobs and injected millions of pounds into the economy at a time when Scotland has a ?15 billion annual spending deficit.

But environmental groups and Holyrood's other opposition parties backed the move, with Labour calling on the SNP to go further and ban fracking.

The announcement was made the same day that the UK Government gave the go-ahead for fracking at a site in Lancashire and came ahead of next week's SNP conference in Glasgow, with the vast majority of members opposed to fracking and UCG.

Mr Wheelhouse said: ""Having considered the report in detail, it is the Scottish Government's view that UCG poses numerous and serious environmental risks, and on that basis the Scottish Government cannot support this technology.

""Accordingly, UCG will have no place in Scotland's energy mix at this time.""

UCG is a process for converting coal into gas underground, via combustion. Cluff had secured UCG licences from the UK Government's Coal Authority but Mr Wheelhouse told MSPs he had written to London asking for them to be revoked and no more to be issued.

In the meantime, he said Scottish ministers could ensure that no projects proceeded by using their powers over planning and the environment.

Mr Wheelhouse said the review admitted there are ""substantial coal resources"" in Scotland that could be exploited by UCG, with the greatest reserves in central Scotland, Ayrshire, Clackmannanshire and East Fife.

But he said Prof Gemmell, the former chief executive of environment agency Sepa, had raised ""serious concerns"" about giving the green light including soil contamination, the exposure of workers to toxins and the ""unmitigated releases"" of greenhouse gases, which could cripple climate change targets.

Andrew Nunn, Cluff 's chief operating officer, said: ""Being an innovator and world leader in any particular field requires some amount of judged acceptance of risk and it is obviously disappointing that the Scottish Government has decided not to trust its own regulators and world class engineering and scientific resource base to ensure that a UCG industry could be developed under the rigorous scrutiny of a fit for purpose regulatory regime."""

Trump should have seen Paris as a deal, not a threat
Josh Bayliss
On that sunny Thursday afternoon in the White House Rose Garden, President Trump not only walked away from the Paris Agreement. He also passed on the greatest deal he could have ever sealed.

Since the 1960s, there has been continuous progress towards identifying and addressing some of the major environmental problems humans have caused. The first comprehensive Clean Air Act in the US was passed in 1963, a few years before I was born.

Ever since, a string of national laws and global agreements have sought to manage challenges like acid rain, holes in the ozone layer, emissions causing air pollution and global warming.

At university, in the early 1990s, my honours dissertation was about sustainability and environmental management.

At the time, it wasn't very fashionable to talk about saving the planet. Economic growth was still all the rage even after the 1987 stock market crash. Classical economics didn't take account of environmental damage in assessing costs.

They were an ""externality"" - the price of doing business society simply had to absorb. Likewise, the jury was still out on global warming - whether it was happening at all, let alone what caused it.

We were years away from the Kyoto Protocol, and few governments thought of climate change as the momentous global challenge it would become.

Part of my thesis was that even if the potential for long-term harm was uncertain, governments had to place limits on human activity in order to safeguard the planet for future generations. Yet, this precautionary principle, the idea that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"", was slow to find its way from wellintentioned international declarations into the day-to-day decision-making of business and governments alike.

Well into the 1990s, the prevailing view was that so long as economic growth was guaranteed, it didn't matter much if the world our grandchildren would live in was compromised.

Twenty five years on, the effects of global warming are being felt more and more and the evidence that humans are causing the harm is irrefutable, supported by the vast majority of the world's climate scientists.

Consequently, most sensible people have concluded that we have to change the way we do things now. And we are.

Electric vehicles, reductions in fossil fuel energy generation, greater energy efficiency and even greenhouse gas removal have become a reality. And slowly, the threat has turned into an opportunity unlike any I have seen, presenting a fantastic and irresistible business case for change.

Last November, the IFC estimated that climate action in 21 emerging markets alone could create a staggering $23trillion investment opportunity by 2030.

And following the Paris Agreement, the International Energy Agency priced the low-carbon technology and efficiency investments needed to meet national climate commitments at $13.5trillion . Similarly, the clean energy revolution is also a massive job engine. Take solar energy: according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, job growth in the solar sector was 17 times faster than that in the total US economy in 2016.

There are now 2.6m solar jobs in the US. Worldwide, nearly 10m people were employed in renewable energy in 2016. And the only way is up.

No question, these two central promises of the low-carbon economy - growth and jobs - should be any leader's dream for a positive legacy.

So why in the world would President Trump turn his back on the most significant global agreement to drive sustainable growth and safeguard our planet for generations to come?

I increasingly feel that he never quite grasped that Paris is a deal, not a threat. That's a remarkable lapse for a self-styled dealmaker. The result is tragic. It is self-evident that the impacts of global warming transcend borders and national sovereignty, imperilling the future of all. The President's statement that he represents the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris, is therefore meaningless - and was swiftly rebutted by Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto.

Fortunately, President Trump's announcement has awakened an enormous sense of unity in the rest of the world.

Nations, cities, civil society and business leaders are stepping up to the plate, renewing their commitments to work together to tackle this challenge and seize the opportunity - with or without the US government on their side.

And much of US business, and the majority of US citizens, support taking action now and making Paris a priority.

Virgin will be part of that global effort. We will continue to invest in renewable energy, from wind farms to solar power. We will continue to search for new fuels for aircraft, as we have been since 2006. We will continue to invest in energy efficiency in our fleets and buildings. We will continue to convene and support those who, like us, think this is the right way to go.

Looking at it from our grandchildren's perspective, it clearly is.

Josh Bayliss is chief executive officer of Virgin Group."

N Korea scolds 'egotist' Trump over climate
WORLD BULLETIN

North Korea has criticised US President Donald Trump for pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, describing the decision as ""the height of egotism"" and an example of the ""moral vacuum"" in the US leadership.

""Global warming is one of the gravest challenges that humankind is facing today"", a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.

""The 'America First Policy' advocated by Trump led to the withdrawal from the Paris agreement"", the official added.

""This is the height of egotism and [a] moral vacuum seeking only their own well-being, even at the cost of the entire planet."""

The car of the future is self-parked around the corner
BEN MARLOW IN THE CITY
The car of the present will soon be obsolete, and if the current hype is to be believed, it will be sooner than you think: the car of the future is just around the corner.

Sceptics will cry that we've heard it all before - green warriors have been saying it for decades. The reality though is that the automotive revolution has had more stop-starts than a second-hand Cortina.

Today's car is vastly different from Henry Ford's Model-T that sparked mass production more than 100 years ago. Vehicles are lighter, safer, more reliable, but also faster and more powerful.

Scores of inventions have changed the way cars look, drive and feel; from the early seat-belts, indicators, air conditioning and navigation systems, to in-car entertainment.

Yet, despite huge advances in technology and more than a billion cars swarming the world's roads today, the core components of the modern car haven't changed at all. Around 95pc still use a petrol or diesel internal combustion engine that coughs out hugely harmful fumes and all are manually operated.

The car of the future will look very different: it will be electric and, one-day, self-driving - something that even in today's hi-tech world still feels like it could be from a sci-fi film.

It is often forgotten that prior to the era of the mass-produced car, electric models were more popular than their petrol-powered counterparts, but they were more costly and crippled by low top speed and short range. Eventually the pendulum swung the other way as simple economics took over, leaving the internal combustion engine to reign.

Yet more than a century later the same factors have continually prevented the electric car industry from taking off a second time.

Still, there have been some important recent shifts. The Paris Agreement on climate change was seen by many experts as a seminal moment in the electric car market's evolution - without a genuine move towards so-called ""zero-emissions vehicles"", it is unlikely the accord's lower temperature goal of 1.5C will be reached.

One report estimates that if the majority of countries doubled fuel economy standards for new cars by 2030 they could increase the uptake of electric vehicles by 50pc by 2050 - then the world would be on a path to stay within the 2C global warming goal set out in December 2015.

On current numbers that looks farfetched. In 2015, just 462,000 electric cars were sold worldwide, taking the total number on the road to 1.3m. With costs remaining high, the electric pioneers such as Nissan with its Leaf model and Chevrolet with the Volt have relied on a mixture of innovations and government incentives to commercialise their concepts.

Still, there are growing predictions of a big jump in sales in the coming years thanks mostly to the plummeting cost of batteries. Lithium-ion battery costs plunged 65pc from 2010 to 2015 to $350 per kWh and are tipped to fall by two-thirds again by 2030. At that point they would be close to the $100/ kWh that is generally considered the point at which electric cars become cost-competitive.

Some carmakers think that goal is achievable by the early 2020s, especially as lithium batteries become more dense and their range expands. At that rate, electric vehicles could represent as much as 35pc of new car sales by 2040, a recent report by Bloomberg estimated.

There are other forces at work too. A new generation of long-range, affordable electric cars that can compete with petrol-powered models will soon come to market.

Tesla, whose founder Elon Musk has probably done more for the industry than any other individual, will begin production of its Model 3, the first mass-production battery electric vehicle. It will be the California-based car firm's cheapest model yet and, with a price tag of $30,000 after tax breaks, rival many similarly priced conventional small saloons. Musk says it has 400,000 pre-orders.

Most mainstream electric cars, such as those by BMW and Nissan, have a range of 100-150 miles but Renault's latest ""Zoe"" model, revealed at Paris Motor Show last autumn, can travel 250 miles, a distance it claims is a key psychological barrier among drivers who fear running out of power.

Nearly every other automaker is planning electric cars in the next few years, with as many as 75 European and American models expected, three times the level of today.

Perhaps the surest sign that the electric car market is on the cusp of exploding was the announcement by Shell that it would soon start putting charging stations at its petrol stations. Total has similar plans. Widely seen as a serious threat to the oil industry because of their potential to temper the biggest source of demand for petroleum, the acknowledgement that electric vehicles could become a genuine commercial opportunity is a big move indeed.

However, one big challenge remains: working out how to make money from electric vehicles. Consider the numbers at Tesla. It has raised roughly $6.5bn from investors since 2012 to support its ambitions, but is burning through cash at an astonishing rate. Last year, it reported a loss of $888m and spent $1.6bn on new manufacturing capabilities, including its so-called ""gigafactory"" to mass produce lithium batteries. No wonder electric cars continue to take a back seat to more profitable gasguzzling sport utility vehicles. Revolutions don't come cheap but this one will need to be profitable.

America to see the roll-back of Obama's green legacy
US election Climage-change denier Donald Trump wants an energy revolution. Emily Gosden reports

Emily Gosden
With a man who says global warming is an ""expensive hoax"" about to become leader of the free world, it's no surprise that fossil fuel companies have been seen as some of the biggest beneficiaries of the US election result - while renewable energy investors have taken fright.

Donald Trump's presidency is likely to herald a shift in US domestic energy policy, unravelling many of Barack Obama's key environmental policies.

It also threatens the fragile global progress to tackling climate change that Mr Obama helped spearhead - risking undermining the growth of green energy worldwide.

Trump's ""America First Energy Plan"" pledges to ""unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country"". America may already have undergone a shale revolution but Trump wants to go further, accessing ""$50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves, plus hundreds of years in clean coal reserves"".

Whereas Hillary Clinton had threatened curbs on fracking, Trump plans to rip up energy regulation, lifting moratoriums on production in federal lands and to ""save the coal industry"".

""Less regulation could help energy investments because it could lower companies' costs to pull resources out of the ground,"" Jeff Rottinghaus of the T Rowe Price US Large Cap Equity Fund explains.

While shares in coal producers jumped on the Trump victory, analysts at Bernstein warn that scrapping environmental regulations may not revive the industry. ""Cheap natural gas is the true chief culprit in coal's decline, and if Trump's other campaign promises regarding expanding gas infrastructure are to be believed, gas supply may grow even more quickly than it would have under Clinton,"" they say.

Will Scargill of GlobalData also cautions that Trump's support for shale may be frustrated by the fact many regulations exist at local or state level. Despite this, he says Trump's pledges suggest ""a positive outlook for the oil and gas sector"" - not least with Harold Hamm, chief executive of oil firm Continental Resources, a candidate for energy secretary.

Trump's victory also brings the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the US, which was blocked by Obama on climate grounds, back on the agenda, and is likely to mean full steam ahead for the controversial Dakota access pipeline, with Trump owning a stake in the company building it.

When it comes to global oil prices, the ramifications are unclear. An increase in US production could put further downward pressure on prices, as could any slowdown to global economic growth. However, if Trump revokes the nuclear agreement with Iran and reintroduces sanctions, Commerzbank analysts say, ""oil prices would presumably rise"".

Renewables, which benefited from Obama, look vulnerable - as evidenced by the plunge in shares in Denmark's Vestas, the world's biggest wind turbine maker, and several US solar companies on Wednesday.

Trump has derided wind farms as ""ugly"" and blamed them for killing birds, while criticising costs.

According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, if Trump were to end investment tax credit incentives for renewables it could ""slash solar installation demand by 60pc"".

But Matthew Knight, a UK executive of wind manufacturer Siemens, argues Trump's climate scepticism doesn't necessarily spell the end for US renewables. ""If you deny the science, that doesn't change the economics,"" he says. ""Solar and wind in [parts of ] North America are financially comparable with gas and coal.""

However, while Obama helped negotiate a climate deal with China that paved the way the historic global emissions-reductions deal in Paris last year, Trump has pledged to ""cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of US tax dollars to UN global warming programmes"".

Infrastructure Trump cheers National Grid

National Grid could benefit from the election of Donald Trump if he presses ahead with plans to upgrade US infrastructure, according to its chief executive.

John Pettigrew welcomed the president-elect's comments about investing in ""a modern and reliable electricity grid"" as a priority.

He said: ""It's early days but there was definitely some positive commentary around infrastructure…. What we need to see is the detailed policy development now.""

He added: ""Our major businesses in the US are gas distribution and electricity distribution, which are predominantly regulated at the state level. But we will look forward to working with the Trump administration.""

Mr Pettigrew was speaking as the FTSE 100 utility giant unveiled a 1pc rise in first-half operating profits to ?1.85bn. Its US unit, centred on New York, Rhode Island and Massachusetts, accounted for ?435m of the profits.

Carbon capture project 'can revive parts of UK'
Carbon capture can play central role in economy, says new report

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard
A HIGH-LEVEL government inquiry has called for a massive national investment in carbon capture to revive depressed regions of the North and exploit Britain's perfectly placed network of offshore pipelines and depleted wells.

Lord Oxburgh's cross-party report has concluded that the cheapest way to lower CO2 emissions from heavy industries and heating is to extract the carbon with filters and store it in the North Sea oil.

The parliamentary advisory group said the technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) is ready to go immediately and should cut costs below ?85 per megawatt hour by the late 2020s if launched with sufficient conviction and on a large scale, below the strike price for the Hinkley Point nuclear project. It could be fitted on to existing gas plants or be purposebuilt in new projects, and could ultimately save up ?5bn a year compared to other strategies. Unlike other renewables CCS does not alter with the weather or suffer from intermittency. It can be ""dispatched"" at any time, helping to balance peaks and troughs in power demand.

""I have been surprised myself at the absolutely central role that CCS has to play across the UK economy,"" said Lord Oxburgh, a former chairman of Shell Transport and Trading.

""We can dramatically reduce our CO2 emissions, create tens of thousands of jobs, and give our domestic industry a great stimulus by making use of technologies which are now well understood and fully proved,"" he said.

No other country is likely to take the plunge first since few have the magic mix of industrial hubs, teams of offshore service specialists, and cheap, well-mapped, sea storage sites all so close together. ""CCS technology and its supply chain are fit for purpose. There is no justification for delay,"" says the report, to be released today.

Lord Oxburgh said the state must take the lead and establish the basic infrastructure in the early years.

The report called for a government delivery company modelled on Crossrail, or the Olympic Delivery Authority, taking advantage of rock-bottom borrowing costs. It could be privatised later once the CCS has come of age.

The captured CO2 is potentially valuable. Some could be used for market gardening in greenhouses, to produce biofuels, or for industrial needs.

Most CCS in North America is commercially exploited to extract crude through enhanced oil recovery by pumping CO2 into old wells, a technology that could give a new lease of life to Britain's depleted offshore fields. ""We could keep North Sea production going for another hundred years,"" said Prof Jon Gibbins from Sheffield University.

The report rebuked the previous Cameron government for shutting down Britain's world-leading scheme last November. George Osborne pulled the plug abruptly on a ?1bn ""prize"". The Treasury cited high costs.

The move stunned the industry and elicited blistering criticism in parliament. Shell and Drax and other companies had sunk large sums into the fouryear project. Lord Oxburgh said costs can be halved if the Government puts its shoulder to the wheel.

The economic calculus of CCS is sophisticated.There is no avoiding the fact roughly 18pc of the power from gas or coal is lost in the process, the socalled ""parasitic load"". The technology is not viable today without subsidies, given that carbon prices in Europe are barely $5 a tonne.

But the COP21 climate deal agreed in Paris implies a ratchet effect of higher carbon penalties for the next half century. The equation will look very different at $50 a tonne; at $100 the storage sites will be worth more than fossil fuels. Countries able to dispose of CO2 most effectively may become the new masters of the energy world.

Other renewables have a 20-year head start on CCS technology. Advocates say costs would plummet once there was a concerted push. Managers of the world's first utility scale CCS plant at Boundary Dam in Canada say they could shave 30pc off the next plant.

For the industrial hub of Teesside - once home to the world's greatest iron works, and now reeling from the loss of the Redcar steel plant - it may mean the difference between regeneration and slow death. The valley hosts 58pc of Britain's chemical industry and five of the UK's top 25 CO2-emitting plants. CCS could ultimately help it to leapfrog rivals with the cheapest decarbonised energy in Europe, and reclaim some of its former glory.

The same logic applies in varying degrees to Grangemouth in Scotland, as well as the Humber, Merseyside, and other industrial hubs on the coast. It could put flesh on the bones of Theresa May's new industrial strategy and turn the Northern Powerhouse dream into reality.

The initial outlay for the state body would be ?200m to ?300m spread over four years, with a second body exploring how to decarbonise heat. An earlier study for the Government concluded that the total capital costs for transport and storage for all sites would be ?4.4bn, with an offshore lifetime of 40 years.

The push for CSS divides green activists. Some fear the stored CO2 may leak and cause further acidification of the oceans. ""Rather than being a solution, it risks perpetuating the problem,"" says Friends of the Earth.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says carbon capture is a crucial part of the fight against global warming, warning that the cost of meeting targets by the middle of the century will be 140pc higher without CCS.

Even if it were possible to generate enough power from renewables, half of Britain's emissions come from sectors such as steel, cement, and chemicals that produce CO2 as part of the industrial process, or come from heating and cooking.

The Oxburgh report suggests that Britain's natural gas network should eventually be switched to emissionfree hydgrogen, based on the model of the H21 Leeds Citygate project. Power can be converted into hydrogen through electrolysis - expensive at this stage - or produced from fossil fuels using CCS. Hydrogen could then be used to fuel vehicles as well.

The Oxburgh report will be delivered to Greg Clark, the newly minted Secretary of Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy. How he responds will be a litmus test of Theresa May's new economic order.

'Green fuels' may hurt the planet more than petrol
By Henry Bodkin
""GREEN"" biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel are worse for the environment than petrol, a major study has claimed.

The alternative energy source has long been praised for being carbonneutral because the plants it is made from absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while they are growing.

But new research in the US has concluded that the crops used for biofuel absorb only 37 per cent of the C02 that is later released into the atmosphere when the plants are burnt, meaning the process actually increases the amount of greenhouse gas in the air.

The scientists behind the study have called on governments to rethink their carbon policies in light of the findings.

The use of biofuels is controversial because it means crops and farm space that could otherwise be devoted to food production are used for energy.

They currently make up just under 3 per cent of global energy consumption, and use in the US grew from 4.2 billion gallons a year in 2005 to 14.6 billion gallons a year in 2013.

In the UK the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation now means that 4.75 per cent of any suppliers' fuel must come from a renewable source, which is usually ethanol derived from crops.

Prof John DeCicco, from the University of Michigan, said: ""When you look at what's actually happening on the land, you find that not enough carbon is being removed from the atmosphere to balance what's coming out of the tailpipe.

""When it comes to the emissions that cause global warming, it turns out that biofuels are worse than gasoline.""

Prof DeCicco said the study, which is published in the journal Climatic Change, reset the assumptions that biofuels, as renewable alternatives to fossil fuels, are inherently carbon neutral simply because the C02 released when burned was originally absorbed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis."

Green targets could breathe new life into industrial areas
Stringent curbs on emissions offer a golden opportunity for carbon capture to transform depressed parts of the North and Scotland

By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard
RENAISSANCE beckons for the once great industrial hubs of northern England and Scotland, and the paradoxical lifeline may come from stringent climate controls.

What looks at first sight like an economic threat could instead play elegantly to Britain's competitive advantage, for almost no other country on earth is so well-placed to combine energy-intensive manufacturing with carbon capture at a viable cost.

The industrial clusters of the Tees Valley and the Humber are linked by a network of pipelines to depleted and well-mapped oil and gas fields in the North Sea, offering rare access to infrastructure for carbon storage deep underground.

Liverpool has old wells of its own offshore in the Irish Sea. Scotland's heavy industry in Grangemouth and the Forth have feeder pipelines to the Golden Eye.

Such sites may not be worth much today - with carbon prices in Europe too low to matter at barely $5 a tonne - but the COP21 climate deal agreed in Paris last December transforms the long-term calculus.

It implies a tightening regime of higher carbon penalties for the next half century, ending in net zero CO2 emissions. Once prices reach $100 it inverts the pyramid of energy wealth: profits accrue to those with access to the cheapest low carbon power.

""Storage will be much more valuable than the fossil fuels themselves. If you are an energyintensive industry in the middle of Europe and you don't have C02 storage, you're stuffed,"" said Prof Jon Gibbins from Edinburgh University.

The Government's ""Heseltine report"" into regeneration of Teesside concludes that carbon capture and storage (CCS) could reap windfall gains. ""This is a rare instance when existing industries can harness a new technology and ensure that Britain becomes a European and world leader,"" it said.

Britain is already a player in CCS technology. Shell Cansolv installed the world's first utility scale filtering system on a 110 megawatt coal-plant for SaskPower in Canada. UK engineers Costain are managing a project for Emirates Steel Industries in Abu Dhabi, capturing the CO2 at source and piping it for ""enhanced oil recovery"" (EOR), a technique to extract more crude from depleted fields.

The UK Oil & Gas Authority says such EOR could extend the life of North Sea fields for another decade and generate 250 million barrels of oil equivalent.

Yet Britain has not yet launched carbon capture at home. The Cameron government abruptly halted a ?1bn prize for two world-leading CCS projects last November, prompting a lacerating rebuke from the Commons select committee on energy and climate change.

""The manner in which the carbon capture and storage competition was cancelled, weeks before the final bids were to be submitted and without any prior indication given to the relevant parties, was both disappointing and damaging,"" it said in February.

""The delay in bringing forward any subsequent plans seems to be in direct contradiction with the direction of energy policy. If Government does not come up with a clear strategy very soon, knowledge, investment, assets and expertise in the UK will all be lost.""

The suspension was a Treasury decision, a blunder made by a department in thrall to an austerity doctrine that should have no place in a depressed 1930s world awash with excess savings, and offering the lowest bond yields in history.

Britain can borrow for 20 years at 1.23pc. It should do so without hesitation for infrastructure projects that pay for themselves, and this one promises to transform the ""Northern Powerhouse"" from pious rhetoric to hard reality.

The drastic implications of COP21 are still sinking in. A maximum ""carbon budget"" of 3,000 gigatonnes - deemed necessary to stop temperatures rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels - may mean zero emissions from the power sector by mid-century.

""There are areas like farming and aircraft travel where it is tougher to drive down emissions, so other areas will have to go negative to meet the target,"" said Professor Gibbins.

The accord was signed by 195 countries, led by the US and China. It makes no difference whether you accept the hypothesis of man-made global warming. The deal constitutes the political will of the world. It is possible that Donald Trump will be elected US president and that the global consensus will unravel. But Britain cannot make strategic plans based on that conjecture, and I write this article on the assumption that COP21 will remain the global framework.

A study of Britain's CCS potential for the Government concluded that there are five optimal sites that can meet the UK's needs and service Europe.

""There are no major technical hurdles. The UK is endowed with offshore geology that presents a superlative national CO2 storage proposition,"" it said.

The cradle-to-grave ""levelised unit cost"" ranges from ?11 to ?18 per tonne of CO2 that is transported and stored, adding ?5 to ?9 per megawatt hour (MWh) to electricity costs. The capital cost for all sites is estimated at ?4.4bn with an offshore lifetime of 40 years.

Carbon capture is still in its infancy, like wind and solar 20 years ago, before an avalanche of subsidies and sheer scale succeeded in jump-starting the technology.

Shell expects a similar ""race down the cost-curve"" for CCS, ultimately undercutting offshore wind.

Luke Warren from the UK's Carbon Capture and Storage Association says gas-fired CCS could drop to ?85 per MWh by the late 2020s, comparable to other renewables by then but with the advantage that it serves as ""dispatchable"" power whenever needed. ""We think costs will come plummeting down but it needs government intervention to develop the infrastructure,"" he said.

Canada's SaskPower plant has at least shown that it can be done, extracting 90pc of the CO2. It loses 18pc of the power, the so-called ""parasitic load"", better than feared.

The utility says it has learnt so much from its first trial and error that it could cut 30pc off the cost of the next plant. Yet the project is so heavily subsidised that it tells us little about the likely economics of CCS in the 2030s. Nobody will know what the cost-curve looks like until the Government has taken plunge, and it would be feckless for Britain to try to coast as a ""late mover"" on the uncertain efforts of other countries with less reason to act.

The green movement is split on carbon capture. Greenpeace calls CCS a ""risky distraction"" that merely keeps the current fossil-based energy mode alive. This overlooks the salient fact that steel, cement, and chemical plants - among others - emit large amounts of CO2 as part of the industrial process, regardless of whether their electricity is from renewables.

Greenpeace fears a high risk of CO2 leakage and further acidification of the oceans. This is certainly a legitimate concern. But it then switches tack - in an odd alliance with climate sceptics - asserting that ""CCS doesn't work"" and that the technology an exorbitant failure everywhere.

It is not the view of most climate policy experts. Britain's official Committee on Climate Change says carbon capture is likely to be a ""crucial part of the least-cost path to decarbonisation in the UK, and globally"".

The International Panel of Climate Change estimates that it would cost 140pc more to meet the Paris goals without CCS technology - given what we now know about alternatives.

Britain has a chance to revive its programme when Lord Oxburgh reports to the Government next month on the future of CCS. For Teesside it may be the difference between revival and irreversible decline."

We have no more climate excuses, Cameron warns Paris summit
By Henry Samuel in Paris and Emily Gosden
WORLD leaders will have no excuses if they fail to reach an agreement to tackle climate change,ÊDavid CameronÊwarned yesterday.
The Prime Minister painted an apocalyptic vision of the Earth's plight as he joined almost 150 leaders in Paris for the start of a UN climate conference, described by organisers as the largest gathering of heads of state the world has known.
Held just two weeks after the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 130, the summit saw leader after leader issue their condolences to the French people and underline their solidarity in turning up to the huge event, withÊBarack ObamaÊcalling it an ""act of defiance"" against terrorism.
Over the next fortnight negotiators aim to thrash out an agreement governing how they will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the 2020s, with a long-term goal of preventing global temperatures rising 2C beyond pre-industrial levels. Above that level, scientists say, the world will experience the most extreme effects of climate change.
Deep divisions remain between the countries over the different responsibilities that developed and developing countries should shoulder, with negotiators only just beginning to hone down a vast draft agreement. Speaking during the latter stages of an exhausting series of speeches by world leaders, from China'sÊXi JinpingÊand Russia'sÊVladimir PutinÊto the heads of tiny island nations that are in danger of vanishing beneath rising seas, Mr Cameron said all parties knew what a ""good deal"" looked like and insisted an agreement was ""not difficult, it is do-able"".
""Let's just imagine for a moment what we would have to say to our grandchildren if we failed. We would have to say, it was all too difficult,"" he said. ""They would reply, 'What was it that was so difficult when the Earth was in peril?'"" Mr Cameron said a deal must have a ""binding legal mechanism"" and include a ""five-year review so we can see how we are doing"" against the targets, fi-nancial support for the poorest and most vulnerable countries, and mechanisms to measure and verify progress. He also used the summit to push his renegotiation of Britain's membership of the EU, holding meetings withÊJean-Claude Juncker, theÊEuropean CommissionÊpresident,ÊMatteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, and Antonio Costa, the Portuguese prime minister.
Earlier, the Prince of Wales issued an impassioned plea for action, warning that ""in damaging our climate we are becoming the architects of our own destruction"", while President Obama warned the world had almost run out of time to tackle the problem.
Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, gave a hint of the rows to come as he used his speech to insist that rich nations must make the deepest cuts.
""It is not just a question of historical responsibility, they also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact. AndÊclimateÊjusticeÊdemands that with the little carbon space we still have, developing countries have enough room to grow,"" he said.
Amid the torrent of words, those from tiny nations at the front line of climate change were the most poignant. Christopher Loeak, prime minister of the Marshall Islands, said: ""Everything I know, and everyone I love, is in the hands of those of us gathered here today.""

Climate change 'to bring regular killer heatwaves within 30 years'
By Henry Bodkin
HEATWAVES fierce enough to kill thousands will become the norm in this country within 30 years because of climate change, a report prepared for the Government warns.

Repeats of the extreme heat that killed more than 2,000 people in 2003 are likely to become routine by the 2040s, putting at risk what will be an ageing population.

The Committee on Climate Change, an independent body that advises the Government, said people living in newer homes faced a greater risk of overheating than those in older properties. The analysis also found that the potential for floods put the viability of some conurbations under threat.

While floods and coastal erosion are already a significant risk, the report said that ""more ambitious approaches"" could offset increasing flood damage if global temperatures do not rise more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.

But if temperatures were allowed to rise by 4C, then even the most ambitious schemes would be unlikely to protect against major floods.

At the Paris climate conference in December last year, 195 countries agreed a legally binding deal to keep global warming to below 2C.

Lord Krebs, chairman of the adaptation sub-committee which produced the research, said: ""We must take action now to prepare for the further, inevitable changes we can expect.""

Water shortages for homes, agriculture, energy and industry and effects on domestic and international food production and trade are also among the risks from global warming that urgently need to be tackled, the committee said."

Minister stokes fears of retreat on shutting coal power plants
By Emily Gosden
THE Government has been forced to deny it is watering down its pledge to phase out unabated coal power plants by 2025 after the energy minister suggested there could be leeway in the definition of ""unabated"".

Unabated coal is widely understood to mean any plants that are not fitted with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, which captures the harmful emissions that cause global warming for permanent burial.

But minutes of a coal industry meeting with Andrea Leadsom, the energy minister, record that she encouraged the industry to engage in a forthcoming consultation on the 2025 closure plans, including on the question of ""what is 'unabated coal'?"" The speculation that the consultation could result in the commitment being watered down was compounded when a Whitehall source was quoted in The Independent saying the consultation would consider whether coal could carry on burning if it was ""partially abated"".

The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) refused to provide a definition of ""unabated"" yesterday, indicating this was one of the areas that the forthcoming consultation would ""seek to clarify"".

It is not clear in what way a plant could be ""partially abated"", although it is accepted that even CCS abatement technology is only expected to capture about 90pc of emissions.

A Government source insisted it had no intention of offering a loophole to water down its pledge and suggested the process of defining ""unabated"" would simply mean setting a standard that could allow for CCS. The technology is untested in the UK and is seen as a distant prospect after the Government last year scrapped a ?1bn scheme to develop the technology. Two projects had been competing for that funding: one to retrofit CCS to an existing gas plant at Peterhead in Scotland, and one to build a coal plant with CCS in Yorkshire.

Experts say retrofitting CCS to coal in the UK could be tricky, not least because of the age of most of the coal fleet. A previous Government competition for CCS was cancelled in 2011 as developers planning to retrofit CCS to the Longannet coal plant encountered technical difficulties.

Guy Shrubsole of Friends of the Earth said: ""It's bizarre there's still talk of CCS for coal. Even the most ardent advocates of CCS now accept that it only makes sense for gas and industry.""

The DECC also declined to say how it would treat coal plants that co-fired biomass, such as the unit of Drax which burns 5pc-15pc coal with the remainder biomass. Drax itself acknowledged the coal element of its co-fired unit was unabated. It plans to convert the unit to burn 100pc biomass, subject to state aid clearance, and is also lobbying for subsidies to convert its remaining three coal-fired units.

A spokesman for the DECC said it was ""absolutely committed to phasing out power production from unabated coal by 2025 and it is nonsense to suggest otherwise.""

Trump vows to tear up climate deal in dash for fossil fuels
By Our Foreign Staff
DONALD TRUMP unveiled an ""America first"" plan of unrestricted production of oil, coal, natural gas and other fuel sources yesterday, to push the US toward energy independence.

He promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payments to a UN fund to mitigate effects of climate change worldwide.

It formed part of a populist general election pitch aimed squarely at Hillary Clinton, his likely Democrat rival in the race for the White House.

""She's declared war on the American worker,"" Mr Trump said, reading a prepared text in a stadium packed with thousands in Bismarck, North Dakota.

He delivered the address hours after winning enough delegates to clinch the Republican presidential nomination. Mr Trump focused on coal, in particular, to help make his case against Mrs Clinton, who said in March: ""We're going to put a lot of coalminers and coal companies out of business.""

She has since called the remark ""a misstatement"" and outlined a plan to help displaced coal workers.

Mr Trump said he would do all he could to ""free up coal"" and bring back thousands of jobs lost to cheaper natural gas and regulations designed to cut pollution and greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.

""They love it,"" Mr Trump said of those who work in coal mines. ""We're going to bring it back and we're going to help those people because that's what they want to do.""

The comment marked a shift from a remark he made in a 1990 interview with Playboy magazine, when he compared his career in real estate to ""the story of the coalminer's son"". ""The coalminer gets black-lung disease. His son gets it, then his son. If I had been the son of a coalminer, I would have left the damn mines,"" he told Playboy. ""But most people don't have the imagination - or whatever - to leave their mine.""

Asked about the comments, Mr Trump responded in an email. ""I never had the imagination to leave the real estate industry, until I recently decided to make America great again,"" he said. ""We tend to follow up our father's footsteps, and that's the lifestyle we want, even if it's tougher than other alternatives. Being a coalminer is really tough, but that's what they love, and unlike Hillary Clinton, I am going to make sure they have they have their jobs for many years to come.""

Mr Trump is among many Republicans who reject mainstream arguments on global warming. He has called climate change a ""con job"" and a ""hoax"", and suggested it is a Chinese plot ""to make US manufacturing non-competitive"".

He accused President Barack Obama of doing ""everything he can to get in the way of American energy"".

Mr Trump's remarks were out of step with an ongoing oil boom that has raised US production to record levels and cut gas prices.

The US has been the world's top producer of petroleum and natural gas for the past four years, according to its Energy Department.

Since Mr Obama took office in 2009, US onshore crude oil production has increased by nearly 90 per cent.

Michael Brune, director of the Sierra Club, a US environmental organisation, said Mr Trump's ""so-called energy plan"" was ""an unmitigated disaster""."

Is golf driving Trump to thaw over climate?
By Ruth Sherlock in Washington
DONALD TRUMP has dismissed climate change as a ""hoax"", while at the same time attempting to build a sea wall to protect his golf course in Ireland from ""global warming and its effects"". Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has long publicly asserted that ""nuclear weapons"" are a bigger threat to the climate than increases in the Earth's temperature.

But he is quietly using the case for climate change to argue that he needs to protect his real estate, legal documents show.

Mr Trump bought the golf resort in County Clare in 2014, promising to invest up to ?35 million and ""make it one of the greatest golf courses in the world.""

But before he could even close the deal, a storm eroded 26ft of valuable golfing terrain. Earlier this month, Trump International Golf Links Ireland filed a planning application to the local county council asking to build a two-mile barrier, made up of 200,000 tons of rock, to protect the club from further erosion.

The permit request, which was reviewed by Politico magazine, explicitly cites global warming and its consequences - increased erosion due to rising sea levels and extreme weather - as a primary reason for building the structure.

The petition cited one Irish government study that assumed a steady rate of erosion through to 2050, but it argued that this did not go far enough because it failed to consider the effects of climate change.

The plea is at odds with Mr Trump's public posture. During his election campaign, he has been openly scathing about climate change and repeatedly called the warnings a ""total hoax""."

Steel's battle to survive in the face of spiralling environmental costs
WOLFGANG EDER VIEWPOINT
At first glance, they are two apparently unconnected stories - the Paris agreement to cut global emissions on the one hand, and the current steel crisis with potentially devastating consequences for the UK's industrial sector on the other.

Both have been given great prominence by the media and international opinion leaders in recent months. But, as leading nations of the world gather in New York today to sign the Paris deal from last December, we should remember that climate and industrial policy are in fact two sides of the same coin. The future of the steel industry in Europe and the global framework for emissions control are inextricably linked.

At the moment, the EU is in fact an isolated pioneer when it comes to CO2 reduction measures. EU steel producers are among the global leaders not only in steel-making technology, but also in climate protection. For instance, we at voestalpine, a steel-based technology and capital goods group headquartered in Austria with global operations, are running two of the most efficient steel plants in the world.

None the less, steel producers in Europe face environmental costs that make it almost impossible for them to compete in the global market - even for the most efficient ones. According to the European Commission, just ""regulatory costs"" for the steel industry in the EU amount to almost a third of the sector's operating profit. Production is becoming utterly unsustainable - even for the best performing and environmentally aware companies.

The result? Production of steel is on the verge of moving outside the EU, with no benefits at all for the world's climate. Without consistent global standards, the production of steel will follow the path of least resistance. It will go to the parts of the world with lowest costs, meaning lowest environmental standards, an increasing problem that has been labelled ""carbon leakage"". In fact, this is no obscure academic theory, but a disaster for the future of industrial sites - not just steel - across Europe and the communities that depend on them.

The deal that was agreed in Paris last December (and will be signed in New York today) is a first step - or more precisely a first attempt - in creating a global level playing field. Almost 200 countries have demonstrated a commitment to ambitious climate measures. This is to be welcomed. But the key question that remains for European energyintensive industries is whether the EU will take the result of the Paris summit as a cue to tighten further its climate targets or will it wait to see if other regions actually take part in global climate protection. If the EU continues to intensify its climate goals in a one-sided manner, further collateral damage is unavoidable. In that case, the action against ""global warming"" will gloss over the potential social and economic consequences in Europe.

I doubt that anyone at the UN ceremony in New York today will dwell on these arguments. All the attention is about the commitments - or at least indications - that have been made rather than their actual implementation. But the case should be made. A compulsory global system for climate regulations will be needed to secure the competitiveness of European industry on the one hand and tackle global warming on the other. Instead of one-sided, ideologically motivated goals, we need fair play and intelligent global solutions.

Let's not pretend that every time a plant closes and workers face redundancy that there is something ""inevitable"" or ""irreversible"" about manufacturing decline. It would be stupid to neglect that every operation, every plant has a birth date and passes away at some point of time. But that does not at all mean that manufacturing dies. With the right policies, we can not only prevent further erosion of our industrial base but actually lead a renaissance of manufacturing excellence. We have the know-how and the capabilities, and 38 years in the steel business convince me that it's achievable.

There are still some aces we can play in the UK and across Europe to keep what remains of our industrial strength. Technological leadership is the most effective card we have. Let's not throw it away. We should not aim at low-cost or low-regulation manufacturing, but instead compete on a more promising level by producing higher-tech, higher-quality products.

There's little future in exporting raw or simply processed commodities from a region with the highest overall cost in the world. Instead Europe's industrial companies need to offer new solutions, more sophisticated products for long-term growth industries such as transport, mechanical engineering and consumer goods. That's the route to long-term sustainability and profitability.

There is no doubt: high climate costs in the EU without the investment in innovation will certainly result in a further decline in manufacturing. Therefore, what is needed instead of the highest possible carbon prices, is capital to develop new technologies and more advanced products in order to remain competitive as well as protect the climate.

We require a plan for establishing an efficient, forward-oriented and state-of-the-art production in the UK and across Europe - within a fair system of global climate regulations and not protection for uncompetitive assets in a completely unbalanced world-climate scenario.

That's an industrial and an environmental policy we should all support.

Wolfgang Eder is chairman of the management board of voestalpine. He is also chairman of worldsteel, the second largest industry association in the world, representing 85pc of global steel production

Electric cars will be a good idea one day, but we aren't there yet
BJORN LOMBORG
As Elon Musk presented the new Tesla 3, a fawning press announced that the ""worldchanging car"" could ""dominate"" the market. Within days, 276,000 people had put down $1,000 to preorder the electric vehicle.

But the Model 3 doesn't exist yet. There is no final production version, much less any production. Musk is ""fairly confident"" that deliveries could start by the end of 2017. But running on schedule isn't Tesla's strong suit. Meanwhile, the company's current bestseller has been plagued by quality problems.

All of this might be dismissed as the concerns of a geek - except that these vehicles are hailed as green saviours and so are subsidised to the tune of billions of pounds.

Before unveiling the car, Musk sanctimoniously declared that Tesla exists to give the planet a sustainable future. He pointed to rising CO2 levels. He lamented that 53,000 people die from air pollution from transportation. Tesla, so the story goes, is a lifesaver. Like other electric cars, it has ""zero emissions"" of air pollution and CO2.

But this is only true of the car itself; the electricity powering it is often produced with coal, which means that the clean car is responsible for heavy air pollution. As green venture capitalist Vinod Khosla likes to point out, ""electric cars are coal-powered cars"".

If the US had 10 per cent more petrol cars by 2020, air pollution would claim 870 more lives. A similar increase in electric ones would cause 1,617 more deaths a year, mostly because of the coal burned.

If we were to scale this to the UK, electric cars would cause the same or more air pollution-related deaths than petrol-powered cars.

In China, because their coal power plants are so dirty, electric cars make local air much worse: in Shanghai, pollution from more electricfrom powered cars would be nearly three-times as deadly as more petrol-powered ones.

Moreover, while electric cars typically emit less CO2, the savings are smaller than most imagine. Over a 150,000 km lifetime, the topline Tesla S will emit about 13 tonnes of CO2. But the production of its batteries alone will emit 14 tonnes, along with seven more from the rest of its production and eventual decommissioning.

Compare this with the diesel-powered, but similarly performing, Audi A7 Sportback, which uses about seven litres per 100km, so about 10,500 litres over its lifetime. This makes 26 tonnes of CO2. The Audi will also emit slightly more than 7 tons in production and end-of-life. In total, the Tesla will emit 34 tonnes and the Audi 35. So over a decade, the Tesla will save the world 1.2 tonnes of CO2.

Reducing 1.2 tonnes of CO2 on the EU emissions trading system costs ?5; but instead, the UK Government subsidises each electric car with ?4,500. All of the world's electric cars sold so far have soaked up ?9 billion in subsidies, yet will only save 3.3 million tonnes of CO2. This will reduce world temperatures by 0.00001°C in 2100 - the equivalent of postponing global warming by about 30 minutes at the end of the century.

Electric cars will be a good idea, once they can compete - which will probably be by 2032. But it is daft to waste billions of pounds of public money on rich people's playthings that kill more people through air pollution while barely affecting total carbon emissions.

The Tesla 3 is indeed a ""zero emissions"" marvel - but that is only because it does not yet exist."

Nuclear power shapes up as choice energy source in battle on global climate change
By Xinhua writers Wang Shang, Ma Qian and Deng Yushan
Just like on many other windless days, Beijing was enveloped in a cloak of smog on 18 March, though the winter heating season, which consumes a considerable - albeit dwindling - amount of coal, had just ended.

Under the grey canopy, highranking officials from China and the US braved the unpleasant air and gathered in southwest Beijing for the opening ceremony of the largest nuclear security centre in the Asia-Pacific region.

The advanced facility, a fitting prelude to the fourth Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) in Washington, marks a significant achievement in China-US nuclear security co-operation, and provides a superb venue for international exchanges. It will help promote the peaceful, safe and effective use of nuclear power around the world, which many experts agree serves as a counter to global warming.

DISTINCT ADVANTAGES

In his speech at the 2014 NSS in The Hague, Chinese President Xi Jinping referred to nuclear energy as an important means to ensure energy security and tackle climate change.

Compared with fossil fuels, nuclear power has considerably lower carbon emissions. Guo Zhifeng, an associate professor with the China Institute of Nuclear Information and Economics (CINIE), pointed out that while other parts of the nuclear power industry chain, such as excavating, concentrating and transporting uranium and building nuclear plants, emit greenhouse gases, the electricity generation process of a nuclear reactor discharges zero carbon dioxide. The emission rate of nuclear power, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, is only 1 to 3 per cent of that of coalgenerated electricity.

""Moreover, nuclear power also has its unique advantages over other new energies,"" Guo said, noting that a nuclear power plant produces energy steadily, while the power generation of solar and wind farms relies heavily on the weather, and so is likely to fluctuate.

In addition, as the first nuclear power plant for commercial use was built as early as in 1954, nuclear power generation has already become a mature technology. Even without any further major technological breakthroughs, it can meet the need of replacing fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.

Jin Canrong, deputy director of the School of International Studies at Renmin University of China (RUC) in Beijing, said: ""If we really want to tackle emissions and climate change, climate-neutral nuclear power should not be ignored. Nuclear energy could be our way out of the current energy plight.""

RADIOACTIVE SHADOWS

But nuclear energy does have its downsides. Opponents often argue that radioactive waste from nuclear power plants is too difficult to be dealt with and poses a threat to people and the environment.

They also readily point to the nuclear catastrophes of Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, which have cast a long shadow across the planet.

In the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, Germany decided to halt operations at its eight oldest nuclear plants and shut down the other nine by 2022. France, once the most prominent proponent of nuclear power, has also announced plans to reduce its reliance on nuclear reactors.

However, according to a report presented by the Paul Scherrer Institute, the largest research centre for natural and engineering sciences in Switzerland, nuclear power plants have caused fewer fatalities per unit of energy generated than other major sources of power. ""It's true that the spent fuel rods are highly radioactive, but they can be stored safely,"" said Guo, emphasising that no nuclear power plant has been shut down because of its inability to keep spent fuel rods safe and that past disasters have led to new technological improvements that are making nuclear facilities safer and safer.

To harness nuclear power in modern times is not unlike how mankind learnt how to use fire through a process that mixed excitement and fear about its enormous power.

Jin said: ""We need to find better and safer way to use nuclear energy. And the forthcoming Nuclear Security Summit offers an opportunity for countries to discuss the issue. So it's a positive step.""

GLOBAL ASPIRATIONS

China, in line with its green commitments, has been at pains to reduce its dependence on coalgenerated electricity and is actively reshaping its energy structure by enlarging the share of low-carbon power, particularly nuclear.

By the end of last October, the Chinese mainland had 27 nuclear generating units in operation, with a total installed capacity of 25.50 gigawatts electrical (GWe), and another 25 units under construction with a total installed capacity of 27.51 GWe, according to China's Nuclear Emergency Preparedness, a white paper that Beijing released in January. By 2020 the total capacity is expected to reach 58 GWe.

Guo noted that China, as the world's largest developing and most populous nation, accounts for more than a third of all the nuclear power units that are currently under construction across the globe, so outpacing all other countries in the pursuit of nuclear power.

The front-runner is also leading in developing the third-generation of nuclear reactors. The Hualong (Chinese Dragon) One model, which China has independently developed, has passed IAEA screening and is going global.

A Hualong One nuclear reactor has been under construction in Pakistan. Argentina signed an agreement with China in January to build a reactor of this type as the South American country's fifth nuclear power unit, and Britain is also in talks with China over installing one.

On 17 March, two Chinese nuclear power giants, the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and China National Nuclear Corporation, established a joint venture to promote the Hualong One in overseas markets as the Chinese nuclear power industry's ""flagship brand"".

He Yu, president of CGN, said: ""We believe that Hualong One will be able to grab a large share of the global nuclear power market in the future, which will also drive China's equipment manufacturing industry to go global."""

Politicians must stop dithering over energy
Letters to the Editor

SIR - Jeremy Warner (Business, March 9) highlights the chaotic energy policy that our politicians have created over the past 30 years. They have dithered over nuclear power, accepted the alarmism about global warming, and subsidised unreliable, high-cost wind farms that must be backed up by fossil fuel-fired power stations.

It is now clear that a fleet of new combined-cycle gas-fired power stations is needed, along with new pressurised water nuclear power stations. In the meantime, we should stop closing coal-fired power stations and start fracking for gas.

James Allan Fellow, Energy Institute (retd) Hartlepool, Co Durham SIR - Rupert Darwall's polemic on our energy crunch (Business, March 7) makes three major mistakes.

First, Britain is not going to see a US-style ""shale revolution""; the economics don't stack up, and British people don't want fracking.

Secondly, wind and solar do not impose significant ""hidden"" costs on consumers. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the Government, calculates the cost at about ?10 per year per household.

Thirdly, Mr Darwall assumes that climate change is not a serious issue. It is serious, so a fossil-fuels-as-usual electricity system will not do.

Renewable energy can deliver the market-based electricity system that Mr Darwall wants, but getting there entails some years of transitional support. Renewables will not need the endless subsidies associated with nuclear power and fossil fuels. Catherine Mitchell Professor of Energy Policy University of Exeter Penryn, Cornwall"

'Wind and solar have destroyed the ability of the market to signal price'
RUPERT DARWALL VIEWPOINT
Before the election, high electricity prices made the Big Six energy companies everyone's favourite whipping boys. A report by the competition watchdog exonerated them. Government-driven social, environmental and network costs were the main drivers of rising electricity bills, the Competition and Markets Authority found. Now the Big Six have put themselves squarely back in the frame. A 125-page report by the electricity industry lobby group, Energy UK, supports phasing out cheap coal power and demands more subsidies for wind and solar.

It is a high-risk strategy. In capitulating to ""big wind and solar"", the Big Six energy companies have no one to blame but themselves for the heightened political risk caused by rising electricity prices and the inevitable consumer backlash. Weather-dependent wind and solar power is inherently unreliable and high cost. In addition to subsidies, wind and solar need more grid infrastructure. When the wind blows and the sun shines, they swamp the grid with zero marginal cost electricity, forcing gas, coal and nuclear to reduce their output.

Lower prices and lower output demolish the investment case for building the gas-fired power stations the Government says are vital. These hidden costs are the real killer. As Amber Rudd, the energy and climate secretary, observed in her ""smell the coffee speech"" last November, ""we now have an electricity system where no form of power generation, not even gas-fired power stations, can be built without government intervention"".

Advocates of wind and solar claim falling costs mean renewables will soon reach ""grid parity"". Anyone who knows anything about electricity understands this is highly misleading.

To its great discredit, the Big Six report peddles the grid-parity fib, which ignores the hidden costs imposed on the rest of the system. Rather lamely, the report calls for government and industry to conduct further analysis on the whole-system costs of weatherdependent renewables, something it very well could have done itself.

While the Government insulates wind and solar investors from the damaging effect their output has on the market, the report admits that wind and solar have destroyed the ability of the wholesale market to provide price signals to guide investment decisions. It envisages more wind and solar on the grid, leading to more electricity priced as garbage that consumers are forced to pay someone else to take away during periods of negative prices.

Since last summer, almost 8.5 gigawatts of conventional capacity has closed or faces closure. In 2014, the Big Six made ?556m from renewables and lost ?1,615m on their gas and coal-fired power stations. Without cheap electrical storage, wind and solar can't keep the lights on. The report foresees storage as the ""single most important technological breakthrough"" likely in the next 15 years. One thing's for sure: it hasn't happened yet.

Thanks to government policies deliberately distorting the market, we have over-invested in wind and solar. It has blighted investment in reliable capacity that can keep the lights on. This is the crux of Britain's energy crunch. Clearly it was a colossal mistake to have embarked on renewables with storage unsolved.

The Big Six could have drawn attention to a situation where, in a world awash with hydrocarbons, Britain has an increasing shortage of generating capacity. There is no shortage of energy in the world. Oil prices have been falling. Last month, the US started exporting natural gas for the first time. In the first decade of electricity privatisation, around half Britain's generating capacity was renewed. The market worked.

Now that the market has been destroyed, the real choice is between finding a path back to the market or accepting the Government is running the show. Private ownership and state control is the worst of all worlds. Political risk is borne by the private sector, which in turn means higher electricity bills. Financial efficiency would see new investment being funded off the Government's balance sheet and reinstating the Central Electricity Generating Board. Instead, the Big Six report calls for more honesty about the impact of more renewables on electricity bills without providing any itself. For the industry, higher bills are primarily a PR problem to be solved by better communication.

Energy UK's chief, Lawrence Slade, goes out on a limb in advocating a British equivalent of Germany's disastrous Energiewende (Energy Transition). In 2004, the Green energy minister, Jurgen Trittin, claimed that the extra cost of renewable energy on monthly bills was equivalent to the cost of a scoop of ice cream. Nine years later, CDU minister Peter Altmaier said Energiewende could cost around €1 trillion by the end of the 2030s. The cost of feed-in tariffs and other subsidies is currently €21.8bn a year; €20bn is being spent on a new northsouth high voltage line and investment in other grid infrastructure is likely to double that number.

Thanks to the high volatility of wind and solar output, 25pc of Germany's green energy is dumped on other countries at low or negative prices, destabilising the grid of Germany's neighbours. At home, the situation is just as serious. In 2013, 345,000 households could not pay their electricity bills. In January 2014, Deutsche Bank warned that Germany's energy cost penalty was already eroding its industrial base. In a 2013 survey by the German Chambers of Commerce, over half of industrial companies reported that Energiewende was having a negative or very negative impact on their competitiveness.

To see a successful energy transformation, you have to look across the Atlantic. In the most telling indication of the Big Six surrender to the green lobby, there is not a single mention of fracking and the US shale revolution. But, as the report states, it is assumed that the UK remains part of the European Union and continues to try to meet its legally binding renewable energy targets for 2020 under the 2009 renewable energy directive. The underlying message from the Big Six is clear: if you want lower electricity bills, vote leave."

Christians 'should go green' to save the world
NEWS BULLETIN

Christians should switch to green energy deals to help tackle global warming, the Church of England bishop in charge of environmental issues has said.

The Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Rev Nicholas Holtam, endorsed a new charity campaign encouraging Christians to choose a deal with Green Star Energy with its ""100 per cent clean electricity"".

The ''Big Church Switch'', launched by Christian Aid and Tearfund today, hopes to spur ""hundreds of thousands of Christians to switch suppliers"".

Meanwhile, E.On has suspended its Age UK tariff following allegations that it was poor value for pensioners."

Big oil embraces 'green' carbon capture technology
The fossil fuel industry has become an unlikely ally of environmentalists in the push for new ways to reduce their emissions
By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Houston
THE world's fossil fuel industry has become the most ardent defender of carbon capture, joining environmentalists in an unholy alliance to push for radical changes in public policy to kick-start the technology.
Leaders of the big oil, gas, and coal companies lined up at the IHS CERAWeek summit in Houston, pledging a muscular drive to slash the costs of extracting CO2 from hydrocarbon energy. The goal is some sort of ""Manhattan Project"" breakthrough to safeguard the long-term survival of their companies. ""We can't just keep our heads in the sand,"" said Bob Dudley fromÊBP.
Contrary to widespread belief, the top executives are going out of their way to praise the findings of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC).
""I have read all theÊIPCCÊreports. We understand the risks associated with fossil fuels, and we think we can help mitigate those risks through technology,"" said Darren Woods, the new chief of ExxonMobil.
Few believe that the United States will withdraw from the ParisÊclimateÊagreement under PresidentÊDonald TrumpÊ- despite his rhetoric - or that his election will stop the global push for tighter controls on greenhouse gas emissions in the 2020s and beyond. The historic forces are too powerful.
Rex Tillerson, the US Secretary of State, has warned that it would be fatal for American credibility to pull out of the accord. Ivanka Trump is trying to persuade her father to let the matter drop quietly.
The fear in Houston is that hardening public attitudes and rising penalties on carbon will drive much of the fossil fuel industry out of business unless it can come up with viable forms of carbon capture and storage (CCS). If they fail to take the lead in time, some rival technology may beat them to it and catapult renewables into irreversible dominance.
Mr Woods said ExxonMobil is involved in a quarter of all the CCS projects in the world, and is working on new chemicals that can lower emissions rather then relying on the primitive bolt-on CCS technologies mostly in use today, which gobble up a fifth of the power as ""parasitic load"".
It has launched a joint venture with FuelCell Energy exploring whether carbonate fuel cells can capture 90pc of CO2 gasses cheaply and at scale before they are emitted. ExxonMobil backs a carbon tax.
This is the new orthodoxy of an industry under huge pressure from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and activist shareholders to adapt.
""We believe in the science ofÊclimateÊchange, and it changes the way we invest. We are reducing our own emissions, and we are investing in commercial scale CCS,"" said Steve Pastor, head ofÊBHP Billiton's operations in the US, where the company has major oil and gas assets.
Shell andÊBPÊare funding advanced research on CCS at Imperial College London through the Oil and GasÊClimateÊInitiative, a $1bn (£821m) scheme backed by Europe's leading energy groups.
Ben van Beurden, Shell's chief executive, warned that the political backlash in the advanced democracies poses an existential danger to the fossil fuel companies unless they get ahead of public opinion on global warming. ""Social acceptance is just disappearing. I do think trust has been eroded to the point that it is becoming a serious issue for our long-term future,"" he said in Houston.
Carbon capture is not new. Drillers use CO2 on a commercial basis, pumping it into depleted wells for enhanced oil recovery. The gas sells at $15 (£12) a tonne at current crude prices, but would be worth nearer $40 (£33) in a fresh oil boom. It is used in a host of processes from fertilisers, or the treatment of alkaline waste water, to dry cleaning and decaffeinated coffee.
Utility-scale CCS has so far proved too expensive. Southern Co's project at a Mississippi coal plant in Kemper has been a sorry saga, running $4bn (£3.29bn) over budget and two years late. It will capture just 65pc of the emissions.
The UK is better placed than almost any other country to take the lead on CCS since it has storage sites in the North Sea and a nexus of pipelines already in place. Yet the Government abandoned Britain's £1bn prize for twin projects in Scotland and North Yorkshire in 2105, citing budget costs.
While the abrupt decision caused uproar at the time, it may prove fortuitous if cheaper technologies emerge. ""The most elegant solution is to disassemble the carbon molecule itself. We are not there yet,"" said Lord Browne of Madingley, formerÊBPÊchief and now a champion of green energy causes.
NetPower is building a remarkable pilot project on the Texas Gulf coast, with Exelon andÊToshiba, based on the Allam cycle. Designed by British inventor Rodney Allam, it relies on supercritical oxy-combustion that captures CO2 as part of the process - along with others gases - at zero net cost.
""We can help the world meetÊclimateÊtargets without paying a penny more in electricity costs. All we are is a gas turbine inside a steam process. It's really very simple. People think the story must be too good to be true,"" said NetPower founder Bill Brown.
Mr Brown is off to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states next week, at their invitation. Saudi Aramco already has a cutting-edge CCS venture at its Hawiyah natural gas plant. Its EXPECAdvanced Research Center is scouring the world for the latest ideas.
""The problem is that reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels has not had policy parity,"" said Charles McConnell, former assistant US energy secretary underÊPresident Obama. ""It has no institutional shield of approval. The administration I used to work for said it was a subsidy for the oil and gas industry, if you can believe it.""
Mr McConnell, now head ofÊRice University's Energy and Environment Initiative, said investment in CCS would take off if it was put on a level playing field with renewables like wind and solar. He insists that there is no plausible alternative.
""Energy demand is going to double by 2050 and the reality is that most of this will come from fossil fuels.
""We'll need carbon capture if we are ever going to do anything serious aboutÊclimateÊchange. The world cannot afford to get this wrong,"" he said.

Consumers unwilling to alter lifestyle for climate
NEWS BULLETIN

Two fifths of Britons are unwilling to make any changes to their lifestyle to help combat the threat of climate change, a survey has found.

Despite more than 80 per cent of Britons saying they are concerned about the impact global warming will have on the UK, 40 per cent said they were not willing to make any personal changes to help address the problem, a study by solar panel firm REC found.

Previous research has found widespread support for the UK signing up to international goals to curb carbon emissions. But hitting such goals is likely to require significant consumer lifestyle changes, such as swapping diesel and petrol cars for electric plug-in vehicles, and replacing gas ovens and heating systems with electric or renewable alternatives.

The survey of 2,000 UK consumers found that only 12.3 per cent were prepared to buy electric vehicles."

Well–regulated shale gas industry will help cut Britain's import bills and carbon dioxide emissions
Telegraph Personal view

Lord Browne
Mankind has a tortured relationship with the earth's natural resources. In my 45 years of experience in the energy industry, the development of any hydrocarbon resource has always been met with some sort of opposition.

But it is our ability and willingness to put those resources to work that has lifted whole nations out of poverty, freed mankind from the shackles of subsistence living, and provided us with health, wealth and happiness which our ancestors could only dream of. In Britain today, the stakes are not quite so existential. But the safe, responsible and sustainable development of the country's natural resources remains a national imperative.

In the 1970s, the discovery of oil and gas under the North Sea fundamentally altered Britain's economic prospects. It was greeted with economic scepticism and environmental opposition, and the unfortunate absence of a sovereign wealth fund means that we cannot always see the benefits which the industry has provided. North Sea production may not have reduced international oil and gas prices, but it provided Britain with new businesses, jobs, economic growth and more than ?300bn of tax receipts. We live in a wealthier nation as a result.

In addition to those economic benefits, North Sea gas production combined with the liberalisation of the power market in the early 1990s led to the rapid expansion of gas–fired electricity generation, which made a major contribution to the 15 per cent reduction in UK carbon dioxide emissions between 1990 and the present day. With the discovery of very significant onshore natural gas resources in the form of shale gas, Britain once again has the opportunity to make a pivotal economic and environmental decision.

We must make that decision in open consultation with all of those who would be affected by a shale gas industry. But a productive conversation will be significantly more difficult in the absence of accurate information about onshore operations.

Operators, governments and regulators have a duty to support campaigns of information, so that the nation can leave behind the myths, scaremongering and confusion which have characterised much of the debate so far.

There is no evidence that the development of a shale gas industry will lock Britain into a high–carbon, fossil fuel future. The International Energy Agency has recently noted that to prevent damaging levels of global warming, the world can only afford to emit another 900 gigatons of carbon dioxide between now and 2050, equivalent to one third of the world's proven fossil fuel reserves. But not all fossil fuels are created equal. We could in fact burn all of the world's proven gas reserves, and spend just 40 per cent of our carbon budget. Burn just half of the world's coal reserves, however, and we would emit over two thousand gigatons of carbon dioxide, or more than twice the carbon budget.

Britain should be aiming for a balanced carbon diet, but we are currently consuming more coal and less gas than at any point since 1995. Renewable energy output is rising, but it is not enough to compensate for our growing dependency on coal.

Domestically produced gas is less carbon–intensive than both coal and the increasing amounts of imported gas which the UK is consuming, so providing that shale gas displaces these fuels from our energy mix, it can help Britain to meet its carbon dioxide reduction targets.

Thanks to the shale gas revolution, American carbon dioxide emissions have fallen more than those of any other nation over the past eight years, while wind generation capacity doubled and solar generation capacity tripled in 2012 alone. All the evidence suggests that natural gas can and must play a critical role in a low–carbon future.

There is also no evidence that hydraulic fracturing contaminates water. Shales and aquifers are too far apart for this to occur, especially in Britain, where the Bowland shale is considerably thicker and deeper than shales in the USA. However, poorly built wells could potentially leak, releasing methane into aquifers nearer the surface and into the atmosphere. This is very much rarer than popular films and documentaries would lead viewers to believe. In almost all cases of alleged contamination examined in one study, there was either no methane present, or it came from natural sources like wetlands. Like any industrial activity, onshore hydrocarbon production can be done well and it can be done badly, which is an argument in favour of tough regulation to enforce best practice. In my experience at BP, best practice is not only good for the environment, but it is also good for business. During my time as CEO, we saved $650m (?396m) simply by tightening valves and reducing waste.

Stories of carbon dioxide or methane emissions and water contamination are just two sorts of misinformation. Others concern earth tremors, water consumption, use of toxic chemicals and the industrialisation of the countryside. Misinformation and myth should be credibly met with facts and evidence, preferably by an independent commission on shale gas charged with running a campaign of information. If that succeeds, then Britain will be in a position to reap the economic benefits of greater domestic energy production.

Those benefits could be enormous. Britain is more dependent on energy imports than at any time since 1975. Shale gas production is no panacea, but it could cut the UK's annual gas import bill in half by 2030, which means more money remaining in the British economy. The Institute of Directors estimates that the industry could support up to 75,000 jobs, and it could create new centres of technology and expertise outside of the booming South East. Natural gas is abundant, it can provide reliable baseload power to complement a thriving renewable energy sector, and it could put downward pressure on prices by displacing more expensive LNG from the European market.

We still do not know how much of Britain's vast shale gas reserves can be extracted economically. The industry needs to drill and fracture between 20 and 40 wells before we can speak about the future with any kind of certainty. But the potential benefits are too great to ignore. The development of Britain's onshore gas reserves is a national imperative.

Obama to cut power station emissions
By Peter Foster in Washington
PRESIDENT Barack Obama thrust the US into the forefront of efforts to strike a global deal to combat climate change, announcing tough new targets that will require US power plants to cut their carbon dioxide emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.

The plan, which ends years of US foot-dragging, was welcomed as a ""momentous"" step forward by climate experts, as Mr Obama risked a political backlash at home.

Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's climate action commissioner, welcomed ""the strongest action ever taken"" by a US government to counter global warming, adding that Mr Obama's decision should spur efforts to finalise an international climate change agreement in Paris next year.

Lord Stern of Brentford, the author of a 2007 British government report on the economics of climate change, said Mr Obama had shown ""real leadership"". ""These plans should put pressure on European leaders to stop dithering over their plans and to commit to strong cuts of 40 per cent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels,"" he added.

Mr Obama's announcement is a gamble that sets up a fierce battle with Republicans in November's mid-term elections. Democrats will now face awkward re-election battles in coal-burning states.

Anticipating resistance from special interests that warned the guidelines ""will kill jobs or crush the economy"", Mr Obama said such predictions would prove unfounded, as they were when laws were introduced to combat smog, acid rain or car pollution.

""What we've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you give workers and businesses the tools and the incentives they need to innovate,"" he said.

The proposals made good Mr Obama's promise to use his regulatory authority to bypass a grid-locked Congress and address climate change, on which he said the science was ""now settled"".

""Climate change is real. It has impacts not just in the distant future, it has serious impacts as we speak,"" he said to an audience of groups, including the Lung Association, that are affected by pollution. ""Today carbon emissions are as low as they've been in about 20 years, and that's a good start, but... for the sake of our children, we're going to have to do more.""

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plan will have a particular impact on coal-fired power stations and will face possible legal challenges and the risk of being watered down if the Republicans were to win the White House in 2016.

Mitch McConnell, the senior Republican in the Senate, accused Mr Obama of inflicting ""acute pain"" on coal-dependent states such as Virginia and Kentucky.

However, Gina McCarthy, the EPA administrator, said cutting 30 per cent of power plant emissions from their 2005 levels was the equivalent of cancelling out all the annual carbon pollution from two thirds of the cars and lorries in America."

Britain freed of duty to build wind farms in EU energy deal
By Emily Gosden
BRITAIN will no longer be forced to build wind and solar farms from 2020, under a new European Union climate–change deal that allows countries to choose how to cut their carbon emissions.

EU leaders pledged yesterday to cut Europe's greenhouse–gas emissions by at least 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2030, in an agreement that ministers say will bring the rest of Europe into line with the UK's commitments.

The deal does not impose binding targets for renewable energy or energy effi–ciency on individual countries, following lobbying by Britain.

Instead, it sets a binding target for 27 per cent renewable energy and a nonbinding target for 27 per cent energy efficiency improvements – but only at EU level.

Current legally binding targets require Britain to generate 15 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. In practice, it effectively means more than 15 per cent.

Critics say that the targets have forced Britain down an expensive and unsightly path of building heavily–subsidised wind farms, solar farms and wood–burning biomass plants.

Some countries, including Germany, had sought binding targets to force other European countries to cut their energy consumption.

The agreement said: ""These targets will be achieved while fully respecting the member states' freedom to determine their energy mix. Targets will not be translated into nationally binding targets.""

Ed Davey, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said the deal was ""good for consumers because we can decarbonise at the lowest possible cost using a diverse mix of technologies"".

""This is a historic moment. Europe has sent a clear and firm message to the world that ambitious climate action is needed now.

""True to our word, we have delivered a highly ambitious EU climate target, while also significantly strengthening Europe's energy security by making us less reliant on imported energy. This morning only five countries in Europe had climate targets post–2020, now 28 countries do."" But Richard Black, head of the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the deal did not go far enough towards tackling climate change.

""The EU deal was probably the best compromise that progressive countries could hope for, given concerns of various nations about coal–burning and competitiveness.

""However, it is also a compromise with the climate system and with the needs of future generations.

""It's not at all clear that this deal will allow the EU to meet its long–term target of virtually eliminating carbon emissions by mid–century, which science suggests is necessary for limiting global warming to 2C."""

Weak agreement on world climate targets
UN climate change talks have been saved from the brink of collapse by a ""weak"" agreement that could let countries dodge setting clear targets to cut their emissions.

Negotiations in Lima, the Peruvian capital, dragged on to the early hours of yesterday morning amid deep disagreements between rich and poor nations over how to tackle global warming. The divisions eventually resulted in a ""bare minimum"" deal that left many key disputes unresolved. The Lima deal is intended to make countries issue pledges outlining the action they will take to cut carbon emissions. The pledges are then supposed to form the basis of a binding deal in Paris next year. However, after objections from developing nations, the eventual text was watered down so the rules are voluntary."

Most coal 'should stay in ground'
By Emily Gosden
LESS than a fifth of the world's existing coal reserves can be burnt if the world wants to avoid dangerous global warming, while developing oil and gas in the Arctic is ""inconsistent"" with tackling climate change, government–funded research has found.

A third of existing oil reserves and half of gas reserves must also stay in the ground if the world wants to avert extremes of climate change in the most cost–effective way, the study by scientists at University College London concluded. UK shale gas development could still be compatible with global warming goals, but only if it is used as a substitute for other more expensive or polluting fossil fuels, the authors said.

The study, published in the journal Nature, is the latest contribution to the debate over the so–called ""carbon bubble"" – the theory that if global warming is to be limited to within 2C, the stated UN goal, carbon emissions must be capped such that much of the world's existing fossil fuel reserves can never be burnt.

Proponents of the theory argue that investing in fossil fuel companies is increasingly risky as a result.

Energy companies suggest it is unrealistic to think the world will agree the stringent emissions reductions needed to reach the 2C goal.

The majority of coal reserves in China, Russia and the US and some 260bn barrels of Middle Eastern oil must be left in the ground, the study found."

He wears white, but is he really green?
Geoffrey Lean
Stand by for an unholy row. Next week the Pope is expected to come out as perhaps the world's most effective environmental campaigner.

On Thursday, Pope Francis will issue the first-ever encyclical on the environment. The most authoritative document a pontiff can publish, this encyclical is also the first to try to influence a global political process. It is unapologetically aimed at helping to forge global agreement to tackle climate change at a special summit in Paris in December.

Circulated to the Church's 5,000 bishops and 400,000 priests, it is a call to action for the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. Prayer vigils and pilgrimages, protests and policy briefings have all been prepared, as environmentalists and the faithful alike seek to maximise its leverage.

The Pope himself will front the campaign, travelling to the US in September to speak at the United Nations and metaphorically entering the lions' den by addressing Congress - about a third of whose members are Catholics, but which remains the world's most resistant legislative body to taking action on global warming.

It is timely. Last weekend, the G7 leaders pledged to phase out fossil fuels by the end of the century. On Wednesday, BP hailed a ""watershed moment"" as the growth of fossil fuels slowed faster last year than at any time since the depths of the recession, and called for a ""substantial"" deal in Paris. And on Thursday, the latest session of the tortuous UN negotiations on the agreement ended with rare, but real, progress.

Theologians say the encyclical has attracted unprecedented interest, even before publication. Environmentalists believe that the intervention of the world's most popular and respected leader will have a major, possibly decisive, impact. Dr Mary Evelyn Tucker, director of Yale University's Forum on Religion and Ecology, even calls it ""the most important thing that will happen in our lifetime on the environment"".

It also marks a big landmark for the church. Only once before, say experts, has an encyclical sought to influence a political process, rather than react to it - when Pius XI proclaimed his ""burning anxiety"" at events in Nazi Germany. But that was addressed to one country, not the whole world. And publishing it months before the Paris meeting shows - as Catherine Pepinster, editor of The Tablet, puts it - that Pope Francis ""is willing to intervene in a quite deliberate way in the global political process"".

Appropriately for the first scientist Pope (he trained as a chemist), the encyclical is also thought to be the first to be rooted in science, based on the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And, as the first one that is entirely Francis's work, it is expected to be especially authoritative.

Not that other popes haven't shown concern. Paul VI issued a statement on a ""hospitable Earth"" to the groundbreaking 1972 Stockholm conference. John Paul II stressed a duty to safeguard the environment, and Benedict XVI became known as the ""green pope"" for his writings. But Pope Francis's encyclical goes far further, by enshrining environmental protection as central to the faith. Though not infallible, its teaching becomes part of Catholic doctrine: disregarding it requires powerful evidence and argument.

Old Argentinian colleagues say Francis did not seem particularly environmentally conscious, and were surprised when he chose the name of the greenest saint. But he has a longstanding concern for the poor, and has been much influenced by reports filtering up through the church from the grassroots of how climate change is already devastating their lives (the decision to publish was taken after visiting the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan).

His green Greek Orthodox counterpart, Patriarch Bartholomew, has also been very influential.

The encyclical - called Laudato sii (Be Praised) - is expected to address the whole environment, not just climate change, and concentrate on morality, much more than science, focusing on human development and concern for the poor.

But that has not stopped climate change sceptics, especially in the US, already denouncing it, in a foretaste of an almighty row to come. They have accused Francis of ""demeaning"" the Papacy and ""kicking the poor in the teeth"". They have called him ""callous"", ""Marxist"" and even ""pagan"", and warned him to ""back off"" and ""not do this again"".

Catholic figures confess to wry amusement that, having been condemned since Galileo for being anti-science, the Church is now under fire for supporting it.

But the sceptics are right to be worried.

The encyclical could do much to persuade previously lukewarm countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe of the need for a climate agreement. And it could move huge numbers of undecided American Catholics.

And Congress? We're hoping, says one doubtless particularly faith-filled archbishop, that they will listen to the Pope's message with ""open hearts""."

Energy needs real reform if Britain is to keep the lights on
Viewpoint

Andrew Critchlow
energy industry has cause to celebrate the resounding Conservative victory in the general election. Under an illconceived, Labour-led coalition government — backed by the Scottish nationalists and Greens — the lights would have been in danger of going out across the land before Christmas.

More than any other sector, energy would have felt the full force of Ed Miliband's socialist quest to hammer free enterprise by virtually making ""profit"" a prohibited word in the English language. The now ex-leader of Labour had placed freezing energy prices — in effect choking off private investment — at the top of his party's agenda without any consideration for the massive shortfall in energy supply which Britain faces.

David Cameron's choice to lead the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) will now be critical in ensuring a competitive environment for energy utilities to make a fair profit. It will need to make sure investment is encouraged to generate the new electricity capacity that is vital to power the growing economy that will come from another five years of Conservative government.

With spare energy capacity expected to drop to around 4pc again this winter, Britain must urgently build more conventional and nuclear power plants without delay. Forget ill-conceived commitments to generate 15pc of the UK's power from renewables by the end of the decade by building even more useless windmills and solar parks. The construction of the Hinkley Point nuclear plant and several new gas-fired stations is now vital.

As the North Sea declines, the burden for supplying our oil and gas will increasingly fall on securing abundant and reliable sources of fossil fuels from overseas. The lessons of the past six months are that the UK cannot fall into the trap now facing the rest of Europe, which is increasingly beholden to Russia and the mood swings of Vladimir Putin for a large proportion of its gas supplies.

If we are to import more natural gas, this must come from reliable partners such as Norway and Qatar, who we can trust will not hold the nation to ransom for political gain. Onshore, important decisions must also to be taken on how to move forward the development of shale oil and gas resources, which in some cases exist in areas of green belt and natural beauty. Although no one wants to see Britain's countryside turned into Texas, with a ""nodding donkey"" in the corner of every green field, our economy will wither and die unless we find a way to harness our onshore fossil fuel resources. The jobs and industrial growth created by shale in the US should be enough motivation to exploit our own resources.

Following the departure from DECC of Tory minister Michael Fallon to defence last year, the process of encouraging the nascent shale industry in the UK appeared to stall. The danger is that the opportunity to tap this potentially vast resource will be lost unless the energy department and the new Oil and Gas Authority do more to encourage major companies to invest.

Then there is climate change.

Policymakers will gather in Paris later this year to hammer out a binding agreement on carbon emissions and limiting global warming. Britain has already made an important contribution to the debate and placed renewables at the centre of energy policy. But it cannot afford to fall into the trap set by the climate change zealots who would see our great oil and gas companies bankrupted on the evidence of some questionable scientific assumptions.

As Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP, recently pointed out when asked about the ""carbon bubble"" theory, the solution to reducing emissions doesn't have to be financial Armageddon that would follow divestment from the industry. According to Mr Hayward, if much of the billions invested into renewables over the last 20 years had instead been directed towards technologies such as carbon capture which can mitigate pollution, then climate change might not be such as issue.

However, under the Lib Dems' Ed Davey - who lost his seat in the election and saw his party wiped out in the polls - DECC lurched too far towards pandering to the green lobby and arguably made itself the enemy of an industry that it is intended to nurture and oversee. Mr Davey, who is unlikely to ever return to political life in any serious decision-making capacity, appeared to make it his primary goal in government to attack the energy industry at every possible opportunity.

Last year, Mr Davey's astonishing claim that fossil fuel companies could be turned into the ""sub-prime assets of the future"" by action to limit climate change demonstrated what was wrong at the heart of DECC while he held a ministerial role. His judgment and naivety on critical issues such as the environment arguably helped to drive a wedge between fossil fuel-producing industries, which are vital to the British economy, and campaigners. A long-term solution to global warming can only be reached with the support and investment of the energy industries, which wants to help provided they aren't portrayed by government ministers as the root of all evil.

The rumour is that Mr Fallon was originally given the role of energy minister — a position that was held later by Matthew Hancock — to keep an eye on Mr Davey who it was feared would stray off the reservation on Coalition policy. Now that Mr Cameron has a majority there is arguably no need to have two ministers taking care of what is essentially the same portfolio.

Not even energy superpower Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has two energy ministers and neither should the UK. Amalgamating the portfolio would immediately cut red tape, streamline decision making, create a clear vision for the future and ultimately save the Government money.

According to BP, world energy demand is expected to grow by 40pc through to 2030 as Asia and markets in South America and Africa draw on more power for their expanding economies. Unless Britain gets its energy governance and policies right we risk being left behind in an increasingly competitive race to secure access to finite resources. Therefore, Mr Cameron should seize the opportunity he has earned by winning a spectacular election victory and use his mandate to reform DECC and prepare Britain to lead the world in energy.

Our dividend is safe from climate change laws, pledges BHP Billiton
By Andrew Critchlow
BHP Billiton, one of the largest producers of fossil fuels, will be able to maintain its dividend to shareholders regardless of measures nations may introduce to limit climate change, the company's chief executive has said.

It has the ability to change focus to copper and uranium mining, said Andrew Mackenzie.

The Anglo-Australian commodities firm, among the world's biggest producers of coal, has been criticised by climate change campaigners who argue that most remaining fossil fuels must remain in the ground to limit the pace of global warming.

Last month the Church of England decided to move its investments out of fossil fuel-producing assets involved in tar sands and thermal coal amid a growing activist campaign.

But speaking exclusively to the Telegraph, Mr Mackenzie said that the company had a diverse range of production assets including copper and uranium that would enable it to adjust in line with any changes to global policies on climate change. ""We look at a number of scenarios of how the climate change debate will play out because we're believers in climate science,"" said Mr Mackenzie. ""There are many choices that the world could make but it doesn't matter whether that choice is more renewables or actually a continuation of current predominant supply of fossil fuels maybe supported by carbon capture and storage; we have a business plan for that. In all cases we have tested it and those business plans would make good returns to underpin the dividend.""

The UN has convened crunch climate change talks in Paris this year aimed at reaching a binding agreement between the biggest economies to limit carbon emissions to reduce global warming to within 2 deg C. ""Whatever way the world chooses to manage itself to a 2 degree margin on global warming we have a business plan that allows us to remain committed to our dividend,"" said Mr Mackenzie.

Concern over the pace of climate change has prompted debate about a potential ""carbon bubble"", in which investments in fossil fuels could become worthless if those fuels can never be used because of their environmental impact.

Mr Mackenzie said that BHP Billiton - the largest miner on the FTSE - would remain committed to a ""progressive"" dividend. Mining stocks have suffered over the past year due to a near collapse in prices for core commodities such as iron ore, in the face of a slowdown in demand growth from China.

""There is a little bit of a glimmer in China at the moment but I don't know how sustained that will be,"" said Mr Mackenzie. ""What is more significant is that this is a business that has seen a phenomenal period of growth which is unlikely to be repeated. It is now going back to being a more normal business where you have to compete by being very good on costs."""

Cameron must go green – and mean it
Geoffrey Lean
It was the day Michael Gove finally came out. Standing before a packed parliamentary room of Conservatives, the Education Secretary confessed to being a ""shy green"". He had learnt, he added ""that I'm an environmentalist, but a lot of the time I didn't realise it"".

Just hours earlier, the Prime Minister had made his strongest statement on ""man–made climate change"" in years, calling it ""one of the most serious threats that this country and the world faces"". And just hours before that, the Telegraph had reported that the Government was dropping plans, exposed in this column last Saturday, to suburbanise National Parks by allowing landowners to convert barns into clusters of homes.

It was thus perhaps the best day for turquoise Tories since Mr Cameron's pledge, four years ago, to run ""the greenest government ever"". Serendipitously, the blue greens had chosen it to launch ""the most comprehensive attempt yet to identify the doctrines of Conservative environmentalism"", a report with chapters by ""14 senior global figures"" including Arnold Schwarzenegger, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, Unilever CEO Paul Polman, Owen Paterson, the Environment Secretary, and (rather incongruously) me.

Gove also contributed a chapter and, his confession made, he told those at the report's launch that environmental concerns ""come naturally to Conservatives"", adding it was ""unarguable"" that humanity was changing the climate in potentially ""devastating"" ways, and that action should be taken.

Hitherto he has been less shy than Garboesque about his environmentalism; he's mainly known for last year's omission of climate change from the geography curriculum. But he is just the latest supposedly sceptical minister – others include Philip Hammond and George Osborne – to stress the threat of global warming, while the formerTory leader, Michael Howard, told a private dinner that it was time for the Coalition to be proactive.

Historically, governments of the Right, both in Britain and the United States, have done most for the environment; examples include the Reagan administration's leadership on protecting the ozone layer and Mrs Thatcher's pioneering push for action on global warming. The present fashionable Right–wing antipathy to greenery is a late aberration, originating in a group set up by the orthographically challenged former US vice–president Dan Quayle. In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain campaigned on action to combat climate change, while governors from the same party – including Schwarzenegger and Mitt Romney – pioneered practical measures on the ground. Congressional resistance to it began as a political ploy, only recently hardening into ideology.

David Cameron's early environmentalism was thus in a long tradition; his subsequent silence (he has yet to make a green speech as Prime Minister) and cuts to flood defences conflicted with it. A pushback began last autumn when green Tory MPs and ministers began organising. Last month they published a report of their own. And there have been growing signs that the public is bored by the carping of sceptics, just as it was turned off some years ago by self–righteous climate campaigners.

The floods have catalysed both public and political change. The numbers telling pollsters that the environment should be a top political priority trebled to 23 per cent last month, a level unseen for two decades. Politicians grasped the disruption that extreme weather can bring. Besides the smashing of the rail link to the West Country, sources say that Immingham came within centimetres of inundation from high seas in early December. The penny is dropping that the costs of prevention pale besides those of reconstruction.

Top Tories have also begun to raise their sights from parliamentary to electoral politics as polling day approaches. Lib Dems pose the main challenge in almost half of their top target seats; anti–green policies won't win those voters over. Meanwhile, nearly half of Ukip's supporters say they cannot be wooed at any price.

Crucially, Cameron's own credibility, with both business and the electorate, is connected with rediscovering the environment. Companies increasingly take the long view to a low–carbon future. And when the public hears the husky–hugger sound off about ""green crap"" it tends, fatally, to doubt his authenticity.

As it happens, the Prime Minister has an opportunity to restore his credentials at a new climate summit scheduled for New York in September to prepare for agreement on a new international treaty. Leadership there would do nothing but good. At home, of course, many in his party have yet to be persuaded, but he can now draw on apparently unlikely allies, including the two Michaels, Howard and Gove.

For as the Education Secretary – quoting Mrs Thatcher – made clear, Conservatives traditionally recognise that ""we have a full repairing lease on this planet, not a freehold that allows us to do what we will"".

USAToday-1.txt,"5 takeaways about the climate deal
Eric J. Lyman, Special for USA TODAY Published 2:07 p.m. ET Dec. 12, 2015 | Updated 12:08 a.m. ET Dec. 13, 2015The 195-nation U.N. climate summit concluded with delegates adopting the Paris Agreement, the first-ever global climate deal of this sweep and ambition. Here are five things to know about the accord:

THE 2-DEGREE TARGET

• The world will look to limit global warming  by 2100 to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, compared to pre-industrial levels. It also lists 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) as an aspirational goal, but leaves a lot of the decision-making for that goal until a future date. According to climate models, the national climate pledges submitted by countries before the Paris summit will only limit warming to between 2.7 and 3.5 degrees Celsius (4.9 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit, meaning further action will need to be taken.

Climate deal within reach; 'powerful' document drafted in Paris
 FOLLOW THROUGH STEPS

• To that end, the agreement formally asks the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the U.N. climate science and research body, to issue a special report in 2018 detailing steps needed to reach the 2- and 1.5-degree Celsius targets. The deal also requests that countries re-submit the pledges made this year by 2020, reflecting the conclusions of the IPCC report and new developments in technology. A similar review is scheduled to take place every five years starting in 2020.

FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS

• With the worldwide economic crisis still lingering, countries were slow to commit on financial issues. Industrialized countries promised in 2009 to provide $100 billion per year to help poor countries adapt to the impacts of climate change by 2020. They could not agree on a target for after 2020, and so instead they agreed to use the $100 billion figure as a floor for subsequent years. More specific goals will be decided in the future.

RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENTS
• The agreement provides a big indirect push for the development of renewable energy sources, but few direct incentives. Language calling for “de-carbonization” or “zero emissions” at some future date has been left out. But experts said the long-term temperature goals, along with individual national climate pledges that often include goals for clean energy, would act indirectly as incentives for a big ramp-up in investments in renewable energy.

A generation of progress on climate change
ELEVATED STATUS

• Climate change has become a headline issue. When the Kyoto Protocol was agreed to back in 1997, it was seen as an environmental agreement. Now it is a top geopolitical issue that attracted 147 heads of government at the opening sessions. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, the summit’s president, is a higher rank than the ministers of environment who presided over the most recent summits. There is already buzz that Fabius, or perhaps the U.N. climate secretariat, could be in line for a Nobel Peace prize."

195 countries signed the Paris deal, 2 oppose it. For now.
Mike James, USA TODAY
This file photo taken on November 04, 2016 shows The Arc de Triomphe (Arch of Triumph) illuminated with the lettering reading 'The Paris accord is done' in Paris, to celebrate the first day of the application of the Paris COP21 climate accord.

A view of a power plant in New York, New York, USA, 10 March 2017.

If President Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, the nation will be allied — environmentally speaking — with Nicaragua and Syria.

Trump still hasn't said for sure whether he plans to back out of the climate pact, which the U.S. and 194 other nations around the globe have signed. But The New York Times, CNN and CBS News, citing unnamed U.S. officials, reported Wednesday that Trump intends to withdraw from the agreement.

The president played his cards close to his chest Wednesday afternoon in the White House's Oval Office, deflecting questions about whether he plans to withdraw from the Paris accord.

“You’re going to find out very soon,"" Trump told reporters. The president has scoffed at green causes in the past, even tweeting in a famous 2012 comment, ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" He later said his tweet was a joke.

A secession from the Paris alliance would leave the U.S., which the European Commission cites as the second largest carbon dioxide-emitting nation on the planet, as one of only three nations out of 197 that are entitled to be in the pact but refuse to do so. The others are Syria and Nicaragua.

Nicaragua's envoy Paul Oquist said in a statement last year that Nicaragua, which produces only a tiny fraction of the greenhouse emissions as the U.S., believes rich industrialized countries should pay more for climate change, since they cause more of the problem.

Syria, heavily sanctioned by the U.N. over human rights violations amid a civil conflict in the nation, flatly refused to commit to climate emissions control.

Even the rogue hermit nation of North Korea ratified the Paris agreement, as well as its predecessor, the Kyoto Protocol. North Korea also pledged last year to wage ""war on deforestation"" and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 37%.

Among the other U.N.-sanctioned or war-torn nations who have signed the Paris agreement:

Experts warned that a U.S. pull-out from the agreement could have troubling consequences.

“The actions of the United States are bound to have a ripple effect in other emerging economies that are just getting serious about climate change, such as India, the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia,” Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton, told the Times.

Other nations may pull out, creating a domino effect that could cripple the strength of the alliance. In the long run, it would thwart one of the main aims of the alliance, which is to lower planet-warming emissions enough to avoid an irrevocable global change, Oppenheimer said in the interview.

“We will see more extreme heat, damaging storms, coastal flooding and risks to food security,” Oppenheimer told the Times. “And that’s not the kind of world we want to live in.”

The aim of the Paris agreement is to gradually reduce emissions that cause climate change in order to prevent a major increase in the global temperatures that could raise sea levels, spark major droughts, and lead to more dangerous storms. When it took effect in 2016, environmental groups and political leaders heralded it as a critical step in trying to reverse man-made ravages on the global environment.

The truth about why people don't trust science
Alia E. Dastagir, USA TODAY
Americans aren’t at war with science — just with themselves.

People protest for greater action against climate change during the People's Climate March on September 21, 2014 in New York City.

Climate change activists carry signs as they march during a protest in Philadelphia a day before the start of the Democratic National Convention, on July 24, 2016.

Scientists and their allies are expected to fill the streets of the nation’s capital Saturday for Earth Day's March for Science, advocating for the importance of scientific truth in an era we’ve ominously been told doesn’t value the truth any longer.

Advocates say science is under attack. President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt doesn’t accept evidence that shows humans are causing climate change. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos' 2001 comments on wanting to “advance God’s kingdom” through education have educators worried she could undermine the teaching of evolution in public schools. Trump’s budget blueprint slashes funding for the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy's Office of Science.

Esteemed astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, in an impassioned video on his Facebook page, said he fears people have lost the ability to judge what's true and what's not.

""That is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy,"" he says.

The scientific community is alarmed by the Trump administration, and by what they see as the diminishing role of objective science in American life. But the General Social Survey, one of the oldest and most comprehensive recurring surveys of American attitudes, shows that although trust in public institutions has declined over the last half century, science is the one institution that has not suffered any erosion of public confidence. Americans who say they have a great deal of confidence in science has hovered around 40% since 1973.

Many scientists say there is no war on their profession at all.

According to the 2016 GSS data released this month, people trust scientists more than Congress (6%) and the executive branch (12%). They trust them more than the press (8%). They have more trust in scientists than in the people who run major companies (18%), more than in banks and financial institutions (14%), the Supreme Court (26%) or organized religion (20%).

So why all the headlines about the ""war on science""?

Though science still holds an esteemed place in America, there is a gap between what scientists and some citizens think — a rift that is not entirely new — on issues such as climate change, nuclear power, genetically modified foods, human evolution and childhood vaccines.

Americans don’t reject science as a whole. People love the weather forecast. They love their smartphones. When people reject science, it’s because they’re asked to believe something that conflicts with a deeply held view, whether political (my party does not endorse that), religious (my god did not say that) or personal (that's not how I was raised).

Many conservatives reject the science of man-made climate change, just as many liberals reject the science that shows nuclear energy can safely combat it. The views we express signal which political group we belong to. The gap between what science shows and what people believe, experts say, is about our identity.

“The issue of climate change isn’t about what you know,” said Dan Kahan, a professor of psychology and law at Yale and a member of the university’s Cultural Cognition Project. “It’s about who you are.”

Polarization has exacerbated our differences, and we know some of what’s to blame: The rise of social media. A more partisan press. A dearth of universally-accepted experts. And greater access to information, which Christopher Graves, president and founder of the Ogilvy Center for Behavioral Science, said does not tug us toward the center, but rather makes us more polarized.

“A human being cannot grasp something as a fact if it in any way undermines their identity,” Graves said. “And that is an immutable human foible. These things have always been there, but not at scale.""

The GSS data show confidence in institutions overall has been in decline since the 1970s, though political scientists are quick to caution that this is an imperfect benchmark.

Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, said trust in the mid-20th century was unnaturally high and polarization was unnaturally low, bolstered by unusual growth in middle class income and a reduction of inequality, which is when the ""20th century version of the American dream and the trust in government to produce it was fully mythologized.""

“There was an usually high level of trust that came out of World War II, before the turn towards a more cynical view of the institutions of society — especially politics and media — after Vietnam and Watergate,"" Nyhan said.

So how much more polarization can we expect?

Social scientists aren't sure, but they agree Trump complicates things.

""He really is an us-versus-them figure,"" Kahan said. ""People aren’t thinking about the arguments. They’re thinking about what side they're on.""

Think about the way you search for information. If you’re a new mom who believes vaccines cause autism (and a number of women in your mommy group do, too) are you searching for research that shows whether they actually do, or are you Googling “vaccines cause autism” to find stories to affirm your belief? (Studies show there is no link between vaccines and autism.)

The mother above is probably motivated by fear. Such “motivated reasoning,” says political scientist Charles Taber of Stony Brook University, shows that we are all fundamentally biased.

“You have a basic psychological tendency to perpetuate your own beliefs,” he said “to really … discount anything that runs against your own prior views.”

It gets even more complicated. Once we’ve convinced ourselves of something, research suggests facts don’t appeal to us. A study co-led by Nyhan found that trying to correct a person’s misperception can have a “backfire effect.” When you encounter facts that don’t support your idea, your belief in that idea actually grows stronger.

So what if we did a better job teaching people how science works? Doesn't help, Kahan said. Research shows people with the most science intelligence are also the most partisan.

It’s not knowledge but curiosity, Kahan says, that makes us more likely to accept scientific truths. A recent study that Kahan led found people with more scientific curiosity were more likely to be open-minded about information that challenged their existing political views.

And arguing helps, too. Scientists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber contend in their new book, The Enigma of Reason, that reason isn't something that evolved so humans could solve problems on their own. It developed so we could work together.

Instead of forcing someone to agree that climate change is caused by humans, Graves said, you can stop once you agree that, for example, flooding in Florida is a problem, and that you have to fix it (the bipartisan Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact can teach us about that).

Marcia McNutt, an American geophysicist and president of the National Academy of Sciences, said she isn’t worried about a crisis of science, though she hopes the march will drive home that “science is about the unbiased search for truth"" — and that benefits everyone.

“Being a scientist only means that when I have an intuition about something, I test that intuition, and see if I’m right,” she said. “A very, very smart mentor told me once, ‘I don't trust anyone who hasn't at least changed their mind once in their career.’”

Science, it appears, may have more lessons for us than we think."

Coal comeback unlikely, utility CEO says
By Bill Loveless, @bill_loveless, Special for USA TODAY
President Trump again promised to revive the U.S. coal industry when he announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

But that reversal seems as unlikely as ever as electric power producers, the biggest consumers of coal in the U.S., continue to shift to natural gas and renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. In 2016, natural gas became the leading fuel for U.S. electricity generation for the first time, responsible for 33.8% of the output, compared with 30.4% for coal, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Nick Akins, the CEO of American Electric Power, one of the largest utilities in the U.S., says the preference for gas, renewables and energy efficiency will only grow in response to increasing demands from shareholders and customers for cleaner energy, regardless of changes in national energy policy.

With 5.4 million customers in 11 states, AEP plans to spend $1.5 billion on renewable energy from 2017 through 2019 and $13 billion on transmission and distribution improvements, including new ""smart"" technologies that will make the grid more resilient and efficient.

USA TODAY spoke with Akins after Trump's announcement. The transcript is edited for length and clarity.

Q: What do you think of Trump's decision to pull the U.S. from the climate agreement?

A: I don't think it's unexpected. He obviously made the point that he's willing to renegotiate or have further dialogue about it. That's a good sign. From our perspective, we're going to continue along the path we're already on toward a cleaner energy economy.

Q: AEP and the U.S. electric power industry in general have been moving away from coal in favor of natural gas and renewable energy. Will this decision by the Trump administration have any impact on that trend?

A: If you look at our resource plans in all of the states we serve, they are focused on renewables, natural gas and transmission. And big-data analytics improves the efficiency of the grid, so energy efficiency is obviously a key component.

Our carbon dioxide emissions in 2016 were 44% below 2000 levels, and that progress will continue with the additions of more renewables, energy efficiency and natural gas.

Q: So you don't see coal making a comeback at AEP or other utilities?

A: No, I don't think so. … You wouldn't make a decision (to build a coal power plant) at this point because it's heavily capital-intensive and involves a longer-term process and risk to build. And, of course, you can add renewables that are very efficient and natural gas that's efficient and much less expensive and risky, in terms of construction and operation.

Q: Do you plan to close any more coal-powered plants soon?

A: I suspect we'll see some more retirements in the future, and as we progress toward that cleaner energy economy and consider the expectations of our customers and shareholders for us to mitigate risk, you'll continue to see that happen.

But on the other hand, I want to make sure there's an understanding that coal will remain a part of the portfolio, but it will be of a lesser degree because of these other resources that are available to us now that weren't available to us just a few years ago.

Q: Do you find yourself under more or less pressure from customers and shareholders to move to cleaner forms of energy?

A: I think there's more pressure. Investors are looking for the sustainability of the company going forward and mitigation of risks … From a customer standpoint, we have some large customers interested in moving into our service territory who are looking for cleaner energy, and want to know if we're focused on that. Some of them want to be supplied entirely by those clean sources.

So, we're clearly responding to our customers' and our shareholders' expectations.

Q: What's the solution for workers at coal mines and coal power plants who have lost their jobs?

A: Certainly, the skill sets of employees in mining and around machinery are transferable to other areas of manufacturing, like aerospace and defense. So, we're really focusing on economic-development efforts in our service territories … particularly in the coal states … to bring coal miners back to work, not necessarily in coal mines but certainly (in manufacturing)."

Lawsuit alleges GM rigged diesel pickups to pollute
Eric D. Lawrence, Detroit Free Press
DETA lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal district court in Detroit, accuses General Motors trying to circumvent pollution control devices in diesel-powered heavy-duty pickups, echoing similar claims against Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles

2015 Chevrolet Silverado LT 2500HD with Z71

DETROIT -- A lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal district court in Detroit, accuses General Motors trying to circumvent pollution control devices in diesel-powered heavy-duty pickups, echoing similar claims against Volkswagen and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

The lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, alleges the trucks emit nitrogen oxide at two to more than five times the legal limit and pollute more than the trucks' gasoline-fueled counterparts. Robert Bosch, the company that made GM's electronic diesel controls, is also named as a defendant.

GM called the claims ""baseless"" and said it will defend the lawsuit.

""The Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra comply with all U.S. EPA and CARB emissions regulations,"" the statement reads, referring to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.

Bosch, which has its North American headquarters in Farmington Hills, said it takes the allegations seriously.

""Bosch is cooperating with the continuing investigations in various jurisdictions and is defending its interests in the litigation,"" according to a statement read by spokeswoman Linda Beckmeyer. She said she couldn't comment directly on the suit.

The company has also been mentioned in a federal emissions lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler, but it is not a defendant in that case.

Diesel engines have been under scrutiny worldwide after Volkswagen admitted to rigging its tests. The German automaker agreed to pay more than $17 billion in civil settlements as well as a $2.8-billion criminal fine in the case.

Diesel cheating allegations have also hit Fiat Chrysler, which was sued by the Justice Department this week. FCA has denied intentionally cheating, but the federal government accused the company of using at least eight software-based features that acted as defeat devices for diesel emissions testing on 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees.

One well-known automotive analyst said the GM and FCA cases are different from the Volkswagen case. While Volkswagen admitted its involvement, both GM and FCA are vowing to fight the accusations, he said.

Jack Nerad, executive editorial director and analyst at Kelley Blue Book, also said that the issues were more significant for Volkswagen because diesel engines have been more critical for that automaker's sales.

""If GM sold no more diesel trucks, it would be a big deal to them, but it wouldn’t be the big deal that maybe it is to Volkswagen here in North America. And kind of ditto that for FCA,"" Nerad said. “If they never sold another diesel Ram truck and never sold another diesel Grand Cherokee, it wouldn’t help them but I'm certain that it wouldn’t send them careening out of control either.”

The 191-page suit accuses GM of using ""defeat devices,"" software design to turn down emissions controls when vehicles are not being tested. That in turn boosts the performance of the vehicles.

The lawsuit covers an estimated 705,000 or more Silverado and Sierra diesels on the road.

The suit is filed on behalf of truck owners, specifically naming one in California and one in Louisiana. GM vehicles powered by Duramax engines were affected by the ""unlawful, unfair, deceptive and otherwise defective emission control,"" the lawsuit says.

The affected vehicles were 2011 to 2016 GM Sierra 2500 HD and 3500 HD trucks and GM Silverado 2500 HD and 3500 HD trucks, the lawsuit says.

The suit says that GM did not disclose to owners that in ""real-world"" driving conditions, the vehicle could only achieve high fuel economy, power and durability without full emissions controls operating.

The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, alleges that the company was able to make its trucks more appealing by promoting a supposedly cleaner diesel engine.

""The defeat devices allowed GM to have its cake and eat it, too,"" the suit said.

The suit says diesel engines pose a challenge to the environment because there is a trade-off. Compared with gasoline engines, diesel engines are more fuel-efficient and produce greater torque, but without technology to make them cleaner, they also produce more harmful emissions.

The suit against Fiat Chrysler notes that the resulting pollution ""contributes to the formation of harmful smog and soot, exposure to which is linked to a number of respiratory- and cardiovascular-related health effects as well as premature death.""

The U.S. Department of Justice and the EPA were asked for comment on the GM suit. A Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment, and the EPA did not immediately respond."

Tests allege Fiat Chrysler diesels exceed smog limits
Eric D. Lawrence, Detroit Free Press
The automaker is accused of exceeding allowable pollution levels with two of its diesels

Fiat Chrysler is under scrutiny for diesel engines that could violate federal emission limists. Here's the Ram 1500 EcoDiesel.

DETROIT -- Researchers who helped uncover diesel emissions test cheating at Volkswagen are now accusing Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of exceeding allowable pollution levels with two of its diesel vehicles.

But the automaker, which has denied intentionally cheating on emissions tests, describes the results of the testing as misleading.

The Wall Street Journal said it reviewed a report on the findings of the researchers from the Center for Alternative Fuels, Engines and Emissions at West Virginia University who determined that the emissions from the automaker's diesel engines vastly exceed federal standards. The report found that Ram 1500 pickups ""produced nitrogen-oxide emissions up to 25 times above allowable levels in the U.S., and similarly equipped Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles up to eight times"" in road tests.

The Journal said the researchers ""stopped short of concluding"" whether Fiat Chrysler used defeat devices ""meant to dupe regulators."" The paper reported that the center tested ""five model-year 2014 and 2015 vehicles.""

Officials at the university did not respond to multiple requests for information from the Free Press. Research conducted by the university on Volkswagen's vehicles with diesel engines showed that the German automaker's vehicles exceeding EPA standards when tested on roadways. That research led to a federal investigation and, eventually, criminal and civil fines that exceed $20 billion.

The university's tests represent the latest accusations targeting Fiat Chrysler diesels.

The company was sued last month by the Justice Department, which accused the automaker, based in the Detroit suburb of Auburn Hills, using at least eight software-based features that acted as defeat devices for diesel emissions testing on 104,000 Ramp pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees.

Fiat Chrysler issued a statement saying it had been made aware of the university lab's testing but that the researchers had been unwilling to discuss the report and that the testing ""appears to have been commissioned by a plaintiffs’ law firm for purposes of litigation.""

The company takes issue with the way the university's research was conducted, saying speeds were higher and payloads greater than in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency testing and that road conditions were not representative of EPA testing.

""Each of the above may increase emissions readings, therefore rendering invalid a comparison of on-road and off-road test results. Further, the aggregation of these variations makes any comparison misleading,"" the company said, noting that the report indicates the vehicles were modified by the researchers.

Fiat Chrysler and General Motors, which faces a civil lawsuit accusing it of using defeat devices on Duramax Diesel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, have both denied the allegations against them, but VW has admitted that it cheated. The German automaker has agreed to pay more than $17 billion in civil settlements as well as a $2.8-billion criminal fine in its case."

Justice sues Fiat Chrysler over diesel emissions
By Eric D. Lawrence, and Brent Snavely, Detroit Free Press
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles for allegedly building and selling diesel engines that violated pollution standards.

The federal government said 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokee sport-utility vehicles contain software that violates U.S. emissions tests for diesels.

The matter erupted in January when the Environmental Protection Agency accused Fiat Chrysler of possible violations, after which CEO Sergio Marchionne accused the agency of ""smoking illegal material"" for making bogus allegations.

The lawsuit comes after months of negotiations and discussions between the Italian-American automaker, the EPA, the California Air Resources Board and other federal investigators.

The company last week proposed a software fix that it hoped would resolve a discrepancy on the emissions performance of the diesel vehicles in a move aimed at averting a legal battle.

But on Tuesday, the federal government said vehicle emissions are ""much higher than the EPA-compliant level"" in real-world use.

Fiat Chrysler said it was ""disappointed"" in the lawsuit and vowed to fight back.

""The company intends to defend itself vigorously, particularly against any claims that the company engaged in any deliberate scheme to install defeat devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests,"" the company said in a statement.

The showdown comes on the heels of a resolution over German automaker Volkswagen Group's scandal, in which the company acknowledged intentionally using software to evade emissions tests on diesel vehicles.

Fiat Chrysler has vigorously rejected any comparisons between its situation and Volkswagen, which admitted to evading standards on 11 million vehicles globally.

The scandal has cost Volkswagen more than $22 billion, including a U.S. criminal settlement and vehicle buybacks for consumers."

Volkswagen must pay $2.8B criminal fine for emissions cheating
Brent Snavely, Detroit Free Press
The company agreed to the plea deal as part of a Justice Department settlement.

Volkswagen got in trouble over emissions.

RFC DETROIT — Volkswagen must pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for purposely building a diesel engine equipped with software to cheat on greenhouse gas emissions tests.

U.S. District Judge Sean Cox accepted a $4.3 billion plea agreement reached in January between the automaker and the federal government that includes the fine. He sentenced the company to three years of probation and accepted the appointment of a federal monitor to oversee the automaker's compliance with federal regulations.

Cox said the $2.8 billion criminal penalty is large enough, even though Volkwagen's offenses, spanning a decade, were intentional as the automaker sold more than 590,000 vehicles with diesel engines that spewed emissions far above acceptable federal levels.

""This is a case of deliberate, massive fraud perpetrated by VW management,"" Cox said. ""This case also involves a failure of the VW supervisory board, which is government, labor and shareholders.""

The $4.3 billion settlement was reached in January between Volkswagen and the U.S. Justice Department. By imposing the fine and accepting Volkswagen's agreement to be overseen by a federal monitor, the judge accepted the deal between the government and the company.

Lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice argued a month ago that the $4.3 billion settlement was adequate even though it was only a fraction of the penalty U.S. law allowed. That penalty had a range of $17 billion to $34 billion.

U.S. Attorney John Neal argued in March that the lower figure was appropriate because Volkswagen went to great lengths to cooperate with the government and move the investigation along swiftly after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency charged the automaker with wrongdoing in September 2015.

Volkswagen agreed to civil settlements worth about $17 billion for U.S. consumers and dealers who own the automaker's diesel vehicles.

The automaker spent months trying to conceal the device even after the California Air Resources Board began asking questions. In a span of several weeks, about 40 employees at Volkswagen and Audi destroyed thousands of emails and documents before the company admitted wrongdoing to regulators, according to the book Faster, Higher, Farther by Jack Ewing.

Cox initially said the government's agreement might not be enough. Friday,  he noted that consumers and low-level employees were hurt the most by Volkswagen's actions.

""This corporate greed, this failure of management … has cost VW billions and billions of dollars,"" Cox said. ""The individuals who will be hurt the most are the working men and women at VW,"" who probably will not get bonuses or raises because of the financial burden caused by actions of higher-ranking company officials.

Even so, Cox overruled several objections to the plea agreement from lawyers representing consumers who wanted to pursue criminal restitution from the courts and agreed with federal prosecutors who argued that a better remedy was available through civil settlements the automaker agreed to.

Neal argued that 95% of those who owned Volkswagens with affected diesel engines are participating in the civil settlements that allow owners to sell their vehicle back to the company or terminate their lease without an early termination penalty.

""That process provides for more financial recompense for individuals than they would be able to receive through a criminal restitution process,"" Neal said.

Former U.S. deputy attorney general Larry Thompson was selected as the independent compliance monitor to make sure the automaker complies with federal regulators and the terms of criminal and civil settlements.

""We look forward to working closely with Mr. Thompson as we press forward with the biggest change process in Volkswagen’s history,” said Hiltrud Werner, a Volkswagen board member who oversees legal affairs at Volkswagen."

London's toxic air pollution is killing thousands every year
Adam Wernick, PRI.org
A man wears a dust mask in London, Britain, on Jan. 26, 2017.

Decades ago, London suffocated under poisonous smogs. Now, deadly air is back.

Diesel-burning vehicles are causing record levels of pollution linked to thousands of deaths in the United Kingdom, and the British government could face fines from the European Court of Justice if the smog is not controlled.

Conditions in London have become so bad that London Mayor Sadiq Khan now suggests children should be given gas masks to protect their lungs.

Unlike the deadly “pea souper” of 1952, which was caused by the burning of sulfur-laden coal and led to as many as 12,000 deaths, the toxic air pollution from diesel engines is invisible, which “makes it much harder to realize there’s a problem,” says James Thornton, CEO and founder of ClientEarth, a public interest environmental law organization.

“In the old days of the pea soup fog, you actually couldn't see across the street,” Thornton says. “Now, it all looks nice, but it is poisonous … It is killing thousands of people. They're just not falling down in the street like they were during the Great Smog.”

The government's own numbers, which Thornton says are probably conservative, conclude that around 40,000 people a year are dying early as a result of the air pollution in the U.K. — 9,000 of them in London alone.

Diesel engines emit large amounts of nitrogen dioxide, or NO2, a highly toxic gas. NO2 causes heart attacks and strokes and can prevent the development of children’s lungs.

And, diesel engines emit far more NO2 than gasoline engines. The scandal surrounding Volkswagen, for example, has to do with the company hiding the unsafe — and illegal — levels of NO2 produced by their cars’ diesel engines.

The British government has been shockingly arrogant in its refusal to follow European Union regulations on this matter, according to Thornton. In 2009, when his organization sued the government, they first wrote “a very polite letter, as one does in Britain,” asking the government how it intended to come into compliance with the law. “They wrote back and said, ‘We intend to do absolutely nothing,’” Thornton says.

""'We know we have to come into compliance by 2010, but we won't come into compliance until at least 2025, and maybe later,'"" Thornton says the government wrote. ""That was a surprising letter to receive, so we then had to go to court, and ... take it all the way up to the Supreme Court.""

In front of the Supreme Court, the U.K. government admitted to violating the law and that ClientEarth’s numbers — estimating deaths from pollution — were indeed the government’s own but said they had ""no intention of complying with the law until at least 2025, and you, the Supreme Court, may not order us to do so,’” Thornton says.

“The Supreme Court turned to us and said, ‘The government has said they have no intention of complying with the law. What would you like us to do? We’re only the Supreme Court,’” Thornton adds. ClientEarth responded by pointing to a famous U.S. case from 1802 called Marbury v. Madison, in which the Supreme Court asserted its authority to order the government to comply with the law.

“So, we said, ‘Forget this is an environmental case. This could be a securities case or a public procurement case or a family law case, any type of case,’” Thornton explains. “If the government can walk into the Supreme Court and say, ‘We're only going to comply with the law when we feel like it,’ then it's not a government under the rule of law. It's a government by Fiat and Diktat.’”

The Supreme Court said, ""'Well, now that you put it that way, here is an injunction.' It was the first environmental injunction they ever gave against the government.""

Asked why the government is dragging its feet on such a clear-cut public health issue, Thornton says it’s a reluctance to deal with cars. He quotes former California politician Tom Hayden, whose mentor told him, “Tom, you'll have a great career, as long as you don't mess with people's guns or their cars.”

Brexit is another issue that keeps environmentalists in the U.K. up at night, Thornton says, because once the U.K. leaves the European Union, it will no longer be bound by its laws.

“There’s a big movement now to say, ‘After Brexit, we need a new Clean Air Act that's stronger, rather than weaker,’” Thornton says. “But after we won our first case in the Supreme Court, the U.K. government actually went to Brussels to try and increase the pollution limits, so it could say it was meeting them without doing anything. The level of governmental inaction and bad faith is depressing when the result is that citizens are suffering.”"

Hawaii passes law binding it toÊParisÊclimateÊagreement
By John Bacon, @jmbacon, USA TODAY
Hawaii Gov. David Ige has signed the nation's first state legislation boosting the drive toward the commitments of the Paris climate agreement despite theÊTrumpÊadministration decision to withdraw the U.S. from the global accord.
The Hawaii measures are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, monitor the rise in sea level and encourage agricultural practices that improve soil health -- crucial actions for the environmentally fragile island state, Ige said. He applauded the legislature for its efforts to ""deliver the island Earth that we want to leave our children"" and said his state is committed to ""environmental stewardship.""
""Climate change is real, regardless of what others may say,"" Ige said at Tuesday's bill signing in Honolulu. ""Hawaii is seeing the impact first hand. Tides are getting higher, biodiversity is shrinking, coral is bleaching, coastlines are eroding, weather is becoming more extreme. We must acknowledge these realities.""
Andrew Light, a professor of public policy and atmospheric sciences atÊGeorge Mason University, was one of theÊObamaÊadministration's climate negotiators in Paris. He said he was encouraged by the efforts of Hawaii and other states to essentially go it alone, without federal support.
""I am excited about what Hawaii has done,"" Light said. ""Efforts by state, local and business leaders to mitigate the impact of theÊTrumpÊadministration decision are absolutely critical right now.""
Other states also have taken steps to align with the agreement. California's ambitious plan calls for reducing carbon emissions by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030. Both states are among more than a dozen in the newly formed U.S. Climate Alliance that share a commitment to upholding the Paris Accord and taking aggressive action on climate change.
The alliance was formed last week by three Democratic governors, New York Gov.ÊAndrew Cuomo, California Gov. Edmund Brown and Washington Gov.ÊJay Inslee. And they say climate change can be addressed without taking an economic hit.
""New York and states across the country are picking up the mantle of climate leadership and showing the world it's possible to address climate change while also creating good-paying careers,""ÊCuomoÊsaid.
Cities also are getting involved. Chicago MayorÊRahm EmanuelÊannounced in April that all of the city's public buildings will be powered by renewable energy by 2025.
At the bill signing in Honolulu, Mayor Kirk Caldwell and representatives for Hawaii Island Mayor Harry Kim, Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa and Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho signed a statement declaring their commitment to continue supporting the Paris agreement.
The earliest a nation can formally withdraw from the agreement is November 2020. But the greenhouse gas reduction targets are largely voluntary, and PresidentÊTrumpÊsaid last week his administration would ""cease all implementation of the non-binding"" deal, which more than 190 nations have signed.
TrumpÊsaid it's possible the U.S. will be back on board in the future.

Programs bring electric cars to low-income people
Sophia Tulp, USA TODAY
The Los Angeles program follows an initiative in Chicago

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti tries out a car at the launch of what is being billed as the nation's largest electric vehicle' car sharing program for disadvantaged communities

LOS ANGELES -- Electric cars have a Tesla-like image of being pricey, but new programs seek to put them in the hands of lower-income drivers as well in the name of cleaner air.

A new program here makes Los Angeles the latest city to expand car-sharing opportunities to less affluent areas in hopes of not only lowering carbon emissions in some of the most polluted urban areas, but also expanding transportation opportunities for residents. A similar car-sharing experiment is under way in Chicago.

Los Angeles' program, BlueLA, provides battery-powered vehicles as cheap as 15 cents a minute, or $9 an hour, to lower-income people who qualify.

“A zip code doesn’t define how you can help contribute to saving our planet,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti at a ceremony to mark the start of the program.

Non-members -- mainly tourists or first-time users -- pay up to 80 cents per minute, which comes to $48 an hour, said Tim Frisbee, spokesman for the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national organization that connects lower-income people with transportation, which acted an adviser for the program.

“The pricing is set up to be extremely reasonable. It’s kind of a sliding scale and income-based,” said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center. “The pricing is affordable, whereas owning a car is really expensive.”

Electric-car advocates say the program holds the promise of opening the benefits of the emission-free cars up to the masses. They also say prices on electric cars are coming down as more makers have offered them, which also makes them more accessible to the public.

""As a new technology, there was a lot of folks offering vehicles in the higher price points,"" said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transport Association. ""Now seven years on, we're seeing ... different models of plug-ins available at all different price points. Getting that message and those models out to the next round of consumers is where the market is going.""

BlueLA is starting modestly. There's a single station with five cars in the city's Pico-Union district near MacArthur Park. But proponents hope to build it to 100 cars and 40 stations across the city by the end of next year. The cars are being supplied by the Bollore Group, a French company that also operates a similar program in Indianapolis called BlueIndy. However, BlueIndy does not specify a program for low-income individuals.

Last fall, the Shared-Use Mobility Center also partnered with the San Francisco-based app “Getaround” to create a car-sharing pilot program in low-income communities around Chicago.

Nationally, participating in all kinds of car sharing has increased sharply. In 2004, more than 50,000 Americans belonged to car-sharing services. By this year, the number had swelled to about 1.4 million Americans, according to Susan Shaheen, the Director of Innovative Mobility Research at the University of California-Berkeley’sTransportation Sustainability Research Center.

“A lot of the [carsharing] market tends to be younger, upwardly mobile, well-educated individuals,” Shaheen said. “What we’re finding as technology continues to advance is the promise of bringing innovative mobility solutions to a larger suite of individuals and mainstreaming them.”

And electric-car buyers mirror those numbers, tending to be younger and wealthier, a 2015 study byTrueCar.com found.  A 2012 survey from the Electric Vehicle Information Exchange found that of the almost 1,000 electric-vehicle owners, most were ""very well educated, upper-middle class white men in their early 50s with ideal living situations for EV charging.""

In Los Angeles, locals say they are already excited about the prospects of the program.

Nakea Brown, who lives in south Los Angeles said she couldn’t wait to utilize the cars when they expand to her area.

“I’m definitely going to use [BlueLA],” Brown said. “I think a lot more people around here can be educated on [pollution] so this is an amazing project to educate the people on safe streets, the environment, and its benefit to low-income families.”

Brady Collins, a policy analyst at Los Angeles’ Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance has been advising the city to make sure that the program really does work for the low-income, immigrant community members he serves in practice, not just in theory.

“High earners are the types of people you normally associate with having access to these resources … but those in the community that are working-class families, largely low-income immigrants they pay a much-discounted rate, so we think that is going to be a huge incentive to use it,” Collins said. “It’s not going to directly compete with every public transportation trip or walking, but I think it will allow them to have this option for … perhaps grocery shopping …  getting to work, picking up their kids from school.”

In addition to helping those of modest incomes, Garcetti hopes the program, too, sends a message after President Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Garcetti is one of 287 mayors nationwide, leading their cities to uphold the Paris agreement, despite the national direction.

“I want to be very clear … with or without Washington we are forging ahead, we are moving ahead with our climate change policies,” Garcetti said, garnering resounding applause.

That’s where programs like BlueLA come into play, by extending climate-protecting technology to a greater sector of the population, not just the 1%.

“It’s critical that we democratize our climate change policies to make sure that every individual, regardless of who they are or where they come from, the hue of their skin, the language they speak, … have access to the latest and greatest technologies,” California Sen. Kevin DeLeon, said at the unveiling ceremony."

North Korea: Trump withdrawal from Paris agreement 'height of egoism'

The reclusive North Korean regime lashed out this week at the Trump administration for withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, calling it a “short-sighted and silly decision”.

“This is the height of egoism and moral vacuum seeking only their own well-being even at the cost of the entire planet,” the official Korean Central News Agency said in a statement attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman.

The ""America First Policy"" advocated by Trump led to the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the statement adds, before calling the move “a short-sighted and silly decision ignorant of the fact that the protection of the global environment is in their own interests.”

Read more:

The landmark Paris climate agreement signed by 195 countries pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The deal, reached in 2015, is regarded as one of the major global achievements of former president Barack Obama.

Despite global appeals and intense lobbying, President Trump announced last week that the U.S. will leave the accord, fulfilling a campaign promise and sparking strong criticism at home and abroad.

“Global warming is one of the gravest challenges the humankind is facing today” the North Korean statement chiding Trump's withdrawal said.

The isolated regime, under immense global pressure led by the United States to scale back its nuclear ambitions, also used the occasion to criticize U.S. policy vis-a-vis its nuclear program.

The strongly worded statement warned the “selfish act” of the U.S. does not only have grave consequences for the international efforts to protect the environment, but poses great danger to other areas as well. “The U.S. attitude towards the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula is the typical example,” it said.

The harsh rhetoric by North Korea wraps up with a call for the world to remain highly vigilant about “the dangerous ideological trend” surfacing in the U.S. with the Trump administration.

“Whoever chooses to blindly follow the Trump administration overpowered by its bravado should be fully aware that the judgment of history shall take them all as one,"" the statement said."

To fight climate change, start with celebs, pols
By Glenn Harlan Reynolds
If climate change is really such a crisis, and if sacrifice on our part is needed to stop it, why aren't we seeing more sacrifice from people who think it's a problem?

As one person asked on Twitter, ""What if climate scientists decided, as a group, to make their conferences all virtual? No more air travel. What a statement!"" And what if academics in general -- most of whom think climate change is a big deal -- started doing the same thing to make an even bigger statement?

What if politicians and celebrities stopped jetting around the world -- often on wasteful private jets instead of flying commercial with the hoi polloi -- as a statement of the importance of fighting climate change?

And what if they lived in average-sized houses, to reduce their carbon footprints? What if John Kerry, who was much put out by President Trump's withdrawal from the non-binding Paris agreement, gave up his yacht-and-mansions lifestyle?

What if, indeed? One reason so many people don't take climate change seriously is that the people who constantly tell us it's a crisis never actually act like it's a crisis. Some might say that's why we need laws. I have some proposals that take climate change seriously indeed.

First, we need to tax the ""blue zones."" That is, we need to impose steep taxes on property in coastal areas that will be flooded by the sea-level increases that global warming is supposed to bring. By discouraging people from living or building there now, we'll save ourselves from big problems in the future. Sure it'll drive down property values, but those values should go down -- that property is going to be flooded anyway, remember?

Second, we need to ban taxpayer-funded air travel to conferences. State legislatures could ban reimbursement for travel outside their states; Congress could require that no federal grant money be spent on air travel to conferences and similar events. A lot of academic conferences would fail, but that's a small price to pay for saving the planet.

Third, we need to ban private jet travel. It's nice that Leonardo DiCaprio can jet around the world speaking against climate change, but the carbon emissions involved set a bad example that outweighs anything he might say. So no more private jets. Bigshots will just have to fly commercial like everyone else, the way they did in the 1950s. Politicians, too, should have to fly commercial. No more government-funded ""executive jets"" for them.

Fourth, we need a luxury tax on mansions. Any home more than twice the size of the average American home should be taxed at 25% of its value per year.

I'm sure enterprising members of Congress and state legislatures can come up with more ideas. But the important thing is to set a good example: Treat climate change like the crisis you say it is, and maybe more people will believe it really is a crisis.

More states sign on to U.S. Climate Alliance to honor Paris agreement
Doyle Rice, USA TODAY
Frustrated by President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, several governors have joined together to create the United States Climate Alliance.

California Gov. Jerry Brown speaks at an environmental conference in San Francisco in late May 2017.

In this Friday Sept. 22, 2006, file photo, an oil refinery is seen at sunset in Rodeo, Calif. California was one of the three states to form the U.S. Climate Alliance.

Frustrated by President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, several governors have joined together to create the United States Climate Alliance.

The alliance is the brainchild of Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and California Gov. Jerry Brown, the first three states to join last week. All three are Democrats.

Nine more states — Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia — joined the coalition this week. Puerto Rico has also enrolled. The only states with a Republican governor to join so far are Massachusetts and Vermont.

The member states represent about one-third of the U.S. population, roughly 102 million people, and also about one-third of the U.S.'s overall Gross Domestic Product at $6.83 trillion combined, according to Jaime Smith, communications director for Inslee.

The goal of the alliance is to bring states together to reduce emissions 26%-28% from 2005 levels, in order to meet or exceed the targets of the federal Clean Power Plan, which Trump has promised to undo. The plan, instituted by President Obama in 2015, targeted coal-fired power plants, requiring existing power plants to cut harmful emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

Related coverage:

These gases have caused the Earth's temperature to rise over the past century to levels that cannot be explained by natural processes alone.

The group will also act as a forum to sustain and strengthen existing climate programs, promote the sharing of information and best practices and implement new programs to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors of the economy.

“If our national government isn’t willing to lead in this area, the states are prepared to step up and lead,"" said Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican.

Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said ""if the federal government insists on abdicating leadership on this issue, it will be up to the American people to step forward — and in Virginia we are doing just that.""

Brown said “the president has already said climate change is a hoax, which is the exact opposite of virtually all scientific and worldwide opinion. I don't believe fighting reality is a good strategy — not for America, not for anybody.""

""If the president is going to be AWOL in this profoundly important human endeavor, then California and other states will step up,"" Brown added.

Governors from other states, such as Colorado, Maryland, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania, along with the District of Columbia, have expressed interested in joining the alliance, but have yet to do so.

""Our intent is certainly to be more than just a list of signatories to a pledge, and we are focusing now on how to best use the alliance to ensure the U.S. remains a visible and viable player on the global stage when it comes to climate action,"" Smith said."

John Oliver slams 'egomaniac' Trump for withdrawing from Paris Agreement
Erin Jensen, USAToday
President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement doesn't sit well with the host.

'Last Week Tonight' host John Oliver

President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement doesn't sit well with France, Bernie Sanders or John Oliver.

Like USA TODAY, the Last Week Tonight host fact-checked the president's speech from the White House Rose Garden in a NSFW segment Sunday night, beginning with Trump's claim his assessment that the celebration surrounding the U.S. signing the document was spurred by ""the simple reason that it put our country... at a very, very big economic disadvantage.""

""What are you talking about?"" Oliver asked, bewildered. ""They were happy because they secured a landmark victory for the future of the planet, you (bleeping) egomaniac.""

Oliver continued, combing over Trump's speech for inaccuracies, bashing the president's reasoning that the   . When POTUS stated the agreement would allow other countries to expand coal production while ""we're supposed to get rid of ours.""

Oliver told viewers, ""For the record, the agreement doesn't actually ban America from building coal plants,"" Oliver told viewers.

""It doesn't even contain the word 'coal,'"" he told his audience. ""Each country sets its own goals that it can meet however it wants, so that is wrong.""

Then, Oliver proceeded to rip apart another one of Trump's statements about the Green Climate Fund phrase by phrase. As a reminder, Trump said, ""The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars, of which the United States has already handed over $1 billion. Nobody else is even close.""

""Now, to his credit,"" Oliver began,"" that is actually an impressive amount of misleading (expletive) in very few words."" The host of HBO's satirical news show roasted Trump for calling it ""The Green Fund"" and inflating the amount of money the U.S. committed which Oliver says is $3 billion.

""You can't just inflate three to potentially tens,"" Oliver reprimanded POTUS. ""I can't say that you have had potentially tens of failed marriages. I can only say you've had three because you have. You have had three failed marriages and yes, I'm very much including your current one.""

Global warming unabated: Carbon dioxide tallied 2nd-largest rise on record last year
Doyle Rice, USA TODAY
Carbon dioxide is the ""greenhouse"" gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming. Last year's increase in CO2 was nearly double the average pace since measurements began in 1979

The levels of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere have risen over the past several decades.

A coal-fired power plant churns out electricity in this Friday, Feb. 2, 2007, file photo in Holcomb, Kan. Carbon dioxide emissions will remain in Earth's atmosphere for hundreds of years.

As President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the landmark Paris climate agreement last week, federal scientists reported 2016 tallied the second-largest rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide ever recorded.

Carbon dioxide is the ""greenhouse"" gas scientists say is most responsible for global warming. Last year's increase in CO2 was nearly double the average pace since measurements began in 1979, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.

The gas is measured in parts per million (ppm) of Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels were around 280 ppm prior to the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, when large amounts of greenhouse gases started to be emitted into the atmosphere due to human activity.

The burning of the oil, gas and coal for energy releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. These gases have caused the Earth's temperature to rise over the past century to levels that cannot be explained by natural processes alone.

Today, CO2 levels measure over 400 ppm. While that may not sound like a huge increase, scientists have known for decades that even trace amounts in the atmosphere can raise temperatures around the world. Atmospheric CO2 hasn't been at this level in thousands, or perhaps millions of years.

The goal of the Paris climate agreement, which President Trump withdrew the U.S. from last week, is for nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to prevent rising global temperatures.

According to NOAA, the annual rate of growth of CO2 in a given year is the difference in concentration between the end of December and the start of January. It represents the sum of all CO2 added to and removed from the atmosphere over the course of the year by human activities and natural processes.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the CO2 level increased at about 1.5 ppm each year. Last year, it rose 2.93 ppm. The highest growth rate was recorded in 2015 at 2.96 ppm, said NOAA spokesman Theo Stein.

Higher global temperatures are predicted to cause rising sea levels, more frequent heat waves and wildfires, and huge losses of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic.

""The warming effect of these chemicals we're tracking has increased by 40% since 1990,"" Steve Montzka, a NOAA scientist who co-authored the update, told Inside Climate News. ""Even though emissions are leveling off, CO2 is so long-lived that the concentration is still increasing."""

Global dismay mounts over Paris climate deal withdrawal

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that Trump's decision was “extremely regrettable.""

Christian Engeli, campaign manager for Greenpeace Switzerland, speaks while activists of Greenpeace protest with a sign reading 'fuel puppet', during a protest against the decision of the US government to exit the Paris climate deal, in front of U.S. Embassy in Bern, Switzerland, June 2 2017.

LONDON — Dismay continued to mount around the globe Friday, a day after President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the decision was “extremely regrettable - and I'm using very restrained terms here.""

""Nothing can and will stop us. We need this Paris accord to protect what we have created,"" she said Friday, according to German news agency dpa. ""To all who believe that the future of our planet is important, I say: Let us continue along the path together so that we can be successful (in protecting) our Mother Earth.""

Trump said Thursday that he is willing to work for a better deal, but France, Italy and Germany said in a joint statement that the accord cannot be re-negotiated.

""The decision made by U.S. President Trump amounts to turning their backs on the wisdom of humanity. I'm very disappointed... I am angry,"" Japanese Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto told reporters Friday.

China and the European Union are expected to issue their first-ever joint statement Friday committing to fully implement the Paris agreement following a meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top European officials in Brussels.

Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU’s executive, said Friday that he was “deeply disappointed"" by the U.S. leader's decision. “Against what we stand for, contrary to what the world expects,” he added.

Dozens of protesters from the environmental group Greenpeace demonstrated outside the U.S. embassies in the Spanish capital Madrid and in Bern, Switzerland on Friday.

“The battle against climate change is irreversible. Resistance will be maintained because the United States is much more than just the White House and Trump,"" said Mario Rodriguez, Greenpeace’s director in Spain.

Juri Ratas, the prime minister of Estonia — which will take over the rotating EU presidency this year — told the Associated Press the “very bad, very negative” decision will force the bloc to take a stronger lead on climate issues.

He said the Paris agreement “was, and still is a very important goal to achieve.”

The African Union, an alliance of 55 countries, expressed dismay at Trump’s decision. Africa contributes little to global levels of pollution but is uniquely vulnerable to climate change, according to African Business magazine and others.

In a joint statement, the African Union and the EU said they “reaffirm their strong commitment to full implementation of the Paris agreement.”

They said climate change and renewable energy will be on the agenda at a summit between the two continents in the Ivory Coast in November.

“The European Union and the African Union reaffirm their commitment to continuing to address the adverse effects of climate change on human and animal health, natural ecosystems and other social and economic impacts that threaten our developmental gains as a global community,” the statement added.

The 197-member climate agreement requires every country to establish ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gasses. But those targets are largely voluntary, and Trump views environmental regulations as an obstacle to his goal of creating jobs and ensuring energy independence.

Climate agreement withdrawal: 'Trump just stepped on the gas' toward catastrophe
Doyle Rice, USA TODAY
President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement is a major step backward, groups say.

The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural variability.

President Trump's decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement drew the ire of top environmental and science groups Thursday, who called it a major step backward both for the climate and the country as a leader in environmental issues.

The U.S. might as well put up a ""closed for business"" sign up across America, said Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Both for symbolic and practical purposes, it would signal an American leadership retreat.""

Jake Schmidt of the Natural Resource Defense Council said that ""stepping back from such a historic agreement means we're not prepared to be leaders on the global stage.""

The 197-member Paris climate agreement requires every country to establish ambitious targets to reduce the greenhouse gasses that cause global warming. Only two countries didn't sign: Nicaragua and Syria. The U.S. is the second-leading emitter of greenhouse gas emissions behind China.

In announcing his decision to withdraw, Trump said the Paris Accord is a bad deal for the United States due to the “draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.""

However, Keohane said companies looking to invest in clean energy such as solar and wind will just go to Europe or China instead, taking away jobs from the U.S. ""The losers will be American families and workers and businesses of being at the cutting edge of clean economy,"" he said.

Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists said Trump's ""climate inaction plan is a threat to every American’s health and future prosperity,"" Meeting the Paris agreement’s temperature limitation goals would have been in the ""environmental, economic and national security interests of the United States,"" he said.

The decision makes zero sense from a public health or an economic perspective, said former EPA head Gina McCarthy. ""It's a disappointing and embarrassing day for the United States,"" she added.

The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas releases greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide and methane — into the atmosphere, causing it to warm to levels that scientists say cannot be explained by only natural patterns.

A whopping 97% of climate scientists say evidence for man-made climate change is real and already visible.

""Americans are already feeling the impacts of climate change, including drought, heat waves, wildfires, and worsening flood risks from sea level rise and heavy rainfall,"" said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

In this decade alone, record-warm temperatures have occurred five times as frequently as record cold in U.S. cities, according to an analysis of data from the Weather Underground's Chris Burt. Globally, the Earth sweltered through its two years on record in 2015 and 2016.

“With our world speeding toward a climate catastrophe, Trump just stepped on the gas,” said Kieran Suckling of the Center for Biological Diversity.

""The Paris climate treaty is climatically insignificant,"" said Patrick Michaels, a climatologist at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. He said the deal would only lower global warming by an inconsequential less than four-tenths of degree by 2100, a finding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported.

In addition, private investments in technological innovation mean America already leads the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, Michaels said. ""We did that without Paris and we will continue our exemplary leadership without it,"" he said.

He said that it would only lower global warming by an inconsequential two-tenths of a degree Celsius by 2100, which was noted in a report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Fred Palmer of the free-market think tank Heartland Institute, which has received funding from oil and gas companies, said Trump will set the U.S. down a path ""where our fossil fuel resources are unleashed to power our future and drive our prosperity.""

The ""anti-fossil-fuel Paris Accord .... is a disastrous plan for working men and women and the country itself – and he pledged to discard it in the presidential campaign,"" Palmer said.

Despite federal inaction, experts say cities, states, businesses, and other countries will continue to move ahead on a clean energy path to reduce carbon pollution and fight climate change.

""In China, India and across Europe, Trump's decision to shoot himself in the foot doesn't matter,"" Schmidt of the NRDC said.

The number U.S. states actively fighting climate change already represent the 5th-largest economy in the world, David Waskow of the World Resources Institute said. Douglas Phelps, the head of Environment America, said that ""governors and mayors must step in to fill the leadership void to show the world that Americans will do our part to address the climate crisis.”

That's already happening in California, where the economy is booming partly because of clean energy, Keohane said. ""There's more clean tech investment (there) in the past few years than the other 49 states combined,"" he said.

In the long run, though, federal action is still needed, he added: ""If we're going to tackle this challenge for our kids and grandkids, we'll have to do something at the federal level sooner or later."""

Where CEOs stand on Trump and climate change pact
Roger Yu, USA TODAY
Withdrawal response underscores the urgency of climate change in the C-suite

President Trump shakes hands with Pruitt during a Rose Garden event where he announced that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris climate accord on June 1, 2017.

President Trump is quickly losing support of his closest private sector advisers on the issue of climate change as more CEOs voice their disagreement with his decision to pull the United States from the landmark Paris accord.

In USA TODAY’s queries to 18 business leaders who are members of the president’s business advisory council, only seven confirmed that they’re staying on as members of the group. a sign of how quickly the issue has become a political lightning rod. (List of seven names is at the bottom)

Two CEOs, Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger and Tesla CEO Elon Musk quit the council, citing their concerns that Trump’s withdrawal weakens global efforts to combat climate change and U.S. leadership on the issue. “As a matter of principle, I've resigned from the President's Council over the #ParisAgreement withdrawal,” Iger tweeted.

Eight members declined to or didn’t immediately return requests for comment.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanik left the council in February after Trump's temporary travel ban on people from certain countries in the Middle East stirred controversy.

In announcing his decision Thursday, Trump said the Paris agreement, signed by President Obama in 2015, is unfair and other countries have attached too many conditions to reduce the carbon emissions causing climate change. “So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we’ll see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” he said.

Business leaders’ swift affirmation of their support for the Paris accord underscores the urgency of climate change in the corner offices of corporate America. (Only one council member  – former General Electric CEO Jack Welch – has previously stated his skepticism about the validity of climate change.) But it also reflects the isolationist tendencies of Trump’s closest advisers who are firmly intent on nixing any foreign deals they consider to be against their America-first policy orientation.

Executives who support the Paris agreement, but are choosing to stay on as council members echoed a similar message – that influencing the president is easier and more effectively done within Trump’s inner circle.

“I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment,"" JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

Three other leaders -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser -- joined Dimon in staying on as council members but opposing Trump’s decision. “We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” McMillon said.

Other CEOs were more cautious. Pepsi CEO Indra Nooyi said she supports the Paris agreement, but declined to comment on whether she plans to remain as council member.

General Motors CEO Marry Barra plans to remain on the council, but declined to state her position on the Paris accord. The company said it supports efforts to curb the effects of climate change.

Contentious political issues often elicit silence among corporate titans, but it’s becoming “politically wise” to support climate change, says Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware. “And sometimes people do what’s politically expedient. But when that becomes a litmus test, I get concerned.”

Elson disagreed with the CEOs who resigned, saying the business council's aim is to advise the president on the total economic health of country. “You’re supposed to check your politics at the door,” he said. “If you didn’t feel comfortable with (Trump’s politics), you shouldn’t have gone there in the first place….In leaving, your alternative voice disappears.”

Those who've stated their intent to stay on as council members include: Dimon, Rometty, McMillion, Barra, Lesser, Welch and Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove."

After Paris climate change pullout, give up on Trump and Congress for now
Henry Waxman, Opinion contributor
We need to put pressure on corporations. That's where the most change can be made.

Smoke rises from a thermal power station.

The withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate accord is one of President Trump’s most irresponsible moves yet.

But let’s not kid ourselves, it was not reasonable to expect Trump to keep us in the Paris accords — or to meet our obligations even if we stayed in. Given his short and stunningly terrible record on climate and the environment, we can reasonably conclude that this likely never will be a climate-friendly administration.

I believe it is time to accept that. At least until 2018, we will not make any real progress in reducing America’s greenhouse gas emissions through federal policy. At best, we will be able to defend existing climate, renewable energy and other environmental programs and budgets. Even that goal, while essential to holding U.S. emissions steady, will be hard enough for dedicated advocates to achieve.

It is not easy for me to say that there is no hope for Congress on climate change in the near future. After over 40 years in Washington fighting these fights every day, it pains me to see this venerable institution so thoroughly co-opted and hamstrung. But the reality is that climate change — rising temperatures, dying coral reefs, accelerating droughts and increasing human conflict — will not wait for our political institutions to right themselves. To confront the greatest common threat we have ever faced, we must go where the most change can be made.

I believe that the private sector provides the best such opportunity. After all, most U.S. emissions come from the private sector — and if policy can’t be expected to limit those emissions, something else has to.

This is not unfamiliar territory. Many companies have made real commitments and progress toward reducing emissions from their operations, cleaning up their supply change and procuring more renewable energy. The IT sector is an excellent example. In the absence of strong federal action to address climate change or expand renewable energy, Google, Facebook and Apple have all committed to source their power from 100% clean energy. These companies have either already achieved or are close to achieving those goals. Google’s carbon savings approximate the emissions of the entire city of San Francisco, and Apple has gone a step further and is encouraging its manufacturing suppliers in China and elsewhere to themselves use 100% clean energy.

The climate-friendly actions taken by the tech sector didn’t happen in a vacuum; they were the result of strong, concerted pressure by groups like Greenpeace. We have seen the same kind of pressure work in the agriculture sector, where major producers in the palm oil and soybean industries have pledged to clean up their operations after intensive consumer campaigns dented their reputations.

However, there remains a huge portion of the private sector that has done little to nothing to address its own contributions to climate change. If we are to have the greatest impact on climate in the near term, we should concentrate on those industries that are responsible for the lion’s share of emissions and are not doing their part to reduce them.

Heavy industries such as steel, chemicals, manufacturing and paper are vulnerable to reputational risk, especially because their major customers are consumer-facing: the steel they sell goes into cars sold by GM, Tesla and Ford; the aluminum into Coca-Cola and Pepsi cans; the paper into Staples and Office Depot. These industries are responsible for more than a third of global greenhouse gas emissions and are disproportionately reliant on polluting fossil fuels for their energy.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

The same can be said for the U.S. auto industry. According to the EPA, 27% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions came from transportation in 2015. And while automakers agreed to tougher tailpipe emissions standards during the Obama administration, they have done an about-face since Trump took office and are now calling for those standards to be reviewed and relaxed. This kind of opportunism and hypocrisy cannot stand.

It is up to climate advocates to focus the same kind of pressure on backpedaling automakers that is normally reserved for climate-denying members of Congress.    We should not abandon crucial efforts to protect existing programs and take back the Congress in 2018, but the private sector has been able to wait out the policy process, hoping that stronger standards will not materialize. We cannot allow that waiting game to continue — we must take citizens’ demands for climate action directly to the companies that pollute. We know this kind of action can work. We just need to do it on a far greater scale, starting now.

Paris climate agreement: World leaders slam Trump decision
Jessica Durando and Oren Dorell, USA TODAY
World leaders pledged Thursday to keep up the fight against global warming.

Members of the German environment organization BUND demonstrate in Berlin, on June 1, 2017. Posters read: 'Save Climate.'

World leaders on Thursday condemned President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she regrets the U.S. withdrawal. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the decision ""irresponsible.""

Prime Minister of Denmark Lars Rasmussen said it was a ""sad day for the world.""

The European Union's top climate change official echoed Rasmussen's sentiments, calling it ""a sad day for the global community.""

""The EU deeply regrets the unilateral decision by the Trump administration to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement,"" European Union Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said in a statement.

Meanwhile, former Mexico president Vincente Fox unleashed a tweetstorm following the announcement, saying Trump has ""surrendered the hopes and future of a nation.""

The Prime Minister of Belgium Charles Michel also weighed in: ""I condemn this brutal act against #ParisAccord@realDonaldTrump Leadership means fighting climate change together. Not forsaking commitment.""

The 197-member climate agreement requires every country to establish ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gasses. But those targets are largely voluntary, and Trump has already made clear that he views environmental regulations as an obstacle to his goal of creating jobs and ensuring energy independence.



Earlier Thursday, Russia said it supported the Paris deal. ""President (Vladimir) Putin signed this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said during a call with reporters, the Independent reported.

""At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants,"" he said.

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised to work with the EU to uphold the Paris climate accord, saying there is a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility” to fight climate change, the Associated Press reported.

""China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment,” he said in Berlin, referring to the Paris climate deal. China has been actively promoting the Paris agreement and was one of the first countries to ratify it, he said."

Apple, Facebook, Google CEOs urge support for Paris climate agreement

Apple, Facebook and Google are urging President Trump to stay in climate change accord.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, and PayPal founder Peter Thiel, center, listen as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York, Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016. Cook is among tech CEOs urging Trump to keep the U.S. in the Paris climate accord.

Tech companies including Apple, Facebook, Google and Intel are reminding President Trump about their support for the Paris climate agreement in advance of his expected announcement Thursday on the U.S. and its continued participation.

Two dozen companies joined those tech giants in signing a letter urging Trump to keep the U.S. in the 197-member international accord, according to letter tweeted out late Wednesday night by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. ""Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement,"" he tweeted.

The letter, also signed by Gap, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Levi Strauss & Co., and Morgan Stanley, appeared as full page newspaper advertisements last month in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other newspapers.

“By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth. U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures,"" said the letter signed by the companies, which combined, they say, have a market cap of more than $3.2 trillion.

Some CEOs have also personally attempted to sway the president, who reportedly will announce the U.S. will pull out of the accord at 3 p.m. ET Thursday. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the White House Tuesday, Bloomberg reported.

Other initiatives include a letter signed by 282 investors, representing more than $17 trillion in assets, supporting the accord.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has threatened to leave Trump's Business Advisory Council if the U.S. withdraws from the agreement. Musk made his intentions clear on Twitter saying: ""Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain.""

Musk also joined GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Disney CEO Bob Iger and several other CEOs in a TV commercial, created by Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, released earlier this week urging U.S. commitment to the agreement. ""Stay in Paris and negotiate a better deal that creates jobs,"" the ad says."

SAN FRANCISCO — Businesses and corporate leaders were quick to react to President Trump's decision Thursday to pull the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk made good on his threat to leave President Trump's CEO-stacked economic council if he turns his back on the consortium of nations pledged to fight climate change. Trump has argued that taxes and other measures imposed by such a group would hamper U.S. economic growth.

Musk tweeted that ""climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.""

Musk, whose companies not only make rockets and fancy electric cars but also are pushing hard into solar electricity, had been very public about defending his decision to be a part of Trump's advisory group, arguing that having the president's ear was better than having no influence at all.

Other reactions that expressed disappointment with the president's decision include those from:

Facebook

In a post on the social networking site, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, ""Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk.

""For our part, we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100% renewable energy.

""Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late.""

General Motors

General Motors said it is sticking by a previous assertion that combating climate change is good for business. The company said its Chevrolet Bolt electric car, the only long-range mass-market electric vehicle in the U.S., is an example of its commitment to zero-emission solutions.

“GM will not waver from our commitment to the environment and our position on climate change has not changed,” General Motors said in a statement following the president’s announcement. “International agreements aside, we remain committed to creating a better environment.”

Google

Google CEO Sundar Pichai tweeted he was ""Disappointed with today’s decision. Google will keep working hard for a cleaner, more prosperous future for all.""

The computing giant, a carbon neutral company since 2007, is on track this year to reach its goal of 100% renewable energy for global operations.

Salesforce

Customer relationship management software CEO Marc Benioff tweeted that he was ""Deeply disappointed by President's decision to withdraw from ParisAgreement. We will double our efforts to fight climate change.""

Benioff included a photo of Salesforce's official response, which notes that his company is pushing to achieve carbon-neutral cloud storage status while running 100% on renewable energy.

IBM

The computing giant posted a message on its website ""reaffirming its support"" for the Paris agreement.

""IBM has been one of industry’s earliest — and unambiguous — leaders on the subject of climate change with a commitment that goes back decades. Ten years ago, we declared that climate change was one of the most critical global environmental challenges facing the planet,"" the statement reads.

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is on the presidential economic advisory council that Musk has just left.

Microsoft

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella tweeted that ""We believe climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action. We remain committed to doing our part.""

Nadella linked to his company's official statement on the decision to exit the Paris agreement. It noted that Microsoft had for weeks, and along with other big companies, lobbied President Trump on the matter, urging him to keep the U.S. in the agreement.

""We believe that continued U.S. participation benefits U.S. businesses and the economy in important and multiple ways,"" wrote Microsoft president Brad Smith. ""A global framework strengthens competitiveness for American businesses. It creates new markets for innovative clean technologies, from green power to smart grids to cloud-enabled solutions."""

U.S. reducing dependence on fossil fuels even without Paris climate agreement
Ledyard King, USATODAY
President Trump’s decision to opt out of Paris climate accord won't have major environmental impact.

The Brayton Point Power Station, New England's largest and one of its last coal-fired power plants, appears on a cloudy day, Wednesday in Somerset, Mass. The plant, which has been generating electricity since the 1960s along Mount Hope Bay, is shutting down permanently. It's been cited by federal regulators as one of the region's heaviest polluters.

WASHINGTON – President Trump’s decision to back out of the Paris climate accord is a blow to environmental activists, but the nation's steady, years-long reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming won’t suddenly stop.

Utility companies have announced plans to fully or partially close more than a half dozen coal-fired power plants since Trump took office fewer than five months ago, taking some of the nation’s largest greenhouse gas emitters off-line.

And Wall Street fund managers and large businesses are moving away from fossil fuels due to market conditions, further contributing to increased use of cleaner energy sources. Since 2010, more than 250 coal-fired power plants have closed in the U.S. On Wednesday, Exxon Mobil shareholders voted – against the board’s recommendation – to require the company publicly report on the risks to its business posed by climate change.

Trump’s decision to withdraw from what’s officially known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that more than 190 nations have signed on to will no doubt have some environmental reverberations. But public sentiment, market forces and corporate strategies have already pushed the United States to make significant headway battling climate change.

“The United States is making progress,” said John Coequyt, Global Climate Policy Director for the Sierra Club. “We’re moving forward. We believe the rest of the world will do the same.”

Trump has already taken unilateral steps to roll back regulations that were designed to implement the Paris agreement, including reversing President Obama's Clean Power Plan rule that sought to lower greenhouse emissions. Trump campaigned on a promise to withdraw the U.S. from the accord, saying it would lead to higher energy prices and hurt domestic businesses from being able to compete globally.

""As president, I have one obligation and that obligation is to the American people,"" Trump said during a speech in the Rose Garden announcing the decision. ""The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other counties of the world.""

The international agreement, which was signed in 2015 and went into effect seven months ago, is considered a major part the environmental legacy of the Obama administration.

Michael A. Needham, chief executive officer of the conservative Heritage Action for America, applauded the president's move.

""Withdrawal from the agreement marks a critical step in unraveling former President Obama’s destructive legacy,"" Needham said. ""Not only did Obama make this agreement without approval from Congress, but in doing so he handed more control of America’s energy to foreign officials.""

Experts say pulling out of the accord will slow but hardly stop the momentum that's been building to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Under current policy, the U.S. is still set to come “within striking distance” of meeting its 2020 goal under a prior U.N. climate change accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% below 2005 levels, according to a report by energy analysts the Rhodium Group. But the analysis said withdrawing from the accord makes it very unlikely the U.S. will meet the 26-28% target set out under the Paris deal.

“There is still time to correct course, whether at the subnational level over the next couple years or through new federal policy a little further down the road,” the Rhodium Group report said. “But with President Trump’s election, it will certainly be a tougher lift.”

The exit from the accord will allow states, such as California and New York, to play a leading role in meeting climate change targets. California, for example, has stood out with its toughest-in-the-nation vehicle emissions laws that often effectively establish auto industry standards nationwide.

California Gov. Jerry Brown said he hopes Trump's ""insane move"" to back out of the Paris accord will spur others to action.

""California will resist,"" he told reporters on a conference call after Trump's announcement. ""California (is) all in. We're on the field ready for battle and while our president may be AWOL in the battle against climate change, we're not."""

Does President Trump believe in climate change? White House, EPA won't say
Heidi M Przybyla, USA TODAY
EPA head Scott Pruitt refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is an invented problem.

WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 02: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt answers reporters' questions during a briefing at the White House June 2, 2017 in Washington, DC. Pruitt faced a barrage of questions related to President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.

WASHINGTON – Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt refused to say whether President Trump still believes that climate change is a hoax, one day after the president promised to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement.

Pruitt sidestepped reporters' questions about Trump’s views on climate change three times during a White House news conference on Friday.

“The discussions we had, through the last several weeks, have been focused on one singular issue: is Paris good or not for this country? That’s the discussions I’ve had with the President. So that’s been my focus.”

In a highly anticipated announcement from the Rose Garden on Thursday, Trump pledged to pull out of the international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases because it would cost the U.S. millions of jobs – sparking an outcry from European allies and even some high-profile American business leaders.

While Trump said he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement to be more ""fair"" to the U.S., he has been a longtime critic of climate change, including in a 2012 tweet when he called it a Chinese creation to make the U.S. less competitive.

According to a review by Vox.com, Trump has tweeted climate change skepticism at least 115 times, even accusing scientists of manipulating data.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer also said he did not know the answer to whether Trump believes in climate change. “I have not had an opportunity to have that discussion. Administrator Pruitt pointed out what the president is focused on is making sure we have clean water, clean air” and the best deal for U.S. businesses, Spicer added.

Spicer vowed to track down the answer “if possible.”

During his Thursday announcement on the climate pact, Trump cited statistics from a Massachusetts Institute of Technology report in concluding that the agreement would only reduce emissions by a “tiny, tiny amount.""

The report's author subsequently said that conclusion shows Trump misunderstood their findings. ""If we don't do anything, we might shoot over 5 degrees or more, and that would be catastrophic,"" said John Reilly, co-director of the MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

Pruitt insisted there was additional scientific research backing up Trump’s claim that the accord would have a minimal impact on reducing carbon emissions – without providing examples. “They didn’t have a corner on the market,” he said of the MIT study. “There were many at the time” and “we can provide those to you,” said Pruitt.

Later Pruitt was asked his own personal opinions about whether global warming is real, and he acknowledged that “global warming is occurring” and “human activity contributes to it.”

“The president made a very courageous decision yesterday for America,” said Pruitt. “We have nothing to be apologetic about as a country,” he said, stating that the U.S. has reduced its “carbon footprint” to 1990 levels through innovation and technology"

Mayors pledge to take the lead on fighting climate change
Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY
Mayors say it's now up to them to address climate change by lowering carbon emissions.

Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard signed an executive order in 2009 prohibiting discrimination in hiring of city employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity. An Indianapolis Star survey of community leaders found general support for expanding such protections, especially in the state law.

WASHINGTON — Mayors from across the country — including Republican Jim Brainard of Carmel, Ind. — pledged Friday to take the lead in reducing the nation’s carbon footprint after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement.

“There will still be leadership from the United States,” Brainard said in a call with reporters organized by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. “It’s going to come from the mayors of the country.”

While Trump has decided to go ""America only,"" that doesn't mean the rest of the country is behind him, said New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat.

""We're ready to accept the challenge,"" said Landrieu, who is dealing with the ""triple threat"" of coastal erosion, rising sea levels and climate change.

One of the first mayors to speak out after Trump’s Thursday announcement was Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto who was appalled that the president used his city to justify his decision.

“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said in the Rose Garden announcement of his intent to quit the international agreement to reduce greenhouse gases.

Peduto, one of the mayors who went to Paris to push for the 2015 agreement, said it’s his duty to prepare his city for the future.

“If you are a mayor and not addressing shifts in changing weather patterns or preparing for the impacts of climate change you aren't doing your job,” Peduto, a Democrat, said in a statement.

Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., tweeted his support of Peduto Thursday.

“All climate change is local,” Buttigieg said.

As evidence, he said one of South Bend’s worst problems last year was “a climate disaster,” referring to extensive flooding caused by an historic rainfall. By contrast, one of the area's best job creators is a solar company, which has brought 50 full-time jobs to the city, he said.

Buttigieg announced Friday he is joining the Mayors National Climate Action Agenda, a group of mayors who have promised to work locally, and advocate nationally, for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In Carmel, Ind., Brainard has been involved in the issues for years.

Co-chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors task force on energy independence and climate protection, Brainard was also one of four Republicans on former President Obama’s 26-member task force of state and local elected officials created to give the previous White House feedback on how local communities are dealing with climate change.

Brainard traveled with the group to speak with local leaders in India and Germany about creating sustainable cities in advance of the Paris climate change conference.

In his own city, Brainard has pushed various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions including purchasing hybrid and bio-fuel vehicles, planting trees and keeping traffic moving by building roundabouts instead of traffic signals.

“Cities all over the country are experimenting and innovating with how to reduce that particular city’s carbon emissions, and that’s why I’m still optimistic that we’ll be able to meet the terms of our country’s promise to the rest of the world, regardless of what this particular administration chooses,” Brainard said. “In some cities that maybe haven’t gone as far as we have, they may have to step it up a bit.”

Fellow Republican Mayor Elizabeth Kautz of Burnsville, Minn., was also optimistic.

""It's going to be okay because mayors are going to do it,"" she told reporters. ""We will do what is right.""

But while Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton told reporters Friday that mayors will be stepping up their game, he also said Trump’s decision is a setback.

“I want to give people hope, but not false hope,” said Stanton, a Democrat who said climate change is contributing to extreme heat, drought and increased forest fires in his state. “It’s going to be a lot harder for the United States to meet its commitment under the Paris accord without the president being on board.”"

Paris deal harms U.S. prosperity: Opposing view
Roger Wicker, USATODAY
Job creation is one of President Trump’s principal goals.

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss.

Last month, I signed a letter with 21 of my Senate colleagues urging President Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. The 2015 deal made by the Obama administration runs counter to the actions President Trump has taken to deliver regulatory relief to American families and workers since he took office.

Chief among those actions is an executive order to end President Obama’s so-called Clean Power Plan. The carbon dioxide rules at the center of the Clean Power Plan amount to an intrusive overreach, and the Supreme Court has halted their implementation.

The Paris agreement stood in the way of President Trump’s efforts to eliminate these costly carbon dioxide rules. But this would be the least of its harm. A report released in March by NERA Economic Consulting suggests that the climate deal could cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion and more than 6 million industrial sector jobs by 2040.

Like many Americans, I questioned what this hefty price tag would actually buy. There is little evidence that the Paris agreement would significantly reduce the growth of global temperatures — or that it would substantially change the level of the seas. In other words, why should we put American livelihoods at risk and subject U.S. sovereignty to international litigation when the climate change agreement offers little return on its investment?

Americans who are concerned about carbon dioxide should be pleased with recent developments. Market-driven solutions helped reduce CO2 emissions by 12% in the past decade. Besides, the United States already engages with other countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty adopted by the Senate in 1992. Under the Constitution, legally binding treaties require a two-thirds majority of the Senate.

The Paris deal would have threatened our country’s prosperity. Because job creation is one of President Trump’s principal goals, I am glad he has initiated what our letter suggested: “Make a clean break from the Paris agreement.”"

What the Paris climate agreement withdrawal means for U.S. economy

Exit from Paris accord provides lift for oil and gas, but jeopardizes U.S. bargaining power.

SAN FRANCISCO — President Trump's decision Thursday to exit the Paris climate agreement is likely to give a small and immediate lift to the oil and coal industry, which makes good on a persistent campaign promise.

But, economists and energy experts warn, over time the controversial decision to drop out of the international pact to help stem climate change may hamper the nation's ability to financially capitalize on the globe's shift to renewable resources.

Leaving the Paris agreement jeopardizes the U.S.'s ability to be a global leader in new clean technology developments and sell those insights to a world hungry for cheap energy, experts say.

""The biggest danger in leaving the accord is you lose your seat at the negotiating table for all climate talks to come,"" says Shayle Kann of GTM Research, which does market analysis on next-generation energy solutions. ""If you're not able to negotiate bilateral agreements, that can impact U.S. exports of our own leading edge technology.""

Trump's decision runs counter to the advice of some of his closest advisers, including daughter Ivanka. It also flies in the face of pleas from everyone from Exxon CEO Darren Woods, who wrote Trump asking him to keep the U.S. seat at the bargaining table, to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has made good on his vow to quit the president's economic council if Trump opted out of Paris.

""Climate change is real,"" Musk tweeted. ""Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.""

Other business leaders reacting swiftly and negatively to the news, included Salesforce founder Marc Benioff and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

Benioff tweeted that he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision, noting that his company would continue to strive to run only renewable energy.

Nadella tweeted that ""climate change is an urgent issue that demands global action,"" and linked to Microsoft president Brad Smith's blog post that noted a weeks-long effort to lobby, along with other business leaders, the White House to stay in the agreement.

In making the announcement, Trump seemed to leave the door open to join a modified global pact under terms he believes are more favorable to the U.S.

“We are getting out,"" Trump said at a White House ceremony. ""But we will start to negotiate, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And if we can, that’s great.”

Kann, the GTM Research analyst, is among those who don't see a big immediate economic effect on the clean-energy movement in the U.S. as a result of the decision. He says that Americans ultimately vote with their pocketbooks, which means any clean energy solutions — notably solar and natural gas — that can reduce their monthly bills will continue to get support.

""Clean tech growth in the U.S. is unstoppable from an economic perspective, partly because you'll likely see continued support (of such companies) on a state level,"" he says. ""You'll see continued growth in this area because it'll be the cheapest energy available.""

In the short run, withdrawing from the accord will negate the impact of possible carbon emissions fees on gas and electricity costs, says economist Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics. And Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, notes that the decision will likely slow job losses in fossil fuel industries, such as coal, as well as job gains in renewable energy, such as solar and wind.

But, adds Zandi, employment in coal already has been shrinking in part because natural gas has become a cheaper and cleaner power source. And renewable energy already has seen job growth, partly as a result of state mandates and lower prices that have encouraged many home owners to install solar panels on their rooftops, for example.

As a result, the short-term effect on U.S. employment likely would amount to just several thousand additional jobs in a nation that employs more than 140 million, Zandi says.

“Why would you try to help the coal industry while reducing investment in future energy such as solar, wind and storage? This is crazy,” says Mike Phillips, CEO of Sense, maker of a high-tech power-measurement device for smart homes.

Job creation in renewable energy dwarfs coal, which was an obsession with Trump on the campaign trail, Phillips says, citing a Department of Energy report in January that noted the coal industry employs about 160,000 in the U.S., and is shrinking, while jobs are growing in the areas of energy-efficiency (2.2 million), natural gas (400,000), solar (374,000) and wind (102,000).

Domestic job growth issues aside, economist Zandi says that Trump's decision makes it less likely the U.S. will be at the forefront of clean energy innovation, possibly costing the country as many as hundreds of thousands of jobs over the next decade or two. “We’re not going to lead the way,” he says.

Zandi also cautions about a ripple effect of climate change that could have another huge economic impact, namely that stronger hurricanes, floods and other catastrophic events that destroy homes and businesses could cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decades.

But mostly, Daco says, withdrawing from the Paris accord represents a dangerously isolationist stance at a time when the planet feels like an increasingly interdependent ecosystem.

Say Daco: “You’re coming and saying, ‘I don’t want to deal with the rest of the world.'""

We won't always have Paris: 'We're getting out' of climate agreement
Editors, USA TODAY
The U.S. joins Syria and Nicaragua as the only three countries opting out of the Paris climate accord.

People walk in front of the Eiffel tower in Paris.

What do the United States, Syria and Nicaragua have in common? They're the only countries opposed to the Paris climate agreement, which requires establishing ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gases. President Trump said Thursday that ""we're getting out"" of the Paris accord, making the announcement in the White House Rose Garden, the same place where President Barack Obama hailed the agreement last fall as ""a turning point for our planet."" Trump said the deal amounted to a ""self-inflicted, major economic wound” for the United States. (A reminder from our weather desk: The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing it to warm to levels that scientists say cannot be explained by only natural patterns.) “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” Trump said. Reaction to the announcement was swift; Obama issued a statement even before Trump was done speaking. Under the terms of the agreement, the earliest a nation can formally withdraw is November 2020 — the same month Trump will run for re-election.

A massive crack in an Antarctic ice shelf grew by 11 miles in the past six days, as one of the world's biggest icebergs ever is poised to break off. Only 8 miles remain until the crack in the Larsen C ice shelf cuts all the way across, producing an iceberg about the size of Delaware. Why does it matter? Once the iceberg breaks off, it ""will fundamentally change the landscape of the Antarctic Peninsula,"" said Adrian Luckman of Project MIDAS, a British Antarctic research project. Also, ice shelves and icebergs ""hold back the glaciers that 'feed' them,” Luckman said. ""When they disappear, ice can flow faster from the land to the ocean and contribute more quickly to sea-level rise.” That happened when the Larsen B ice shelf broke off 15 years ago. While Larsen C’s progress is not attributed to climate change, it is widely accepted that warming temperatures were a factor in other Antarctic ice shelf disintegrations. Global warming has pushed temperatures 5 degrees higher in the region since the 1950s and could increase up to 7 degrees more by the end of the century.

It's on now. We've been been waiting to hear what former FBI director James Comey has to say since President Trump abruptly fired him last month, and the date is now set. Comey will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee next Thursday (that's June 8 — circle it on your calendar in red) and is set to discuss the investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling. We expect to hear about his conversations with Trump, including reports the president asked Comey to back off the FBI's investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. So grab your popcorn because expectations are high for some explosive testimony (although the juiciest beans might not spill until the closed session on classified information that follows Comey’s public appearance).

American aviation has added more superlatives to its list of industry accomplishments. United Airlines is waiting for regulators to OK its 8,700-mile non-stop route from Los Angeles to Singapore. Expected this fall, the flight would be the longest of any carrier flying in or out of the United States. At nearly 18 hours, the flight would also spend the most time in the air. Meanwhile, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen unveiled a massive 500,000-pound plane, the world’s largest, based on wingspan. The plane, built by Allen's company Stratolaunch, measures 385 feet wide, has two cockpits and six Boeing 747 engines, and can carry up to 550,000 pounds.

It was 50 years ago today Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. On June 1, 1967, the Beatles released the iconic Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Fab Four’s eighth studio album was a break from so much of what they — really, anyone — had done before, and it was not universally well-received. Was it their best album? That’s up for debate. But it became ""the most significant musical cocktail of all time,” said Mike Jones, a popular music expert at the University of Liverpool. Perhaps Beatle Paul McCartney says it best: ""It’s crazy to think that 50 years later, we are looking back on this project with such fondness and a little bit of amazement at how four guys, a great producer and his engineers could make such a lasting piece of art.” Do yourself a favor and pull out the turntable, give the half-century-old gem a spin, and read this first-person recounting of a schoolboy stumbling upon John, Paul, George and Ringo filming a promo for the upcoming Sgt. Pepper's. We hope you have enjoyed the show.

Rising seas doom a cherished way of life
By Trevor Hughes, @trevorhughes, USA TODAY
Annie Weyiouanna remembers her home being bigger. For decades, the relentless Chukchi Sea has been washing away the fine sand that makes up Sarichef Island, and this Iupiaq village of 650 now faces a stark choice: Move or drown.

""You are taking away our identity,"" Weyiouanna says. ""That's like a punch in the gut. That's who we are -- we are tied to this land and the sea.""

Regardless of debates about climate change, there's no question the island is shrinking. Satellite images taken over the past 20 years show how far the shoreline has receded, drawing ever closer to the small homes huddled on what is little more than a large sandbar.

Federal officials estimate the island loses somewhere between 9 and 22 feet of shoreline every year, although a massive seawall built from rocks barged in from the mainland has slowed the process.

Still, that rock wall protects only the hardest-hit areas from erosion, and the wind carries away sand year-round from the island's highest point, about 20feet above sea level.

Many of the native people here blame human-caused climate change for accelerating the island's erosion and worry that President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement will supercharge the destruction that's already occurring. One government estimate says the majority of the town's homes could be uninhabitable within 15 years.

What's worse, they say, is Trump's proposed federal budget would eliminate money they hoped could pay to relocate the village to the mainland about 20miles away in what would be a years-long logistics nightmare of barges, temporary roads and construction of a new airstrip. One U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimate put the moving cost at $180 million for a town where the median household income is less than $30,000 a year. And Shishmaref is just one of more than 180 coastal towns in Alaska facing such problems, although federal officials say it's one of the most precariously situated.

Beyond cost, a move raises more personal questions. Community identity here is often tied to a specific location, where fathers pass down tips on the best hunting sites to their sons, where grandmothers take kids fishing for dinner and where virtually everyone is related to their neighbor.

""We have no choice. Our island is getting smaller. It isn't getting bigger,"" ivory carver Edwin Weyiouanna said.

Understanding what's happening to Sarichef Island requires a bit of a history and geology lesson. The island, about 100 miles from the Russian mainland, is part of a land bridge that once connected the North American continent to Asia. Researchers have concluded North America was initially populated by people and animals that made their way across that land bridge before it disappeared. The people who live on the coasts of both continents are related to one another and used to routinely shuttle across in boats before the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union ended that practice. On a clear day, you can see Russia from their island.

Today, the residents of Shishmaref live a largely subsistence-based life. They boat to the mainland to hunt caribou and ducks and gather berries. They fish and shoot seals for meat for them and their dogs.

Few have running water inside their homes. Instead, they buy water delivered by barge during the summer and collect crystal-clear freshwater ice from the mainland for drinking. They also depend heavily on food stamps to buy dried ramen noodles and eight kinds of Spam at the town's two grocery stores, along with so much soda that the town's dentist shakes his head in frustration. Health care is provided to most everyone free under Medicaid.

Without running water, few people have flush toilets. Instead, they use buckets fitted with toilet seats and then bag up the waste for transport to a sewage lagoon. Trash gets hauled to a landfill at the island's south end and burned, and animal carcasses lie half buried in the snow or dirt.

Dogs chained up outside the modest houses bark at strangers, and residents drive most everywhere on four-wheelers or snowmobiles or side-by-sides rather than walking the few blocks from one end of the town to the other.

Many of the approximately 150 houses are owned by the local housing authority, and the local government is the largest employer here. The land on which the town sits is owned by the tribe's native corporation, which means few people have any significant financial resources.

The plot where they might relocate is also owned by the tribal corporation. It's surrounded by the 2.6-million-acre Bering Land Bridge National Reserve, which means the federal government's permission would be required to build roads and create a quarry for foundation materials.

Flights off the island cost about $400 round-trip, and that will get you only to Nome, population 3,500, about 120 miles away. The Army Corps estimates moving and assimilating the entire population of Shishmaref into Nome would cost about half what it would take to rebuild the town in an entirely new location, but residents here say that would destroy their sense of identity.

This island, be it ever so humble, is home.

At least for another decade. Maybe. It depends on whether sea level rise speeds up, a big storm again knocks out the defensive wall or warmer winters continue melting the protective sea ice that surrounds the island for much of the year. The ground itself is softening, the once-frozen permafrost melting, and there's little vegetation to stop the top layers from blowing away.

""I wish we didn't have to move,"" Lorraine Jungers said as she shopped at one of the stores with her teenage daughter. ""I know the benefits of moving. But we'd be too far apart from the people that mean the most to us. This is our whole life right here. I can't picture us anywhere else.""

Some residents don't think the town will move. They say there's no way to pay for it and no way to physically move an entire village across miles of open water to reach the mainland. In that event, residents here would slowly disperse over time as the water flowed its way inland.

Even if the relocation happens, they fear there will be no way to maintain the same sense of community in a new place. Other struggles include questions over polar bears coming onto the mainland, whether to move the bodies buried in the island's small cemetery, and how to overcome the inertia that comes with having lived in the same small piece of land for generations.

The effort to move has been underway, in one form or another, for years. Residents have voted multiple times to relocate to the mainland, and several have testified before Congress. A youth ambassador from Shishmaref attended the 2015 Paris climate talks.

Still, not much has changed despite more than a decade of lobbying, votes and media attention.

And the clock is ticking.

Shishmaref native Esau Sinnok has already seen the island lose at least 100 feet of coastline in his 19years, and a dozen houses, including his grandmother's, were relocated in 1997 to stave off collapse into the ocean.

Emergency protection has proved costly: In 2001, the state paid $110,000 to install sand-filled wire baskets along the western shore. They lasted through only the next storm.

A more expensive and extensive sea wall built in pieces in the late 2000s has helped protect a small portion of the island's west closest to homes, but satellite images show it merely moved the erosion a little farther along the shore, closer to the airstrip.

The lack of action under President Obama frustrated residents ready to move. They wonder why Obama could commit so many billions of dollars to fighting climate change abroad while not doing more to help Americans. Things will be worse, they fear, under Trump.

""He doesn't believe climate change is real,"" Annie Weyiouanna said.

""I think it's scary."""

Trump says it plainly: 'We're getting out'
By Gregory Korte, @gregorykorte, USA TODAY
President Trump's decision Thursday to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement put the rest of the world on notice about a decision he had already made: to stop implementing the Obama-era policies that would have allowed the United States to meet its commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.

But in making the long-awaited announcement, the president also added a signature Trump condition: that he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement on more favorable terms.

""So we're getting out, but we will start to negotiate, and we'll see if we can make a deal that's fair,"" he said.

Under the terms of the international accord to reduce greenhouse gases, the earliest a nation can formally withdraw is November 2020 -- the same month Trump faces re-election. But because the greenhouse gas reduction targets are largely voluntary, Trump said, he would immediately ""cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord.""

European leaders quickly responded that the accord was ""irreversible"" and not open to renegotiation.

""We firmly believe that the Paris Agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies,"" said a joint statement by Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron.

In a half-hour speech in the White House Rose Garden, Trump did not address the scientific consensus that rising global temperatures, almost certainly caused by human activity since the industrial revolution, are a threat to the planet. He has called that science ""an expensive hoax"" perpetrated by the Chinese.

Instead, Trump complained that other countries had attached too many conditions to their commitments -- known as nationally determined contributions -- to reduce carbon emissions. As he has with with trade and immigration, Trump accused the rest of the world of taking advantage of the U.S.

""At what point do they stop laughing at us as a country? I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.""

China, for example, said it would begin reducing emissions beginning in 2030 -- meaning it could continue to build coal-fired power plants every year until then.

""In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America ... and ships them to foreign countries,"" Trump said.

Trump has made clear he views the climate accord as an obstacle to his goal of creating jobs and ensuring energy independence. In March, he signed an executive order rolling back most of the environmental regulations the Obama administration had used as a down payment toward its nationally determined contributions.

Still, the rest of the world was watching to see how far Trump would go in backing out of the deal. The White House said Trump ""personally explained"" his decision Thursday in a call with the leaders of Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.

Trump cast the decision in terms of his campaign promise to ""put America first,"" reasserting American sovereignty. He made his announcement in the same place where President Obama hailed the agreement as ""a turning point for our planet.""

Your Say: LETTERS
In pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, President Trump is creating damage somewhere between a disaster and a catastrophe. Obviously, refusal to curb its greenhouse gases by the world's second biggest carbon polluter (us) will accelerate global warming's impacts, e.g. sea level rise, severe storms, droughts, floods and extinctions of endangered species.

But that's not all. The climate change skeptic is also ceding America's leadership in the world. No more will other countries follow our lead, or even agree to cooperate with us, having seen that at any time our president can pull out, rescind or cancel our agreed-upon responsibilities.

We are losing the competition to lead the next technological revolution, that of sustainable energy production. China now leads in solar, Denmark in wind, Netherlands in tides. America leads in turning backward and inward.

As our planet's temperature increases, we will suffer more destruction from hurricanes, flooding, drought and fires. The productive jobs not created by committing to sustainable energy will require jobs to clean up debris, fight fires, build seawalls and bury victims.

President Trump expected to withdraw from Paris climate agreement
Doug Stanglin, USA TODAY
The international treaty binds countries to limit the emission of greenhouse gases.

Coal-fired power plants like the Homer City Generating Station in Pennsylvania emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.

President Trump appears poised to announce U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement that limits the emission of greenhouse gases.

Details on the withdrawal are being worked out by a small team including EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, according to Axios, which broke the story Wednesday. It quotes two sources with direct knowledge of the decision.

A White House official confirms the president is expected to withdraw from the accord, the Associated Press reports.

In a slightly more cautious report, CBS says the president is expected to withdraw from the accord, but has also discussed with senior White House staff an effort to renegotiate the agreement with an eye toward making its provisions less onerous to U.S. industry.

The president, in a tweet posted after the media reports began to circulate, said only: ""I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

Read more:

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Tuesday only that an announcement on the decision could come soon.

The international agreement, which went into effect seven months ago, is considered a major part the environmental legacy of the Obama administration.

It was not immediately clear whether the president intends to make a quick, clean break with the treaty or to work out a full, formal withdrawal, which could take three years.

The move, if confirmed, comes despite the urging of European leaders at the G-7 summit last week in meetings with Trump not to abandon the accord.

The agreement, formally known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, focuses on ways to reduce greenhouse gases emissions. It was negotiated by 195 countries at a conference in 2015.

It was formally adopted following the ratification by a sufficient number of signatories and took effect in November. Under the terms of the agreement, member countries promised to reduce their carbon output ""as soon as possible"" and to do their best to keep global warming ""well below 2-degree Celsius"" of pre-industrial levels.

Shortly after the news broke Wednesday, the United Nations official account tweeted a note from U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres: ""Climate change is undeniable ... Climate action is unstoppable ...  Climate solutions provide opportunities that are unmatchable.""

Axios reports that the decision to withdraw from the accord followed an appeal by 22 Republican senators, including Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, calling for a ""clean exit"" from the agreement.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly expressed his skepticism over laws and regulations driven by environmental concerns.

On Tuesday, Spicer was asked directly at a press briefing whether the president believes that humans affect global warming. His reply: ""I'll get back to you."""

OnPolitics Today: America first, Earth last
Josh Hafner, USA TODAY
Au revoir to the Paris deal.

President Trump on Thursday officially declared that the United States will back out of the Paris Climate Accord, a worldwide effort to combat global warming adhered to by nearly every other nation on Earth. Trump fulfilled a campaign promise in doing so, while also jeopardizing America's global standing, its economy and, you know, the very planet upon which America exists.

Also on Thursday: Comey's coming for Trump, who experts say really needs a nap.

It's OnPolitics Today, the daily politics roundup from USA TODAY. Subscribe here.

America dumps more greenhouse gasses into the air than any nation besides China, but Trump said on Thursday that the U.S. wasn't getting ""a deal that's fair."" Trump cited the economy as a major reason for the withdrawal, despite several successful people with successful businesses — think Apple's Tim Cook and Elon Musk of Tesla — urging Trump to stay with the Paris deal. (Musk even left Trump's economic council after the decision.) World leaders condemned Trump's decision, as well. Our Cup of Politics podcast dives the details of the agreement.

How real could climate change get? Sea levels could rise to flood America's coastlines by the end of this century, a University of Georgia researcher found, forcing as many as 13 million Americans to evacuate their homes. Climate change is happening now, though: U.S. cities have broken their hottest temperature records five times as often as their coldest temp records this decade, the Weather Underground found.

“With our world speeding toward a climate catastrophe, Trump just stepped on the gas,” said Kieran Suckling of the Center for Biological Diversity.

Here's how America's step back from the Paris deal could affect our Earth, according to two dozen climate scientists.

Trump fired the FBI director overseeing an investigation tied to him last month. Now, that former FBI director will publicly testify on Russia's possible tampering with the presidential election. James Comey will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee next Thursday, part of one of five separate investigations into Russia and Trump associates. Expect him to address whether Trump pressured him to halt an investigation. Ready the popcorn. This could be big.

So back to Trump's ""covfefe"" tweet yesterday. It came at midnight, when most all of the Eastern Seaboard was asleep. Why wasn't Trump? He only sleeps three or four hours a night, he's said, and sleep experts say that could impair his performance as, you know, somehow who holds the nuclear codes. Trump shows ""many classic signs of sleep deprivation,"" said neurologist Chris Winter, a self-described conservative, including bad decision making, irritability, impulsiveness and an inability to focus. In short: Trump may suffer from lack of sleep, and side effects may include covfefe."

Haley: Trump 'believes the climate is changing'
Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY
The statement follows two days of evading questions by the White House on Trump's beliefs on global warming, which in the past he has referred to as a ""hoax.""

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley speaks to the media in the Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington on April 24, 2017.

President Trump believes climate change is real and human activity contributes to it, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley told CBS on Saturday.

Haley's statement follows two days of evading questions by the White House on Trump's beliefs on global warming, which in the past he has referred to as a ""hoax.""

Haley told CBS' Face The Nation repeatedly in an interview scheduled for broadcast Sunday that Trump acknowledges the climate is changing. On Thursday, he announced that he was withdrawing the United States from the 2015 Paris climate agreement that seeks to limit global warming through cuts in carbon emissions."

GOP congressman on climate change: God will 'take care of it' if it's real
Eliza Collins, USA TODAY
WASHINGTON — Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg isn’t concerned about the effects of climate change — if it exists — because God will “take care of it.” 

U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., speaks as people stand in protest during a town hall meeting May 11, 2017, in Jackson, Mich.

WASHINGTON — Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg isn’t concerned about the effects of climate change — if it exists — because God will “take care of it.”

Walberg was speaking to constituents in Coldwater, Mich., last week when he was asked about climate change.

Walberg, who has previously questioned the existence of global warming, first joked that he could take some global warming at home in Michigan because it was too cold and some global cooling in Washington because of the humidity.

Walberg then conceded that the climate was changing, before adding that wasn't anything new.

“I believe there’s climate change,” Walberg said, according to a video of the exchange obtained first published by the Huffington Post. “I believe there’s been climate change since the beginning of time. I think there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah, of course. Can man change the entire universe? No.”

“Why do I believe that?” he continued. “Well, as a Christian, I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us. And I’m confident that, if there’s a real problem, he can take care of it.”

On Thursday afternoon, President Trump is expected to announce whether the United States will remain a member of the Paris climate agreement. Trump hasn’t announced whether he’ll make good on his campaign promise to leave the pact — which includes every country besides Syria and Nicaragua — but multiple outlets have reported he's leaning towards dropping out.

U.S. withdrawing from Paris climate agreement, Trump announces
Gregory Korte, USA TODAY
The 197-member climate agreement requires every country to establish ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gases.

President Trump announces his decision on the Paris climate agreement in the Rose Garden of the White House on June 1, 2017.

WASHINGTON — President Trump said Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement to reduce greenhouse gases because it would cost American jobs, but he added a signature Trump condition: that he would be willing to renegotiate the agreement on more favorable terms.

“I don’t want anything to get in our way. I am fighting every day for the great people of our country.  Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord,” he said.

But he quickly added a caveat that the United States would also seek to re-enter the agreement — or some other treaty — on terms that were more favorable to American workers. “So were getting out, but we'll start to negotiate, and well see if we can make a deal that’s fair,” he said.

Trump complained that other countries had attached too many conditions to their voluntary agreements to reduce carbon emissions. China, for example, said it would begin reducing emissions in 2030 — meaning they could continue to build coal-fired power plants every year until then. “In short, the agreement doesn’t eliminate coal jobs, it just takes coal jobs out of the United States and ship them to other countries,” he said.

Trump cast the decision in terms of his campaign promise to put America First, reasserting American sovereignty and rebuffing an attempt by the rest of the world to take advantage of the United States.

“At what point do they stop laughing at us as a country?” he said. “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”

Trump said the deal amounted to a ""self-inflicted, major economic wound” for the United States.

He downplayed the impact of carbon reductions to the environment, saying the plan would only result in a few degrees’ difference by the year 2100 — gains that could be wiped out by increased emissions by China.

Trump made the long-awaited announcement in the White House Rose Garden, the same place where President Obama hailed the agreement last year as ""a turning point for our planet.""

With typical Trumpian flair for building suspense, the president had announced his announcement via Twitter, saying ""I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""

The announcement came on a seasonably sunny 82-degree June day, with staffers and supporters ringing the Rose Garden and a Marine Corps jazz quartet providing warm-up music. Even after starting the event a half-hour late, Trump used the attention commanded by the climate announcement to tout his record on jobs, terrorism and the appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

The 197-member climate agreement requires every country to establish ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gasses. But those targets are largely voluntary, and Trump has already made clear that he views environmental regulations as an obstacle to his goal of creating jobs and ensuring energy independence.

Still, the rest of the world was watching to see how far Trump will go in backing out of the accord. By leaving open the possibility of re-entering the agreement, he ended up on the more moderate end of the range of options the White House had been exploring.

Trump had said he's been lobbied heavily by both sides on the climate agreement. On one side is the economic nationalist wing of his White House, advisers such as Steve Bannon who have called climate change a ""manufactured crisis"" and who once urged ""good global warming skeptics"" to leave all the lights in their house on in order to protest the Paris talks.


The decision makes good on a campaign promise to “cancel the Paris Climate Agreement and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs.” But Trump has also been known to change his mind, as he did in April with the North American Free Trade Agreement. After anonymous White House officials signaled for days that Trump would withdraw from the trade agreement, the leaders of Canada and Mexico ultimately persuaded him to renegotiate.

After anonymous White House officials signaled for days that Trump would withdraw from the trade agreement, the leaders of Canada and Mexico ultimately persuaded him to renegotiate.

Trump's decision came less than a week after he met with world leaders in Sicily, where closed-door discussions included pleas for the United States to stick to the consensus agreed to in Paris in 2015 and consummated last year.

In a separate meeting with Pope Francis last week, the pontiff presented Trump with a gift — a copy of his two-year-old encyclical on climate change known as Laudato Si. Francis, who argues that care of God's creation is part of the church's larger concern for the poor, encouraged ""continued participation,” in the climate agreement.

Trump said he hoped to continue American leadership on the environment, but make sure that “the burdens are equally shared among the many nations all around the world.”


Obama had framed the agreement as a key test of American leadership in the world, and issued a fiery statement even before Trump finished his announcement.

""The nations that remain in the Paris agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,"" Obama said in a statement Thursday. ""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the planet we've got.""

With typical Trumpian build up of suspense for Thursday's Rose Garden appearance, the president earlier announced his announcement via Twitter, saying ""I will be announcing my decision on Paris Accord, Thursday at 3:00 P.M. The White House Rose Garden. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"""

Preserve Paris climate treaty: Our view
The Editorial Board, USA TODAY
Mr. President, don't wreck the international pact aimed at saving the planet.

President Trump at the White House Easter fest on April 17, 2017.

The Paris climate agreement reached in 2015 was a remarkable example of global cooperation. Nearly 200 nations joined forces against a planet-threatening crisis, promising to curb emissions of human-generated greenhouse gases.

To be sure, the pact is imperfect. It offers only a voluntary, pledge-drive approach to reducing emissions by the world's leading carbon polluters, the United States second among them. But, barring some technological breakthrough in green energy, the accord is a vital first step toward preventing catastrophic climate change.

Now President Trump, who once famously labeled global warming a hoax, is deciding whether to keep his campaign pledge to ""cancel"" the agreement, and he has a divided stable of policy advisers.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil CEO, says the United States should stay in to keep ""a seat at the table"" on global climate talks. Trump's daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner are said to agree.

Aides urging withdrawal include chief strategist Steve Bannon, a minder of Trump's campaign pledges, and Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who is brazenly skeptical of established science on climate change.

Here's hoping that the ""stay"" forces prevail.

Abandoning the Paris agreement could endanger the planet's future. The accord relies heavily on international peer pressure, and pulling out would offer other nations an excuse to bail or fall short on their emission-reduction commitments.

Reneging on such a far-reaching and historic pact would also damage America's credibility and erode diplomatic relations with countries that take their environmental promises far more seriously. Nations that have, or are planning, taxes on carbon emissions could slap retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from America.

""I can't think of an issue, except perhaps NATO, where if the U.S. simply walks away, it would have such a major negative impact on how we are seen,"" R. Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of State in the George W. Bush administration, told The New York Times.

As if to underscore the grave nature of pulling out of the agreement, even major energy corporations such as ExxonMobil, BP and Royal Dutch Shell oppose such a step.

Scientific evidence continues to mount that human-caused climate disruption is a here-and-now problem, not some distant threat. In the United States, the past five years have been the warmest in 122 years of record-keeping, according to new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data.

Abandoning Paris would expose America to massive international condemnation, all for the sake of getting out of a non-binding agreement. That makes no sense."

Quit Paris climate treaty: Opposing view
Christopher C. Horner, USA TODAY
Breaking Trump's vow amounts to a costly betrayal.

President Trump

President Trump’s advisers are debating recommendations on the Paris climate treaty. Reported arguments for staying in it appear to be no more than rationalizations to break Trump’s campaign promise to leave.

Consider the line that it is not a treaty because it’s not binding. This is, respectively, untrue and irrelevant. State Department guidelines (Circular 175) establish treaty criteria, and the Paris Agreement requires Senate ratification to be valid under our Constitution. Do it legally, or get out.

President Obama claimed that the Senate’s treaty-power role existed at his discretion in order to confer treaty-like status on his domestic climate agenda without making the apparently futile case to gain political support. Accepting this precedent guarantees that future “pen and phone” presidents will also avoid constitutional review of unpopular commitments by just declaring them “not a treaty.”

Climate catastrophe? No computer model cited by the United Nations projects a detectable temperature reduction from Paris. The ultimate aim of the agreement is instead to make the most abundant energy increasingly costly, artificially rationing its availability.

Seeking subsidies or competitive advantage for pro-environment industry under these schemes have motivated climate treaties since Enron pioneered the move in the mid-1990s (I was in the room). They seek to use government to profit at your expense.

Remaining in the agreement endangers energy prices underpinning the U.S. manufacturing renaissance Trump favors, while also risking that activist courts will reimpose restrictions such as the EPA “war on coal” rules that Trump says he’ll undo.

We hear climate policy leadership will be ceded to China. Did you hear about the mule who refused to shed his reins because he didn’t want to give up his leadership position? Me neither. Withdrawing means take one lump, now, and avoid sticking us all with the bill once Trump leaves office. Trump promised as candidate to withdraw. Breaking that vow amounts to a costly betrayal.

Democrats vent but can't stop Trump from leaving Paris climate agreement
Ledyard King, USATODAY
Republicans couldn't stop Obama from joining Paris accord and Democrats can't stop Trump from withdrawing.

This Sept. 2, 2016, file photo shows Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, former president Barack Obama and former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon shaking hands during a joint ratification of the Paris climate agreement in Hangzhou.

In this May 18, 2017 file photo, President Trump speaks in the East Room of the White House.

WASHINGTON — Democratic lawmakers slammed President Trump on Wednesday as news spread that he plans to pull out of the Paris climate accord, but there's not much they can do to about it if he does.

Trump has said he will make a decision by the end of the week, and news reports Wednesday indicated he is moving toward withdrawal.

A Republican-controlled Congress couldn't stop President Barack Obama in 2015 from signing on to the treaty designed to cut lower the risks of climate change by cutting emissions, and the Democrats can't stop Trump from pulling America out of the landmark deal signed by 195 countries.

That didn't stop Democrats from venting.

“President Trump’s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Accord is a stunning abdication of American leadership and a grave threat to our planet’s future,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. ""In walking away from this agreement, the President is denying scientific truths, removing safeguards that protect our health and our environment, protecting polluters and their dirty energy agenda, and threatening our national and global security.""

Rex Tillerson misled Exxon Mobil investors on climate change, NY AG says
Nathan Bomey, USA TODAY
NY AG Eric Schneiderman cited documents that surfaced during a probe of the oil giant.

This file photograph shows U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaking at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Press Room in Washington, D.C.

New York's attorney general accused U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of misleading investors on the costs of climate change while serving as CEO of Exxon Mobil.

The accusation — made in a court filing Friday in New York — reflects the latest development in an investigation on the oil giant's role in accounting for the potential costs of climate change.

Exxon documents that surfaced during the probe show the company used ""secret, internal figures"" that were lower than numbers publicly disclosed to investors from 2010 to 2014, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office said in the filing.

""Exxon’s documents show that former Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson was specifically informed of, and approved of, this inconsistency,"" the New York attorney general's office said in the document.

An Exxon spokesman was not immediately available for comment, but the company has denied any wrongdoing in how it accounted for climate change costs. A State Department representative was also not immediately available.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating the matter.

Any evidence that Exxon misled investors on the potential costs of climate change could trigger significant financial liability. Publicly traded companies are required to disclose to their investors any potentially major challenges, including financial threats such as the possibility of steep new taxes or harsh regulations.

The fresh allegation comes a day after tensions over climate change intensified when President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Tillerson, who resigned from his post at Exxon to take the secretary of State post, is said to have supported sticking with the deal.

Schneiderman's office said the documents allegedly showing Tillerson authorizing the bogus communication on climate costs came to light through a subpoena.

The office also accused Exxon of ""destruction of untold numbers of documents"" from more than a dozen employees, including ""months"" of communications by Tillerson on a second company email account under an alias that Exxon originally failed to disclose to the attorney general's office."

EPA removes climate change data, other scientific information from website
Michael Collins, USA TODAY
Agency says it is updating its website to reflect 'new direction' under Trump administration.

Protesters chant in front of the White House during the People's Climate March in Washington, DC, on April 29, 2017.

WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection Agency is updating its website and, in the process, has removed a page that explained the causes and effects of climate change.

The agency said Friday the website, epa.gov, is undergoing changes to reflect its new direction under President Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

“As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air, land and water, our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency,” J.P. Freire, the agency’s associate administrator for public affairs, said in a statement.

“We want to eliminate confusion by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how we’re protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law.”

The overhaul already appears to have impacted at least two of the agency’s websites – the EPA’s main climate change site and another regarding the Clean Power Plan, a rule put in place under former President Obama to reduce carbon pollution from power plants.

Visitors to the EPA’s main climate change website are now directed to a page that explains the site is being updated. The website, which launched in 1997, had included detailed data on the causes and the impact of climate change.

An archived snapshot of how the page looked under the Obama administration is still available from EPA’s main page. The agency said it will follow proper archiving procedures.

The first website update will reflect Trump’s position on energy independence and his calls for a review of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, the EPA said.

The site that included detailed data on the Clean Power Plan now directs readers to a page with photo of Trump signing an executive order in March to undo that rule and other Obama-era climate regulations.

In its statement, the EPA said the language associated with the Clean Power Plan is “out of date” and that content related to climate and regulation also is under review.

Environmentalists said they were alarmed by the EPA’s decision to scrub scientific data from the site.

“Cleansing has begun,” David Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean air program, wrote on Twitter.  “EPA website scrubbed of pages on ‘so-called’ Clean Power Plan. Now only alternative facts.”

The non-profit Environmental Data and Governance Initiative, which tracks governmental and science websites, called the website overhaul “concerning” and noted that the climate change resources became inaccessible the evening before tens of thousands of protesters participated in climate marches in Washington and other cities.

“The timing of this overhaul cuts off availability when access to trusted information about the science behind climate change will be necessary to enable a conversation about our changing climate,” the group said.

The group said it will continue to monitor the website update and make sure the archived snapshot of epa.gov remains online and accessible."

Trump'sÊchangeÊof U.S. direction at G-20
By Gregory Korte, @gregorykorte, USA TODAY
PresidentÊTrumpÊattended the G-20 summit in Hamburg, but he wasn't really a part of it.
Instead,ÊTrumpÊused the conference space generously provided by his host, German ChancellorÊAngela Merkel, to conduct a series of his own mini-summits -- separate on-on-one ""meetings on the sidelines"" with other world leaders whereÊTrumpÊpursued his own agenda.
He met with Russian PresidentÊVladimir PutinÊabout his interference in western elections. He met with leaders in Asia about North Korea. And he met with trading partners throughout the world in a two-day binge of talks.
This focus on one-on-one meetings, which ended withÊTrumpÊdeclaring newly created great friendships with world leaders, meant that he often stepped away from the bigger meetings. On Saturday, he left his daughter Ivanka to represent the United States on the floor of the G-20 while he met with the president of Indonesia.
And when the rest of the summit agreed that the ParisÊclimateÊagreement was ""irreversible,""ÊTrumpÊwithheld U.S. support for that part of the final communique.
The dynamic was apparent from the very beginning, while posing for the ""family photo"" with other world leaders. It wasÊMerkeltaking center stage, her bright red jacket standing out all the more from a sea of black business suits.
TrumpÊwas on the outskirts, unable to shove his way through the crowd to get to the center as he did with the Montenegrin prime minister at theÊNATOÊsummit in May. Instead, he was in the corner, engaged in small talk with French President Emmanuel Macron.
It was a visual representation ofÊTrump's brand of diplomacy. While he loves to command a room, he prefers to work one-on-one as opposed to groups.
If PresidentÊGeorge W. BushÊwas accused of being a unilateral president, too often going it alone on the world stage; and PresidentÊBarack ObamaÊwas a multilateral president, seeking broad consensus on issues likeÊclimateÊchange, trade and security --thenÊTrumpÊis a bilateral president, seeking to make deals one at a time.
That preference for bilateral relationships is based on personality, experience in business and a philosophy that puts narrow national interests ahead of broader global concerns like wealth inequality, refugee resettlement andÊclimateÊchange.
It's a worldviewÊTrumpÊarticulated in his speech in Warsaw on Thursday, where he extolled the virtues of national sovereignty, self-determination, strong borders and nations paying for their own defense.
While he pledged to defendÊNATOÊallies from attack -- something he pointedly did not do at theÊNATOÊsummit -- he also expressed a deep skepticism of international bureaucracies.
Bureaucracies like the G-20. the group of 19 of the largest national economies (plus theÊEuropean Union) founded in 1999 to address the world's most pressing economic issues.
TrumpÊnow has three major foreign summits under his belt, plus two other smaller group meetings in Saudi Arabia and Poland. While he often seemed on the sidelines, aides sayÊTrumpÊ""will not ""lead from behind.""
TrumpÊis driven by a ""clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors and businesses engage and compete for advantage,"" national security adviser H.R. McMaster and economic adviser Gary Cohn wrote in theÊWall Street JournalÊafter his first foreign trip.
A shared worldview
That's a view of the world largely shared byÊPutin. He, too, favors the one-on-one relationships to broader action.
""If we want to have a positive development through bilaterals and be able to resolve most acute international problems, then definitely we need personal meetings,"" he said in his meeting withÊTrumpÊFriday.
As cameras clicked and reporters shouted questions,ÊPutinÊmotioned to the journalists and askedÊTrump, ""These are the ones hurting you?""
""These are the ones. You're right about that,""ÊTrumpÊsaid.
Putin's reference toÊTrump's war with the media was no accident, said Stephen Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet Union during the Clinton administration. ""I'm sureÊPutinÊfinds that very simpatico.""
""TrumpÊclearly thinks bilateral relationships serve the U.S. best in general, but there's a separate reason for dealing with Russia one-on-one,"" said Sestanovich, now a professor atÊColumbia University. ""PutinÊis a semi-pariah internationally, especially now that the G-7 kicked him out three years ago. He too deals with many countries bilaterally, because Russia isn't in all that many global clubs.""
Trump's critics say his fostering of aÊPutinÊrelationship in particular is a dangerous gambit. WhileÊTrumpÊpressedÊPutinÊabout his involvement in a campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign,ÊPutinÊsaysÊTrumpÊended up agreeing with him that there was no such interference.
White House Chief of StaffÊReince PriebusÊsaid Sunday thatÊTrumpÊdoes believeÊPutinÊmeddled in the election, and simply chose to move on to other topics.
He said the summit showedÊTrumpÊ""standing up for the American people.""
""I think the American people should look at that as a massive positive about this president, that you have a president that doesn't just show up at the G-20 and sink into his chair and just suddenly agree with all of these European leaders across the table when it comes to issues that he disagrees on,"" Priebus toldÊFox NewsÊSunday.Ê""The president has made it very clear that he doesn't believe the Paris agreement is fair.""
But even asÊTrumpÊrankles Europe, he seems to be focusing more attention to the Pacific Rim -- whereÊTrumpÊis hoping to sign a series of trade deals to replace theÊTrans-Pacific PartnershipÊhe tore up his first week in office.
Trump's formula
Those meetings illustrateÊTrump's tried and true formula for opening a bilateral meeting: emphasizing the closeness of the relationship, and then launching right into a discussion about trade:
** With Indonesian PresidentÊJoko Widodo: ""We've become friends, and we're going to be doing a lot of deals together -- trade deals.""
** With Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore: ""The prime minister of Singapore -- we're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways.""
** With Mexican President Enrique Pea-Nieto: ""It's great to be with my friend, the president of Mexico. And we're negotiating NAFTA and some other things with Mexico, and we'll see how it all turns out.""
** With South Korean President Moon Jae-in: ""We had fantastic dinner at the White House -- accomplished a lot,"" he said. ""We are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea, and hopefully it will be an equitable deal.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the talks behind closed doors were ""very, very substantive.""
""These were not just relationship builders,"" he said.

HowÊTrumpÊshould celebrate Energy Week
By Ted Nordhaus
TheÊTrumpÊadministration is celebrating a self-designated ""Energy Week,"" which culminates today with a presidential speech and participation in an ""American Energy Dominance Panel."" But PresidentÊTrump's proposed budget cuts to energy innovation programs are no reason to celebrate. In fact, they could prove even more damaging to the environment than his decision to pull out of the ParisÊclimateÊagreement.
Not only would innovation programs be cut across the board by $3.1 billion (18%), popular programs such as the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Program and Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy would be axed entirely.
Energy DepartmentÊinnovation programs have not been without controversy. Failed loan guarantees for Solyndra and Fisker sparked outrage duringÊPresident Obama's first term. The Clinton administration and congressionalÊDemocratsÊkilled the Experimental Breeder Reactor program, setting back efforts to develop advanced nuclear reactors by decades. And environmentalists and conservatives alike have lampooned costly synthetic fuels and oil shales programs from the 1970s and 1980s that failed to deliver cheap transportation fuels.
But energy innovations have also brought economic, energy security and environmental benefits. Clean, carbon-free nuclear energy, commercialized by the old Atomic Energy Commission for less than $10 billion in today's dollars, supplies almost 20% of U.S. electricity. Investments in hydraulic fracturing and turbines have allowed natural gas to displace coal as our largest power source, the main reason we have led the world in emissions reductions for a decade.
Wind and solar energy were commercialized through the Energy Research and Development Administration, which became part of the department in 1977. Technological advances from the Clinton-era Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles paved the way for today's electric cars. TheÊEnergy DepartmentÊand the National Laboratories also played critical roles in developing transformative energy efficiency technologies such as LED lighting, high-definition video screens and high-efficiency appliances.
Federal investments have worked best when there was private skin already in the game. Competitive grant processes, requiring that private investors share in the cost of developing better technologies, help ensure that promising technologies are vetted for their economic viability by market actors before federal investment starts to flow.
Warts and all, federal investments in clean energy technology over the past six decades have paid off for consumers, health and energy security. That is why keyÊRepublicansÊhave criticized the administration's proposed cuts. Even for those skeptical thatÊclimateÊchangeÊis caused by humans and bullish that today's era of cheap fossil energy will continue for decades, these sorts of investments represent cheap insurance to protect our planet.

World leaders condemned President Trump's decision Thursday to pull out of the ParisÊclimateÊagreement.
Although the president said he was willing to work for a better deal, France, Italy and Germany said in a joint statement that the accord can not be renegotiated.
German ChancellorÊAngela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni urged allies to ""speed up"" efforts to fight againstÊclimateÊchangeÊand said they would do more to help poorer countries.
Paris City Hall was illuminated in green Thursday night after Trump's announcement.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took to Twitter to criticize the president's decision, saying his country is ""deeply disappointed.""
""We are all custodians of this world, and that is why Canada will continue to work with the U.S. at the state level, and with other U.S. stakeholders, to addressÊclimateÊchangeÊand promote clean growth,"" Trudeau said in a statement.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the decision ""irresponsible.""
Prime Minister of Denmark Lars Rasmussen said it was a ""sad day for the world.""
Former Mexican president Vincente Fox tweeted that Trump has ""surrendered the hopes and future of a nation.""
""He's declaring war on the planet itself,"" Fox added.
Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel also weighed in: ""I condemn this brutal act. ... Leadership means fightingÊclimateÊchangetogether. Not forsaking commitment.""
Earlier Thursday, Russia said it supported theÊclimateÊagreement. ""President (Vladimir)ÊPutinÊsigned this convention in Paris. Russia attaches great significance to it,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a call with reporters, theÊIndependentÊreported. ""At the same time, it goes without saying that the effectiveness of this convention is likely to be reduced without its key participants.""
In China, premierÊLi KeqiangÊpromised to work with theÊEUÊto uphold the accord, saying there is a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility"" to fightÊclimateÊchange, theÊAssociated PressÊreported. ""China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment,"" he said in Berlin.

Pulling out of Paris climate agreement kills U.S. leadership

For 70 years America has led Europe and the free world. Not anymore.

President Trump and EPA Director Scott Pruitt at the White House on June 1, 2017.

If Russia’s goal in meddling with our 2016 election in order to support the election of Donald Trump was to isolate the U.S. from the rest of the international community of nations and to weaken the NATO alliance standing in the way of Russia’s ambitions to recover parts of eastern Europe that it had “lost” after the collapse of the Soviet Union, then it has succeeded beyond its wildest imagination.

Every one of the U.S’s allies and trading partners has signed onto the Paris climate agreementour news is not capitalizing it, which has the goal of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and slow the alarming rise in global temperatures. There are now 194 countries that have joined the agreement, with only two holdouts (Syria and Nicaragua).

The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the agreement, not only jeopardizes this historic effort to address the serious perils of climate change, but it marks the death knell of America’s position for the past 70 years as the leader of the free world.

Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has — with limited exceptions — provided the leadership as well as the economic and military might to ensure that global and regional alliances promoting peace and stability can work effectively. In 1945, the international conference establishing the United Nations was sponsored by the U.S. in San Francisco, and it has been headquartered in New York City since then. The World Bank and the IMF are headquartered in Washington, D.C., and have helped contribute to global economic and financial stability for decades. In Western Europe, U.S. leadership of the NATO alliance has kept the peace in Europe and deterred the Soviet Union and its Communist allies from engulfing our democratic allies in Western Europe.

When George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of the Kyoto Protocol — an international treaty acknowledging that global warming exists and that that human-made CO2 emissions have caused it — the U.S.’s standing in the world was severely damaged and took years to repair. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has recently acknowledged that the international and diplomatic “blowback” from this last attempt by a Republican administration to undermine international efforts to combat climate change was far greater than anticipated.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

A similar blunder by the Trump administration with regard to the Paris accord would be likely to have even more severe consequences, given the fact that our allies are already questioning the U.S.’s willingness and ability to lead the Western democratic alliance. The Trump White House has already caused consternation among our NATO allies by raising doubts as to whether the U.S. can continue to be relied upon to come to the defense of another NATO country that is attacked, and his suggestion that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese has made us the laughing stock of the rest of the world. Trump also could not resist picking a fight with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over trade and other issues during his recent overseas trip, and his ham-handed attempt to shoveelbow another leader out of the way during a photo-op did little to repair the damage that he has already caused to our standing among our European allies. Merkel has already started publicly talking about the necessity for Europe to forge its own destiny without the U.S., and this kind of thinking will only accelerate if the U.S. pulls out of the Paris accord.

ClimateÊchangeÊcould foul up precipitation
By Doyle Rice, @usatodayweather, USA TODAY
Last month alone,ÊclimateÊchangeÊwas blamed for sleepless nights and trees moving west. Now there's a new problem: weird rainfall.
A study in the journalÊScience AdvancesÊsuggestsÊclimateÊchangeÊwill alter where rain falls around the world, making wet areas wetter and dry areas drier, especially in the summer.
The world's rainiest areas may push north during the winter, said study lead author Aaron Putnam, a glacial geologist at theÊUniversity of Maine. The redistribution of rainfall is worrisome, he said, as it would affect water availability for people around the world.
The shift isn't unprecedented: It's happened before, but that was because of naturalÊclimateÊchange.
Researchers studied ancientÊclimateÊhistory to see how a warmingÊclimateÊchanged rainfall patterns. About 14,600 years ago, a shift in temperature changed where precipitation fell over the entire planet, much like the predicted effect of man-made global warming over the next few decades.
Global warming occurs when heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, which boosts world temperatures to levels that scientists say cannot be explained by natural factors.
The study ""adds to the large body of evidence thatÊclimateÊchangeÊis going to mess with the large-scale motions of air and water in the atmosphere,""ÊNASAÊclimateÊscientist Kate Marvel, who wasn't involved with the study, told Wisconsin'sÊBeloit Daily NewsÊ. ""And this matters, because those patterns largely determine where it's rainy or arid, broadly speaking,""
According toÊNASA, rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's water cycle, increasing evaporation. This increased evaporation will result in more storms but also contribute to drying over some land areas.
As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and increased risk of flooding, while areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Trump's Paris pullout endangers the planet
Decades from now -- if sea levels continue rising, polar ice caps keep melting and weather patterns grow ever more extreme -- people might well look back at the spring of 2017 as a key turning point in the failed effort to stave off catastrophic, human-inducedÊclimateÊchange.
President Trump's decision Thursday to withdraw the United States, the world's second largest emitter of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, from the ParisÊclimateÊagreement deals a body blow to one of the best hopes for slowing a ruinous rise in global temperatures.
By breaking ranks with nearly 200 nations, the United States joins only Syria (which is riven by civil war) and Nicaragua (which thinks the Paris agreement isn't ambitious enough) as the odd countries out. The Trump administration's action abdicates America's moral leadership and makes it easier for other nations to renege on their own pledges to curb greenhouse-gas emissions.
In making his reckless decision, Trump defied the advice of the world's leadingÊclimateÊscientists. Of Pope Francis and other religious leaders. Of the leaders of the seven wealthiest democracies. Of major corporations, including Chevron,ÊGoogle,ÊFacebookandÊApple. Of members of his own inner circle, including son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka. Of his own secretary of State, a former ExxonMobil CEO.
And Trump ignored the wishes of most Americans, seven out of 10 of whom favor the Paris agreement.
But the president -- prodded by chief strategist Steve Bannon,ÊEnvironmental Protection AgencyÊadministrator Scott Pruitt and coal-stateÊRepublicansÊin Congress -- thinks he knows better. At Thursday's Rose Garden announcement, Trump argued that the 2015 agreement ""handicaps the United States economy,"" even though there is no binding deal, only voluntary pledges by each nation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He expressed concern about job-killing restrictions. Yet the Paris accord restricts nothing. Instead, it relies on peer pressure and transparency to limit global warming to a more tolerable level. Trump could have revisedÊPresident Obama's pledges without ending U.S. participation.
Trump made a nod toward renegotiating the Paris agreement, or crafting an entirely new pact that would be ""fair"" to the United States. But it's hard to imagine other nations rushing back to the bargaining table after Trump walked away from an agreement that grew out of decades of arduousÊclimateÊtalks.
Other governments, notably in theÊEuropean UnionÊand China, vow to forge ahead developing the clean-energy technologies that will be the drivers of economic growth in the 21st century. But global warming is a problem that requires a global solution. The margin for tilting the planet away from catastrophicÊclimateÊchangeÊin the future is slim, and no matter the slack picked up by other nations in the absence of U.S. leadership, it might not be enough.
The 45th president dreams of a legacy where America is great again. There was no greatness in the decision he rendered Thursday, just the heightened prospect of aÊclimate-stricken globe left behind for future generations.

Disease collides with changing climates
By Mark Johnson, and Ryan Patterson, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
Two years of drought had been hard on Valdemar Braun and his three grown sons. They lived in the hilly, picturesque village of So Joo Pequeno, and when the rains quit, the coffee would not grow. The farmers were forced to sell some of their cows.
Then at last the showers returned, and 2017 dawned full of promise for the plantations.
Valdemar had given each son twoÊalqueiresÊof land (almost 11acres). In mid-January, one son helped another clear out forest to plant more coffee.
The portion of forest belonged to Edson Braun, who had recently divorced. He wanted to transfer the land to his ex-wife so she could provide for their daughters. His brother, Virlei, agreed to help.
Virlei, 30, with pale blue eyes and a handsome face, had his own family to provide for: a wife and toddler son. On the day he went to help his brother, Virlei had worked on the farm for 14 straight days. Never in his life had he been to a doctor.
That day in the forest, relatives believe, a mosquito bit Virlei.
In just 10 days, he would die, doctors desperately trying to lower his fever by packing his abdomen in ice, his mother crying out, ""God, don't take my son. Don't take my son.""
""Go back home and help raise my child,"" Virlei told her. ""I've already put myself in the hands of God.""
Brazil, hit hard by the Zika virus in 2015 and 2016, is once again in the throes of a devastating mosquito-borne disease.
The illness that killed Virlei and has claimed at least 263 other Brazilians is yellow fever, a virus that can cause victims to vomit blood, suffer liver damage and descend into organ failure and coma. In some of Brazil's forests, the virus recurs every six or seven years.
The current outbreak is the nation's worst on record; yellow fever deaths in the first four months of 2017 already exceeded all those from 1989 through 2008.
At the epicenter is a group of states that had just recovered from their worst droughts in 80 years. This intersection of drought and disease raises a complex and troubling question for scientists:
Is our changingÊclimateÊcontributing to flare-ups of infectious diseases?
""Yes, this is a factor that is present in our modeling,"" says Mrcia Chame, a researcher who has been examining the outbreak for the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro.
ButÊclimateÊalone cannot account for Brazil's latest bout with yellow fever, says Chame, coordinator of the foundation's biodiversity research unit. Other contributors include the clearing of forests for farms and plantations, which brings humans into areas thick with mosquitoes; the grinding rural poverty that makes insect repellent a luxury for many villagers; and the reluctance of many Brazilians to receive the yellow fever vaccine.
Still, it is clear that the recentÊclimateÊin the areas most affected by yellow fever -- severe drought followed by rainfall -- benefits the forest mosquitoes. Their eggs can survive dry weather in a state of suspended animation ""for years and years,"" says Michael Osterholm, co-author of the new bookÊDeadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer GermsÊ.
When rains do come, they unleash several years' worth of mosquito offspring. Whether this outbreak is linked toÊclimateÊchangeÊ""is unclear,"" Osterholm says. ""It wouldn't surprise me, but I don't think we can say that.""
So far, yellow fever has been confined to rural, wooded areas, mostly in four states on Brazil's eastern flank: Minas Gerais, Esprito Santo, So Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. But the virus already has spread much farther than in previous outbreaks, raising an unsettling possibility.
""If this thing takes off in the urban areas of Brazil, we're in big trouble,"" says Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at theÊUniversity of Minnesota.
Experts say it is unlikely the U.S. will see a comparable outbreak of yellow fever, in part because air conditioning and window screens are commonplace. The U.S. has not experienced an outbreak of yellow fever in more than a century; the 1905 epidemic in New Orleans that killed more than 430 people was the last. Yet the past 20 years have seen the appearance or reappearance of several other mosquito-borne diseases:
** In 1999, it was West Nile virus, which arrived in the U.S. in New York and has since spread through almost the entire country.
** In 2001, it was dengue fever, thought to have been eliminated from the U.S. 30 years earlier. Hawaii, Texas and Florida have all reported outbreaks of dengue, a virus that produces flu-like symptoms but can lead to severe illness and death.
** Last year, it was the Zika virus making its first appearance in the U.S. in South Florida and Brownsville, Texas, a port city on the Mexican border.
Osterholm notes one parallel between Brazil's latest bout with yellow fever and the appearance of West Nile virus in New York: ""In 1999, when West Nile virus broke in the U.S., lack of rainfall favored the mosquito.""
There is another parallel.
With West Nile, animals fell sick before humans did. Tracey McNamara, head pathologist at theÊBronx ZooÊat the time, noticed crows dropping dead in and around the zoo. Soon afterward, doctors began seeing patients with symptoms resembling encephalitis, including fever, dizziness and fatigue.
In Brazil, monkeys served as sentinels for the latest outbreak of yellow fever. In April 2016 -- eight months before any people became sick -- a single monkey was found dead on a farm in Montes Claros, about 530 miles north of Rio de Janeiro.
Even in areas where monkeys are plentiful, it is unusual to find one dead. Their bodies generally decompose quickly or are consumed by scavengers.
In this case, health officials came to Montes Claros to collect the monkey's remains for testing. Waldney P. Martins, a professor at Universidade Estadual de Montes Claros who studies monkeys, says it took four months to determine the cause of death: Yellow fever.
Frightening signals
Jos Luis Machado, housekeeper for Fazenda Macacos, the ""Farm of Monkeys,"" was born just 2miles away in the village of Itapina, about 400 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
He has been there so long, he says, that he feels like part of the forest, much like the howler monkeys he used to watch feasting on mango leaves. A group of eight to 10 monkeys were permanent residents. They clambered through the trees. Sometimes their shouts could be heard clear across the Rio Doce, or Sweet River, a mile away.
""This was full of monkeys,"" Machado says, staring at a hollow of empty trees. Like many of the Brazilians interviewed for this story, he speaks through an interpreter.
""They were very happy,"" he says. ""They make the house happy, too.""
But on this morning in early April, the house and forest are quiet.
The property's owner found the first dead monkey on the last day of 2016. Soon after, Machado watched other monkeys fall ill.
""When they were already very sick,"" he says, ""they would fall down from the tree and die on the (forest) floor.""
Back east in So Joo Pequeno, Valdemar Braun also had been wondering about the monkey population. Two dozen or so used to come right onto his covered porch to eat juicy guava.
""They have all disappeared,"" he says.
Although he cannot remember precisely, he believes the monkeys vanished around the end of last year, before his son Virlei grew ill and died.
Insects hold the key
The idea thatÊclimateÊand disease are related dates back at least 2,000 years to the Greek physician Hippocrates. He wrote:
""Whoever wishes to investigate medicine properly should proceed thus: in the first place to consider the seasons of the year and what effects each of them produces. É Then the winds, the hot and the cold, especially such as are common to all countries, and then such as are peculiar to each locality.""
For some of the most serious diseases, including yellow fever, it is not so much the effect ofÊclimateÊon humans that matters; it is the effect on insects.
""There are some people that argue that global warming's greatest threat may also be the smallest, and, of course what we're thinking about are insect-borne diseases,"" says Jonathan Patz, director of the Global Health Institute at theÊUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison.
""And we all know that insects are cold-blooded, unlike us, and when the temperature changes a little bit, their body temperature changes with it.""
Decades of research has established that Aedes aegypti, a species of mosquito that carries yellow fever, Zika, dengue and chikungunya, thrives in warmer climates. The mosquitoes are more active, reproduce more frequently and enjoy a longer breeding season, though there's a catch. If theÊclimateÊbecomes too hot and dry, it can shorten their lifespan.
Mosquitoes that transmit West Nile virus show a similar sensitivity.
""Every degree above 70 degrees exponentially expands the mosquito's ability to transmit West Nile virus,"" says McNamara, the formerÊBronx ZooÊofficial and now a professor of pathology at Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, Calif.
""Forget the cockroach inheriting the Earth. It's going to be the mosquito.""
Already, warmer temperatures have helped mosquitoes settle into new regions. Aedes albopictus, another of the mosquitoes that carries the viral diseases dengue and chikungunya, ""has undergone a dramatic global expansion facilitated by human activities,"" according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Found originally in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia, Aedes albopictus, commonly known as the Asian tiger mosquito, has spread into Europe, the Middle East, Africa and North and South America -- largely in the past 30 years. The mosquito, first discovered in the United States in Houston in the mid-1980s, has since spread to 37 states.
Researchers believe the Asian tiger mosquito's rapid advance has been fueled by international transport of old tires and bamboo, objects that retain water, which makes them ideal places for mosquitoes to lay eggs.
Once carried overseas, however, the mosquitoes find the warmingÊclimateÊto their liking. In a 2013 paper in the journalÊPLOS ONEÊ, researchers said the Asian tiger mosquito ""is poised to significantly expand its range in the northeastern United States in the next few decades primarily due to warming winter temperatures.""
Where the mosquitoes migrate, disease often follows.
But few scientists, if any, attribute the spread of such diseases toÊclimateÊchangeÊalone.
Studies suggest other likely factors include global reductions in pesticide use and massive increases in waste plastics, such as bags, suitable for breeding by mosquitoes. In a larger sense, the growth and spread of the world's population into rural areas is undoubtedly bringing more humans onto the turf of mosquitoes, ticks and other parasites and insects.

ZuckerbergÊgives grads a mission
By Jessica Guynn, @jguynn, USA TODAY
Mark Zuckerberg,ÊHarvard's most famous dropout, returned to the leafy college campus he left behind nearly 12 years ago forÊFacebookÊto make an urgent appeal to his generation, Millennial to Millennial: Don't just seek out your own sense of purpose. Create a world in which everyone can.
""To keep our society moving forward, we have a generational challenge -- to not only create new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose,""ÊZuckerbergÊtoldÊHarvardÊgraduates Thursday. ""It's not enough to have purpose yourself. You also have to create a sense of purpose for others.""
The commencement address, for which he prepared for weeks, was delivered in a pouring rain. It nodded to growing disillusionment by everyday Americans who have watched the gains of the economic recovery pass them by.
""When our parents graduated, purpose reliably came from your job, your church, your community,""ÊZuckerbergÊsaid. ""But today, technology and automation are eliminating many jobs. Membership in communities is declining. Many people feel disconnected and depressed and are trying to fill a void.
""As I've traveled around, I've sat with children in juvenile detention, and opioid addicts who told me their lives could have turned out differently if they just had something to do, an after-school program or somewhere to go. I've met factory workers who know their old jobs aren't coming back and are trying to find their place.""
The remarks, delivered in suit and tie, not his customary gray T-shirt and jeans and at a podium without a teleprompter, focused heavily on harnessing this generation's entrepreneurial spirit to push for big ideas and big projects, equal economic opportunity for all and a global community that crosses borders and ideologies.
That's an idea, the power of entrepreneurship and innovation toÊchangeÊlives, that's deeply personal for the 33-year-oldÊFacebookfounder and chief executive who has pledged to give away most of his wealth in his lifetime to address some of the most pressing problems of the planet, fromÊclimateÊchangeÊand curing diseases to income inequality and criminal justice reform, while running the multibillion-dollar corporation he started in his college dorm room.
While he denies he's aiming for a stint in politics or for the West Wing, and he takes great pains to avoid the appearance of partisanship,ÊZuckerbergÊwas clearly sending a political message, not just to the sea of graduates gathered in cap and gown in Cambridge, Mass., but to the much larger audience that tuned into the livestream on hisÊFacebookÊpage.
And that message, which included a call for affordable health care and child care, immigrant rights, personalized education, sharing our genomes to advance scientific research, allowing everyone to vote online and testing out new concepts such as universal basic income, will undoubtedly again raise questions about his political ambitions.
The commencement address is the latest illustration of the hybrid roleÊZuckerbergÊis carving out for himself in public life, not just as a leader of a global company but as a global voice whose influence is being felt beyond Silicon Valley in the spheres of politics and the economy. That's much like the political entrepreneurs and philanthropic chieftains from the tech world who came before him such as Dave Packard and Bill Gates, says Margaret O'Mara, professor of history at theÊUniversity of Washington.
ZuckerbergÊthis year has embarked on a multistate tour to put him back in touch with Americans andÊFacebookÊusers at the farm dinner table,ÊNASCARÊtrack and on the factory floor, worlds from which he has been isolated since moving to Silicon Valley, if not before.
""Mark ZuckerbergÊis a face and voice of the Millennial generation that expresses and acts upon a very strong sense of social consciousness,"" O'Mara said. ""He's both a product of history and someone who's reflecting a current moment.""
There were moments of levity in his commencement address.ÊZuckerbergÊjoked: ""If I get through this speech today, it will be the first time I actually finish something atÊHarvard.""
And the delivery did not come without a couple of pratfalls. That morning the student newspaper's website was hacked to troll theÊFacebookÊCEO. Then whenÊFacebookÊstreamed the commencement address live, the captions provided byÊHarvardÊwere gibberish.
But the bulk of the address revolved around three challengesÊZuckerbergÊthrew down toÊHarvardÊgraduates:
** Give everyone ""the cushion"" they need to try new things.
""Today we have a level of wealth inequality that hurts everyone. When you don't have the freedom to take your idea and turn it into a historic enterprise, we all lose,"" he said.
ZuckerbergÊowned up to his privilege as a white, upwardly mobile suburban kid who could drop out ofÊHarvardÊto pursue a start-up idea in Silicon Valley.
""If I had to support my family growing up instead of having the time to learn how to code, if I didn't know I'd be fine ifÊFacebookdidn't work out, then I wouldn't be standing up here today. If we're honest, we all know how much luck we've had to get to this point in our lives,"" he said.
""Every generation expands its definition of equality. Previous generations fought for the vote and civil rights. They had the New Deal and Great Society, and now it's time for our generation to define a new social contract.
""And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue purpose isn't going to be free. People like me should pay for it. A lot of you are going to do well, and you should, too.""
** Take on ""generating defining"" projects, the Millennial version of putting a man on the moon, eradicating polio or building the Hoover Dam.
""These projects didn't just provide purpose for the people doing those jobs, they gave our whole country a sense of pride that we could do great things,"" he said.
** Build a global community. ""When our generation says 'everyone,' we mean everyone in the world,""ÊZuckerbergÊsaid, returning to his theme of the forces of freedom, openness and community fighting the forces of authoritarianism, isolationism and nationalism.

ShiftingÊclimateÊthins tree cover in East
By Doyle Rice, @usatodayweather, USA TODAY
It's getting so hot that even the trees are heading north.
Man-madeÊclimateÊchangeÊ-- including warmer temperatures and deviations in rainfall patterns -- appears to be one of the reasons tree populations in the eastern USA are shifting north and, more surprisingly, west, according to new research.
The shift could lead to the extinction of certain trees in select forests, the study said.
Overall, the changingÊclimateÊhas pushed trees an average of 20 miles north and 25 miles west over the past 30 years. Though the northern shift was expected because of warming temperatures, researchers said the more surprising westward movement could be the result of aÊchangeÊin rainfall patterns.
When researchers analyzed the impact ofÊclimateÊchange, they found precipitation had a stronger impact on forests in the short term than temperatures, said lead author Songlin Fei ofÊPurdue University.
The eastern USA has gotten warmer over the past few decades, and the Southeast has trended drier.
Fei said deciduous trees such as oak and maple primarily move west, and evergreens move north. Trees don't actually move, of course, but where they sprout canÊchange. Saplings can expand into a region while older growth dies in another,ÊThe Atlanticreported.
One of the more striking examples is the scarlet oak, which in nearly three decades has moved more than 127 miles northwest from the Appalachians, Fei told theÊAssociated Press. Its population is reduced in the Southeast and more pronounced in the Midwest.
Brent Sohngen ofÊOhio State University, who was not involved in the study, told the AP the findings show ""there is no doubt some signature ofÊclimateÊchange.""
The research, which studied 86 species of trees and was based on data gathered by the U.S. Forest Service, was published in the journalÊScience AdvancesÊ.

Study: Tornado havoc to triple in coming decades
By Doyle Rice, @usatodayweather, USA TODAY
The number of deaths and damaged or destroyed homes caused by tornadoes in the U.S. could triple by the end of the century, and man-madeÊclimateÊchangeÊmay not be entirely to blame.
Instead, the culprit is population increase and urban sprawl, according to a new study. Simply put, there will be more homes -- and people -- in the path of tornadoes.
We're already well on our way: In the past several decades, development in the 48 contiguous states more than quadrupled, said study lead author Stephen Strader of Villanova University's Department of Geography and the Environment.
""Disasters are socially constructed,"" he said. We're ""building ourselves into disasters.""
Residents in tornado-prone regions should be more concerned with the construction quality of their homes than possible impactsÊclimateÊchangeÊcould bring, such as an increase in the number or intensity of twisters, neither of which have been concretely forecast, Strader said. To minimize the risk, homeowners and businesses should look at building storm shelters or safe rooms, he added.
Violent and deadly tornado outbreaks are a serious threat each year across the U.S., the most tornado-prone nation on Earth. So far this decade, the U.S. has endured 46 separate severe storm and tornado outbreaks that each caused more than $1 billion in damage, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
Tornado expert Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory, who was not involved in the study, said the research methodology and findings are sound.
""One of the things I really liked about it was its realistic look at the future exposure of human beings to tornadoes,"" he said.
Already this year, twisters have killed dozens of people in the U.S. In addition, nearly 700 tornadoes have been reported, more than 100 above average, the Storm Prediction Center reported.
In upcoming decades, the increasing number of homes, structures and developed land in tornado-prone regions such as the Southeast, Midwest and Plains will be at greatest risk, especially sprawling metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and St. Louis. Deaths are most likely in the Southeast because of it large suburban footprint, Strader said.
The study appeared in the peer-reviewed journalÊClimaticÊChange.

Another day, another march. Then what?
By Josh Rivera, USA TODAY
Living here, I see national landmarks so often that I'm annoyed when people ask me to take them to the Lincoln Memorial. It also desensitizes me to every march, protest or strike of the day. Two weeks ago it was the March for Science, last week it was The Great March forÊClimateÊChange, and this weekend it will be The Immigrants' March.
But a strike in my hometown of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Monday did hit this cynical Washingtonian. After Puerto Rico's debt ballooned to a point of no return, the island's finances were handed over to an oversight board created by Congress last year. Much like the case with President Trump in the mainland, recommendations, changes and appointments are starting to have an impact on the island's economy and its people's bottom line.
Although I repudiate the violence that took place at the march in Puerto Rico's financial district, it's understandable -- not to mention convenient for those who wanted to undermine the protest.
Therein lies the problem. Marches are a frail tactic to raise awareness. A broken window or tear gas thrown and the message loses all meaning.
Take the Women's March here. There's no beating more than 2 million attendees. But what did it accomplish other than show discontent? Do marches produce tangible results anymore? Some might still believe that. The March for Science on April 22 is credited for a $2 billion boost for medical research at theÊNational Institutes of Health. But let's be honest, the march would have been little more than a nice gesture had people not testified before Congress, or run campaign ads directed at lawmakers.
I went to a liberal college in Rio Piedras, and we were known as the ""strikers."" During my four years, none of the almost yearly strikes stopped tuition hikes or funding cuts. At a student assembly when they were voting for yet another strike, I spoke up: ""What's the point? We're known for doing strikes. From an outside perspective, this just looks like a bunch of whining college kids.""
And that still holds true. One more protest in Puerto Rico or Washington is the equivalent of Cher announcing another last tour. March, by all means, but civic engagement, more specifically grassroots lobbying, is the most powerful tactic citizens have. As someone who reads emails and letters from readers every day, I can assure you: If I receive more than three comments on the same issue, I'm paying attention.
Why do you think the One Million Moms group can get TV shows to drop sponsors they deem inappropriate or get them canceled altogether? Because their efforts don't end with a march, they start with one. From there you create contacts, build coalitions and activate people.
I'm not suggesting ridiculous protests like threatening a boycott because the Disney channel aired a gay kiss. How about trying to prevent the reauthorization of theÊExport-Import Bank, or pushing for an audit of Puerto Rico's debt? There's so much that's important -- and can't get done with just a march.

Donald Trump can strengthen America by dumping Paris agreement: Sen. Inhofe
James M. Inhofe, Opinion contributor
U.S. energy industry needs room to grow without environmental roadblocks

President Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt.

In light of his recent travels abroad and ensuing affirmations of America’s partnership moving forward, President Trump is now set to make a decision as to whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.

The Paris Agreement was a false promise from the start, committing the United States to an unattainable 26-28% reduction by 2025. This commitment, and remaining in the Paris Agreement, not only threatens Trump’s goals abroad, but it threatens our energy producers at home as well.

Remaining in the Paris Agreement could force the Trump administration to unnecessarily regulate greenhouse gases, in turn limiting his and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s ability to rescind the Clean Power Plan.

This is because the United States is required under Section 115 of the Clean Air Act to take regulatory action in order to limit any international pollutant after two tests are met. First, a finding must establish that a pollutant from the United States is endangering the public health or welfare of another country; and second, the endangered country gives the United States reciprocal rights to prevent or control pollution from them in turn.

Environmentalists believe that the Paris Agreement meets that reciprocal test.

Absent withdrawal from the agreement, these environmental extremists will have a heyday working to block the rollback of the Clean Power Plan or even to compel further regulation under Section 115. If we stay in the Paris Agreement, we can rest assured Democrats will use every legal tool available to keep greenhouse gas regulations in place — and they could be successful.

This is not a secret. David Bookbinder, formerly chief counsel of the Sierra Club, stated that together the Paris Agreement and Section 115 are the “silver bullet de jour of the enviros.” And their intent to use it is real. New York and Vermont Attorneys General recently wrote to their colleagues “states must still play a critical role in ensuring that the promises made in Paris become a reality.”

Further, by pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump is further demonstrating his prioritization of American energy dominance. We must do everything in our power to advance the development of domestic energy to lead the world away from dependence on energy-rich regimes like Iran and Russia.

Since electing Trump, U.S. exports of natural gas and oil are up 32%59% and 9.2%19%, respectively. p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} span.s1 {font-kerning: none} natural gas up 32% ( 32,976 to 43,553 ) and oil up 9.2% ( 5,392 to 5,886 )As each shipment reaches the banks of Europe and Asia, the oppressive grips of Putin and the Ayatollah on our closest friends lighten. Our abundance is a competitive advantage that we can share freely with our allies.

Remaining in the Paris Agreement could hinder Trump’s energy dominance agenda. This risk is not worth taking.

Trump's budget proposal 'savages' climate research, scientists say
Doyle Rice and Ledyard King, USA TODAY
Climate science takes a major hit in President Trump's proposed 2018 federal budget.

Entrepreneurs, there are plenty of ways to encourage your team to go green. This July 1969 photo taken by the crew of Apollo 11 shows the Earth rising above the moon's horizon.

WASHINGTON — Scientists poring over President Trump's proposed 2018 federal budget say it guts funding for climate science.

Under the proposal, the three federal agencies that perform the bulk of that research face dramatic cuts.

David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council said the budget ""savages"" the agencies' programs, noting dramatic slashes in funding at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the proposal would ""stall out U.S. technological innovation and scientific research, and the country’s capabilities to respond to extreme weather and national security threats.""

NASA's Earth science mission faces cuts of 8.7%, according to Chris McEntee, executive director of the American Geophysical Union. Overall, there is a 45% cut in research in the EPA budget, the NRDC said. And NOAA faces a 16% reduction. Cuts were also proposed to the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Energy.

Trump's Office of Management and Budget defended the cuts at a media briefing in Washington, D.C., Tuesday morning: “What I think you saw happen during the previous administration is the pendulum went too far to one side, where we’re spending too much of your money on climate change and not very efficiently,"" said OMB director Mick Mulvaney.

""We don’t get rid of it here,"" he said. ""Do we target it? Sure. Do a lot of the EPA reductions aim at reducing the focus on climate science? Yes. Does it mean that we are anti-science? Absolutely not. We simply try to get things back in order so we can look at the folks who pay the taxes and say: ‘look, yeah we want to do some climate science but we’re not going to do some of the crazy stuff the previous administration did.' ”

Both Republicans and Democrats have raised concerns about various parts of the budget plan and have indicated they are not using the president’s request as the starting point for drafting a spending bill for next year.

The elimination of five NASA Earth science space missions ""were not identified as high priority,"" according to the budget. Those missions have yielded safeguards to avoid eating toxic shellfish, reduce aviation disruptions and take precautions for unhealthy air quality, to name a few, the Union of Concerned Scientists said. NASA has instructions to ""stop looking at Earth and only focus on other planets,"" Doniger said.

The EPA's program that reports on greenhouse gas levels drops from $95.3 million to $13.6 million, according to the budget. Carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases that are most responsible for global warming.

“This is a budget declaring war on climate change,"" said Elgie Holstein of the Environmental Defense Fund. ""It’s not a particular surprise though it’s deeply disappointing and (with rollback of Clean Power Plan) an abdication of American leadership on climate.""

In addition to its 16% overall reduction, NOAA faces deeper cuts to climate and other research programs, McEntee said. The agency provides weather and climate data that protects more than half of all American who live along the coasts, over 2.8 million jobs in ocean reliant industries and coastal property valued in excess of $10 trillion.

""We are concerned that the administration's proposed cuts to research into the Earth system sciences will undermine the continued scientific progress that is so vitally needed to better protect the nation in the future from costly natural disasters,"" the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) said in a statement.

Last year, the nation endured a whopping 15 separate disasters that each cost at least $1 billion in damages, including tornadoes, drought, and widespread flooding, UCAR said.

Enacting the budget would bring serious repercussions for the U.S. economy and national security and to the ability to protect life and property, UCAR said. ""Such funding cuts would be especially unfortunate at a time when the nation is moving to regain its position as the world leader in weather forecasting.""

McIntee said: ""The President’s FY18 proposal instead charts a course of destructive under-funding for scientific agencies that stimulate the economy, protect public safety, and keep our nation safe and secure.""

Treat climate change symptoms and don't worry about the cause
Bruce Bartlett, Opinion contributor
Trump infrastructure and tax plans should include flood control and a carbon tax.

Protesters in Washington on April 29, 2017.

For the vast majority of scientists, global warming is a fact. Not so for many conservatives and Republicans, who believe it is a ruse to impose new taxes and regulations on the economy.

“The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive,” President Trump said in a 2012 tweet. Environmental Protection Administrator Scott Pruitt denies that carbon dioxide is a cause of global warming. And The New York Times has lately come under fire for hiring columnist Bret Stephens, who kicked off his tenure by writing that projections of rising global temperatures are too uncertain to guide policy.

It is highly doubtful that those concerned about the threat of global warming are going to change conservative minds any time soon. Given the political reality that Republicans control Congress and the White House, what to do?

Sometimes doctors have a patient who is sick from an unknown disease. Rather than do nothing, they treat the symptoms, which often is enough to cure the disease or at least keep the patient alive until the disease can be properly diagnosed.

I think a similar strategy should apply to climate change. We know two things about its symptoms — rising ocean levels and intense storms, see extreme events both of which will cause flooding in low-lying areas.  p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 15.0px Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000} span.s1 {font-kerning: none}

It is beyond dispute that sea levels are rising. According to the National Ocean Service, a government agency, the global sea level was 2.6 inches higher in 2014 than it was in 1993 and is rising about one-eighth of an inch per year.

We also know exactly where flooding is going to occur if sea levels continue to rise. Basically, it’s where there already is flooding during big storms; it will just continue to get worse.

Dealing with flooding is something we know how to do. Among other things, we need to build sea walls, tide-gates and better drainage, and start moving people away from areas prone to flooding.

All of this will be expensive. But Trump has said that he is in favor of a national public infrastructure program. Making flood control a key element would go a long way toward dealing with the effects of climate change.

Given the cost of this program, it needs to be financed and not just put on the national credit card. A carbon tax would provide the revenue while at the same time reducing what most scientists believe is the principal cause of global warming.

Since a broad-based carbon tax is essentially a consumption tax, the type of tax Republicans support, it might also provide revenue for various tax reforms that would reduce the cost of capital and provide incentives for investment.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

A policy that focuses on the impact of rising sea levels, building infrastructure that is needed regardless of its cause, and can be financed conservatively — that is a compromise everyone should be able to live with. Republicans don’t have to accept that global warming is real as long as they don’t deny that sea levels are rising. And Democrats get actions to deal with the consequences of climate change, even if the causes are inadequately addressed.

If we are very lucky, the rapid transition to solar energy may reduce carbon emissions enough to stabilize global temperatures without onerous taxes or regulations that are, in any event, politically impossible at the moment.

Addressing symptoms while sidestepping causes will not satisfy the Al Gores of the world. But it might get us moving on concrete actions to deal with the consequences of global warming. We will need them no matter what.

Federal court grants Trump administration delay in clean power case
Richard Wolf, USA TODAY
Environmental officials now oppose the Obama administration's initiative to clean the air.

A federal appeals court on Friday delayed action on the Obama administration's major limits on power plant emissions at the request of the Trump administration.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration's most ambitious environmental initiatives took a procedural hit in court Friday as the Trump administration fights to undo them.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit put two clean air cases on hold for 60 days at the new administration's request, giving the Environmental Protection Agency more time to devise alternative plans favorable to coal-producing states and industries. The original plans would set new standards for existing as well as new or modified power plants.

The move by the nation's second-most powerful court, now dominated by Democratic appointees, represented an acknowledgment that the government's position has changed. It asked both sides to weigh in by May 15 on whether the matter should be sent back to the EPA, which would end the cases.

“The court recognized the landscape has changed and that a decision on the merits is not appropriate at this time,"" said West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a leader among the many opponents of Obama's plan. “We appreciate the Trump administration's willingness to review the devastating impact of the so-called Clean Power Plan, and further appreciate the court giving due time to hear the new administration's take on this unlawful regulation.""

The Clean Power Plan is a cornerstone of Obama's climate change initiative, now incorporated into the United Nations climate agreement. It aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32% from 2005 levels over the next 15 years by requiring some coal-fired plants to shut down or invest in natural gas, wind or solar power. Opponents say the reductions are not achievable and will cost thousands of jobs.

So important is the initiative that the entire appeals court devoted seven hours last September to hearing from 16 lawyers involved in the case, rather than send it to a three-judge panel. The court's decision has been widely anticipated for months.

The appeals court refused to block the Clean Power Plan in January 2016 while states and industry coalitions were mounting their appeal. But the Supreme Court issued a stay in one of Justice Antonin Scalia's last rulings before his death the following month. The other rules for new or modified power plants remain in effect for now.

Consumer and environmental groups decried the delay approved Friday. “This decision clears the way for the White House to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, a move that will cost consumers more in the long run, in the form of higher energy and health care bills,"" said Shannon Baker-Branstetter, policy counsel for Consumers Union.

""We are in a race against time to address the climate crisis,"" said Vickie Patton, general counsel at the Environmental Defense Fund. ""Climate progress and clean energy cannot be stopped by the litigation tactics of polluters."""

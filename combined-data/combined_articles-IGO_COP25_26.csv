Summary for Policymakers
Summary for Policymakers
Introduction
This Report responds to the invitation for IPCC '... to provide a Special Report in 2018 on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways' contained in the Decision of the 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to adopt the Paris Agreement.1
The IPCC accepted the invitation in April 2016, deciding to prepare this Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents the key findings of the Special Report, based on the assessment of the available scientific, technical and socio-economic literature2 relevant to global warming of 1.5°C and for the comparison between global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using the IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter elements. In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report.
A. Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C1
A. 1 Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming2 above pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C. Global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.1) {1.2}
A.1.1 Reflecting the long-term warming trend since pre-industrial times, observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) for the decade 2006-2015 was 0.87°C (likely between 0.75°C and 0.99°C)6 higher than the average over the 1850-1900 period (very high confidence). Estimated anthropogenic global warming matches the level of observed warming to within ±20% (likely range). Estimated anthropogenic global warming is currently increasing at 0.2°C (likely between 0.1 °C and 0.3°C) per decade due to past and ongoing emissions (high confidence). {1.2.1, Table 1.1,1.2.4}
A.1.2 Warming greater than the global annual average is being experienced in many land regions and seasons, including two to three times higher in the Arctic. Warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean, (high confidence) {1.2.1,1.2.2, Figure 1.1, Figure 1.3,3.3.1,3.3.2}
A.1.3 Trends in intensity and frequency of some climate and weather extremes have been detected over time spans during which about 0.5°C of global warming occurred (medium confidence). This assessment is based on several lines of evidence, including attribution studies for changes in extremes since 1950. {3.3.1,3.3.2,3.3.3}
1 Decision 1/CP.21, paragraph 21.
2 The assessment covers literature accepted for publication by 15 May 2018.
3 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99-100% probability, very likely 90-100%, likely 66-100%, about as likely as not 33-66%, unlikely 0-33%, very unlikely 0-10%, exceptionally unlikely 0-1 %. Additional terms (extremely likely 95-100%, more likely than not >50-100%, more unlikely than likely 0-<50%, extremely unlikely 0-5%) may also be used when appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5.

5 Present level of global warming is defined as the average of a 30-year period centred on 2017 assuming the recent rate of warming continues.
6 This range spans the four available peer-reviewed estimates of the observed GMST change and also accounts for additional uncertainty due to possible short-term natural variability. {1.2.1,Table 1.1}

A. 2 Warming from anthropogenic emissions from the pre-industrial period to the present will persist for centuries to millennia and will continue to cause further long-term changes in the climate system, such as sea level rise, with associated impacts (high confidence), but these emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming of 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.2, 3.3, Figure 1.5}
A.2.1 Anthropogenic emissions (including greenhouse gases, aerosols and their precursors) up to the present are unlikely to cause further warming of more than 0.5°C over the next two to three decades (high confidence) or on a century time scale (medium confidence). {1.2.4, Figure 1.5}
A.2.2 Reaching and sustaining net zero global anthropogenic C02 emissions and declining net non-C02 radiative forcing would halt anthropogenic global warming on multi-decadal time scales (high confidence). The maximum temperature reached is then determined by cumulative net global anthropogenic C02 emissions up to the time of net zero C02 emissions (high confidence) and the level of non-C02 radiative forcing in the decades prior to the time that maximum temperatures are reached (medium confidence). On longer time scales, sustained net negative global anthropogenic C02 emissions and/ or further reductions in non-C02 radiative forcing may still be required to prevent further warming due to Earth system feedbacks and to reverse ocean acidification (medium confidence) and will be required to minimize sea level rise (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1,1.2.3,1.2.4, Figure 1.4,2.2.1,2.2.2,3.4.4.8,3.4.5.1,3.6.3.2}
A. 3 Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present, but lower than at 2°C (high confidence). These risks depend on the magnitude and rate of warming, geographic location, levels of development and vulnerability, and on the choices and implementation of adaptation and mitigation options (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {1.3, 3.3, 3.4, 5.6}
A. 3.1 Impacts on natural and human systems from global warming have already been observed (high confidence). Many land and ocean ecosystems and some of the services they provide have already changed due to global warming (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {1.4,3.4,3.5}
A. 3.2 Future climate-related risks depend on the rate, peak and duration of warming. In the aggregate, they are larger if global warming exceeds 1.5°C before returning to that level by 2100 than if global warming gradually stabilizes at 1.5°C, especially if the peak temperature is high (e.g., about 2°C) (high confidence). Some impacts may be long-lasting or irreversible, such as the loss of some ecosystems (high confidence). {3.2, 3.4.4,3.6.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
A.3.3 Adaptation and mitigation are already occurring (high confidence). Future climate-related risks would be reduced by the upscaling and acceleration of far-reaching, multilevel and cross-sectoral climate mitigation and by both incremental and transformational adaptation (high confidence). {1.2,1.3, Table 3.5, 4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, Box 4.6,4.3.1,4.3.2,4.3.3,4.3.4,4.3.5,4.4.1,4.4.4,4.4.5,4.5.3} 5






































B. Projected Climate Change, Potential Impacts and Associated Risks
B. 1 Climate models project robust3 differences in regional climate characteristics between present-day and global warming of 1.5°C,4 and between 1.5°C and 2°C.8 These differences include increases in: mean temperature in most land and ocean regions (high confidence), hot extremes in most inhabited regions (high confidence), heavy precipitation in several regions (medium confidence), and the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions (medium confidence). {3.3}
B.1.1 Evidence from attributed changes in some climate and weather extremes for a global warming of about 0.5°C supports the assessment that an additional 0.5°C of warming compared to present is associated with further detectable changes in these extremes (medium confidence). Several regional changes in climate are assessed to occur with global warming up to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels, including warming of extreme temperatures in many regions (high confidence), increases in frequency, intensity, and/or amount of heavy precipitation in several regions (high confidence), and an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions (medium confidence). {3.2,3.3.1,3.3.2,3.3.3,3.3.4, Table 3.2}
B.1.2 Temperature extremes on land are projected to warm more than GMST (high confidence): extreme hot days in mid-latitudes warm by up to about 3°C at global warming of 1.5°C and about 4°C at 2°C, and extreme cold nights in high latitudes warm by up to about 4.5°C at 1.5°C and about 6°C at 2°C (high confidence). The number of hot days is projected to increase in most land regions, with highest increases in the tropics (high confidence). {3.3.1,3.3.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
B.1.3 Risks from droughts and precipitation deficits are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming in some regions (medium confidence). Risks from heavy precipitation events are projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming in several northern hemisphere high-latitude and/or high-elevation regions, eastern Asia and eastern North America (medium confidence). Heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones is projected to be higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming (medium confidence). There is generally low confidence in projected changes in heavy precipitation at 2°C compared to 1.5°C in other regions. Heavy precipitation when aggregated at global scale is projected to be higher at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). As a consequence of heavy precipitation, the fraction of the global land area affected by flood hazards is projected to be larger at 2°C compared to 1.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.3.1,3.3.3,3.3.4,3.3.5,3.3.6}
B. 2 By 2100, global mean sea level rise is projected to be around 0.1 metre lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (medium confidence). Sea level will continue to rise well beyond 2100 (high confidence), and the magnitude and rate of this rise depend on future emission pathways. A slower rate of sea level rise enables greater opportunities for adaptation in the human and ecological systems of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas (medium confidence). {3.3, 3.4, 3.6}
B.2.1 Model-based projections of global mean sea level rise (relative to 1986-2005) suggest an indicative range of 0.26 to 0.77 m by 2100 for 1.5°C of global warming, 0.1 m (0.04-0.16 m) less than for a global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). A reduction of 0.1 m in global sea level rise implies that up to 10 million fewer people would be exposed to related risks, based on population in the year 2010 and assuming no adaptation (medium confidence). {3.4.4,3.4.5,4.3.2}
B.2.2 Sea level rise will continue beyond 2100 even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C in the 21 st century (high confidence). Marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica and/or irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet could result in multi-metre rise in sea level over hundreds to thousands of years. These instabilities could be triggered at around 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.3.9,3.4.5,3.5.2,3.6.3, Box 3.3}
B.2.3
  Increasing warming amplifies the exposure of small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas to the risks associated with sea level rise for many human and ecological systems, including increased saltwater intrusion, flooding and damage to infrastructure (high confidence). Risks associated with sea level rise are higher at 2°C compared to 1.5°C. The slower rate of sea level rise at global warming of 1.5°C reduces these risks, enabling greater opportunities for adaptation including managing and restoring natural coastal ecosystems and infrastructure reinforcement (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.5, Box 3.5}
B.3
  On land, impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, including species loss and extinction, are projected to be lower at 1.5°C of global warming compared to 2°C. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to lower the impacts on terrestrial, freshwater and coastal ecosystems and to retain more of their services to humans (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 4.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3}
B.3.1
  Of 105,000 species studied,9 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates are projected to lose over half of their climatically determined geographic range for global warming of 1.5°C, compared with 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates for global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). Impacts associated with other biodiversity-related risks such as forest fires and the spread of invasive species are lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming (high confidence). {3.4.3,3.5.2}
B.3.2
  Approximately 4% (interquartile range 2-7%) of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one type to another at 1 °C of global warming, compared with 13% (interquartile range 8-20%) at 2°C (medium confidence). ^\\\s indicates that the area at risk is projected to be approximately 50% lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.4.3.1,3.4.3.5}
B.3.3
  Fligh-latitude tundra and boreal forests are particularly at risk of climate change-induced degradation and loss, with woody shrubs already encroaching into the tundra (high confidence) and this will proceed with further warming. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C is projected to prevent the thawing over centuries of a permafrost area in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 million km2 (medium confidence). {3.3.2,3.4.3, 3.5.5}
B.4
  Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C is projected to reduce increases in ocean temperature as well as associated increases in ocean acidity and decreases in ocean oxygen levels (high confidence). Consequently, limiting global warming to 1.5°C is projected to reduce risks to marine biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystems, and their functions and services to humans, as illustrated by recent changes to Arctic sea ice and warm-water coral reef ecosystems (high confidence). {3.3, 3.4, 3.5, Box 3.4, Box 3.5}
B.4.1
  There is high confidence that the probability of a sea ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer is substantially lower at global warming of 1.5°C when compared to 2°C. With 1.5°C of global warming, one sea ice-free Arctic summer is projected per century. This likelihood is increased to at least one per decade with 2°C global warming. Effects of a temperature overshoot are reversible for Arctic sea ice cover on decadal time scales (high confidence). {3.3.8,3.4.4.7J
B.4.2
  Global warming of 1.5°C is projected to shift the ranges of many marine species to higher latitudes as well as increase the amount of damage to many ecosystems. It is also expected to drive the loss of coastal resources and reduce the productivity of fisheries and aquaculture (especially at low latitudes). The risks of climate-induced impacts are projected to be higher at 2°C than those at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). Coral reefs, for example, are projected to decline by a further 70-90% at 1.5°C (high confidence) with larger losses (>99%) at 2°C (very high confidence).Jhe risk of irreversible loss of many marine and coastal ecosystems increases with global warming, especially at 2°C or more (high confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}



B. 4.3 The level of ocean acidification due to increasing C02 concentrations associated with global warming of 1.5°C is projected to amplify the adverse effects of warming, and even further at 2°C, impacting the growth, development, calcification, survival, and thus abundance of a broad range of species, for example, from algae to fish (high confidence). {3.3.10,3.4.4}
B. 4.4 Impacts of climate change in the ocean are increasing risks to fisheries and aquaculture via impacts on the physiology, survivorship, habitat, reproduction, disease incidence, and risk of invasive species (medium confidence) but are projected to be less at 1.5°C of global warming than at 2°C. One global fishery model, for example, projected a decrease in global annual catch for marine fisheries of about 1.5 million tonnes for 1.5°C of global warming compared to a loss of more than 3 million tonnes for 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). {3.4.4, Box 3.4}
B. 5 Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C. (Figure SPM.2) {3.4, 3.5, 5.2, Box 3.2, Box 3.3, Box 3.5, Box 3.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, 5.2}
B.5.1 Populations at disproportionately higher risk of adverse consequences with global warming of 1.5°C and beyond include disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, some indigenous peoples, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods (high confidence). Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states, and Least Developed Countries (high confidence). Poverty and disadvantage are expected to increase in some populations as global warming increases; limiting global warming to 1.5°C, compared with 2°C, could reduce the number of people both exposed to climate-related risks and susceptible to poverty by up to several hundred million by 2050 (medium confidence). {3.4.10, 3.4.11, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5,4.2.2.2, 5.2.1,5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.6.3}
B.5.2 Any increase in global warming is projected to affect human health, with primarily negative consequences (high confidence). Lower risks are projected at 1.5°C than at 2°C for heat-related morbidity and mortality (very high confidence) and for ozone-related mortality if emissions needed for ozone formation remain high (high confidence). Urban heat islands often amplify the impacts of heatwaves in cities (high confidence). Risks from some vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are projected to increase with warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, including potential shifts in their geographic range (high confidence). {3.4.7,3.4.8,3.5.5.8}
B.5.3 Limiting warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C is projected to result in smaller net reductions in yields of maize, rice, wheat, and potentially other cereal crops, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America, and in the C02-dependent nutritional quality of rice and wheat (high confidence). Reductions in projected food availability are larger at 2°C than at 1.5°C of global warming in the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, central Europe, and the Amazon (medium confidence). Livestock are projected to be adversely affected with rising temperatures, depending on the extent of changes in feed quality, spread of diseases, and water resource availability (high confidence). {3.4.6,3.5.4,3.5.5, Box 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.4 Depending on future socio-economic conditions, limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C may reduce the proportion of the world population exposed to a climate change-induced increase in water stress by up to 50%, although there is considerable variability between regions (medium confidence). Many small island developing states could experience lower water stress as a result of projected changes in aridity when global warming is limited to 1.5°C, as compared to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.3.5,3.4.2,3.4.8,3.5.5, Box 3.2, Box 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}
B.5.5 Risks to global aggregated economic growth due to climate change impacts are projected to be lower at 1.5°C than at 2°C by the end of this century5 (medium confidence). This excludes the costs of mitigation, adaptation investments and the benefits of adaptation. Countries in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere subtropics are projected to experience the largest impacts on economic growth due to climate change should global warming increase from 1.5°C to 2°C (medium confidence). {3.5.2,3.5.3} 6 7

B.5.6 Exposure to multiple and compound climate-related risks increases between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming, with greater proportions of people both so exposed and susceptible to poverty in Africa and Asia (high confidence). For global warming from 1.5°C to 2°C, risks across energy, food, and water sectors could overlap spatially and temporally, creating new and exacerbating current hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities that could affect increasing numbers of people and regions (medium confidence). {Box 3.5,3.3.1,3.4.5.3,3.4.5.6,3.4.11,3.5.4.9}
B.5.7 There are multiple lines of evidence that since AR5 the assessed levels of risk increased for four of the five Reasons for Concern (RFCs) for global warming to 2°C (high confidence). The risk transitions by degrees of global warming are now: from high to very high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC1 (Unique and threatened systems) (high confidence)] from moderate to high risk between 1 °C and 1.5°C for RFC2 (Extreme weather events) (medium confidence)] from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2°C for RFC3 (Distribution of impacts) (high confidence)] from moderate to high risk between 1.5°C and 2.5°C for RFC4 (Global aggregate impacts) (medium confidence)] and from moderate to high risk between 1°C and 2.5°C for RFC5 (Large-scale singular events) (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.13; 3.5,3.5.2}
B. 6 Most adaptation needs will be lower for global warming of 1.5°C compared to 2°C (high confidence). There are a wide range of adaptation options that can reduce the risks of climate change (high confidence). There are limits to adaptation and adaptive capacity for some human and natural systems at global warming of 1.5°C, with associated losses (medium confidence). The number and availability of adaptation options vary by sector (medium confidence). {Table 3.5, 4.3, 4.5, Cross- Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5}
B.6.1 A wide range of adaptation options are available to reduce the risks to natural and managed ecosystems (e.g., ecosystem- based adaptation, ecosystem restoration and avoided degradation and deforestation, biodiversity management, sustainable aquaculture, and local knowledge and indigenous knowledge), the risks of sea level rise (e.g., coastal defence and hardening), and the risks to health, livelihoods, food, water, and economic growth, especially in rural landscapes (e.g., efficient irrigation, social safety nets, disaster risk management, risk spreading and sharing, and community- based adaptation) and urban areas (e.g., green infrastructure, sustainable land use and planning, and sustainable water management) (medium confidence). {4.3.1,4.3.2,4.3.3,4.3.5,4.5.3,4.5.4, 5.3.2, Box 4.2, Box 4.3, Box 4.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4}.
B.6.2 Adaptation is expected to be more challenging for ecosystems, food and health systems at 2°C of global warming than for 1.5°C (medium confidence). Some vulnerable regions, including small islands and Least Developed Countries, are projected to experience high multiple interrelated climate risks even at global warming of 1.5°C (high confidence). {3.3.1, 3.4.5, Box 3.5, Table 3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, 5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, Box 5.3}
B.6.3 Limits to adaptive capacity exist at 1.5°C of global warming, become more pronounced at higher levels of warming and vary by sector, with site-specific implications for vulnerable regions, ecosystems and human health (medium confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5, Box 3.5, Table 3.5} 10























C. Emission Pathways and System Transitions Consistent with 1.5°C Global Warming
C. 1 In model pathways with no or limited overshoot of 1.5°C, global net anthropogenic C02 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40-60% interquartile range), reaching net zero around 2050 (2045-2055 interquartile range). For limiting global warming to below 2°C11 C02 emissions are projected to decline by about 25% by 2030 in most pathways (10-30% interquartile range) and reach net zero around 2070 (2065-2080 interquartile range). Non-C02 emissions in pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C show deep reductions that are similar to those in pathways limiting warming to 2°C. (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3a) {2.1, 2.3, Table 2.4}
C. 1.1	C02 emissions reductions that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot can involve different portfolios of
mitigation measures, striking different balances between lowering energy and resource intensity, rate of decarbonization, and the reliance on carbon dioxide removal. Different portfolios face different implementation challenges and potential synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development, (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.2,2.3.4,2.4,2.5.3}
C. 1.2 Modelled pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot involve deep reductions in emissions of methane and black carbon (35% or more of both by 2050 relative to 2010). These pathways also reduce most of the cooling aerosols, which partially offsets mitigation effects for two to three decades. l\lon-C02 emissions8 can be reduced as a result of broad mitigation measures in the energy sector. In addition, targeted non-C02 mitigation measures can reduce nitrous oxide and methane from agriculture, methane from the waste sector, some sources of black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons. High bioenergy demand can increase emissions of nitrous oxide in some 1.5°C pathways, highlighting the importance of appropriate management approaches. Improved air quality resulting from projected reductions in many non-C02 emissions provide direct and immediate population health benefits in all 1.5°C model pathways, (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3a) {2.2.1,2.3.3,2.4.4,2.5.3,4.3.6, 5.4.2}
C. 1.3 Limiting global warming requires limiting the total cumulative global anthropogenic emissions of C02 since the preindustrial period, that is, staying within a total carbon budget (high confidence).'3 By the end of 2017, anthropogenic C02 emissions since the pre-industrial period are estimated to have reduced the total carbon budget for 1.5°C by approximately 2200 ± 320 GtC02 (medium confidence). The associated remaining budget is being depleted by current emissions of 42 ± 3 GtC02 per year (high confidence). The choice of the measure of global temperature affects the estimated remaining carbon budget. Using global mean surface air temperature, as in AR5, gives an estimate of the remaining carbon budget of 580 GtC02 for a 50% probability of limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 420 GtC02 for a 66% probability (medium confidence).'4 Alternatively, using GMST gives estimates of 770 and 570 GtC02, for 50% and 66% probabilities,15 respectively (medium confidence). Uncertainties in the size of these estimated remaining carbon budgets are substantial and depend on several factors. Uncertainties in the climate response to C02 and non-C02 emissions contribute ±400 GtC02 and the level of historic warming contributes ±250 GtC02 (medium confidence). Potential additional carbon release from future permafrost thawing and methane release from wetlands would reduce budgets by up to 100 GtC02 over the course of this century and more thereafter (medium confidence). In addition, the level of non-C02 mitigation in the future could alter the remaining carbon budget by 250 GtC02 in either direction (medium confidence). {1.2.4, 2.2.2, 2.6.1, Table 2.2, Chapter 2 Supplementary Material}
C. 1.4 Solar radiation modification (SRM) measures are not included in any of the available assessed pathways. Although some SRM measures may be theoretically effective in reducing an overshoot, they face large uncertainties and knowledge gaps
11 References to pathways limiting global warming to 2°C are based on a 66% probability of staying below 2°C.
12 Non-C02 emissions included in this Report are all anthropogenic emissions other than C02 that result in radiative forcing. These include short-lived climate forcers, such as methane, some fluorinated gases, ozone precursors, aerosols or aerosol precursors, such as black carbon and sulphur dioxide, respectively, as well as long-lived greenhouse gases, such as nitrous oxide or some fluorinated gases. The radiative forcing associated with non-C02 emissions and changes in surface albedo is referred to as non-C02 radiative forcing. {2.2.1}
13 There is a clear scientific basis for a total carbon budget consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. However, neither this total carbon budget nor the fraction of this budget taken up by past emissions were assessed in this Report.
14 Irrespective of the measure of global temperature used, updated understanding and further advances in methods have led to an increase in the estimated remaining carbon budget of about 300 GtC02 compared to AR5. (medium confidence) {2.2.2}
15 These estimates use observed GMST to 2006-2015 and estimate future temperature changes using near surface air temperatures.














































C. 2 Pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would require rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems (high confidence). These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those options (medium confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5}
C.2.1 Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show system changes that are more rapid and pronounced over the next two decades than in 2°C pathways (high confidence). The rates of system changes associated with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot have occurred in the past within specific sectors, technologies and spatial contexts, but there is no documented historic precedent for their scale (medium confidence). {2.3.3,2.3.4,2.4,2.5,4.2.1,4.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
C.2.2	In energy systems, modelled global pathways (considered in the literature) limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (for more details see Figure SPM.3b) generally meet energy service demand with lower energy use, including through enhanced energy efficiency, and show faster electrification of energy end use compared to 2°C (high confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, low-emission energy sources are projected to have a higher share, compared with 2°C pathways, particularly before 2050 (high confidence). In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, renewables are projected to supply 70-85% (interquartile range) of electricity in 2050 (high confidence). In electricity generation, shares of nuclear and fossil fuels with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) are modelled to increase in most 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot. In modelled 1.5°C pathways with limited or no overshoot, the use of CCS would allow the electricity generation share of gas to be approximately 8% (3-11% interquartile range) of global electricity in 2050, while the use of coal shows a steep reduction in all pathways and would be reduced to close to 0% (0-2% interquartile range) of electricity (high confidence). While acknowledging the challenges, and differences between the options and national circumstances, political, economic, social and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy and electricity storage technologies have substantially improved over the past few years (high confidence). These improvements signal a potential system transition in electricity generation. (Figure SPM.3b) {2.4.1,2.4.2, Figure 2.1, Table 2.6, Table 2.7, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 3,4.2.1,4.3.1,4.3.3,4.5.2}
C.2.3	C02 emissions from industry in pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are projected to
be about 65-90% (interquartile range) lower in 2050 relative to 2010, as compared to 50-80% for global warming of 2°C (medium confidence). Such reductions can be achieved through combinations of new and existing technologies and practices, including electrification, hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). These options are technically proven at various scales but their large-scale deployment may be limited by economic, financial, human capacity and institutional constraints in specific contexts, and specific characteristics of large-scale industrial installations. In industry, emissions reductions by energy and process efficiency by themselves are insufficient for limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). {2.4.3, 4.2.1, Table 4.1, Table 4.3,4.3.3,4.3.4,4.5.2}
C.2.4 The urban and infrastructure system transition consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would imply, for example, changes in land and urban planning practices, as well as deeper emissions reductions in transport and buildings compared to pathways that limit global warming below 2°C (medium confidence). Technical measures and practices enabling deep emissions reductions include various energy efficiency options. In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the electricity share of energy demand in buildings would be about 55-75% in 2050 compared to 50-70% in 2050 for 2°C global warming (medium confidence). In the transport sector, the share of low-emission final energy would rise from less than 5% in 2020 to about 35-65% in 2050 compared to 25-45% for 2°C of global warming (medium confidence). Economic, institutional and socio-cultural barriers may inhibit these urban and infrastructure system transitions, depending on national, regional and local circumstances, capabilities and the availability of capital (high confidence). {2.3.4,2.4.3,4.2.1, Table 4.1,4.3.3,4.5.2}
C.2.5 Transitions in global and regional land use are found in all pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, but their scale depends on the pursued mitigation portfolio. Model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a 4 million km2 reduction to a 2.5 million km2 increase of non-pasture agricultural land for food and feed crops and a 0.5-11 million km2 reduction of pasture land, to be converted into a 0-6 million km2 increase of agricultural land for energy crops and a 2 million km2 reduction to 9.5 million km2 increase in forests by 2050 relative to 2010 (medium confidence).9 Land-use transitions of similar magnitude can be observed in modelled 2°C pathways (medium confidence). Such large transitions pose profound challenges for sustainable management of the various demands on land for human settlements, food, livestock feed, fibre, bioenergy, carbon storage, biodiversity and other ecosystem services (high confidence). Mitigation options limiting the demand for land include sustainable intensification of land-use practices, ecosystem restoration and changes towards less resource-intensive diets (high confidence). The implementation of land-based mitigation options would require overcoming socio-economic, institutional, technological, financing and environmental barriers that differ across regions (high confidence). {2.4.4, Figure 2.24, 4.3.2, 4.3.7, 4.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}
C.2.6 Additional annual average energy-related investments for the period 2016 to 2050 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C compared to pathways without new climate policies beyond those in place today are estimated to be around 830 billion USD2010 (range of 150 billion to 1700 billion USD2010 across six models10). This compares to total annual average energy supply investments in 1.5°C pathways of 1460 to 3510 billion USD2010 and total annual average energy demand investments of 640 to 910 billion USD2010 for the period 2016 to 2050. Total energy-related investments increase by about 12% (range of 3% to 24%) in 1.5°C pathways relative to 2°C pathways. Annual investments in low-carbon energy technologies and energy efficiency are upscaled by roughly a factor of six (range of factor of 4 to 10) by 2050 compared to 2015 (medium confidence). {2.5.2, Box 4.8, Figure 2.27}
C.2.7 Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot project a wide range of global average discounted marginal abatement costs over the 21st century. They are roughly 3-4 times higher than in pathways limiting global warming to below 2°C (high confidence).Jhe economic literature distinguishes marginal abatement costs from total mitigation costs in the economy. The literature on total mitigation costs of 1.5°C mitigation pathways is limited and was not assessed in this Report. Knowledge gaps remain in the integrated assessment of the economy-wide costs and benefits of mitigation in line with pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. {2.5.2; 2.6; Figure 2.26}
14 The projected land-use changes presented are not deployed to their upper limits simultaneously in a single pathway.
15 Including two pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and four pathways with higher overshoot.

C.3 All pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot project the use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on the order of 100-1000 GtC02 over the 21st century. CDR would be used to compensate for residual emissions and, in most cases, achieve net negative emissions to return global warming to 1.5°C following a peak (high confidence). CDR deployment of several hundreds of GtC02 is subject to multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints (high confidence). Significant near-term emissions reductions and measures to lower energy and land demand can limit CDR deployment to a few hundred GtC02 without reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 3.6.2, 4.3, 5.4}
C.3.1 Existing and potential CDR measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, BECCS, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. These differ widely in terms of maturity, potentials, costs, risks, co-benefits and trade-offs (high confidence). To date, only a few published pathways include CDR measures other than afforestation and BECCS. {2.3.4,3.6.2,4.3.2,4.3.7}
C.3.2 In pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with limited or no overshoot, BECCS deployment is projected to range from 0-1, 0-8, and 0-16 GtC02 yr1 in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively, while agriculture, forestry and land-use (AFOLU) related CDR measures are projected to remove 0-5,1-11, and 1-5 GtC02 yr1 in these years (medium confidence). The upper end of these deployment ranges by mid-century exceeds the BECCS potential of up to 5 GtC02 yr1 and afforestation potential of up to 3.6 GtC02 yr1 assessed based on recent literature (medium confidence). Some pathways avoid BECCS deployment completely through demand-side measures and greater reliance on AFOLU-related CDR measures (medium confidence). The use of bioenergy can be as high or even higher when BECCS is excluded compared to when it is included due to its potential for replacing fossil fuels across sectors (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.4.2, 3.6.2,
4.3.1.4.2.3.4.3.2.4.3.7.4.4.3, Table 2.4}
C.3.3 Pathways that overshoot 1.5°C of global warming rely on CDR exceeding residual C02 emissions later in the century to return to below 1.5°C by 2100, with larger overshoots requiring greater amounts of CDR (Figure SPM.3b) (high confidence). Limitations on the speed, scale, and societal acceptability of CDR deployment hence determine the ability to return global warming to below 1.5°C following an overshoot. Carbon cycle and climate system understanding is still limited about the effectiveness of net negative emissions to reduce temperatures after they peak (high confidence). {2.2, 2.3.4, 2.3.5, 2.6, 4.3.7,4.5.2,Table 4.11}
C.3.4 Most current and potential CDR measures could have significant impacts on land, energy, water or nutrients if deployed at large scale (high confidence). Afforestation and bioenergy may compete with other land uses and may have significant impacts on agricultural and food systems, biodiversity, and other ecosystem functions and services (high confidence). Effective governance is needed to limit such trade-offs and ensure permanence of carbon removal in terrestrial, geological and ocean reservoirs (high confidence). Feasibility and sustainability of CDR use could be enhanced by a portfolio of options deployed at substantial, but lesser scales, rather than a single option at very large scale (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b) {2.3.4, 2.4.4, 2.5.3, 2.6, 3.6.2,4.3.2,4.3.7,4.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3, Table 4.11, Table
5.3, Figure 5.3}
C.3.5 Some AFOLU-related CDR measures such as restoration of natural ecosystems and soil carbon sequestration could provide co-benefits such as improved biodiversity, soil quality, and local food security. If deployed at large scale, they would require governance systems enabling sustainable land management to conserve and protect land carbon stocks and other ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {2.3.3,2.3.4,2.4.2,2.4.4,3.6.2,5.4.1, Cross-Chapter Boxes 3 in Chapter 1 and 7 in Chapter 3,4.3.2,4.3.7,4.4.1,4.5.2, Table 2.4} 17
D.
 Strengthening the Global Response in the Context of Sustainable Development and Efforts to Eradicate Poverty
 Estimates of the global emissions outcome of current nationally stated mitigation ambitions as submitted under the Paris Agreement would lead to global greenhouse gas emissions18 in 2030 of 52-58 GtC02eq yr1 (medium confidence). Pathways reflecting these ambitions would not limit global warming to 1.5°C, even if supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and ambition of emissions reductions after 2030 (high confidence). Avoiding overshoot and reliance on future large-scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can only be achieved if global C02 emissions start to decline well before 2030 (high confidence). {1.2, 2.3, 3.3, 3.4, 4.2, 4.4, Cross- Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
D.1.1
  Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show clear emission reductions by 2030 (high confidence). AW but one show a decline in global greenhouse gas emissions to below 35 GtC02eq yr1 in 2030, and half of available pathways fall within the 25-30 GtC02eq yr1 range (interquartile range), a 40-50% reduction from 2010 levels (high confidence). Pathways reflecting current nationally stated mitigation ambition until 2030 are broadly consistent with cost-effective pathways that result in a global warming of about 3°C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards (medium confidence). {2.3.3,2.3.5, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4, 5.5.3.2}
D.1.2
  Overshoot trajectories result in higher impacts and associated challenges compared to pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). Reversing warming after an overshoot of 0.2°C or larger during this century would require upscaling and deployment of CDR at rates and volumes that might not be achievable given considerable implementation challenges (medium confidence). {1.3.3,2.3.4,2.3.5,2.5.1,3.3,4.3.7, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4}
D.1.3
  The lower the emissions in 2030, the lower the challenge in limiting global warming to 1.5°C after 2030 with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). The challenges from delayed actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include the risk of cost escalation, lock-in in carbon-emitting infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced flexibility in future response options in the medium to long term (high confidence). These may increase uneven distributional impacts between countries at different stages of development (medium confidence). {2.3.5,4.4.5, 5.4.2}
D.2
 The avoided climate change impacts on sustainable development, eradication of poverty and reducing inequalities would be greater if global warming were limited to 1.5°C rather than 2°C, if mitigation and adaptation synergies are maximized while trade-offs are minimized (high confidence). {1.1,1.4, 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 5.2, Table 5.1}
D.2.1
  Climate change impacts and responses are closely linked to sustainable development which balances social well-being, economic prosperity and environmental protection. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in 2015, provide an established framework for assessing the links between global warming of 1.5°C or 2°C and development goals that include poverty eradication, reducing inequalities, and climate action, (high confidence) {Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1,1.4, 5.1}
D.2.2
  The consideration of ethics and equity can help address the uneven distribution of adverse impacts associated with 1.5°C and higher levels of global warming, as well as those from mitigation and adaptation, particularly for poor and disadvantaged populations, in all societies (high confidence). {1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.4.3, 2.5.3, 3.4.10, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3. 5.4, Cross- Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 8 in Chapter 3, and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 5}
D.2.3
  Mitigation and adaptation consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C are underpinned by enabling conditions, assessed in this Report across the geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, socio-cultural and institutional dimensions of feasibility. Strengthened multilevel governance, institutional capacity, policy instruments, technological innovation and transfer and mobilization of finance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles are enabling conditions that enhance the feasibility of mitigation and adaptation options for 1.5°C-consistent systems transitions, (high confidence) {1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1,2.5.1,4.4,4.5, 5.6}
D. 3 Adaptation options specific to national contexts, if carefully selected together with enabling conditions, will have benefits for sustainable development and poverty reduction with global warming of 1.5°C, although trade-offs are possible (high confidence). {1.4,4.3,4.5}
D. 3.1 Adaptation options that reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems have many synergies with sustainable development, if well managed, such as ensuring food and water security, reducing disaster risks, improving health conditions, maintaining ecosystem services and reducing poverty and inequality (high confidence). Increasing investment in physical and social infrastructure is a key enabling condition to enhance the resilience and the adaptive capacities of societies. These benefits can occur in most regions with adaptation to 1.5°C of global warming (high confidence). {1.4.3,4.2.2,4.3.1,4.3.2,4.3.3,4.3.5,4.4.1,4.4.3,4.5.3, 5.3.1,5.3.2}
D. 3.2 Adaptation to 1.5°C global warming can also result in trade-offs or maladaptations with adverse impacts for sustainable development. For example, if poorly designed or implemented, adaptation projects in a range of sectors can increase greenhouse gas emissions and water use, increase gender and social inequality, undermine health conditions, and encroach on natural ecosystems (high confidence). These trade-offs can be reduced by adaptations that include attention to poverty and sustainable development (high confidence). {4.3.2,4.3.3,4.5.4, 5.3.2; Cross-Chapter Boxes 6 and 7 in Chapter 3}
D. 3.3	A mix of adaptation and mitigation options to limit global warming to 1.5°C, implemented in a participatory and integrated
manner, can enable rapid, systemic transitions in urban and rural areas (high confidence). These are most effective when aligned with economic and sustainable development, and when local and regional governments and decision makers are supported by national governments (medium confidence). {4.3.2,4.3.3,4.4.1,4.4.2}
D.3.4 Adaptation options that also mitigate emissions can provide synergies and cost savings in most sectors and system transitions, such as when land management reduces emissions and disaster risk, or when low-carbon buildings are also designed for efficient cooling. Trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation, when limiting global warming to 1.5°C, such as when bioenergy crops, reforestation or afforestation encroach on land needed for agricultural adaptation, can undermine food security, livelihoods, ecosystem functions and services and other aspects of sustainable development, (high confidence) {3.4.3,4.3.2,4.3.4,4.4.1,4.5.2,4.5.3,4.5.4}
D.4 Mitigation options consistent with 1.5°C pathways are associated with multiple synergies and tradeoffs across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the total number of possible synergies exceeds the number of trade-offs, their net effect will depend on the pace and magnitude of changes, the composition of the mitigation portfolio and the management of the transition, (high confidence) (Figure SPM.4) {2.5, 4.5, 5.4}
D.4.1	1.5°C pathways have robust synergies particularly for the SDGs 3 (health), 7 (clean energy), 11 (cities and communities), 12
(responsible consumption and production) and 14 (oceans) (very high confidence). Some 1.5°C pathways show potential trade-offs with mitigation for SDGs 1 (poverty), 2 (hunger), 6 (water) and 7 (energy access), if not managed carefully (high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.2; Figure 5.4, Cross-Chapter Boxes 7 and 8 in Chapter 3}
D.4.2	1.5°C pathways that include low energy demand (e.g., see PI in Figure SPM.3a and SPM.3b), low material consumption,
and low GHG-intensive food consumption have the most pronounced synergies and the lowest number of trade-offs with respect to sustainable development and the SDGs (high confidence). Such pathways would reduce dependence on CDR. In modelled pathways, sustainable development, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality can support limiting warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3b, Figure SPM.4) {2.4.3,2.5.1,2.5.3, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.28, 5.4.1,5.4.2, Figure 5.4}
19










































D.4.3	1.5°C and 2°C modelled pathways often rely on the deployment of large-scale land-related measures like afforestation
and bioenergy supply, which, if poorly managed, can compete with food production and hence raise food security concerns (high confidence). The impacts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options on SDGs depend on the type of options and the scale of deployment (high confidence). If poorly implemented, CDR options such as BECCS and AFOLU options would lead to trade-offs. Context-relevant design and implementation requires considering people's needs, biodiversity, and other sustainable development dimensions (very high confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {5.4.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3}
D.4.4 Mitigation consistent with 1.5°C pathways creates risks for sustainable development in regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for revenue and employment generation (high confidence). Policies that promote diversification of the economy and the energy sector can address the associated challenges (high confidence). {5.4.1.2, Box 5.2}
D.4.5 Redistributive policies across sectors and populations that shield the poor and vulnerable can resolve trade-offs for a range of SDGs, particularly hunger, poverty and energy access. Investment needs for such complementary policies are only a small fraction of the overall mitigation investments in 1.5°C pathways, (high confidence) {2.4.3, 5.4.2, Figure 5.5}
D.5 Limiting the risks from global warming of 1.5°C in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication implies system transitions that can be enabled by an increase of adaptation and mitigation investments, policy instruments, the acceleration of technological innovation and behaviour changes (high confidence). {2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.2,4.2,4.4,4.5, 5.2, 5.5, 5.6}
D.5.1 Directing finance towards investment in infrastructure for mitigation and adaptation could provide additional resources. This could involve the mobilization of private funds by institutional investors, asset managers and development or investment banks, as well as the provision of public funds. Government policies that lower the risk of low-emission and adaptation investments can facilitate the mobilization of private funds and enhance the effectiveness of other public policies. Studies indicate a number of challenges, including access to finance and mobilization of funds, (high confidence) {2.5.1,2.5.2,4.4.5}
D.5.2 Adaptation finance consistent with global warming of 1.5°C is difficult to quantify and compare with 2°C. Knowledge gaps include insufficient data to calculate specific climate resilience-enhancing investments from the provision of currently underinvested basic infrastructure. Estimates of the costs of adaptation might be lower at global warming of 1.5°C than for 2°C. Adaptation needs have typically been supported by public sector sources such as national and subnational government budgets, and in developing countries together with support from development assistance, multilateral development banks, and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change channels (medium confidence). More recently there is a growing understanding of the scale and increase in non-governmental organizations and private funding in some regions (medium confidence). Barriers include the scale of adaptation financing, limited capacity and access to adaptation finance (medium confidence). {4.4.5,4.6}
D.5.3
  Global model pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C are projected to involve the annual average investment needs in the energy system of around 2.4 trillion USD2010 between 2016 and 2035, representing about 2.5% of the world GDP (medium confidence). {4.4.5, Box 4.8}
D.5.4
  Policy tools can help mobilize incremental resources, including through shifting global investments and savings and through market and non-market based instruments as well as accompanying measures to secure the equity of the transition, acknowledging the challenges related with implementation, including those of energy costs, depreciation of assets and impacts on international competition, and utilizing the opportunities to maximize co-benefits (high confidence). {1.3.3,2.3.4,2.3.5,2.5.1,2.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 4,4.4.5, 5.5.2}
D.5.5
  The systems transitions consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C include the widespread adoption of new and possibly disruptive technologies and practices and enhanced climate-driven innovation. These imply enhanced technological innovation capabilities, including in industry and finance. Both national innovation policies and international cooperation can contribute to the development, commercialization and widespread adoption of mitigation and adaptation technologies. Innovation policies may be more effective when they combine public support for research and development with policy mixes that provide incentives for technology diffusion, (high confidence) {4.4.4,4.4.5}.
D.5.6
  Education, information, and community approaches, including those that are informed by indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate the wide-scale behaviour changes consistent with adapting to and limiting global warming to 1.5°C. These approaches are more effective when combined with other policies and tailored to the motivations, capabilities and resources of specific actors and contexts (high confidence). Public acceptability can enable or inhibit the implementation of policies and measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C and to adapt to the consequences. Public acceptability depends on the individual's evaluation of expected policy consequences, the perceived fairness of the distribution of these consequences, and perceived fairness of decision procedures (high confidence). {1.1,1.5,4.3.5,4.4.1,4.4.3, Box 4.3,5.5.3, 5.6.5}
D.6
 Sustainable development supports, and often enables, the fundamental societal and systems transitions and transformations that help limit global warming to 1.5°C. Such changes facilitate the pursuit of climate-resilient development pathways that achieve ambitious mitigation and adaptation in conjunction with poverty eradication and efforts to reduce inequalities (high confidence). {Box 1.1, 1.4.3, Figure 5.1, 5.5.3, Box 5.3}
D.6.1
  Social justice and equity are core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways that aim to limit global warming to 1.5°C as they address challenges and inevitable trade-offs, widen opportunities, and ensure that options, visions, and values are deliberated, between and within countries and communities, without making the poor and disadvantaged worse off (high confidence). {5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.3, Figure 5.1, Figure 5.6, Cross-Chapter Boxes 12 and 13 in Chapter 5}
D.6.2
  The potential for climate-resilient development pathways differs between and within regions and nations, due to different development contexts and systemic vulnerabilities (very high confidence). Efforts along such pathways to date have been limited (medium confidence) and enhanced efforts would involve strengthened and timely action from all countries and non-state actors (high confidence). {5.5.1,5.5.3, Figure 5.1}
D.6.3
  Pathways that are consistent with sustainable development show fewer mitigation and adaptation challenges and are associated with lower mitigation costs. The large majority of modelling studies could not construct pathways characterized by lack of international cooperation, inequality and poverty that were able to limit global warming to 1.5°C. (high confidence) {2.3.1,2.5.1,2.5.3, 5.5.2}



D.7 Strengthening the capacities for climate action of national and sub-national authorities, civil society, the private sector, indigenous peoples and local communities can support the implementation of ambitious actions implied by limiting global warming to 1.5°C (high confidence). International cooperation can provide an enabling environment for this to be achieved in all countries and for all people, in the context of sustainable development. International cooperation is a critical enabler for developing countries and vulnerable regions (high confidence). {1.4,2.3,2.5,4.2,4.4,4.5, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7, Box 5.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 4, Cross-Chapter Box 13 in Chapter 5}
D.7.1 Partnerships involving non-state public and private actors, institutional investors, the banking system, civil society and scientific institutions would facilitate actions and responses consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {1.4,4.4.1,4.2.2,4.4.3,4.4.5,4.5.3, 5.4.1,5.6.2, Box 5.3}.
D.7.2 Cooperation on strengthened accountable multilevel governance that includes non-state actors such as industry, civil society and scientific institutions, coordinated sectoral and cross-sectoral policies at various governance levels, gender- sensitive policies, finance including innovative financing, and cooperation on technology development and transfer can ensure participation, transparency, capacity building and learning among different players (high confidence). {2.5.1,2.5.2,

D.7.3 International cooperation is a critical enabler for developing countries and vulnerable regions to strengthen their action for the implementation of 1.5°C-consistent climate responses, including through enhancing access to finance and technology and enhancing domestic capacities, taking into account national and local circumstances and needs (high confidence). {2.3.1,2.5.1,4.4.1,4.4.2,4.4.4,4.4.5, 5.4.1 5.5.3, 5.6.1, Box 4.1, Box 4.2, Box 4.7}.
D.7.4 Collective efforts at all levels, in ways that reflect different circumstances and capabilities, in the pursuit of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, taking into account equity as well as effectiveness, can facilitate strengthening the global response to climate change, achieving sustainable development and eradicating poverty (high confidence). {1.4.2, 2.3.1, 2.5.1, 2.5.2,

Box SPM.1: Core Concepts Central to this Special Report
Global mean surface temperature (GMST): Estimated global average of near-surface air temperatures over land and sea ice, and sea surface temperatures over ice-free ocean regions, with changes normally expressed as departures from a value over a specified reference period. When estimating changes in GMST, near-surface air temperature over both land and oceans are also used.11 {1.2.1.1}
Pre-industrial: The multi-century period prior to the onset of large-scale industrial activity around 1750. The reference period 1850-1900 is used to approximate pre-industrial GMST. {1.2.1.2}
Global warming: The estimated increase in GMST averaged over a 30-year period, or the 30-year period centred on a particular year or decade, expressed relative to pre-industrial levels unless otherwise specified. For 30-year periods that span past and future years, the current multi-decadal warming trend is assumed to continue. {1.2.1}
Net zero C02 emissions: Net zero carbon dioxide (C02) emissions are achieved when anthropogenic C02 emissions are balanced globally by anthropogenic C02 removals over a specified period.
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR): Anthropogenic activities removing C02 from the atmosphere and durably storing it in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. It includes existing and potential anthropogenic enhancement of biological or geochemical sinks and direct air capture and storage, but excludes natural C02 uptake not directly caused by human activities.
Total carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic C02 emissions from the pre-industrial period to the time that anthropogenic C02 emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global warming to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2}
Remaining carbon budget: Estimated cumulative net global anthropogenic C02 emissions from a given start date to the time that anthropogenic C02 emissions reach net zero that would result, at some probability, in limiting global warming to a given level, accounting for the impact of other anthropogenic emissions. {2.2.2}
Temperature overshoot: The temporary exceedance of a specified level of global warming.
Emission pathways: In this Summary for Policymakers, the modelled trajectories of global anthropogenic emissions over the 21st century are termed emission pathways. Emission pathways are classified by their temperature trajectory over the 21st century: pathways giving at least 50% probability based on current knowledge of limiting global warming to below 1.5°C are classified as 'no overshoot'; those limiting warming to below 1.6°C and returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are classified as '1.5°C limited-overshoot'; while those exceeding 1.6°C but still returning to 1.5°C by 2100 are classified as 'higher-overshoot'.
Impacts: Effects of climate change on human and natural systems. Impacts can have beneficial or adverse outcomes for livelihoods, health and well-being, ecosystems and species, services, infrastructure, and economic, social and cultural assets.
Risk: The potential for adverse consequences from a climate-related hazard for human and natural systems, resulting from the interactions between the hazard and the vulnerability and exposure of the affected system. Risk integrates the likelihood of exposure to a hazard and the magnitude of its impact. Risk also can describe the potential for adverse consequences of adaptation or mitigation responses to climate change.
Climate-resilient development pathways (CRDPs): Trajectories that strengthen sustainable development at multiple scales and efforts to eradicate poverty through equitable societal and systems transitions and transformations while reducing the threat of climate change through ambitious mitigation, adaptation and climate resilience.

Introduction
This Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) was prepared following an IPCC Panel decision in 2016 to prepare three Special Reports during the Sixth Assessment Cycle3 4. By assessing new scientific literature3, the SROCC5 responds to government and observer organization proposals. The SROCC follows the other two Special Reports on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SRI .5) and on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)6 and the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) compiles key findings of the report and is structured in three parts: SPM.A: Observed Changes and Impacts, SPM.B: Projected Changes and Risks, and SPM.C: Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change. To assist navigation of the SPM, icons indicate where content can be found. Confidence in key findings is reported using IPCC calibrated language7 and the underlying scientific basis for each key finding is indicated by references to sections of the underlying report.



Summary for Policymakers
Startup Box | The Importance of the Ocean and Cryosphere for People
All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71 % of the Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth's water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system1. Around 10% of Earth's land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1,1.2}
Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains8 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone9 is currently home to around 680 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4-8.7% of the projected global population). {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}
In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values, tourism, trade, and transport. The state of the ocean and cryosphere interacts with each aspect of sustainability reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). {1.1,1.2,1.5}
                      |ce sheets and glaciers worldwide have lost mass (very high confidence). Between 2006 and 2015# the Greenland Ice Sheet9 lost ice mass at an average rate of 278 ±11 Gtyr1 (equivalent to 0.77 ± 0.03 mm yr1 of global sea level rise)10, mostly due to surface melting (high confidence). In 2006-2015, the Antarctic Ice Sheet lost mass at an average rate of 155 ± 19 Gt yr1 (0.43 ± 0.05 mm yr1), mostly due to rapid thinning and retreat of major outlet glaciers draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (very high confidence). Glaciers worldwide outside Greenland and Antarctica lost mass at an average rate of 220 ± 30 Gt yr-1 (equivalent to 0.61 ± 0.08 mm yr-1 sea level rise) in 2006-2015. {3.3.1,4.2.3, Appendix 2.A, Figure SPM.1}
 A.1.2	Arctic June snow cover extent on land declined by 13.4 ± 5.4% per decade from 1967
to 2018, a total loss of approximately 2.5 million km2, predominantly due to surface air temperature increase (high confidence). In nearly all high mountain areas, the depth, extent and duration of snow cover have declined over recent decades, especially at lower elevation (high confidence). {2.2.2, 3.4.1, Figure SPM.1}










































Summary for Policymakers
Box SPM.1 I Use of Climate Change Scenarios in SROCC
Assessments of projected future changes in this report are based largely on CMIP510 climate model projections using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCPs are scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use / land cover. RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of global warming. {Annex I: Glossary}
This report uses mainly RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in its assessment, reflecting the available literature. RCP2.6 represents a low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C by 210011. By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming. {Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Table SPM.1 provides estimates of total warming since the pre-industrial period under four different RCPs for key assessment intervals used in SROCC. The warming from the 1850-1900 period until 1986-2005 has been assessed as 0.63°C (0.57°C to 0.69°C likely range) using observations of near-surface air temperature over the ocean and over land.12 Consistent with the approach in AR5, modelled future changes in global mean surface air temperature relative to 1986-2005 are added to this observed warming. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}
Table SPM.11 Projected global mean surface temperature change relative to 1850-1900 for two time periods under four RCPs15 {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}


A.2 It is virtually certain that the global ocean has warmed unabated since 1970 and has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system (high confidence). Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled (likely). Marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity (very high confidence). By absorbing more CO2, the ocean has undergone increasing surface acidification (virtually certain). A loss of oxygen has occurred from the surface to 1000 m (medium confidence). (1.4,3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.7, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
               The ocean warming trend documented in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) has continued. Since 1993 the rate of ocean warming and thus heat uptake has more than doubled (likely) from 3.22 ±1.61 ZJ yr1 (0-700 m depth) and 0.97 ± 0.64 ZJ yr1 (700-2000 m) between 1969 and 1993, to 6.28 ± 0.48 ZJ yr1 (0-700 m) and 3.86 ± 2.09 ZJ yr1 (700-2000 m) between 1993 and 201717# and is attributed to anthropogenic forcing (very likely). {1.4.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.1}
               
               The Southern Ocean accounted for 35-43% of the total heat gain in the upper 2000 m global ocean between 1970 and 2017 (high confidence). Its share increased to 45-62% between 2005 and 2017 (high confidence). The deep ocean below 2000 m has warmed since 1992 (likely), especially in the Southern Ocean. {1.4, 3.2.1, 5.2.2, Table 5.1, Figure SPM.2}
            
               Globally, marine heat-related events have increased; marine heatwaves18, defined when the daily sea surface temperature exceeds the local 99th percentile over the period 1982 to 2016, have doubled in frequency and have become longer-lasting, more intense and more extensive (very likely). It is very likely that between 84-90% of marine heatwaves that occurred between 2006 and 2015 are attributable to the anthropogenic temperature increase. {Table 6.2, 6.4, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
        
               Density stratification19 has increased in the upper 200 m of the ocean since 1970 (very likely). Observed surface ocean warming and high latitude addition of freshwater are making the surface ocean less dense relative to deeper parts of the ocean (high confidence) and inhibiting mixing between surface and deeper waters (high confidence). The mean stratification of the upper 200 m has increased by 2.3 ± 0.1 % (very likely range) from the 1971-1990 average to the 1998-2017 average. {5.2.2}
       
               The ocean has taken up between 20-30% (very likely) of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the 1980s causing further ocean acidification. Open ocean surface pH has declined by a very likely range of 0.017-0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s20, with the decline in surface ocean pH very likely to have already emerged from background natural variability for more than 95% of the ocean surface area. {3.2.1, 5.2.2, Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
 17 ZJ is Zettajoule and is equal to 1021 Joules. Warming the entire ocean by 1 °C requires about 5500 ZJ; 144 ZJ would warm the top 100 m by about 1°C.
18 A marine heatwave is a period of extreme warm near-sea surface temperature that persists for days to months and can extend up to thousands of kilometres (Annex I: Glossary).
19 In this report density stratification is defined as the density contrast between shallower and deeper layers. Increased stratification reduces the vertical exchange of heat, salinity, oxygen, carbon, and nutrients.
 20 Based on in-situ records longer than fifteen years.











































 Datasets spanning 1970-2010 show that the open ocean has lost oxygen by a very likely range of 0.5-3.3% over the upper 1000 m# alongside a likely expansion of the volume of oxygen minimum zones by 3-8% (medium confidence). Oxygen loss is primarily due to increasing ocean stratification, changing ventilation and biogeochemistry (high confidence). {5.2.2, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2}
Observations, both in situ (2004-2017) and based on sea surface temperature reconstructions, indicate that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)13 has weakened relative to 1850-1900 (medium confidence). There is insufficient data to quantify the magnitude of the weakening, or to properly attribute it to anthropogenic forcing due to the limited length of the observational record. Although attribution is currently not possible, CMIP5 model simulations of the period 1850-2015, on average, exhibit a weakening AMOC when driven by anthropogenic forcing. {6.7}
A. 3 Global mean sea level (GMSL) is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence), as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. Increases in tropical cyclone winds and rainfall, and increases in extreme waves, combined with relative sea level rise, exacerbate extreme sea level events and coastal hazards (high confidence). (3.3, 4.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM.4, SPM.5}
     ,•?$•]. H Total GMSL rise for 1902-2015 is 0.16 m (likely range 0.12-0.21 m). The rate of GMSL rise for 2006-2015 of 3.6 mmyr1 (3.1-4.1 mmyr1, very likely range), is unprecedented over the last century (high confidence), and about 2.5 times the rate for 1901-1990 of 1.4 mm yr1 (0.8- 2.0 mm yr1, very likely range). The sum of ice sheet and glacier contributions over the period 2006-2015 is the dominant source of sea level rise (1.8 mm yr-1, very likely range 1.7-1.9 mm yr-1), exceeding the effect of thermal expansion of ocean water (1.4 mm yr-1, very likely range 1.1-1.7 mm yr1)14 (very high confidence). The dominant cause of global mean sea level rise since 1970 is anthropogenic forcing (high confidence). {4.2.1,4.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
A.3.2	Ll^á	Sea level rise has accelerated (extremely likely) due to the combined increased ice loss from
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (very high confidence). Mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet over the period 2007-2016 tripled relative to 1997-2006. For Greenland, mass loss doubled over the same period (likely, medium confidence). {3.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.2, SPM A.1.1}
Acceleration of ice flow and retreat in Antarctica, which has the potential to lead to sea level rise of several metres within a few centuries, is observed in the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica and in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica (very high confidence). These changes may be the onset of an irreversible15 ice sheet instability. Uncertainty related to the onset of ice sheet instability arises from limited observations, inadequate model representation of ice sheet processes, and limited understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean and the ice sheet. {3.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.2.3}
A.3.4	Sea level rise is	 not globally uniform and varies regionally. Regional differences, within ±30%
of the global mean sea level rise, result from land ice loss and variations in ocean warming and circulation. Differences from the global mean can be greater in areas of rapid vertical land movement including from local human activities (e.g. extraction of groundwater), (high confidence) {4.2.2, 5.2.2, 6.2.2, 6.3.1, 6.8.2, Figure SPM.2}


 A.3.5 ÏZZSà	Extreme	wave	heights,	which contribute to extreme sea level events, coastal erosion and
flooding, have increased in the Southern and North Atlantic Oceans by around 1.0 cm yr1 and 0.8 cm yr1 over the period 1985-2018 (medium confidence). Sea ice loss in the Arctic has also increased wave heights over the period 1992-2014 (medium confidence). {4.2.2, 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
 A.3.6	Anthropogenic	climate	change	has	increased	observed	precipitation	(medium confidence),
winds (low confidence), and extreme sea level events (high confidence) associated with some tropical cyclones, which has increased intensity of multiple extreme events and associated cascading impacts (high confidence). Anthropogenic climate change may have contributed to a poleward migration of maximum tropical cyclone intensity in the western North Pacific in recent decades related to anthropogenically-forced tropical expansion (low confidence). There is emerging evidence for an increase in annual global proportion of Category 4 or 5 tropical cyclones in recent decades (low confidence). {6.2, Table 6.2, 6.3, 6.8, Box 6.1}
 Observed Impacts on Ecosystems
A. 4 Cryospheric and associated hydrological changes have impacted terrestrial and freshwater species and ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions through the appearance of land previously covered by ice, changes in snow cover, and thawing permafrost. These changes have contributed to changing the seasonal activities, abundance and distribution of ecologically, culturally, and economically important plant and animal species, ecological disturbances, and ecosystem functioning, (high confidence) (2.3.2, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
 A.4.1	^5	EH	Over	the last century some species of plants and animals have increased in abundance, shifted
their range, and established in new areas as glaciers receded and the snow-free season lengthened (high confidence). Together with warming, these changes have increased locally the number of species in high mountains, as lower-elevation species migrate upslope (very high confidence). Some cold-adapted or snow-dependent species have declined in abundance, increasing their risk of extinction, notably on mountain summits (high confidence). In polar and mountain regions, many species have altered seasonal activities especially in late winter and spring (high confidence). {2.3.3, Box 3.4}
 A.4.2	Increased wildfire and abrupt permafrost thaw, as well as changes in Arctic and mountain
hydrology have altered frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbances (high confidence).T\\\s has included positive and negative impacts on vegetation and wildlife such as reindeer and salmon (high confidence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
 Across tundra, satellite observations show an overall greening, often indicative of increased plant productivity (high confidence). Some browning areas in tundra and boreal forest are indicative that productivity has decreased (high confidence). These changes have negatively affected provisioning, regulating and cultural ecosystem services, with also some transient positive impacts for provisioning services, in both high mountains (medium confidence) and polar regions (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.3, Annex I: Glossary}
11


A. 5 Since about 1950 many marine species across various groups have undergone shifts in geographical range and seasonal activities in response to ocean warming, sea ice change and biogeochemical changes, such as oxygen loss, to their habitats (high confidence). This has resulted in shifts in species composition, abundance and biomass production of ecosystems, from the equator to the poles. Altered interactions between species have caused cascading impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning (medium confidence). In some marine ecosystems species are impacted by both the effects of fishing and climate changes (medium confidence). (3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}
Rates of poleward shifts in distributions across different marine species since the 1950s are 52 ± 33 km per decade and 29 ± 16 km per decade (very likely ranges) for organisms in the epipelagic (upper 200 m from sea surface) and seafloor ecosystems, respectively. The rate and direction of observed shifts in distributions are shaped by local temperature, oxygen, and ocean currents across depth, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients (high confidence). Warming-induced species range expansions have led to altered ecosystem structure and functioning such as in the North Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Arctic (medium confidence). {5.2.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, Box 3.4, Figure SPM.2}
K4* In recent decades, Arctic net primary production has increased in ice-free waters (high confidence) and spring phytoplankton blooms are occurring earlier in the year in response to sea ice change and nutrient availability with spatially variable positive and negative consequences for marine ecosystems (medium confidence). In the Antarctic, such changes are spatially heterogeneous and have been associated with rapid local environmental change, including retreating glaciers and sea ice change (medium confidence). Changes in the seasonal activities, production and distribution of some Arctic zooplankton and a southward shift in the distribution of the Antarctic krill population in the South Atlantic are associated with climate-linked environmental changes (medium confidence). In polar regions, ice associated marine mammals and seabirds have experienced habitat contraction linked to sea ice changes (high confidence) and impacts on foraging success due to climate impacts on prey distributions (medium confidence). Cascading effects of multiple climate-related drivers on polar zooplankton have affected food web structure and function, biodiversity as well as fisheries (high confidence). {3.2.3, 3.2.4, Box 3.4, 5.2.3, Figure SPM.2}
Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are amongst the most productive ocean ecosystems. Increasing ocean acidification and oxygen loss are negatively impacting two of the four major upwelling systems: the California Current and Humboldt Current (high confidence). Ocean acidification and decrease in oxygen level in the California Current upwelling system have altered ecosystem structure, with direct negative impacts on biomass production and species composition (medium confidence). {Box 5.3, Figure SPM.2}
A.5.4	Ocean	warming	in	the	20th	century	and	beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in
maximum catch potential (medium confidence), compounding the impacts from overfishing for some fish stocks (high confidence). In many regions, declines in the abundance of fish and shellfish stocks due to direct and indirect effects of global warming and biogeochemical changes have already contributed to reduced fisheries catches (high confidence). In some areas, changing ocean conditions have contributed to the expansion of suitable habitat and/ or increases in the abundance of some species (high confidence). These changes have been accompanied by changes in species composition of fisheries catches since the 1970s in many ecosystems (medium confidence). {3.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.2}
12

A. 6 Coastal ecosystems are affected by ocean warming, including intensified marine heatwaves, acidification, loss of oxygen, salinity intrusion and sea level rise, in combination with adverse effects from human activities on ocean and land (high confidence). Impacts are already observed on habitat area and biodiversity, as well as ecosystem functioning and services (high confidence). (4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3, 5.4.1, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Vegetated coastal ecosystems protect the coastline from storms and erosion and help buffer the impacts of sea level rise. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events (high confidence). Vegetated coastal ecosystems are important carbon stores; their loss is responsible for the current release of 0.04-1.46 GtC yr1 (medium confidence). In response to warming, distribution ranges of seagrass meadows and kelp forests are expanding at high latitudes and contracting at low latitudes since the late 1970s (high confidence), and in some areas episodic losses occur following heatwaves (medium confidence). Large-scale mangrove mortality that is related to warming since the 1960s has been partially offset by their encroachment into subtropical saltmarshes as a result of increase in temperature, causing the loss of open areas with herbaceous plants that provide food and habitat for dependent fauna (high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.6, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Increased sea water intrusion in estuaries due to sea level rise has driven upstream redistribution of marine species (medium confidence) and caused a reduction of suitable habitats for estuarine communities (medium confidence). Increased nutrient and organic matter loads in estuaries since the 1970s from intensive human development and riverine loads have exacerbated the stimulating effects of ocean warming on bacterial respiration, leading to expansion of low oxygen areas (high confidence). {5.3.1}
              K4* The impacts of sea level rise on coastal ecosystems include habitat contraction, geographical shift of associated species, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functionality. Impacts are exacerbated by direct human disturbances, and where anthropogenic barriers prevent landward shift of marshes and mangroves (termed coastal squeeze) (high confidence). Depending on local geomorphology and sediment supply, marshes and mangroves can grow vertically at rates equal to or greater than current mean sea level rise (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3, 5.3.2, 5.3.7, 5.4.1}
              K4* Warm-water coral reefs and rocky shores dominated by immobile, calcifying (e.g., shell and skeleton producing) organisms such as corals, barnacles and mussels, are currently impacted by extreme temperatures and ocean acidification (high confidence). Marine heatwaves have already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events at increasing frequency (very high confidence) causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997, and recovery is slow (more than 15 years) if it occurs (high confidence). Prolonged periods of high environmental temperature and dehydration of the organisms pose high risk to rocky shore ecosystems (high confidence). {SR.1.5; 5.3.4, 5.3.5, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.2}

Observed Impacts on People and Ecosystem Services
A.7 Since the mid-20th century, the shrinking cryosphere in the Arctic and high mountain areas has led to predominantly negative impacts on food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation, as well as culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous peoples (high confidence). Costs and benefits have been unequally distributed across populations and regions. Adaptation efforts have benefited from the inclusion of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (high confidence). {1.1,1.5,1.6.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.4, 3.5, Figure SPM.2}
A.7.1	^3	Food and water security have been negatively impacted by changes in snow cover, lake and
river ice, and permafrost in many Arctic regions (high confidence). These changes have disrupted access to, and food availability within, herding, hunting, fishing, and gathering areas, harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations (high confidence). Glacier retreat and snow cover changes have contributed to localized declines in agricultural yields in some high mountain regions, including Hindu Kush Himalaya and the tropical Andes (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, Figure SPM.2}
In the Arctic, negative impacts of cryosphere change on human health have included
increased risk of food- and waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury, and mental health challenges especially among Indigenous peoples (high confidence). In some high mountain areas, water quality has been affected by contaminants, particularly mercury, released from melting glaciers and thawing permafrost (medium confidence). Health-related adaptation efforts in the Arctic range from local to international in scale, and successes have been underpinned by Indigenous knowledge (high confidence). {1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 3.4.3}
Arctic	 residents,	especially 	Indigenous	 peoples,	have adjusted the timing of activities to respond to changes in seasonality and safety of land, ice, and snow travel conditions. Municipalities and industry are beginning to address infrastructure failures associated with flooding and thawing permafrost and some coastal communities have planned for relocation (high confidence). Limited funding, skills, capacity, and institutional support to engage meaningfully in planning processes have challenged adaptation (high confidence). {3.5.2, 3.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9}

Summertime Arctic ship-based transportation (including tourism) increased over the past two
decades concurrent with sea ice reductions (high con/7c/e/7ce). This has implications for global trade and economies linked to traditional shipping corridors, and poses risks to Arctic marine ecosystems and coastal communities (high confidence), such as from invasive species and local pollution. {3.2.1, 3.2.4, 3.5.4, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}

In past decades, exposure of people and infrastructure to natural hazards has increased due to growing population, tourism and socioeconomic development (high confidence). Some disasters have been linked to changes in the cryosphere, for example in the Andes, high mountain Asia, Caucasus and European Alps (medium confidence). {2.3.2, Figure SPM.2}
Changes in snow and glaciers have changed the amount and seasonality of runoff and water resources in snow dominated and glacier-fed river basins (very high confidence). Hydropower facilities have experienced changes in seasonality and both increases and decreases in water input from high mountain areas, for example, in central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and tropical Andes (medium confidence). However, there is only limited evidence of resulting impacts on operations and energy production. {SPM B.1.4, 2.3.1}
a.7.7 rm	High	mountain	aesthetic	and	cultural	aspects	have been negatively impacted by glacier
and snow cover decline (e.g. in the Himalaya, East Africa, the tropical Andes) (medium confidence). Tourism and recreation, including ski and glacier tourism, hiking, and mountaineering, have also been negatively impacted in many mountain regions (medium confidence). In some places, artificial snowmaking has reduced negative impacts on ski tourism (medium confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6, Figure SPM.2}
A. 8 Changes in the ocean have impacted marine ecosystems and ecosystem services with regionally diverse outcomes, challenging their governance (high confidence). Both positive and negative impacts result for food security through fisheries (medium confidence), local cultures and livelihoods (medium confidence), and tourism and recreation (medium confidence). The impacts on ecosystem services have negative consequences for health and well-being (medium confidence), and for Indigenous peoples and local communities dependent on fisheries (high confidence). {1.1,1.5, 3.2.1, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, Figure SPM.2}
A.8.1	iS*	Warming-induced	changes	in	the	spatial	distribution	and	abundance of some fish and
shellfish stocks have had positive and negative impacts on catches, economic benefits, livelihoods, and local culture (high confidence). There are negative consequences for Indigenous peoples and local communities that are dependent on fisheries (high confidence). Shifts in species distributions and abundance has challenged international and national ocean and fisheries governance, including in the Arctic, North Atlantic and Pacific, in terms of regulating fishing to secure ecosystem integrity and sharing of resources between fishing entities (high confidence). {3.2.4, 3.5.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.2}
              K4* Harmful algal blooms display range expansion and increased frequency in coastal areas since the 1980s in response to both climatic and non-climatic drivers such as increased riverine nutrients run-off (high confidence). The observed trends in harmful algal blooms are attributed partly to the effects of ocean warming, marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication and pollution (high confidence). Harmful algal blooms have had negative impacts on food security, tourism, local economy, and human health (high confidence). The human communities who are more vulnerable to these biological hazards are those in areas without sustained monitoring programs and dedicated early warning systems for harmful algal blooms (medium confidence). {Box 5.4, 5.4.2,6.4.2}
A. 9 Coastal communities are exposed to multiple climate-related hazards, including tropical cyclones, extreme sea levels and flooding, marine heatwaves, sea ice loss, and permafrost thaw (high confidence). A diversity of responses has been implemented worldwide, mostly after extreme events, but also some in anticipation of future sea level rise, e.g., in the case of large infrastructure. {3.2.4, 3.4.3, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 5.4.2, 6.2, 6.4.2, 6.8, Box 6.1, Cross Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
A.9.1	Attribution	of	current	coastal	impacts	on	people	to sea level rise remains difficult in
most locations since impacts were exacerbated by human-induced non-climatic drivers, such as land subsidence (e.g., groundwater extraction), pollution, habitat degradation, reef and sand mining (high confidence). {4.3.2, 4.3.3}
A.9.2	L2a	Coastal protection through hard measures, such as dikes, seawalls, and surge barriers, is
widespread in many coastal cities and deltas. Ecosystem-based and hybrid approaches combining ecosystems and built infrastructure are becoming more popular worldwide. Coastal advance, which refers to the creation of new land by building seawards (e.g., land reclamation), has a long history in most areas where there are dense coastal populations and a shortage of land. Coastal retreat, which refers to the removal of human occupation of coastal areas, is also observed, but is generally restricted to small human communities or occurs to create coastal wetland habitat. The effectiveness of the responses to sea level rise are assessed in Figure SPM.5. {3.5.3, 4.3.3, 4.4.2, 6.3.3, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9}
B. Projected Changes and Risks
Projected Physical Changes16
B. 1 Global-scale glacier mass loss, permafrost thaw, and decline in snow cover and Arctic sea ice extent are projected to continue in the near-term (2031-2050) due to surface air temperature increases (high confidence), with unavoidable consequences for river runoff and local hazards (high confidence). The Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets are projected to lose mass at an increasing rate throughout the 21st century and beyond (high confidence). The rates and magnitudes of these cryospheric changes are projected to increase further in the second half of the 21st century in a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (high confidence). Strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades are projected to reduce further changes after 2050 (high confidence). (2.2, 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, 3.3, 3.4, Figure SPM.1, SPM Box SPM.1}
                     Projected glacier mass reductions between 2015 and 2100 (excluding the ice sheets) range from 18 ± 7% (likely range) for RCP2.6 to 36 ± 11 % (likely range) for RCP8.5, corresponding to a sea level contribution of 94 ± 25 mm (likely range) sea level equivalent for RCP2.6, and 200 ± 44 mm (likely range) for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). Regions with mostly smaller glaciers (e.g., Central Europe, Caucasus, North Asia, Scandinavia, tropical Andes, Mexico, eastern Africa and Indonesia), are projected to lose more than 80% of their current ice mass by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence), and many glaciers are projected to disappear regardless of future emissions (very high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 2, Figure SPM.1}
B. i .2 a	In	2100, the Greenland Ice Sheet's projected contribution to GMSL rise is 0.07 m (0.04-0.12 m,
likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.15 m (0.08-0.27 m, likely range) under RCP8.5. In 2100, the Antarctic Ice Sheet is projected to contribute 0.04 m (0.01-0.11 m, likely range) under RCP2.6, and 0.12 m (0.03-0.28 m, likely range) under RCP8.5.The Greenland Ice Sheet is currently contributing more to sea level rise than the Antarctic Ice Sheet (high confidence), but Antarctica could become a larger contributor by the end of the 21 st century as a consequence of rapid retreat (low confidence). Beyond 2100, increasing divergence between Greenland and Antarctica's relative contributions to GMSL rise under RCP8.5 has important consequences for the pace of relative sea level rise in the Northern Flemisphere. {3.3.1,4.2.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, Figure SPM.1}
B. I.3	Arctic	autumn and spring snow cover are projected to decrease by 5-10%, relative to
1986-2005, in the near-term (2031-2050), followed by no further losses under RCP2.6, but an additional 15-25% loss by the end of century under RCP8.5 (high confidence). In high mountain areas, projected decreases in low elevation mean winter snow depth, compared to 1986-2005, are likely 10-40% by 2031-2050, regardless of emissions scenario (high confidence). For 2081-2100, this projected decrease is likely 10-40% for RCP2.6 and 50-90% for RCP8.5. {2.2.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, Figure SPM.1}

B.1.4
 ^3 Widespread permafrost thaw is projected for this century (very high confidence) and beyond. By 2100, projected near-surface (within 3-4 m) permafrost area shows a decrease of 24 ± 16% (likely range) for RCP2.6 and 69 ± 20% (likely range) for RCP8.5. The RCP8.5 scenario leads to the cumulative release of tens to hundreds of billions of tons (GtC) of permafrost carbon as CO226 and methane to the atmosphere by 2100 with the potential to exacerbate climate change (medium confidence). Lower emissions scenarios dampen the response of carbon emissions from the permafrost region (high confidence). Methane contributes a small fraction of the total additional carbon release but is significant because of its higher warming potential. Increased plant growth is projected to replenish soil carbon in part, but will not match carbon releases over the long term (medium confidence). {2.2.4, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, Figure SPM.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1}
B.1.5
 ^3 In many high mountain areas, glacier retreat and permafrost thaw are projected to further decrease the stability of slopes, and the number and area of glacier lakes will continue to increase (high confidence). Floods due to glacier lake outburst or rain-on-snow, landslides and snow avalanches, are projected to occur also in new locations or different seasons (high confidence). {2.3.2}
B.1.6
 ^3 River runoff in snow-dominated or glacier-fed high mountain basins is projected to change regardless of emissions scenario (very high confidence), with increases in average winter runoff (high confidence) and earlier spring peaks (very high confidence). In all emissions scenarios, average annual and summer runoff from glaciers are projected to peak at or before the end of the 21 st century (high confidence), e.g., around mid-century in High Mountain Asia, followed by a decline in glacier runoff. In regions with little glacier cover (e.g., tropical Andes, European Alps) most glaciers have already passed this peak (high confidence). Projected declines in glacier runoff by 2100 (RCP8.5) can reduce basin runoff by 10% or more in at least one month of the melt season in several large river basins, especially in High Mountain Asia during the dry season (low confidence). {2.3.1}
B.1.7
                      Arctic sea ice loss is projected to continue through mid-century, with differences thereafter depending on the magnitude of global warming: for stabilised global warming of 1.5°C the annual probability of a sea ice-free September by the end of century is approximately 1%, which rises to 10-35% for stabilised global warming of 2°C (high confidence). There is low confidence in projections for Antarctic sea ice. {3.2.2, Figure SPM.1}
B.2
 Over the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions with increased temperatures (virtually certain), greater upper ocean stratification (very likely), further acidification (virtually certain), oxygen decline (medium confidence), and altered net primary production (low confidence). Marine heatwaves (very high confidence) and extreme El Niño and La Niña events (medium confidence) are projected to become more frequent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is projected to weaken (very likely). The rates and magnitudes of these changes will be smaller under scenarios with low greenhouse gas emissions (very likely). (3.2, 5.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.7, Box 5.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.3}
B.2.1
                      The ocean will continue to warm throughout the 21st century (virtually certain). By 2100, the top 2000 m of the ocean are projected to take up 5-7 times more heat under RCP8.5 (or 2-4 times more under RCP2.6) than the observed accumulated ocean heat uptake since 1970 (very likely). The annual mean density stratification19 of the top 200 m, averaged between 60°S and 60°N, is projected to increase by 12-30% for RCP8.5 and 1-9% for RCP2.6, for 2081-2100 relative to 1986-2005 (very likely), inhibiting vertical nutrient, carbon and oxygen fluxes. {5.2.2, Figure SPM.1}













































B. Sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate. Extreme sea level events that are historically rare (once per century in the recent past) are projected to occur frequently (at least once per year) at many locations by 2050 in all RCP scenarios, especially in tropical regions (high confidence). The increasing frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many locations depending on exposure (high confidence). Sea level rise is projected to continue beyond 2100 in all RCP scenarios. For a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), projections of global sea level rise by 2100 are greater than in AR5 due to a larger contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence). In coming centuries under RCP8.5, sea-level rise is projected to exceed rates of several centimetres per year resulting in multi-metre rise (medium confidence), while for RCP2.6 sea level rise is projected to be limited to around 1 m in 2300 (low confidence). Extreme sea levels and coastal hazards will be exacerbated by projected increases in tropical cyclone intensity and precipitation (high confidence). Projected changes in waves and tides vary locally in whether they amplify or ameliorate these hazards (medium confidence). (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.1, 4.2, 5.2.2, 6.3.1, Figures SPM.1, SPM.4, SPM.5}
                     The global mean sea level (GMSL) rise under RCP2.6 is projected to be 0.39 m (0.26-0.53 m# likely range) for the period 2081 -2100# and 0.43 m (0.29-0.59 m# likely range) in 2100 with respect to 1986-2005. For RCP8.5, the corresponding GMSL rise is 0.71 m (0.51-0.92 m# likely range) for 2081-2100 and 0.84 m (0.61-1.10 m, likely range) in 2100. Mean sea level rise projections are higher by 0.1 m compared toAR5 under RCP8.5 in 2100, and the likely range extends beyond 1 m in 2100 due to a larger projected ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (medium confidence). The uncertainty at the end of the century is mainly determined by the ice sheets, especially in Antarctica. {4.2.3, Figures SPM.1, SPM.5}
              K4* Sea level projections show regional differences around GMSL. Processes not driven by recent climate change, such as local subsidence caused by natural processes and human activities, are important to relative sea level changes at the coast (high confidence). While the relative importance of climate-driven sea level rise is projected to increase over time, local processes need to be considered for projections and impacts of sea level (high confidence). {SPM A.3.4, 4.2.1,4.2.2, Figure SPM.5}
                     The rate of global mean sea level rise is projected to reach 15 mm yr1 (10-20 mm yr\ likely range) under RCP8.5 in 2100, and to exceed several centimetres per year in the 22nd century. Under RCP2.6, the rate is projected to reach 4 mm yr'1 (2-6 mm yr1, likely range) in 2100. Model studies indicate multi-meter rise in sea level by 2300 (2.3-5.4 m for RCP8.5 and 0.6-1.07 m under RCP2.6) (low confidence), indicating the importance of reduced emissions for limiting sea level rise. Processes controlling the timing of future ice-shelf loss and the extent of ice sheet instabilities could increase Antarctica's contribution to sea level rise to values substantially higher than the likely range on century and longer time-scales (low confidence). Considering the consequences of sea level rise that a collapse of parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet entails, this high impact risk merits attention. {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 8 in Chapter 3, 4.1,4.2.3}
B. 3.4	Global mean sea level rise will cause the frequency of extreme sea level events at most
locations to increase. Local sea levels that historically occurred once per century (historical centennial events) are projected to occur at least annually at most locations by 2100 under all RCP scenarios (high confidence). Many low-lying megacities and small islands (including SIDS) are projected to experience historical centennial events at least annually by 2050 under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The year when the historical centennial event becomes an annual event in the mid-latitudes occurs soonest in RCP8.5, next in RCP4.5 and latest in RCP2.6. The increasing frequency of high water levels can have severe impacts in many locations depending on the level of exposure (high confidence). {4.2.3, 6.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}



                     Significant wave heights (the average height from trough to crest of the highest one-third of waves) are projected to increase across the Southern Ocean and tropical eastern Pacific (high confidence) and Baltic Sea (medium confidence) and decrease over the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea under RCP8.5 (high confidence). Coastal tidal amplitudes and patterns are projected to change due to sea level rise and coastal adaptation measures (very likely). Projected changes in waves arising from changes in weather patterns, and changes in tides due to sea level rise, can locally enhance or ameliorate coastal hazards (medium confidence). {6.3.1, 5.2.2}
B. 3.6	The	average	intensity	of	tropical	cyclones,	the proportion of Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones
and the associated average precipitation rates are projected to increase for a 2°C global temperature rise above any baseline period (medium confidence). Rising mean sea levels will contribute to higher extreme sea levels associated with tropical cyclones (very high confidence). Coastal hazards will be exacerbated by an increase in the average intensity, magnitude of storm surge and precipitation rates of tropical cyclones. There are greater increases projected under RCP8.5 than under RCP2.6 from around mid-century to 2100 (medium confidence). There is low confidence in changes in the future frequency of tropical cyclones at the global scale. {6.3.1}
Projected Risks for Ecosystems
B.4 Future land cryosphere changes will continue to alter terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems in high mountain and polar regions with major shifts in species distributions resulting in changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and eventual loss of globally unique biodiversity (medium confidence). Wildfire is projected to increase significantly for the rest of this century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain regions (medium confidence). (2.3.3, Box 3.4, 3.4.3}
B.4.1 m	In	high	mountain	regions,	further	upslope	migration by lower-elevation species, range
contractions, and increased mortality will lead to population declines of many alpine species, especially glacier- or snow-dependent species (high confidence), with local and eventual global species loss (medium confidence). The persistence of alpine species and sustaining ecosystem services depends on appropriate conservation and adaptation measures (high confidence). {2.3.3}
 B.4.2	On	Arctic	land,	a	loss of globally unique biodiversity is projected as limited refugia exist for
some High-Arctic species and hence they are outcompeted by more temperate species (medium confidence).\Noo6y shrubs and trees are projected to expand to cover 24-52% of Arctic tundra by 2050 (medium confidence).Jhe boreal forest is projected to expand at its northern edge, while diminishing at its southern edge where it is replaced by lower biomass woodland/shrublands (medium confidence). {3.4.3, Box 3.4}
B.4.3 QÉ0 Lî-îl	Permafrost	thaw and decrease in snow will affect Arctic and mountain hydrology and wildfire,
with impacts on vegetation and wildlife (medium confidence). About 20% of Arctic land permafrost is vulnerable to abrupt permafrost thaw and ground subsidence, which is projected to increase small lake area by over 50% by 2100 for RCP8.5 (medium confidence). Even as the overall regional water cycle is projected to intensify, including increased precipitation, évapotranspiration, and river discharge to the Arctic Ocean, decreases in snow and permafrost may lead to soil drying with consequences for ecosystem productivity and disturbances (medium confidence). Wildfire is projected to increase for the rest of this century across most tundra and boreal regions, and also in some mountain regions, while interactions between climate and shifting vegetation will influence future fire intensity and frequency (medium confidence). {2.3.3, 3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, SPM B.1}
21

B.5 A decrease in global biomass of marine animal communities, their production, and fisheries catch potential, and a shift in species composition are projected over the 21st century in ocean ecosystems from the surface to the deep seafloor under all emission scenarios (medium confidence). The rate and magnitude of decline are projected to be highest in the tropics (high confidence), whereas impacts remain diverse in polar regions (medium confidence) and increase for high emissions scenarios. Ocean acidification (medium confidence), oxygen loss (medium confidence) and reduced sea ice extent (medium confidence) as well as non-climatic human activities (medium confidence) have the potential to exacerbate these warming-induced ecosystem impacts. (3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.1	K4*	Projected	ocean	warming	and	changes	in	net primary production alter biomass, production
and community structure of marine ecosystems. The global-scale biomass of marine animals across the foodweb is projected to decrease by 15.0 ± 5.9% (very likely range) and the maximum catch potential of fisheries by 20.5-24.1 % by the end of the 21 st century relative to 1986-2005 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). These changes are projected to be very likely three to four times larger under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6. {3.2.3, 3.3.3, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
B.5.2	K4*	Under enhanced stratification reduced nutrient supply is projected to cause tropical ocean
net primary production to decline by 7-16% (very likely range) for RCP8.5 by 2081-2100 (medium confidence). In tropical regions, marine animal biomass and production are projected to decrease more than the global average under all emissions scenarios in the 21st century (high confidence). Warming and sea ice changes are projected to increase marine net primary production in the Arctic (medium confidence) and around Antarctica (low confidence), modified by changing nutrient supply due to shifts in upwelling and stratification. Globally, the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean is projected to decrease, linked largely due to changes in net primary production (high confidence). As a result, 95% or more of the deep sea (3000-6000 m depth) seafloor area and cold-water coral ecosystems are projected to experience declines in benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {3.2.3, 5.2.2. 5.2.4, Figure SPM.1}
              K4* Warming, ocean acidification, reduced seasonal sea ice extent and continued loss of multi-year sea ice are projected to impact polar marine ecosystems through direct and indirect effects on habitats, populations and their viability (medium confidence). The geographical range of Arctic marine species, including marine mammals, birds and fish is projected to contract, while the range of some sub-Arctic fish communities is projected to expand, further increasing pressure on high-Arctic species (medium confidence). In the Southern Ocean, the habitat of Antarctic krill, a key prey species for penguins, seals and whales, is projected to contract southwards under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {3.2.2, 3.2.3, 5.2.3}
B.5.4	Ocean	warming,	oxygen	loss,	acidification	and a decrease in flux of organic carbon from the
surface to the deep ocean are projected to harm habitat-forming cold-water corals, which support high biodiversity, partly through decreased calcification, increased dissolution of skeletons, and bioerosion (medium confidence). Vulnerability and risks are highest where and when temperature and oxygen conditions both reach values outside species' tolerance ranges (medium confidence). {Box 5.2, Figure SPM.3}
22







































B.6 Risks of severe impacts on biodiversity, structure and function of coastal ecosystems are projected to be higher for elevated temperatures under high compared to low emissions scenarios in the 21st century and beyond. Projected ecosystem responses include losses of species habitat and diversity, and degradation of ecosystem functions. The capacity of organisms and ecosystems to adjust and adapt is higher at lower emissions scenarios (high confidence). For sensitive ecosystems such as seagrass meadows and kelp forests, high risks are projected if global warming exceeds 2°C above pre-industrial temperature, combined with other climate-related hazards (high confidence). Warm-water corals are at high risk already and are projected to transition to very high risk even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C (very high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3, 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
              K4* All coastal ecosystems assessed are projected to face increasing risk level, from moderate to high risk under RCP2.6 to high to very high risk under RCP8.5 by 2100. Intertidal rocky shore ecosystems are projected to be at very high risk by 2100 under RCP8.5 (medium confidence) due to exposure to warming, especially during marine heatwaves, as well as to acidification, sea level rise, loss of calcifying species and biodiversity (high confidence). Ocean acidification challenges these ecosystems and further limits their habitat suitability (medium confidence) by inhibiting recovery through reduced calcification and enhanced bioerosion. The decline of kelp forests is projected to continue in temperate regions due to warming, particularly under the projected intensification of marine heatwaves, with high risk of local extinctions under RCP8.5 (medium confidence). {5.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.6, 5.3.7, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.3}
              K4* Seagrass meadows and saltmarshes and associated carbon stores are at moderate risk at 1.5°C global warming and increase with further warming (medium confidence). Globally, 20-90% of current coastal wetlands are projected to be lost by 2100, depending on projected sea level rise, regional differences and wetland types, especially where vertical growth is already constrained by reduced sediment supply and landward migration is constrained by steep topography or human modification of shorelines (high confidence). {4.3.3, 5.3.2, Figure SPM.3, SPMA.6.1}

               K4* Ocean warming, sea level rise and tidal changes are projected to expand salinization and hypoxia in estuaries (high confidence) with high risks for some biota leading to migration, reduced survival, and local extinction under high emission scenarios (medium confidence). These impacts are projected to be more pronounced in more vulnerable eutrophic and shallow estuaries with low tidal range in temperate and high latitude regions (medium confidence). {5.2.2, 5.3.1, Figure SPM.3}
               K4* Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5°C (high confidence). The species composition and diversity of remaining reef communities is projected to differ from present-day reefs (very high confidence). {5.3.4, 5.4.1, Figure SPM.3}
Projected Risks for People and Ecosystem Services
B.7 Future cryosphere changes on land are projected to affect water resources and their uses, such as hydropower (high confidence) and irrigated agriculture in and downstream of high mountain areas (medium confidence), as well as livelihoods in the Arctic (medium confidence). Changes in floods, avalanches, landslides, and ground destabilization are projected to increase risk for infrastructure, cultural, tourism, and recreational assets (medium confidence). (2.3,2.3.1,3.4.3}
B.7.1	Disaster	risks	to human settlements and livelihood options in high mountain areas and
the Arctic are expected to increase (medium confidence), due to future changes in hazards such as floods, fires, landslides, avalanches, unreliable ice and snow conditions, and increased exposure of people and infrastructure (high confidence). Current engineered risk reduction approaches are projected to be less effective as hazards change in character (medium confidence). Significant risk reduction and adaptation strategies help avoid increased impacts from mountain flood and landslide hazards as exposure and vulnerability are increasing in many mountain regions during this century (high confidence). {2.3.2, 3.4.3, 3.5.2}
B.7.2	Permafrost	thaw-induced	subsidence	of the land surface is projected to impact overlying
urban and rural communication and transportation infrastructure in the Arctic and in high mountain areas (medium coA7//c/eA7ce).The majority of Arctic infrastructure is located in regions where permafrost thaw is projected to intensify by mid-century. Retrofitting and redesigning infrastructure has the potential to halve the costs arising from permafrost thaw and related climate-change impacts by 2100 (medium confidence). {2.3.4, 3.4.1, 3.4.3}
b.7.3 rm	High	mountain	tourism,	recreation	and	cultural	assets	are	projected	to	be	negatively	affected
by future cryospheric changes (high confidence). Current snowmaking technologies are projected to be less effective in reducing risks to ski tourism in a warmer climate in most parts of Europe, North America, and Japan, in particular at 2°C global warming and beyond (high confidence). {2.3.5, 2.3.6}
25

B.8 Future shifts in fish distribution and decreases in their abundance and fisheries catch potential due to climate change are projected to affect income, livelihoods, and food security of marine resource-dependent communities (medium confidence). Long-term loss and degradation of marine ecosystems compromises the ocean's role in cultural, recreational, and intrinsic values important for human identity and well-being (medium confidence). (3.2.4,3.4.3,5.4.1,5.4.2,6.4}
B.8.1	K4*	Projected	geographical	shifts and decreases of global marine animal biomass and fish catch
potential are more pronounced under RCP8.5 relative to RCP2.6 elevating the risk for income and livelihoods of dependent human communities, particularly in areas that are economically vulnerable (medium confidence). The projected redistribution of resources and abundance increases the risk of conflicts among fisheries, authorities or communities (medium confidence). Challenges to fisheries governance are widespread under RCP8.5 with regional hotspots such as the Arctic and tropical Pacific Ocean (medium confidence). {3.5.2, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.4.2, Figure SPM.3}
B.8.2	The decline in warm-water coral reefs is projected to greatly compromise the services they
provide to society, such as food provision (high confidence), coastal protection (high confidence) and tourism (medium confidence). Increases in the risks for seafood security (medium confidence) associated with decreases in seafood availability are projected to elevate the risk to nutritional health in some communities highly dependent on seafood (medium confidence), such as those in the Arctic, West Africa, and Small Island Developing States. Such impacts compound any risks from other shifts in diets and food systems caused by social and economic changes and climate change over land (medium confidence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, 6.4.2}
			 ^
Global warming compromises seafood safety (medium confidence) through human exposure to elevated bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants and mercury in marine plants and animals (medium confidence), increasing prevalence of waterborne Vibrio pathogens (medium confidence), and heightened likelihood of harmful algal blooms (medium confidence). These risks are projected to be particularly large for human communities with high consumption of seafood, including coastal Indigenous communities (medium confidence), and for economic sectors such as fisheries, aquaculture, and tourism (high confidence). {3.4.3, 5.4.2, Box 5.3}
              ÍI3* Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and their services put key cultural dimensions of lives and livelihoods at risk (medium confidence), including through shifts in the distribution or abundance of harvested species and diminished access to fishing or hunting areas. This includes potentially rapid and irreversible loss of culture and local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, and negative impacts on traditional diets and food security, aesthetic aspects, and marine recreational activities (medium confidence). {3.4.3, 3.5.3, 5.4.2}
26

 B.9	Increased mean and extreme sea level, alongside ocean warming and acidification, are projected
to exacerbate risks for human communities in low-lying coastal areas (high confidence). In Arctic human communities without rapid land uplift, and in urban atoll islands, risks are projected to be moderate to high even under a low emissions scenario (RCP2.6) (medium confidence), including reaching adaptation limits (high confidence). Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), delta regions and resource rich coastal cities are projected to experience moderate to high risk levels after 2050 under current adaptation (medium confidence). Ambitious adaptation including transformative governance is expected to reduce risk (high confidence), but with context-specific benefits. (4.3.3, 4.3.4, SM4.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
 B.9.1	In	the	absence of more ambitious adaptation efforts compared to today, and under current
trends of increasing exposure and vulnerability of coastal communities, risks, such as erosion and land loss, flooding, salinization, and cascading impacts due to mean sea level rise and extreme events are projected to significantly increase throughout this century under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (very high confidence). Under the same assumptions, annual coastal flood damages are projected to increase by 2-3 orders of magnitude by 2100 compared to today (high confidence). {4.3.3, 4.3.4, Box 6.1, 6.8, SM.4.3, Figures SPM.4, SPM.5}

 
     High to very high risks are approached for vulnerable communities in coral reef environments, urban atoll islands and low-lying Arctic locations from sea level rise well before the end of this century in case of high emissions scenarios. This entails adaptation limits being reached, which are the points at which an actor's objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions (high confidence). Reaching adaptation limits (e.g., biophysical, geographical, financial, technical, social, political, and institutional) depends on the emissions scenario and context-specific risk tolerance, and is projected to expand to more areas beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise (medium confidence). Some island nations are likely to become uninhabitable due to climate-related ocean and cryosphere change (medium confidence), but habitability thresholds remain extremely difficult to assess. {4.3.4,4.4.2,4.4.3, 5.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SM.4.3, SPM C.1, Glossary, Figure SPM.5}
                     Globally, a slower rate of climate-related ocean and cryosphere change provides greater adaptation opportunities (high confidence). While there is high confidence that ambitious adaptation, including governance for transformative change, has the potential to reduce risks in many locations, such benefits can vary between locations. At global scale, coastal protection can reduce flood risk by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the 21st century, but depends on investments on the order of tens to several hundreds of billions of US$ per year (high confidence). While such investments are generally cost efficient for densely populated urban areas, rural and poorer areas may be challenged to afford such investments with relative annual costs for some small island states amounting to several percent of GDP (high confidence). Even with major adaptation efforts, residual risks and associated losses are projected to occur (medium confidence), but context-specific limits to adaptation and residual risks remain difficult to assess. {4.1.3, 4.2.2.4, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.4., 4.4.3, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1-2 in Chapter 1, SM.4.3, Figure SPM.5}

C. Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change
Challenges
C. Impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere increasingly challenge current governance efforts to develop and implement adaptation responses from local to global scales, and in some cases pushing them to their limits. People with the highest exposure and vulnerability are often those with lowest capacity to respond (high confidence). (1.5,1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 2-3 in Chapter 1, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.4, 3.2.4, 3.4.3, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 4.1, 4.3.3, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
C. 	The	temporal	scales of climate change impacts in ocean and cryosphere and their societal
consequences operate on time horizons which are longer than those of governance arrangements (e.g.# planning cycles, public and corporate decision making cycles, and financial instruments). Such temporal differences challenge the ability of societies to adequately prepare for and respond to long-term changes including shifts in the frequency and intensity of extreme events (high confidence). Examples include changing landslides and floods in high mountain regions and risks to important species and ecosystems in the Arctic, as well as to low-lying nations and islands, small island nations, other coastal regions and to coral reef ecosystems. {2.3.2, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.3, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, 6.9}
 
C. Governance	arrangements (e.g., marine protected areas, spatial plans and water management
systems) are, in many contexts, too fragmented across administrative boundaries and sectors to provide integrated responses to the increasing and cascading risks from climate-related changes in the ocean and/or cryosphere (high confidence). The capacity of governance systems in polar and ocean regions to respond to climate change impacts has strengthened recently, but this development is not sufficiently rapid or robust to adequately address the scale of increasing projected risks (high confidence). In high mountains, coastal regions and small islands, there are also difficulties in coordinating climate adaptation responses, due to the many interactions of climatic and non-climatic risk drivers (such as inaccessibility, demographic and settlement trends, or land subsidence caused by local activities) across scales, sectors and policy domains (high confidence). {2.3.1, 3.5.3, 4.4.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 5.5.3, Box 5.6, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 1}
C. 	There	are	a	broad	range of identified barriers and limits for adaptation to climate change
in ecosystems (high confidence). Limitations include the space that ecosystems require, non-climatic drivers and human impacts that need to be addressed as part of the adaptation response, the lowering of adaptive capacity of ecosystems because of climate change, and the slower ecosystem recovery rates relative to the recurrence of climate impacts, availability of technology, knowledge and financial support, and existing governance arrangements (medium confidence). {3.5.4, 5.5.2}
C. 	Financial,	technological,	institutional	and	other	barriers	exist	for implementing responses to
current and projected negative impacts of climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere, impeding resilience building and risk reduction measures (high confidence). Whether such barriers reduce adaptation effectiveness or correspond to adaptation limits depends on context specific circumstances, the rate and scale of climate changes and on the ability of societies to turn their adaptive capacity into effective adaptation responses. Adaptive capacity continues to differ between as well as within communities and societies (high confidence). People with highest exposure and vulnerability to current and future hazards from ocean and cryosphere changes are often also those with lowest adaptive capacity, particularly in low-lying islands and coasts, Arctic and high mountain regions with development challenges (high confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.7, Box 2.4, 3.5.2, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 5.5.2, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Boxes 2 and 3 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9}

Strengthening Response Options
C. The far-reaching services and options provided by ocean and cryosphere-related ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors (high confidence). Integrated water management (medium confidence) and ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence) approaches lower climate risks locally and provide multiple societal benefits. However, ecological, financial, institutional and governance constraints for such actions exist (high confidence), and in many contexts ecosystem-based adaptation will only be effective under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence). (2.3.1, 2.3.3, 3.2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.2, 5.2.2, 5.4.2, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Figure SPM.5}
	Networks of protected areas help maintain ecosystem services, including carbon uptake
and storage, and enable future ecosystem-based adaptation options by facilitating the poleward and altitudinal movements of species, populations, and ecosystems that occur in response to warming and sea level rise (medium confidence). Geographic barriers, ecosystem degradation, habitat fragmentation and barriers to regional cooperation limit the potential for such networks to support future species range shifts in marine, high mountain and polar land regions (high confidence). {2.3.3, 3.2.3, 3.3.2, 3.5.4, 5.5.2, Box 3.4}
                     Terrestrial and marine habitat restoration, and ecosystem management tools such as assisted species relocation and coral gardening, can be locally effective in enhancing ecosystem-based adaptation (high confidence). Such actions are most successful when they are community-supported, are science-based whilst also using local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge, have long-term support that includes the reduction or removal of non-climatic stressors, and under the lowest levels of warming (high confidence). For example, coral reef restoration options may be ineffective if global warming exceeds 1.5°C, because corals are already at high risk (very high confidence) at current levels of warming. {2.3.3, 4.4.2, 5.3.7, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Box 5.5, Figure SPM.3}
Strengthening precautionary approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries, and responsiveness of existing fisheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries, with benefits for regional economies and livelihoods (medium confidence). Fisheries management that regularly assesses and updates measures over time, informed by assessments of future ecosystem trends, reduces risks for fisheries (medium confidence) but has limited ability to address ecosystem change. {3.2.4,3.5.2,5.4.2,5.5.2,5.5.3, Figure SPM.5}
■
	
              Restoration of vegetated coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass meadows (coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystems), could provide climate change mitigation through increased carbon uptake and storage of around 0.5% of current global emissions annually (medium confidence). Improved protection and management can reduce carbon emissions from these ecosystems. Together, these actions also have multiple other benefits, such as providing storm protection, improving water quality, and benefiting biodiversity and fisheries (high confidence). Improving the quantification of carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes of these coastal ecosystems will reduce current uncertainties around measurement, reporting and verification (high confidence). {Box 4.3, 5.4, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Annex I: Glossary}
■
	
              Ocean renewable energy can support climate change mitigation, and can comprise energy extraction from offshore winds, tides, waves, thermal and salinity gradient and algal biofuels. The emerging demand for alternative energy sources is expected to generate economic opportunities for the ocean renewable energy sector (high confidence), although their potential may also be affected by climate change (low confidence). {5.4.2, 5.5.1, Figure 5.23}
30

	Integrated water management approaches across multiple scales can be effective at
addressing impacts and leveraging opportunities from cryosphere changes in high mountain areas. These approaches also support water resource management through the development and optimization of multi-purpose storage and release of water from reservoirs (medium confidence), with consideration of potentially negative impacts to ecosystems and communities. Diversification of tourism activities throughout the year supports adaptation in high mountain economies (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.5}
C.3 Coastal communities face challenging choices in crafting context-specific and integrated responses to sea level rise that balance costs, benefits and trade-offs of available options and that can be adjusted over time (high confidence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and retreat, wherever possible, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high confidence). (4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.1	The	higher	the	sea levels rise, the more challenging is coastal protection, mainly due to economic, financial and social barriers rather than due to technical limits (high confidence). In the coming decades, reducing local drivers of exposure and vulnerability such as coastal urbanization and human-induced subsidence constitute effective responses (high confidence). Where space is limited, and the value of exposed assets is high (e.g., in cities), hard protection (e.g., dikes) is likely to be a cost-efficient response option during the 21st century taking into account the specifics of the context (high confidence), but resource-limited areas may not be able to afford such investments. Where space is available, ecosystem-based adaptation can reduce coastal risk and provide multiple other benefits such as carbon storage, improved water quality, biodiversity conservation and livelihood support (medium confidence). {4.3.2, 4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.3.2	Some coastal accommodation measures, such as early warning systems and flood-proofing of buildings, are often both low cost and highly cost-efficient under current sea levels (high confidence). Under projected sea level rise and increase in coastal hazards some of these measures become less effective unless combined with other measures (high confidence). All types of options, including protection, accommodation, ecosystem-based adaptation, coastal advance and planned relocation, if alternative localities are available, can play important roles in such integrated responses (high confidence). Where the community affected is small, or in the aftermath of a disaster, reducing risk by coastal planned relocations is worth considering if safe alternative localities are available. Such planned relocation can be socially, culturally, financially and politically constrained (very high confidence). {4.4.2, Box 4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, SPM B.3}
C.3.3	Responses to sea level rise and associated risk reduction present society with profound governance challenges, resulting from the uncertainty about the magnitude and rate of future sea level rise, vexing trade-offs between societal goals (e.g., safety, conservation, economic development, intra- and inter-generational equity), limited resources, and conflicting interests and values among diverse stakeholders (high confidence). These challenges can be eased using locally appropriate combinations of decision analysis, land-use planning, public participation, diverse knowledge systems and conflict resolution approaches that are adjusted over time as circumstances change (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 1,4.4.3, 4.4.4, 6.9}
C.3.4	Despite	the	large	uncertainties about the magnitude and rate of post 2050 sea level rise, many coastal decisions with time horizons of decades to over a century are being made now (e.g., critical infrastructure, coastal protection works, city planning) and can be improved by taking relative sea level rise into account, favouring flexible responses (i.e., those that can be adapted over time) supported by monitoring systems for early warning signals, periodically adjusting decisions (i.e., adaptive decision making), using robust decision-making approaches, expert judgement, scenario-building, and multiple knowledge systems (high confidence). The sea level rise range that needs to be considered for planning and implementing coastal responses depends on the risk tolerance of













































Enabling Conditions
C.4 Enabling climate resilience and sustainable development depends critically on urgent and ambitious emissions reductions coupled with coordinated sustained and increasingly ambitious adaptation actions (very high confidence). Key enablers for implementing effective responses to climate-related changes in the ocean and cryosphere include intensifying cooperation and coordination among governing authorities across spatial scales and planning horizons. Education and climate literacy, monitoring and forecasting, use of all available knowledge sources, sharing of data, information and knowledge, finance, addressing social vulnerability and equity, and institutional support are also essential. Such investments enable capacity-building, social learning, and participation in context-specific adaptation, as well as the negotiation of trade-offs and realisation of co-benefits in reducing short-term risks and building long-term resilience and sustainability. (high confidence). This report reflects the state of science for ocean and cryosphere for low levels of global warming (1.5°C), as also assessed in earlier IPCC and IPBES reports. {1.1, 1.5, 1.8.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, Figure 2.7, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4, 5.2.2, Box 5.3, 5.4.2, 5.5.2, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.8, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.1 Mfl	K4* In light of observed and projected changes in the ocean and cryosphere, many nations will face challenges to adapt, even with ambitious mitigation (very high confidence). In a high emissions scenario, many ocean- and cryosphere-dependent communities are projected to face adaptation limits (e.g. biophysical, geographical, financial, technical, social, political and institutional) during the second half of the 21st century. Low emission pathways, for comparison, limit the risks from ocean and cryosphere changes in this century and beyond and enable more effective responses (high confidence), whilst also creating co-benefits. Profound economic and institutional transformative change will enable Climate Resilient Development Pathways in the ocean and cryosphere context (high confidence). {1.1,1.4-1.7, Cross-Chapter Boxes 1-3 in Chapter 1,2.3.1, 2.4, Box 3.2, Figure 3.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 3, 3.4.3, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.3.4, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.6, 5.4.2, 5.5.3, 6.9.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}
C.4.2	K4*	Intensifying	cooperation	and coordination among governing authorities across scales, jurisdictions, sectors, policy domains and planning horizons can enable effective responses to changes in the ocean, cryosphere and to sea level rise (high confidence). Regional cooperation, including treaties and conventions, can support adaptation action; however, the extent to which responding to impacts and losses arising from changes in the ocean and cryosphere is enabled through regional policy frameworks is currently limited (high confidence). Institutional arrangements that provide strong multiscale linkages with local and Indigenous communities benefit adaptation (high confidence). Coordination and complementarity between national and transboundary regional policies can support efforts to address risks to resource security and management, such as water and fisheries (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, Box 2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 3.5.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9.2}
	Experience	to	date	-	for	example,	in	responding	to sea level rise, water-related risks in some
high mountains, and climate change risks in the Arctic - also reveal the enabling influence of taking a long-term perspective when making short-term decisions, explicitly accounting for uncertainty of context-specific risks beyond 2050 (high confidence), and building governance capabilities to tackle complex risks (medium confidence). {2.3.1, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9, Figure SPM.5}
	Investments	in	education	and	capacity	building	at various levels and scales facilitates
social learning and long-term capability for context-specific responses to reduce risk and enhance resilience (high confidence). Specific activities include utilization of multiple knowledge systems and regional climate information into decision making, and the engagement of local communities, Indigenous peoples, and relevant stakeholders in adaptive governance arrangements and planning frameworks (medium confidence). Promotion of climate literacy and drawing on local, Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems enables public awareness, understanding and social learning about locality-specific risk and response potential (high confidence). Such investments can develop, and in many cases transform existing institutions and enable informed, interactive and adaptive governance arrangements (high confidence). {1.8.3, 2.3.2, Figure 2.7, Box 2.4, 2.4, 3.5.2, 3.5.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, 5.5.2, 6.9}
Context-specific monitoring and forecasting of changes in the ocean and the cryosphere
informs adaptation planning and implementation, and facilitates robust decisions on trade-offs between short- and long-term gains (medium confidence). Sustained long-term monitoring, sharing of data, information and knowledge and improved context-specific forecasts, including early warning systems to predict more extreme El Niño/La Niña events, tropical cyclones, and marine heatwaves, help to manage negative impacts from ocean changes such as losses in fisheries, and adverse impacts on human health, food security, agriculture, coral reefs, aquaculture, wildfire, tourism, conservation, drought and flood (high confidence). {2.4, 2.5, 3.5.2, 4.4.4, 5.5.2, 6.3.1, 6.3.3, 6.4.3, 6.5.3, 6.9}
	Prioritising	measures	to	address	social	vulnerability	and	equity	underpins	efforts	to	promote
fair and just climate resilience and sustainable development (high confidence), and can be helped by creating safe community settings for meaningful public participation, deliberation and conflict resolution (medium confidence). {Box 2.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5, Table 4.9, Figure SPM.5}
*	This 	assessment of the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate reveals the benefits of
ambitious mitigation and effective adaptation for sustainable development and, conversely, the escalating costs and risks of delayed action. The potential to chart Climate Resilient Development Pathways varies within and among ocean, high mountain and polar land regions. Realising this potential depends on transformative change. This highlights the urgency of prioritising timely, ambitious, coordinated and enduring action (very high confidence). {1.1,1.8, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.5, 4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.4, 4.4, Table 4.9, 5.5, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure SPM.5}

Climate Change and Land
An IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertification, land
degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and
greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems
(Summary for Policymakers)


























































































Introduction
This Special Report on Climate Change and Land1 responds to the Panel decision in 2016 to prepare three Special Reports2 during the Sixth Assessment cycle, taking account of proposals from governments and observer organisations.3 This report addresses greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in land-based ecosystems, land use and sustainable land management4 in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation, desertification5, land degradation6 and food security7. This report follows the publication of other recent reports, including the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SRI 5), the thematic assessment of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) on Land Degradation and Restoration, the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, and the Global Land Outlook of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). This report provides an updated assessment of the current state of knowledge8 while striving for coherence and complementarity with other recent reports.
This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) is structured in four parts: A) People, land and climate in a warming world; B) Adaptation and mitigation response options; C) Enabling response options; and, D) Action in the near-term.
Confidence in key findings is indicated using the IPCC calibrated language; the underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references to the main report.9
Summary for Policymakers
A. People, land and climate in a warming world
A. 1 Land provides the principal basis for human livelihoods and well-being including the supply of food, freshwater and multiple other ecosystem services, as well as biodiversity. Human use directly affects more than 70% (likely 69-76%) of the global, ice-free land surface (high confidence). Land also plays an important role in the climate system. (Figure SPM.1) {1.1,1.2, 2.3, 2.4}
A.1.1 People currently use one quarter to one third of land's potential net primary production10 for food, feed, fibre, timber and energy. Land provides the basis for many other ecosystem functions and services,11 including cultural and regulating services, that are essential for humanity (high confidence). In one economic approach, the world's terrestrial ecosystem services have been valued on an annual basis to be approximately equivalent to the annual global Gross Domestic Product12 (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.1,1.2,3.2,4.1,5.1,5.5}
A.1.2 Land is both a source and a sink of GHGs and plays a key role in the exchange of energy, water and aerosols between the land surface and atmosphere. Land ecosystems and biodiversity are vulnerable to ongoing climate change, and weather and climate extremes, to different extents. Sustainable land management can contribute to reducing the negative impacts of multiple stressors, including climate change, on ecosystems and societies (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1 ) {1.1,1.2,3.2,4.1, 5.1,5.5}
A.1.3 Data available since 196113 show that global population growth and changes in per capita consumption of food, feed, fibre, timber and energy have caused unprecedented rates of land and freshwater use (very high confidence) with agriculture currently accounting for ca. 70% of global fresh-water use (medium confidence). Expansion of areas under agriculture and forestry, including commercial production, and enhanced agriculture and forestry productivity have supported consumption and food availability for a growing population (high confidence). With large regional variation, these changes have contributed to increasing net GHG emissions (very high confidence), loss of natural ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannahs, natural grasslands and wetlands) and declining biodiversity (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.1,1.3, 5.1,5.5}
A.1.4	Data available since 1961 shows the per capita supply of vegetable oils and meat has more than doubled and the supply
of food calories per capita has increased by about one third (high confidence). Currently, 25-30% of total food produced is lost or wasted (medium confidence). These factors are associated with additional GHG emissions (high confidence). Changes in consumption patterns have contributed to about two billion adults now being overweight or obese (high confidence). An estimated 821 million people are still undernourished (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {1.1,1.3, 5.1,5.5}
A.1.5 About a quarter of the Earth's ice-free land area is subject to human-induced degradation (medium confidence). Soil erosion from agricultural fields is estimated to be currently 10 to 20 times (no tillage) to more than 100 times (conventional tillage) higher than the soil formation rate (medium confidence). Climate change exacerbates land degradation, particularly in low- lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas (high confidence). Over the period 1961-2013, the annual area of drylands in drought has increased, on average by slightly more than 1 % per year, with large inter-annual variability. In 2015, about 500 (380-620) million people lived within areas which experienced desertification between the 1980s and 2000s. The highest numbers of people affected are in South and East Asia, the circum Sahara region including North Africa, and the Middle East including the Arabian Peninsula (low confidence). Other dryland regions have also experienced desertification. People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1 ) {1.1,1.2,3.1,3.2,4.1,4.2,4.3}










































A. 2 Since the pre-industrial period, the land surface air temperature has risen nearly twice as much as the global average temperature (high confidence). Climate change, including increases in frequency and intensity of extremes, has adversely impacted food security and terrestrial ecosystems as well as contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions (high confidence). {2.2, 3.2, 4.2,
4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, Executive Summary Chapter 7, 7.2}
A.2.1 Since the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) the observed mean land surface air temperature has risen considerably more than the global mean surface (land and ocean) temperature (GMST) (high confidence). From 1850-1900 to 2006-2015 mean land surface air temperature has increased by 1.53°C (very likely range from 1.38°C to 1.68°C) while GMST increased by 0.87°C (likely range from 0.75°C to 0.99°C). (Figure SPM.1) {2.2.1}
A.2.2	Warming has resulted in an increased frequency, intensity and duration of heat-related events, including heatwaves14 in
most land regions (high confidence). Frequency and intensity of droughts has increased in some regions (including the Mediterranean, west Asia, many parts of South America, much of Africa, and north-eastern Asia) (medium confidence) and there has been an increase in the intensity of heavy precipitation events at a global scale (medium confidence). {2.2.5,4.2.3, 5.2}
A.2.3	Satellite observations15 have shown vegetation greening16 over the last three decades in parts of Asia, Europe, South America,
central North America, and southeast Australia. Causes of greening include combinations of an extended growing season, nitrogen deposition, Carbon Dioxide (C02) fertilisation17, and land management (high confidence). Vegetation browning18 has been observed in some regions including northern Eurasia, parts of North America, Central Asia and the Congo Basin, largely as a result of water stress (medium confidence). Globally, vegetation greening has occurred over a larger area than vegetation browning (high confidence). {2.2.3, Box 2.3,2.2.4,3.2.1,3.2.2,4.3.1,4.3.2,4.6.2, 5.2.2}
A.2.4 The frequency and intensity of dust storms have increased over the last few decades due to land use and land cover changes and climate-related factors in many dryland areas resulting in increasing negative impacts on human health, in regions such as the Arabian Peninsula and broader Middle East, Central Asia (high confidence).19 {2.4.1,3.4.2}
A.2.5	In some dryland areas, increased land surface air temperature and évapotranspiration and decreased precipitation amount, in
interaction with climate variability and human activities, have contributed to desertification. These areas include Sub-Saharan Africa, parts of East and Central Asia, and Australia, (medium confidence) {2.2,3.2.2,4.4.1}
A.2.6 Global warming has led to shifts of climate zones in many world regions, including expansion of arid climate zones and contraction of polar climate zones (high confidence). As a consequence, many plant and animal species have experienced changes in their ranges, abundances, and shifts in their seasonal activities (high confidence). {2.2,3.2.2,4.4.1}
A.2.7 Climate change can exacerbate land degradation processes (high confidence) including through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, dry spells, wind, sea-level rise and wave action, and permafrost thaw with outcomes being modulated by land management. Ongoing coastal erosion is intensifying and impinging on more regions with sea-level rise adding to land use pressure in some regions (medium confidence). {4.2.1,4.2.2, 4.2.3,4.4.1,4.4.2, 4.9.6, Table 4.1, 7.2.1, 7.2.2}
A.2.8 Climate change has already affected food security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events (high confidence). Studies that separate out climate change from other factors affecting crop yields have shown that yields of some crops (e.g., maize and wheat) in many lower-latitude regions have been affected negatively by observed climate changes, while in many higher-latitude regions, yields of some crops (e.g., maize, wheat, and sugar beets) have been affected positively over recent decades (high confidence). Climate change has resulted in lower animal growth rates and productivity in pastoral systems in Africa (high confidence). There is robust evidence that agricultural pests and diseases have already responded to climate change resulting in both increases and decreases of infestations (high confidence). Based on indigenous and local knowledge, climate change is affecting food security in drylands, particularly those in Africa, and high mountain regions of Asia and South America.20 {5.2.1,5.2.2, 7.2.2}
A. 3 Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) activities accounted for around 13% of C02, 44% of methane (CH4), and 81% of nitrous oxide (N20) emissions from human activities globally during 2007-2016, representing 23% (12.0 ± 2.9 GtC02eq yr21) of total net anthropogenic emissions of GHGs (medium confidence).2' The natural response of land to human-induced environmental change caused a net sink of around 11.2 GtC02 yr1 during 2007-2016 (equivalent to 29% of total C02 emissions) (medium confidence); the persistence of the sink is uncertain due to climate change (high confidence). If emissions associated with pre- and post-production activities in the global food system22 are included, the emissions are estimated to be 21-37% of total net anthropogenic GHG emissions (medium confidence). {2.3, Table 2.2, 5.4}
A.3.1 Land is simultaneously a source and a sink of C02 due to both anthropogenic and natural drivers, making it hard to separate anthropogenic from natural fluxes (very high confidence). Global models estimate net C02 emissions of 5.2 ± 2.6 GtC02 yr1 (likely range) from land use and land-use change during 2007-2016. These net emissions are mostly due to deforestation, partly offset by afforestation/reforestation, and emissions and removals by other land use activities (very high confidence).23 There is no clear trend in annual emissions since 1990 (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.1, Table SPM.1 ) {1.1,2.3, Table 2.2, Table 2.3}
A.3.2 The natural response of land to human-induced environmental changes such as increasing atmospheric C02 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and climate change, resulted in global net removals of 11.2 ± 2.6 GtC02yr1 (likely range) during 2007- 2016. The sum of the net removals due to this response and the AFOLU net emissions gives a total net land-atmosphere flux that removed 6.0 ± 3.7 GtC02 yr1 during 2007-2016 (likely range). Future net increases in C02 emissions from vegetation and soils due to climate change are projected to counteract increased removals due to C02 fertilisation and longer growing seasons (high confidence). The balance between these processes is a key source of uncertainty for determining the future of the land carbon sink. Projected thawing of permafrost is expected to increase the loss of soil carbon (high confidence). During the 21st century, vegetation growth in those areas may compensate in part for this loss (low confidence). (Table SPM.1) {Box 2.3,2.3.1,2.5.3,2.7,Table 2.3}
A.3.3 Global models and national GHG inventories use different methods to estimate anthropogenic C02 emissions and removals for the land sector. Both produce estimates that are in close agreement for land-use change involving forest (e.g.# deforestation, afforestation), and differ for managed forest. Global models consider as managed forest those lands that were subject to harvest whereas, consistent with IPCC guidelines, national GHG inventories define managed forest more broadly. On this larger area, inventories can also consider the natural response of land to human-induced environmental changes as anthropogenic, while the global model approach (Table SPM.1) treats this response as part of the non-anthropogenic sink. For illustration, from 2005 to 2014, the sum of the national GHG inventories net emission estimates is 0.1 ± 1.0 GtC02 yr1, while the mean of two global bookkeeping models is 5.2 ± 2.6 GtC02 yr1 (likely range). Consideration of differences in methods can enhance understanding of land sector net emission estimates and their applications. {2.4.1,2.7.3, Fig 2.5, Box 2.2}

A.3.4 Global AFOLU emissions of methane in the period 2007-2016 were 161 ±43 MtCH4 yr1 (4.5 ± 1.2 GtC02eq yr1) (medium confidence). The globally averaged atmospheric concentration of CH4 shows a steady increase between the mid-1980s and early 1990s# slower growth thereafter until 1999, a period of no growth between 1999-2006, followed by a resumption of growth in 2007 (high confidence). Biogenic sources make up a larger proportion of emissions than they did before 2000 (high confidence). Ruminants and the expansion of rice cultivation are important contributors to the rising concentration (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1) {Table 2.2,2.3.2, 5.4.2, 5.4.3}
A.3.5 Anthropogenic AFOLU N20 emissions are rising, and were 8.7 ± 2.5 MtN20 yr1 (2.3 ± 0.7 GtC02eq yr1) during the period 2007-2016. Anthropogenic N20 emissions {Figure SPM.1, Table SPM.1} from soils are primarily due to nitrogen application including inefficiencies (over-application or poorly synchronised with crop demand timings) (high confidence). Cropland soils emitted around 3 MtN20 yr1 (around 795 MtC02 eq yr1) during the period 2007-2016 (medium confidence). There has been a major growth in emissions from managed pastures due to increased manure deposition (medium confidence). Livestock on managed pastures and rangelands accounted for more than one half of total anthropogenic l\l20 emissions from agriculture in 2014 (medium confidence). {Table 2.1,2.3.3, 5.4.2, 5.4.3}
A.3.6 Total net G FIG emissions from AFOLU emissions represent 12.0 ± 2.9 GtC02eq yr1 during 2007-2016. This represents 23% of total net anthropogenic emissions {Table SPM.1}.24 Other approaches, such as global food system, include agricultural emissions and land use change (i.e., deforestation and peatland degradation), as well as outside farm gate emissions from energy, transport and industry sectors for food production. Emissions within farm gate and from agricultural land expansion contributing to the global food system represent 16-27% of total anthropogenic emissions (medium confidence). Emissions outside the farm gate represent 5-10% of total anthropogenic emissions (medium confidence). Given the diversity of food systems, there are large regional differences in the contributions from different components of the food system (very high confidence). Emissions from agricultural production are projected to increase (high confidence), driven by population and income growth and changes in consumption patterns (medium confidence). {5.5, Table 5.4}
A. 4 Changes in land conditions,25 either from land-use or climate change, affect global and regional climate (high confidence). At the regional scale, changing land conditions can reduce or accentuate warming and affect the intensity, frequency and duration of extreme events. The magnitude and direction of these changes vary with location and season (high confidence). {Executive Summary Chapter 2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.3}
A.4.1 Since the pre-industrial period, changes in land cover due to human activities have led to both a net release of C02 contributing to global warming (high confidence), and an increase in global land albedo26 causing surface cooling (medium confidence). Over the historical period, the resulting net effect on globally averaged surface temperature is estimated to be small (medium confidence). {2.4,2.6.1,2.6.2}
A.4.2 The likelihood, intensity and duration of many extreme events can be significantly modified by changes in land conditions, including heat related events such as heatwaves (high confidence) and heavy precipitation events (medium confidence). Changes in land conditions can affect temperature and rainfall in regions as far as hundreds of kilometres away (high confidence). {2.5.1,2.5.2,2.5.4,3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
A.4.3 Climate change is projected to alter land conditions with feedbacks on regional climate. In those boreal regions where the treeline migrates northward and/or the growing season lengthens, winter warming will be enhanced due to decreased snow cover and albedo while warming will be reduced during the growing season because of increased évapotranspiration (high confidence). In those tropical areas where increased rainfall is projected, increased vegetation growth will reduce regional warming (medium confidence). Drier soil conditions resulting from climate change can increase the severity of heat waves, while wetter soil conditions have the opposite effect (high confidence). {2.5.2,2.5.3}
A.4.4 Desertification amplifies global warming through the release of C02 linked with the decrease in vegetation cover (high confidence). This decrease in vegetation cover tends to increase local albedo, leading to surface cooling (high confidence). {3.3}
A.4.5 Changes in forest cover, for example from afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, directly affect regional surface temperature through exchanges of water and energy (high confidence).27 28 Where forest cover increases in tropical regions cooling results from enhanced évapotranspiration (high confidence). Increased évapotranspiration can result in cooler days during the growing season (high confidence) and can reduce the amplitude of heat related events (medium confidence). In regions with seasonal snow cover, such as boreal and some temperate regions, increased tree and shrub cover also has a wintertime warming influence due to reduced surface albedo (high confidence).2* {2.3,2.4.3,2.5.1,2.5.2,2.5.4}
A.4.6 Both global warming and urbanisation can enhance warming in cities and their surroundings (heat island effect), especially during heat related events, including heat waves (high confidence). Night-time temperatures are more affected by this effect than daytime temperatures (high confidence). Increased urbanisation can also intensify extreme rainfall events over the city or downwind of urban areas (medium confidence). {2.5.1,2.5.2,2.5.3,4.9.1, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 2}
Box SPM. 1 I Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)
In this report the implications of future socio-economic development on climate change mitigation, adaptation and land-use
are explored using shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). The SSPs span a range of challenges to climate change mitigation
and adaptation.
• SSP1 includes a peak and decline in population (~7 billion in 2100), high income and reduced inequalities, effective land- use regulation, less resource intensive consumption, including food produced in low-GHG emission systems and lower food waste, free trade and environmentally-friendly technologies and lifestyles. Relative to other pathways, SSP1 has low challenges to mitigation and low challenges to adaptation (i.e., high adaptive capacity)
• SSP2 includes medium population growth (~9 billion in 2100), medium income, technological progress, production and consumption patterns are a continuation of past trends, and only a gradual reduction in inequality occurs. Relative to other pathways, SSP2 has medium challenges to mitigation and medium challenges to adaptation (i.e., medium adaptive capacity).
• SSP3 includes high population growth (~13 billion in 2100), low income and continued inequalities, material-intensive consumption and production, barriers to trade, and slow rates of technological change. Relative to other pathways, SSP3 has high challenges to mitigation and high challenges to adaptation (i.e., low adaptive capacity).
• SSP4 includes medium population growth (~9 billion in 2100), medium income, but significant inequality within and across regions. Relative to other pathways, SSP4 has low challenges to mitigation, but high challenges to adaptation (i.e., low adaptive capacity).
• SSP5 includes a peak and decline in population (~7 billion in 2100), high income, reduced inequalities, and free trade. This pathway includes resource-intensive production, consumption and lifestyles. Relative to other pathways, SSP5 has high challenges to mitigation, but low challenges to adaptation (i.e., high adaptive capacity).
• The SSPs can be combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) which imply different levels of mitigation, with implications for adaptation. Therefore, SSPs can be consistent with different levels of global mean surface temperature rise as projected by different SSP-RCP combinations. However, some SSP-RCP combinations are not possible; for instance RCP2.6 and lower levels of future global mean surface temperature rise (e.g., 1.5°C) are not possible in SSP3 in modelled pathways. {1.2.2,6.1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
























A. 5 Climate change creates additional stresses on land, exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and ecosystem health, infrastructure, and food systems (high confidence). Increasing impacts on land are projected under all future GHG emission scenarios (high confidence). Some regions will face higher risks, while some regions will face risks previously not anticipated (high confidence). Cascading risks with impacts on multiple systems and sectors also vary across regions (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {2.2, 3.5, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 5.1, 5.2, 5.8, 6.1, 7.2, 7.3, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
A.5.1 With increasing warming, the frequency, intensity and duration of heat related events including heatwaves are projected to continue to increase through the 21st century (high confidence). The frequency and intensity of droughts are projected to increase particularly in the Mediterranean region and southern Africa (medium confidence). The frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are projected to increase in many regions (high confidence). {2.2.5,3.5.1,4.2.3, 5.2}
A.5.2	With increasing warming, climate zones are projected to further shift poleward in the middle and high latitudes (high confidence).
In high-latitude regions, warming is projected to increase disturbance in boreal forests, including drought, wildfire, and pest outbreaks (high confidence). In tropical regions, under medium and high GHG emissions scenarios, warming is projected to result in the emergence of unprecedented29 climatic conditions by the mid to late 21st century (medium confidence). {2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.5.3,4.3.2}
A.5.3	Current levels of global warming are associated with moderate risks from increased dryland water scarcity, soil erosion,
vegetation loss, wildfire damage, permafrost thawing, coastal degradation and tropical crop yield decline (high confidence). Risks, including cascading risks, are projected to become increasingly severe with increasing temperatures. At around 1.5°C of global warming the risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, permafrost degradation and food supply instabilities are projected to be high (medium confidence). At around 2°C of global warming the risk from permafrost degradation and food supply instabilities are projected to be very high (medium confidence). Additionally, at around 3°C of global warming risk from vegetation loss, wildfire damage, and dryland water scarcity are also projected to be very high (medium confidence). Risks from droughts, water stress, heat related events such as heatwaves and habitat degradation simultaneously increase between 1.5°C and 3°C warming (low confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {7.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6, Chapter 7 Supplementary Material}
A.5.4 The stability of food supply30 is projected to decrease as the magnitude and frequency of extreme weather events that disrupt food chains increases (high confidence). Increased atmospheric C02 levels can also lower the nutritional quality of crops (high confidence). In SSP2, global crop and economic models project a median increase of 7.6% (range of 1-23%) in cereal prices in 2050 due to climate change (RCP6.0), leading to higher food prices and increased risk of food insecurity and hunger (medium
confidence). The most vulnerable people will be more severely affected (high confidence). {5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.2.5, 5.8.1, 7.2.2.2, 7.3.1}
A.5.5 In drylands, climate change and desertification are projected to cause reductions in crop and livestock productivity (high confidence), modify the plant species mix and reduce biodiversity (medium confidence). Under SSP2, the dryland population vulnerable to water stress, drought intensity and habitat degradation is projected to reach 178 million people by 2050 at 1.5°C warming, increasing to 220 million people at 2°C warming, and 277 million people at 3°C warming (low confidence). {3.5.1,
3.5.2, 3.7.3}
A.5.6 Asia and Africa31 are projected to have the highest number of people vulnerable to increased desertification. North America, South America, Mediterranean, southern Africa and central Asia may be increasingly affected by wildfire. The tropics and subtropics are projected to be most vulnerable to crop yield decline. Land degradation resulting from the combination of sea-level rise and more intense cyclones is projected to jeopardise lives and livelihoods in cyclone prone areas (very high confidence). Within populations, women, the young, elderly and poor are most at risk (high confidence). {3.5.1, 3.5.2, 4.4, Table 4.1,5.2.2, 7.2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 2}
A.5.7 Changes in climate can amplify environmentally induced migration both within countries and across borders (medium confidence), reflecting multiple drivers of mobility and available adaptation measures (high confidence). Extreme weather and climate or slow-onset events may lead to increased displacement, disrupted food chains, threatened livelihoods (high confidence), and contribute to exacerbated stresses for conflict (medium confidence). {3.4.2, 4.7.3, 5.2.3, 5.2.4, 5.2.5, 5.8.2,
7.2.2, 7.3.1}
A.5.8 Unsustainable land management has led to negative economic impacts (high confidence). Climate change is projected to exacerbate these negative economic impacts (high confidence). {4.3.1, 4.4.1, 4.7, 4.8.5, 4.8.6, 4.9.6, 4.9.7, 4.9.8, 5.2, 5.8.1, 7.3.4, 7.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
A. 6 The level of risk posed by climate change depends both on the level of warming and on how population, consumption, production, technological development, and land management patterns evolve (high confidence). Pathways with higher demand for food, feed, and water, more resourceintensive consumption and production, and more limited technological improvements in agriculture yields result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation, and food insecurity (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2b) {5.1.4, 5.2.3, 6.1.4, 7.2, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
A.6.1 Projected increases in population and income, combined with changes in consumption patterns, result in increased demand for food, feed, and water in 2050 in all SSPs (high confidence). These changes, combined with land management practices, have implications for land-use change, food insecurity, water scarcity, terrestrial GHG emissions, carbon sequestration potential, and biodiversity (high confidence). Development pathways in which incomes increase and the demand for land conversion is reduced, either through reduced agricultural demand or improved productivity, can lead to reductions in food insecurity (high confidence). All assessed future socio-economic pathways result in increases in water demand and water scarcity (high confidence). SSPs with greater cropland expansion result in larger declines in biodiversity (high confidence). {6.1.4}
A.6.2 Risks related to water scarcity in drylands are lower in pathways with low population growth, less increase in water demand, and high adaptive capacity, as in SSP1 {Box SPM.1}. In these scenarios the risk from water scarcity in drylands is moderate even at global warming of 3°C (low confidence). By contrast, risks related to water scarcity in drylands are greater for pathways with high population growth, high vulnerability, higher water demand, and low adaptive capacity, such as SSP3. In SSP3 the transition from moderate to high risk occurs between 1.2°C and 1.5°C (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2b, Box SPM.1) {7.2}
A.6.3 Risks related to climate change driven land degradation are higher in pathways with a higher population, increased land-use change, low adaptive capacity and other barriers to adaptation (e.g., SSP3). These scenarios result in more people exposed to ecosystem degradation, fire, and coastal flooding (medium confidence). For land degradation, the projected transition from moderate to high risk occurs for global warming between 1.8°C and 2.8°C in SSP1 (low confidence) and between 1.4°C and 2°C in SSP3 (medium confidence). The projected transition from high to very high risk occurs between 2.2°C and 2.8°C for SSP3 (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2b) {4.4, 7.2}
A.6.4 Risks related to food security are greater in pathways with lower income, increased food demand, increased food prices resulting from competition for land, more limited trade, and other challenges to adaptation (e.g., SSP3) (high confidence). For food security, the transition from moderate to high risk occurs for global warming between 2.5°C and 3.5°C in SSP1 (medium confidence) and between 1.3°C and 1.7°C in SSP3 (medium confidence). The transition from high to very high risk occurs between 2°C and 2.7°C for SSP3 (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2b) {7.2}
A.6.5 Urban expansion is projected to lead to conversion of cropland leading to losses in food production (high confidence). This can result in additional risks to the food system. Strategies for reducing these impacts can include urban and peri-urban food production and management of urban expansion, as well as urban green infrastructure that can reduce climate risks in cities32 (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {4.9.1,5.5, 5.6,6.3,6.4, 7.5.6}
Summary for Policymakers
B. Adaptation and mitigation response options
B. 1 Many land-related responses that contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation can also combat desertification and land degradation and enhance food security. The potential for land- related responses and the relative emphasis on adaptation and mitigation is context specific, including the adaptive capacities of communities and regions. While land-related response options can make important contributions to adaptation and mitigation, there are some barriers to adaptation and limits to their contribution to global mitigation, (very high confidence) (Figure SPM.3) {2.6, 4.8, 5.6,
6.1, 6.3, 6.4}
B. 1.1 Some land-related actions are already being taken that contribute to climate change adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development. The response options were assessed across adaptation, mitigation, combating desertification and land degradation, food security and sustainable development, and a select set of options deliver across all of these challenges. These options include, but are not limited to, sustainable food production, improved and sustainable forest management, soil organic carbon management, ecosystem conservation and land restoration, reduced deforestation and degradation, and reduced food loss and waste (high confidence). These response options require integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. {6.3,6.4.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
B. 1.2	While some response options have immediate impacts, others take decades to deliver measurable results. Examples of
response options with immediate impacts include the conservation of high-carbon ecosystems such as peatlands, wetlands, rangelands, mangroves and forests. Examples that provide multiple ecosystem services and functions, but take more time to deliver, include afforestation and reforestation as well as the restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, agroforestry, and the reclamation of degraded soils (high confidence). {6.4.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
B. 1.3	The successful implementation of response options depends on consideration of local environmental and socio-economic
conditions. Some options such as soil carbon management are potentially applicable across a broad range of land use types, whereas the efficacy of land management practices relating to organic soils, peatlands and wetlands, and those linked to freshwater resources, depends on specific agro-ecological conditions (high confidence). Given the site-specific nature of climate change impacts on food system components and wide variations in agroecosystems, adaptation and mitigation options and their barriers are linked to environmental and cultural context at regional and local levels (high confidence). Achieving land degradation neutrality depends on the integration of multiple responses across local, regional and national scales and across multiple sectors including agriculture, pasture, forest and water (high confidence). {4.8,6.2,6.3,6.4.4, 7.5.6}
B. 1.4 Land-based options that deliver carbon sequestration in soil or vegetation, such as afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry, soil carbon management on mineral soils, or carbon storage in harvested wood products, do not continue to sequester carbon indefinitely (high confidence). Peatlands, however, can continue to sequester carbon for centuries (high confidence). When vegetation matures or when vegetation and soil carbon reservoirs reach saturation, the annual removal of C02 from the atmosphere declines towards zero, while carbon stocks can be maintained (high confidence). However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss (or sink reversal) triggered by disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management (high confidence). {6.4.1}
B.2 Most of the response options assessed contribute positively to sustainable development and other societal goals (high confidence). Many response options can be applied without competing for land and have the potential to provide multiple co-benefits (high confidence). A further set of response options has the potential to reduce demand for land, thereby enhancing the potential for other response options to deliver across each of climate change adaptation and mitigation, combating desertification and land degradation, and enhancing food security (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {4.8, 6.2, 6.3.6, 6.4.3}
B.2.1 A number of land management options, such as improved management of cropland and grazing lands, improved and sustainable forest management, and increased soil organic carbon content, do not require land use change and do not create demand for more land conversion (high confidence). Further, a number of response options such as increased food productivity, dietary choices and food losses, and waste reduction, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other response options (high confidence). Response options that reduce competition for land are possible and are applicable at different scales, from farm to regional (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {4.8, 6.3.6,6.4}
B.2.2 A wide range of adaptation and mitigation responses, e.g., preserving and restoring natural ecosystems such as peatland, coastal lands and forests, biodiversity conservation, reducing competition for land, fire management, soil management, and most risk management options (e.g., use of local seeds, disaster risk management, risk sharing instruments) have the potential to make positive contributions to sustainable development, enhancement of ecosystem functions and services and other societal goals (medium confidence). Ecosystem-based adaptation can, in some contexts, promote nature conservation while alleviating poverty and can even provide co-benefits by removing GHGs and protecting livelihoods (e.g., mangroves) (medium confidence). {6.4.3, 7.4.6.2J
B.2.3 Most of the land management-based response options that do not increase competition for land, and almost all options based on value chain management (e.g., dietary choices, reduced post-harvest losses, reduced food waste) and risk management, can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and wellbeing, clean water and sanitation, climate action, and life on land (medium confidence). {6.4.3}
B.3 Although most response options can be applied without competing for available land, some can increase demand for land conversion (high confidence). At the deployment scale of several GtC02 yr1, this increased demand for land conversion could lead to adverse side effects for adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security (high confidence). If applied on a limited share of total land and integrated into sustainably managed landscapes, there will be fewer adverse side- effects and some positive co-benefits can be realised (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {4.5, 6.2, 6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B.3.1 If applied at scales necessary to remove C02 from the atmosphere at the level of several GtC02 yr1, afforestation, reforestation and the use of land to provide feedstock for bioenergy with or without carbon capture and storage, or for biochar, could greatly increase demand for land conversion (high confidence). Integration into sustainably managed landscapes at appropriate scale can ameliorate adverse impacts (medium confidence). Reduced grassland conversion to croplands, restoration and reduced conversion of peatlands, and restoration and reduced conversion of coastal wetlands affect smaller land areas globally, and the impacts on land use change of these options are smaller or more variable (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6,6.4}
B.3.2	While land can make a valuable contribution to climate change mitigation, there are limits to the deployment of land-based
mitigation measures such as bioenergy crops or afforestation. Widespread use at the scale of several millions of km2 globally could increase risks for desertification, land degradation, food security and sustainable development (medium confidence). Applied on a limited share of total land, land-based mitigation measures that displace other land uses have fewer adverse side- effects and can have positive co-benefits for adaptation, desertification, land degradation or food security, (high confidence) (Figure SPM.3) {4.2,4.5,6.4; Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B.3.3	The production and use of biomass for bioenergy can have co-benefits, adverse side-effects, and risks for land degradation,
food insecurity, GHG emissions and other environmental and sustainable development goals (high confidence). These impacts are context specific and depend on the scale of deployment, initial land use, land type, bioenergy feedstock, initial carbon stocks, climatic region and management regime, and other land-demanding response options can have a similar range of consequences (high confidence). The use of residues and organic waste as bioenergy feedstock can mitigate land use change pressures associated with bioenergy deployment, but residues are limited and the removal of residues that would otherwise be left on the soil could lead to soil degradation (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.6.1.5, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B. 3.4 For projected socioeconomic pathways with low population, effective land-use regulation, food produced in low-GFIG emission systems and lower food loss and waste (SSP1), the transition from low to moderate risk to food security, land degradation and water scarcity in dry lands occur between 1 and 4 million km2 of bioenergy or bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (medium confidence). By contrast, in pathways with high population, low income and slow rates of technological change (SSP3), the transition from low to moderate risk occurs between 0.1 and 1 million km2 (medium confidence). (Box SPM.1) {6.4, Table SM7.6, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}

B.4 Many activities for combating desertification can contribute to climate change adaptation with mitigation co-benefits, as well as to halting biodiversity loss with sustainable development cobenefits to society (high confidence). Avoiding, reducing and reversing desertification would enhance soil fertility, increase carbon storage in soils and biomass, while benefitting agricultural productivity and food security (high confidence). Preventing desertification is preferable to attempting to restore degraded land due to the potential for residual risks and maladaptive outcomes (high confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3, 3.6.4, 3.7.1, 3.7.2}
B.4.1 Solutions that help adapt to and mitigate climate change while contributing to combating desertification are site and regionally specific and include inter alia: water harvesting and micro-irrigation, restoring degraded lands using drought- resilient ecologically appropriate plants, agroforestry, and other agroecological and ecosystem-based adaptation practices (high confidence). {3.3,3.6.1,3.7.2,3.7.5, 5.2, 5.6}
B.4.2 Reducing dust and sand storms and sand dune movement can lessen the negative effects of wind erosion and improve air quality and health (high confidence). Depending on water availability and soil conditions, afforestation, tree planting and ecosystem restoration programs, which aim for the creation of windbreaks in the form of 'green walls' and 'green dams' using native and other climate resilient tree species with low water needs, can reduce sand storms, avert wind erosion, and contribute to carbon sinks, while improving micro-climates, soil nutrients and water retention (high confidence). {3.3, 3.6.1,
3.7.2, 3.7.5}
B.4.3 Measures to combat desertification can promote soil carbon sequestration (high confidence). Natural vegetation restoration and tree planting on degraded land enriches, in the long term, carbon in the topsoil and subsoil (medium confidence). Modelled rates of carbon sequestration following the adoption of conservation agriculture practices in drylands depend on local conditions (medium confidence). If soil carbon is lost, it may take a prolonged period of time for carbon stocks to recover. {3.1.4, 3.3, 3.6.1,3.6.3, 3.7.1,3.7.2}
B.4.4 Eradicating poverty and ensuring food security can benefit from applying measures promoting land degradation neutrality (including avoiding, reducing and reversing land degradation) in rangelands, croplands and forests, which contribute to combating desertification, while mitigating and adapting to climate change within the framework of sustainable development. Such measures include avoiding deforestation and locally suitable practices including management of rangeland and forest fires (high confidence). {3.4.2,3.6.1,3.6.2,3.6.3,4.8.5}
B.4.5 Currently there is a lack of knowledge of adaptation limits and potential maladaptation to combined effects of climate change and desertification. In the absence of new or enhanced adaptation options, the potential for residual risks and maladaptive outcomes is high (high confidence). Even when solutions are available, social, economic and institutional constraints could pose barriers to their implementation (medium confidence). Some adaptation options can become maladaptive due to their environmental impacts, such as irrigation causing soil salinisation or over extraction leading to ground-water depletion (medium confidence). Extreme forms of desertification can lead to the complete loss of land productivity, limiting adaptation options or reaching the limits to adaptation (high confidence). {Executive Summary Chapter 3,3.6.4,3.7.5, 7.4.9}
B.4.6 Developing, enabling and promoting access to cleaner energy sources and technologies can contribute to adaptation and mitigating climate change and combating desertification and forest degradation through decreasing the use of traditional biomass for energy while increasing the diversity of energy supply (medium confidence). This can have socioeconomic and health benefits, especially for women and children, (high confidence). The efficiency of wind and solar energy infrastructures is recognised; the efficiency can be affected in some regions by dust and sand storms (high confidence). {3.5.3, 3.5.4, 4.4.4,
7.5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7}

B. 5 Sustainable land management,33 including sustainable forest management,34 can prevent and reduce land degradation, maintain land productivity, and sometimes reverse the adverse impacts of climate change on land degradation (very high confidence). It can also contribute to mitigation and adaptation (high confidence). Reducing and reversing land degradation, at scales from individual farms to entire watersheds, can provide cost effective, immediate, and long-term benefits to communities and support several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with co-benefits for adaptation (very high confidence) and mitigation (high confidence). Even with implementation of sustainable land management, limits to adaptation can be exceeded in some situations (medium confidence). {1.3.2, 4.1.5, 4.8, 7.5.6, Table 4.2}
B.5.1 Land degradation in agriculture systems can be addressed through sustainable land management, with an ecological and socioeconomic focus, with co-benefits for climate change adaptation. Management options that reduce vulnerability to soil erosion and nutrient loss include growing green manure crops and cover crops, crop residue retention, reduced/zero tillage, and maintenance of ground cover through improved grazing management (very high confidence). {4.8}
B.5.2	The following options also have mitigation co-benefits. Farming systems such as agroforestry, perennial pasture phases and
use of perennial grains, can substantially reduce erosion and nutrient leaching while building soil carbon (high confidence). The global sequestration potential of cover crops would be about 0.44 ± 0.11 GtC02 yr1 if applied to 25% of global cropland (high confidence). The application of certain biochars can sequester carbon (high confidence),and improve soil conditions in some soil types/climates (medium confidence). {4.8.1.1,4.8.1.3,4.9.2,4.9.5, 5.5.1,5.5.4, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}
B.5.3	Reducing deforestation and forest degradation lowers GHG emissions (high confidence), with an estimated technical mitigation
potential of 0.4-5.8 GtC02 yr1. By providing long-term livelihoods for communities, sustainable forest management can reduce the extent of forest conversion to non-forest uses (e.g., cropland or settlements) (high confidence). Sustainable forest management aimed at providing timber, fibre, biomass, non-timber resources and other ecosystem functions and services, can lower GHG emissions and can contribute to adaptation (high confidence). {2.6.1.2,4.1.5,4.3.2,4.5.3,4.8.1.3,4.8.3,4.8.4}
B.5.4 Sustainable forest management can maintain or enhance forest carbon stocks, and can maintain forest carbon sinks, including by transferring carbon to wood products, thus addressing the issue of sink saturation (high confidence). Where wood carbon is transferred to harvested wood products, these can store carbon over the long-term and can substitute for emissions-intensive materials reducing emissions in other sectors (high confidence). Where biomass is used for energy, e.g., as a mitigation strategy, the carbon is released back into the atmosphere more quickly (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.6.1, 2.7, 4.1.5,
4.8.4,6.4.1, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B.5.5	Climate change can lead to land degradation, even with the implementation of measures intended to avoid, reduce or reverse
land degradation (high confidence). Such limits to adaptation are dynamic, site-specific and are determined through the interaction of biophysical changes with social and institutional conditions (very high confidence). In some situations, exceeding the limits of adaptation can trigger escalating losses or result in undesirable transformational changes (medium confidence) such as forced migration (low confidence), conflicts (low confidence) or poverty (medium confidence). Examples of climate change induced land degradation that may exceed limits to adaptation include coastal erosion exacerbated by sea level rise where land disappears (high confidence), thawing of permafrost affecting infrastructure and livelihoods (medium confidence), and extreme soil erosion causing loss of productive capacity (medium confidence). {4.7,4.8.5,4.8.6,4.9.6,4.9.7,4.9.8}
B. 6 Response options throughout the food system, from production to consumption, including food loss and waste, can be deployed and scaled up to advance adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). The total technical mitigation potential from crop and livestock activities, and agroforestry is estimated as 2.3 - 9.6 GtC02eq yr1 by 2050 (medium confidence). The total technical mitigation potential of dietary changes is estimated as 0.7 - 8 GtC02eq yr1 by 2050 (medium confidence). {5.3, 5.5, 5.6}

B.6.1 Practices that contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation in cropland include increasing soil organic matter, erosion control, improved fertiliser management, improved crop management, for example paddy rice management, and use of varieties and genetic improvements for heat and drought tolerance. For livestock, options include better grazing land management, improved manure management, higher-quality feed, and use of breeds and genetic improvement. Different farming and pastoral systems can achieve reductions in the emissions intensity of livestock products. Depending on the farming and pastoral systems and level of development, reductions in the emissions intensity of livestock products may lead to absolute reductions in GHG emissions (medium confidence). Many livestock related options can enhance the adaptive capacity of rural communities, in particular, of smallholders and pastoralists. Significant synergies exist between adaptation and mitigation, for example through sustainable land management approaches (high confidence). {4.8, 5.3.3, 5.5.1,5.6}
B.6.2 Diversification in the food system (e.g., implementation of integrated production systems, broad-based genetic resources, and diets) can reduce risks from climate change (medium confidence). Balanced diets, featuring plant-based foods, such as those based on coarse grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and animal-sourced food produced in resilient, sustainable and low-GFIG emission systems, present major opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of human health (high confidence). By 2050, dietary changes could free several million km2 (medium confidence) of land and provide a technical mitigation potential of 0.7 to 8.0 GtC02eq yr1, relative to business as usual projections (high confidence). Transitions towards low-GFIG emission diets may be influenced by local production practices, technical and financial barriers and associated livelihoods and cultural habits (high confidence). {5.3,5.5.2,5.5,5.6}
B.6.3 Reduction of food loss and waste can lower GHG emissions and contribute to adaptation through reduction in the land area needed for food production (medium confidence). During 2010-2016, global food loss and waste contributed 8 -10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions (medium confidence). Currently, 25 -30% of total food produced is lost or wasted (medium con/7c/e/7ce). Technical options such as improved harvesting techniques, on-farm storage, infrastructure, transport, packaging, retail and education can reduce food loss and waste across the supply chain. Causes of food loss and waste differ substantially between developed and developing countries, as well as between regions (medium confidence). By 2050, reduced food loss and waste can free several million km2 of land (low confidence). {5.5.2,6.3.6}
B. 7 Future land use depends, in part, on the desired climate outcome and the portfolio of response options deployed (high confidence). All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C require land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy (high confidence). A small number of modelled pathways achieve 1.5°C with reduced land conversion (high confidence) and thus reduced consequences for desertification, land degradation, and food security (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.4) {2.6, 6.4, 7.4, 7.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
B.7.1 Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C35 include more land-based mitigation than higher warming level pathways (high confidence), but the impacts of climate change on land systems in these pathways are less severe (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.2, Figure SPM.4) {2.6,6.4, 7.4, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
B.7.2	Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 2°C project a 2 million km2 reduction to a 12 million km2 increase in
forest area in 2050 relative to 2010 (medium confidence). 3°C pathways project lower forest areas, ranging from a 4 million km2 reduction to a 6 million km2 increase (medium confidence). (Figure SPM.3, Figure SPM.4) {2.5,6.3,7.3,7.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
B.7.3	The land area needed for bioenergy in modelled pathways varies significantly depending on the socio-economic pathway, the
warming level, and the feedstock and production system used (high confidence). Modelled pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C use up to 7 million km2 for bioenergy in 2050; bioenergy land area is smaller in 2°C (0.4 to 5 million km2) and 3°C pathways (0.1 to 3 million km2) (medium confidence). Pathways with large levels of land conversion may imply adverse side-effects impacting water scarcity, biodiversity, land degradation, desertification, and food security, if not adequately and carefully managed, whereas best practice implementation at appropriate scales can have co-benefits, such as management of dryland salinity, enhanced biocontrol and biodiversity and enhancing soil carbon sequestration (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {2.6, 6.1,6.4, 7.2, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B.7.4 Most mitigation pathways include substantial deployment of bioenergy technologies. A small number of modelled pathways limit warming to 1.5°C with reduced dependence on bioenergy and BECCS (land area below <1 million km2 in 2050) and other carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options (high confidence). These pathways have even more reliance on rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban systems and infrastructure, and on behavioural and lifestyle changes compared to other 1.5°C pathways. {2.6.2, 5.5.1,6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 6}
B.7.5 These modelled pathways do not consider the effects of climate change on land or C02 fertilisation. In addition, these pathways include only a subset of the response options assessed in this report (high confidence); the inclusion of additional response options in models could reduce the projected need for bioenergy or CDR that increases the demand for land. {6.4.4, Cross- Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}

C. Enabling response options
Appropriate design of policies, institutions and governance systems at all scales can contribute to land-related adaptation and mitigation while facilitating the pursuit of climate-adaptive development pathways (high confidence). Mutually supportive climate and land policies have the potential to save resources, amplify social resilience, support ecological restoration, and foster engagement and collaboration between multiple stakeholders (high confidence). (Figure SPM.1, Figure SPM.2, Figure
C. 1.1 Land-use zoning, spatial planning, integrated landscape planning, regulations, incentives (such as payment for ecosystem services), and voluntary or persuasive instruments (such as environmental farm planning, standards and certification for sustainable production, use of scientific, local and indigenous knowledge and collective action), can achieve positive adaptation and mitigation outcomes (medium confidence). They can also contribute revenue and provide incentive to rehabilitate degraded lands and adapt to and mitigate climate change in certain contexts (medium confidence). Policies promoting the target of land degradation neutrality can also support food security, human wellbeing and climate change adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). (Figure SPM.2) {3.4.2,4.1.6,4.7,4.8.5, 5.1.2, 5.7.3, 7.3, 7.4.6, 7.4.7, 7.5}
C. 1.2 Insecure land tenure affects the ability of people, communities and organisations to make changes to land that can advance adaptation and mitigation (medium confidence). Limited recognition of customary access to land and ownership of land can result in increased vulnerability and decreased adaptive capacity (medium confidence). Land policies (including recognition of customary tenure, community mapping, redistribution, decentralisation, co-management, regulation of rental markets) can provide both security and flexibility response to climate change (medium confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.2, 5.3, 7.2.4, 7.6.4, Cross- Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}
C. 1.3	Achieving land degradation neutrality will involve a balance of measures that avoid and reduce land degradation, through
adoption of sustainable land management, and measures to reverse degradation through rehabilitation and restoration of degraded land. Many interventions to achieve land degradation neutrality commonly also deliver climate change adaptation and mitigation benefits. The pursuit of land degradation neutrality provides impetus to address land degradation and climate change simultaneously (high confidence). {4.5.3,4.8.5,4.8.7, 7.4.5}
C. 1.4	Due to the complexity of challenges and the diversity of actors involved in addressing land challenges, a mix of policies,
rather than single policy approaches, can deliver improved results in addressing the complex challenges of sustainable land management and climate change (high confidence). Policy mixes can strongly reduce the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems to climate change (high confidence). Elements of such policy mixes may include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans (high confidence). (Figure SPM.4} {1.2,4.8,4.9.2, 5.3.2, 5.6, 5.6.6, 5.7.2, 7.3.2, 7.4, 7.4.2, 7.4.6, 7.4.7, 7.4.8, 7.5.5, 7.5.6, 7.6.4}
C. 2 Policies that operate across the food system, including those that reduce food loss and waste and influence dietary choices, enable more sustainable land-use management, enhanced food security and low emissions trajectories (high confidence). Such policies can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation, reduce land degradation, desertification and poverty as well as improve public health (high confidence). The adoption of sustainable land management and poverty eradication can be enabled by improving access to markets, securing land tenure, factoring environmental costs into food, making payments for ecosystem services, and enhancing local and community collective action (high confidence). {1.1.2,1.2.1, 3.6.3, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 4.8, 5.5, 6.4, 7.4.6, 7.6.5}
C. 2.1 Policies that enable and incentivise sustainable land management for climate change adaptation and mitigation include improved access to markets for inputs, outputs and financial services, empowering women and indigenous peoples, enhancing local and community collective action, reforming subsidies and promoting an enabling trade system (high confidence). Land restoration and rehabilitation efforts can be more effective when policies support local management of natural resources, while strengthening cooperation between actors and institutions, including at the international level. {3.6.3,4.1.6,4.5.4,4.8.2, 4.8.4, 5.7, 7.2, 7.3}


C. 2.2 Reflecting the environmental costs of land-degrading agricultural practices can incentivise more sustainable land management (high confidence). Barriers to the reflection of environmental costs arise from technical difficulties in estimating these costs and those embodied in foods. {3.6.3, 5.5.1,5.5.2, 5.6.6, 5.7, 7.4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
C. 2.3 Adaptation and enhanced resilience to extreme events impacting food systems can be facilitated by comprehensive risk management, including risk sharing and transfer mechanisms (high confidence). Agricultural diversification, expansion of market access, and preparation for increasing supply chain disruption can support the scaling up of adaptation in food systems (high confidence). {5.3.2, 5.3.3, 5.3.5}
C. 2.4 Public health policies to improve nutrition, such as increasing the diversity of food sources in public procurement, health insurance, financial incentives, and awareness-raising campaigns, can potentially influence food demand, reduce healthcare costs, contribute to lower GHG emissions and enhance adaptive capacity (high confidence). Influencing demand for food, through promoting diets based on public health guidelines, can enable more sustainable land management and contribute to achieving multiple SDGs (high confidence). {3.4.2,4.7.2, 5.1,5.7,6.3,6.4}
C.3 Acknowledging co-benefits and trade-offs when designing land and food policies can overcome barriers to implementation (medium confidence). Strengthened multi-level, hybrid and cross-sectoral governance, as well as policies developed and adopted in an iterative, coherent, adaptive and flexible manner can maximise co-benefits and minimise trade-offs, given that land management decisions are made from farm level to national scales, and both climate and land policies often range across multiple sectors, departments and agencies (high confidence). (Figure SPM.3) {4.8.5, 4.9, 5.6, 6.4, 7.3, 7.4.6, 7.4.8, 7.4.9, 7.5.6, 7.6.2}
C.3.1 Addressing desertification, land degradation, and food security in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner can assist climate resilient development and provides numerous potential co-benefits (high confidence). {3.7.5,4.8, 5.6, 5.7, 6.4, 7.2.2,
7.3.1, 7.3.4, 7.4.7, 7.4.8, 7.5.6, 7.5.5}
C.3.2 Technological, biophysical, socio-economic, financial and cultural barriers can limit the adoption of many land-based response options, as can uncertainty about benefits (high confidence). Many sustainable land management practices are not widely adopted due to insecure land tenure, lack of access to resources and agricultural advisory services, insufficient and unequal private and public incentives, and lack of knowledge and practical experience (high confidence). Public discourse, carefully designed policy interventions, incorporating social learning and market changes can together help reduce barriers to implementation (medium confidence). {3.6.1,3.6.2, 5.3.5, 5.5.2, 5.6,6.2,6.4, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6}
C.3.3 The land and food sectors face particular challenges of institutional fragmentation and often suffer from a lack of engagement between stakeholders at different scales and narrowly focused policy objectives (medium confidence). Coordination with other sectors, such as public health, transportation, environment, water, energy and infrastructure, can increase co-benefits, such as risk reduction and improved health (medium confidence). {5.6.3, 5.7,6.2,6.4.4, 7.1, 7.3, 7.4.8, 7.6.2, 7.6.3}
C.3.4 Some response options and policies may result in trade-offs, including social impacts, ecosystem functions and services damage, water depletion, or high costs, that cannot be well-managed, even with institutional best practices (medium confidence). Addressing such trade-offs helps avoid maladaptation (medium confidence). Anticipation and evaluation of potential tradeoffs and knowledge gaps supports evidence-based policymaking to weigh the costs and benefits of specific responses for different stakeholders (medium confidence). Successful management of trade-offs often includes maximising stakeholder input with structured feedback processes, particularly in community-based models, use of innovative fora like facilitated dialogues or spatially explicit mapping, and iterative adaptive management that allows for continuous readjustments in policy as new evidence comes to light (medium confidence). {5.3.5,6.4.2,6.4.4,6.4.5, 7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 7}
C.4 The effectiveness of decision-making and governance is enhanced by the involvement of local stakeholders (particularly those most vulnerable to climate change including indigenous peoples and local communities, women, and the poor and marginalised) in the selection, evaluation, implementation and monitoring of policy instruments for land-based climate change adaptation and mitigation (high confidence). Integration across sectors and scales increases the chance of maximising co-benefits and minimising trade-offs (medium confidence). {1.4, 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1.3, Box 5.1,
7.4, 7.6}


C.4.1 Successful implementation of sustainable land management practices requires accounting for local environmental and socioeconomic conditions (very high confidence). Sustainable land management in the context of climate change is typically advanced by involving all relevant stakeholders in identifying land-use pressures and impacts (such as biodiversity decline, soil loss, over-extraction of groundwater, habitat loss, land-use change in agriculture, food production and forestry) as well as preventing, reducing and restoring degraded land (medium confidence). {1.4.1,4.1.6,4.8.7, 5.2.5, 7.2.4, 7.6.2, 7.6.4}
C.4.2 Inclusiveness in the measurement, reporting and verification of the performance of policy instruments can support sustainable land management (medium confidence). Involving stakeholders in the selection of indicators, collection of climate data, land modelling and land-use planning, mediates and facilitates integrated landscape planning and choice of policy (medium confidence). {3.7.5, 5.7.4, 7.4.1, 7.4.4, 7.5.3, 7.5.4, 7.5.5, 7.6.4, 7.6.6}
C.4.3 Agricultural practices that include indigenous and local knowledge can contribute to overcoming the combined challenges of climate change, food security, biodiversity conservation, and combating desertification and land degradation (high confidence). Coordinated action across a range of actors including businesses, producers, consumers, land managers and policymakers in partnership with indigenous peoples and local communities enable conditions for the adoption of response options (high confidence) {3.1.3,3.6.1,3.6.2,4.8.2, 5.5.1,5.6.4, 5.7.1,5.7.4,6.2, 7.3, 7.4.6, 7.6.4}
C.4.4 Empowering women can bring synergies and co-benefits to household food security and sustainable land management (high confidence). Due to women's disproportionate vulnerability to climate change impacts, their inclusion in land management and tenure is constrained. Policies that can address land rights and barriers to women's participation in sustainable land management include financial transfers to women under the auspices of anti-poverty programmes, spending on health, education, training and capacity building for women, subsidised credit and program dissemination through existing women's community-based organisations (medium confidence). {1.4.1,4.8.2, 5.1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 7}









































A. Action in the near-term
D. 1 Actions can be taken in the near-term, based on existing knowledge, to address desertification, land degradation and food security while supporting longer-term responses that enable adaptation and mitigation to climate change. These include actions to build individual and institutional capacity, accelerate knowledge transfer, enhance technology transfer and deployment, enable financial mechanisms, implement early warning systems, undertake risk management and address gaps in implementation and upscaling (high confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.7.2, 4.8, 5.3.3, 5.5, 5.6.4, 5.7, 6.2, 6.4, 7.3, 7.4, 7.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
D. 1.1 Near-term capacity-building, technology transfer and deployment, and enabling financial mechanisms can strengthen adaptation and mitigation in the land sector. Knowledge and technology transfer can help enhance the sustainable use of natural resources for food security under a changing climate (medium confidence). Raising awareness, capacity building and education about sustainable land management practices, agricultural extension and advisory services, and expansion of access to agricultural services to producers and land users can effectively address land degradation (medium confidence). {3.1,
5.7.4, 7.2, 7.3.4, 7.5.4}
D. 1.2 Measuring and monitoring land use change including land degradation and desertification is supported by the expanded use of new information and communication technologies (cell phone based applications, cloud-based services, ground sensors, drone imagery), use of climate services, and remotely sensed land and climate information on land resources (medium confidence). Early warning systems for extreme weather and climate events are critical for protecting lives and property and enhancing disaster risk reduction and management (high confidence). Seasonal forecasts and early warning systems are critical for food security (famine) and biodiversity monitoring including pests and diseases and adaptive climate risk management (high confidence). There are high returns on investments in human and institutional capacities. These investments include access to observation and early warning systems, and other services derived from in-situ hydro-meteorological and remote sensing- based monitoring systems and data, field observation, inventory and survey, and expanded use of digital technologies (high confidence). {1.2,3.6.2,4.2.2,4.2.4, 5.3.1,5.3.6,6.4, 7.3.4, 7.4.3, 7.5.4, 7.5.5, 7.6.4, Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 3}
D. 1.3 Framing land management in terms of risk management, specific to land, can play an important role in adaptation through landscape approaches, biological control of outbreaks of pests and diseases, and improving risk sharing and transfer mechanisms (high confidence). Providing information on climate-related risk can improve the capacity of land managers and enable timely decision making (high confidence). {5.3.2, 5.3.5, 5.6.2, 5.6.3 5.6.5, 5.7.1, 5.7.2, 7.2.4, Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5}
D. 1.4	Sustainable land management can be improved by increasing the availability and accessibility of data and information
relating to the effectiveness, co-benefits and risks of emerging response options and increasing the efficiency of land use (high confidence). Some response options (e.g., improved soil carbon management) have been implemented only at small- scale demonstration facilities and knowledge, financial, and institutional gaps and challenges exist with upscaling and the widespread deployment of these options (medium confidence). {4.8, 5.5.1,5.5.2, 5.6.1,5.6.5, 5.7.5,6.2,6.4}
D. 2 Near-term action to address climate change adaptation and mitigation, desertification, land degradation and food security can bring social, ecological, economic and development co-benefits (high confidence). Co-benefits can contribute to poverty eradication and more resilient livelihoods for those who are vulnerable (high confidence). {3.4.2, 5.7, 7.5}
D. 2.1 Near-term actions to promote sustainable land management will help reduce land and food-related vulnerabilities, and can create more resilient livelihoods, reduce land degradation and desertification, and loss of biodiversity (high confidence). There are synergies between sustainable land management, poverty eradication efforts, access to market, non-market mechanisms and the elimination of low-productivity practices. Maximising these synergies can lead to adaptation, mitigation, and development co-benefits through preserving ecosystem functions and services (medium confidence). {3.4.2, 3.6.3, Table 4.2, 4.7,4.9,4.10, 5.6, 5.7, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 7}
D. 2.2 Investments in land restoration can result in global benefits and in drylands can have benefit-cost ratios of between three and six in terms of the estimated economic value of restored ecosystem services (medium confidence). Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are profitable within three to ten years (medium confidence). While they can
Summary for Policymakers
require upfront investment, actions to ensure sustainable land management can improve crop yields and the economic value of pasture. Land restoration and rehabilitation measures improve livelihood systems and provide both short-term positive economic returns and longer-term benefits in terms of climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity and enhanced ecosystem functions and services (high confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.3, 4.8.1, 7.2.4, 7.2.3, 7.3.1, 7.4.6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
D. 2.3 Upfront investments in sustainable land management practices and technologies can range from about USD20 ha1 to USD5000 ha'1, with a median estimated to be around USD500 ha'1. Government support and improved access to credit can help overcome barriers to adoption, especially those faced by poor smallholder farmers (high confidence). Near-term change to balanced diets (SPM B6.2.) can reduce the pressure on land and provide significant health co-benefits through improving nutrition (medium confidence). {3.6.3,4.8, 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7,6.4, 7.4.7, 7.5.5, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6}
D.3 Rapid reductions in anthropogenic GHG emissions across all sectors following ambitious mitigation pathways reduce negative impacts of climate change on land ecosystems and food systems (medium confidence). Delaying climate mitigation and adaptation responses across sectors would lead to increasingly negative impacts on land and reduce the prospect of sustainable development (medium confidence). (Box SPM.1, Figure SPM.2) {2.5,2.7, 5.2,6.2,6.4,7.2,7.3.1,7.4.7,7.4.8,7.5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 6, Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
D.3.1 Delayed action across sectors leads to an increasing need for widespread deployment of land-based adaptation and mitigation options and can result in a decreasing potential for the array of these options in most regions of the world and limit their current and future effectiveness (high confidence). Acting now may avert or reduce risks and losses, and generate benefits to society (medium confidence). Prompt action on climate mitigation and adaptation aligned with sustainable land management and sustainable development depending on the region could reduce the risk to millions of people from climate extremes, desertification, land degradation and food and livelihood insecurity (high confidence). {1.3.5, 3.4.2, 3.5.2,4.1.6,4.7.1,4.7.2, 5.2.3, 5.3.1,6.3, 6.5, 7.3.1}
D.3.2 In future scenarios, deferral of GHG emissions reductions implies trade-offs leading to significantly higher costs and risks associated with rising temperatures (medium confidence). The potential for some response options, such as increasing soil organic carbon, decreases as climate change intensifies, as soils have reduced capacity to act as sinks for carbon sequestration at higher temperatures (high confidence). Delays in avoiding or reducing land degradation and promoting positive ecosystem restoration risk long-term impacts including rapid declines in productivity of agriculture and rangelands, permafrost degradation and difficulties in peatland rewetting (medium confidence). {1.3.1, 3.6.2,4.8,4.9,4.9.1, 5.5.2, 6.3, 6.4, 7.2, 7.3; Cross-Chapter Box 10 in Chapter 7}
D.3.3 Deferral of GHG emissions reductions from all sectors implies trade-offs including irreversible loss in land ecosystem functions and services required for food, health, habitable settlements and production, leading to increasingly significant economic impacts on many countries in many regions of the world (high confidence). Delaying action as is assumed in high emissions scenarios could result in some irreversible impacts on some ecosystems, which in the longer-term has the potential to lead to substantial additional GHG emissions from ecosystems that would accelerate global warming (medium confidence).

IPCC-2021-1.txt,"Climate Change 2021 The Physical Science Basis  Summary for Policymakers  WGI  Working Group I contribution to the  Sixth Assessment Report of the   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change   Introduction    This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents key findings of the Working Group I (WGI)  contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)1 on the physical science basis of climate  change. The report builds upon the 2013 Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth  Assessment Report (AR5) and the 2018–2019 IPCC Special Reports2 of the AR6 cycle and  incorporates subsequent new evidence from climate science3.     This SPM provides a high-level summary of the understanding of the current state of the climate,  including how it is changing and the role of human influence, the state of knowledge about possible  climate futures, climate information relevant to regions and sectors, and limiting human-induced  climate change.     Based on scientific understanding, key findings can be formulated as statements of fact or  associated with an assessed level of confidence indicated using the IPCC calibrated language4.    The scientific basis for each key finding is found in chapter sections of the main Report, and in the  integrated synthesis presented in the Technical Summary (hereafter TS), and is indicated in curly  brackets. The AR6 WGI Interactive Atlas facilitates exploration of these key synthesis findings, and  supporting climate change information, across the WGI reference regions5.        2 The three Special reports are: Global warming of 1.5°C: an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the  threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land: an IPCC  Special Report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas  fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).   3 The assessment covers scientific literature accepted for publication by 31 January 2021.   4 Each finding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five  qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high and very high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium confidence. The following terms  have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or a result: virtually certain 99–100% probability, very likely 90– 100%, likely 66–100%, about as likely as not 33–66%, unlikely 0–33%, very unlikely 0–10%, exceptionally unlikely 0–1%.  Additional terms (extremely likely 95–100%, more likely than not >50–100%, and extremely unlikely 0–5%) may also be used when  appropriate. Assessed likelihood is typeset in italics, for example, very likely. This is consistent with AR5. In this Report, unless  stated otherwise, square brackets [x to y] are used to provide the assessed very likely range, or 90% interval.    A.  The Current State of the Climate    Since AR5, improvements in observationally based estimates and information from paleoclimate archives  provide a comprehensive view of each component of the climate system and its changes to date. New climate  model simulations, new analyses, and methods combining multiple lines of evidence lead to improved  understanding of human influence on a wider range of climate variables, including weather and climate  extremes. The time periods considered throughout this Section depend upon the availability of observational  products, paleoclimate archives and peer-reviewed studies.      A.1  It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.  Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere  have occurred.       A.1.1  Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are  unequivocally caused by human activities. Since 2011 (measurements reported in AR5), concentrations have  continued to increase in the atmosphere, reaching annual averages of 410 ppm for carbon dioxide (CO2),  1866 ppb for methane (CH4), and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide (N2O) in 20196. Land and ocean have taken up a  near-constant proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past  six decades, with regional differences (high confidence)7. {2.2, 5.2, 7.3, TS.2.2, Box TS.5}    A.1.2  Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since  1850. Global surface temperature8 in the first two decades of the 21st century (2001-2020) was 0.99 [0.84- 1.10] °C higher than 1850-19009. Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20] °C higher in 2011– 2020 than 1850–1900, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83] °C) than over the ocean (0.88  [0.68 to 1.01] °C). The estimated increase in global surface temperature since AR5 is principally due to  further warming since 2003–2012 (+0.19 [0.16 to 0.22] °C). Additionally, methodological advances and new  datasets contributed approximately 0.1ºC to the updated estimate of warming in AR610.     6 Other GHG concentrations in 2019 were: PFCs (109 ppt CF4 equivalent); SF6 (10 ppt); NF3 (2 ppt); HFCs (237 ppt HFC-134a  equivalent); other Montreal Protocol gases (mainly CFCs, HCFCs, 1032 ppt CFC-12 equivalent). Increases from 2011 are 19 ppm  for CO2, 63 ppb for CH4 and 8 ppb for N2O.      7 Land and ocean are not substantial sinks for other GHGs.   8 The term ‘global surface temperature’ is used in reference to both global mean surface temperature and global surface air  temperature throughout this SPM. Changes in these quantities are assessed with high confidence to differ by at most 10% from one  another, but conflicting lines of evidence lead to low confidence in the sign of any difference in long-term trend. {Cross-Section Box  TS.1}    9 The period 1850–1900 represents the earliest period of sufficiently globally complete observations to estimate global surface  temperature and, consistent with AR5 and SR1.5, is used as an approximation for pre-industrial conditions.    10 Since AR5, methodological advances and new datasets have provided a more complete spatial representation of changes in surface  temperature, including in the Arctic. These and other improvements have additionally increased the estimate of global surface  temperature change by approximately 0.1 ºC, but this increase does not represent additional physical warming since the AR5.      A.1.3  The likely range of total human-caused global surface temperature increase from 1850–1900 to  2010–201911 is 0.8°C to 1.3°C, with a best estimate of 1.07°C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs contributed  a warming of 1.0°C to 2.0°C, other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0°C to  0.8°C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by –0.1°C to 0.1°C, and internal variability  changed it by –0.2°C to 0.2°C. It is very likely that well-mixed GHGs were the main driver12 of tropospheric  warming since 1979, and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main  driver of cooling of the lower stratosphere between 1979 and the mid-1990s.    A.1.4  Globally averaged precipitation over land has likely increased since 1950, with a faster rate of  increase since the 1980s (medium confidence). It is likely that human influence contributed to the pattern of  observed precipitation changes since the mid-20th century, and extremely likely that human influence  contributed to the pattern of observed changes in near-surface ocean salinity. Mid-latitude storm tracks have  likely shifted poleward in both hemispheres since the 1980s, with marked seasonality in trends (medium  confidence). For the Southern Hemisphere, human influence very likely contributed to the poleward shift of  the closely related extratropical jet in austral summer.    A.1.5  Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and  the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019 (about 40% in September and about  10% in March). There has been no significant trend in Antarctic sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 due to  regionally opposing trends and large internal variability. Human influence very likely contributed to the  decrease in Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover since 1950. It is very likely that human influence has  contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, but there is  only limited evidence, with medium agreement, of human influence on the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss.    A.1.6  extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2  emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean. There is high  confidence that oxygen levels have dropped in many upper ocean regions since the mid-20th century, and  medium confidence that human influence contributed to this drop.     A.1.7  Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate  of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1] mm yr–1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr–1  between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to 4.2] mm yr–1 between 2006 and 2018 (high  confidence). Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971.     A.1.8  Changes in the land biosphere since 1970 are consistent with global warming: climate zones have  shifted poleward in both hemispheres, and the growing season has on average lengthened by up to two days  per decade since the 1950s in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics (high confidence).           It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean (0–700 m) has warmed since the 1970s and      11 The period distinction with A.1.2 arises because the attribution studies consider this slightly earlier period. The observed warming  to 2010–2019 is 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °C.   12 Throughout this SPM, ‘main driver’ means responsible for more than 50% of the change.      Figure SPM.1:    History of global temperature change and causes of recent warming.  Panel a): Changes in global surface temperature reconstructed from paleoclimate archives (solid grey line,  1–2000) and from direct observations (solid black line, 1850–2020), both relative to 1850–1900 and decadally  averaged. The vertical bar on the left shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest  multi-century period in at least the last 100,000 years, which occurred around 6500 years ago during the current  interglacial period (Holocene). The Last Interglacial, around 125,000 years ago, is the next most recent candidate  for a period of higher temperature. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital  variations. The grey shading with white diagonal lines shows the very likely ranges for the temperature  reconstructions.  Panel b): Changes in global surface temperature over the past 170 years (black line) relative to 1850–1900  and annually averaged, compared to CMIP6 climate model simulations (see Box SPM.1) of the temperature  response to both human and natural drivers (brown), and to only natural drivers (solar and volcanic activity, green).  Solid coloured lines show the multi-model average, and coloured shades show the very likely range of simulations.  (see Figure SPM.2 for the assessed contributions to warming).  {2.3.1, 3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1a, TS.2.2}  Figure SPM.2:    Assessed contributions to observed warming in 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900.    Panel a): Observed global warming (increase in global surface temperature) and its very likely range {3.3.1,  Cross-Chapter Box 2.3}. Panel b): Evidence from attribution studies, which synthesize information from climate models and  observations. The panel shows temperature change attributed to total human influence, changes in well-mixed  greenhouse gas concentrations, other human drivers due to aerosols, ozone and land-use change (land-use  reflectance), solar and volcanic drivers, and internal climate variability. Whiskers show likely ranges {3.3.1}.  Panel c): Evidence from the assessment of radiative forcing and climate sensitivity. The panel shows  temperature changes from individual components of human influence, including emissions of greenhouse gases,  aerosols and their precursors; land-use changes (land-use reflectance and irrigation); and aviation contrails.  Whiskers show very likely ranges. Estimates account for both direct emissions into the atmosphere and their effect,  if any, on other climate drivers. For aerosols, both direct (through radiation) and indirect (through interactions with  clouds) effects are considered.{6.4.2, 7.3} A.2  The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of   many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many  thousands of years.   In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than at any time in at least 2 million years       A.2.1  (high confidence), and concentrations of CH4 and N2O were higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years  (very high confidence). Since 1750, increases in CO2 (47%) and CH4 (156%) concentrations far exceed, and  increases in N2O (23%) are similar to, the natural multi-millennial changes between glacial and interglacial  periods over at least the past 800,000 years (very high confidence).  {2.2, 5.1, TS.2.2}    A.2.2  Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at  least the last 2000 years (high confidence). Temperatures during the most recent decade (2011–2020) exceed  those of the most recent multi-century warm period, around 6500 years ago13 [0.2°C to 1°C relative to 1850– 1900] (medium confidence). Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125,000 years ago  when the multi-century temperature [0.5°C to 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900] overlaps the observations of the  most recent decade (medium confidence).    A.2.3 In 2011–2020, annual average Arctic sea ice area reached its lowest level since at least 1850 (high  confidence). Late summer Arctic sea ice area was smaller than at any time in at least the past 1000 years  (medium confidence). The global nature of glacier retreat, with almost all of the world’s glaciers retreating  synchronously, since the 1950s is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years (medium confidence).    A.2.4  Global mean sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least the last  3000 years (high confidence). The global ocean has warmed faster over the past century than since the end of  the last deglacial transition (around 11,000 years ago) (medium confidence). A long-term increase in surface  open ocean pH occurred over the past 50 million years (high confidence), and surface open ocean pH as low  as recent decades is unusual in the last 2 million years (medium confidence).           13 As stated in section B.1, even under the very low emissions scenario SSP1-1.9, temperatures are assessed to remain elevated above  those of the most recent decade until at least 2100 and therefore warmer than the century-scale period 6500 years ago.          A.3  Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes   in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as  heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their  attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5.      A.3.1  It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more  intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become  less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver14 of  these changes. Some recent hot extremes observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely  to occur without human influence on the climate system. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in  frequency since the 1980s (high confidence), and human influence has very likely contributed to most of  them since at least 2006.      A.3.2  The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most  land area for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis (high confidence), and human-induced  climate change is likely the main driver. Human-induced climate change has contributed to increases in  agricultural and ecological droughts15 in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration16 (medium  confidence).     A.3.3  Decreases in global land monsoon precipitation17 from the 1950s to the 1980s are partly attributed to  human-caused Northern Hemisphere aerosol emissions, but increases since then have resulted from rising  GHG concentrations and decadal to multi-decadal internal variability (medium confidence). Over South Asia,  East Asia and West Africa increases in monsoon precipitation due to warming from GHG emissions were  counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation due to cooling from human-caused aerosol emissions  over the 20th century (high confidence). Increases in West African monsoon precipitation since the 1980s are  partly due to the growing influence of GHGs and reductions in the cooling effect of human-caused aerosol  emissions over Europe and North America (medium confidence).     14 Throughout this SPM, ‘main driver’ means responsible for more than 50% of the change.       15 Agricultural and ecological drought (depending on the affected biome): a period with abnormal soil moisture deficit, which results  from combined shortage of precipitation and excess evapotranspiration, and during the growing season impinges on crop production  or ecosystem function in general. Observed changes in meteorological droughts (precipitation deficits) and hydrological droughts  (streamflow deficits) are distinct from those in agricultural and ecological droughts and addressed in the underlying AR6 material  (Chapter 11).   16 The combined processes through which water is transferred to the atmosphere from open water and ice surfaces, bare soil, and  vegetation that make up the Earth’s surface.    17 The global monsoon is defined as the area in which the annual range (local summer minus local winter) of precipitation is greater  than 2.5 mm day–1. Global land monsoon precipitation refers to the mean precipitation over land areas within the global monsoon.       A.3.4  It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3–5) tropical cyclone occurrence has  increased over the last four decades, and the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific  reach their peak intensity has shifted northward; these changes cannot be explained by internal variability  alone (medium confidence). There is low confidence in long-term (multi-decadal to centennial) trends in the  frequency of all-category tropical cyclones. Event attribution studies and physical understanding indicate  that human-induced climate change increases heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones (high  confidence) but data limitations inhibit clear detection of past trends on the global scale.   {8.2, 11.7, Box TS.10}     A.3.5  Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events18 since the 1950s.  This includes increases in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale (high  confidence); fire weather in some regions of all inhabited continents (medium confidence); and compound  flooding in some locations (medium confidence). {11.6, 11.7, 11.8, 12.3, 12.4, TS.2.6, Table TS.5, Box  TS.10}           18 Compound extreme events are the combination of multiple drivers and/or hazards that contribute to societal or environmental risk.  Examples are concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding (e.g., a storm surge in combination with extreme rainfall  and/or river flow), compound fire weather conditions (i.e., a combination of hot, dry, and windy conditions), or concurrent extremes  at different locations.      Figure SPM.3:  Synthesis of assessed observed and attributable regional changes.      The IPCC AR6 WGI inhabited regions are displayed as hexagons with identical size in their approximate  geographical location (see legend for regional acronyms). All assessments are made for each region as a whole and  for the 1950s to the present. Assessments made on different time scales or more local spatial scales might differ  from what is shown in the figure. The colours in each panel represent the four outcomes of the assessment on  observed changes. White and light grey striped hexagons are used where there is low agreement in the type of  change for the region as a whole, and grey hexagons are used when there is limited data and/or literature that  prevents an assessment of the region as a whole. Other colours indicate at least medium confidence in the observed  change. The confidence level for the human influence on these observed changes is based on assessing trend  detection and attribution and event attribution literature, and it is indicated by the number of dots: three dots for  high confidence, two dots for medium confidence and one dot for low confidence (filled: limited agreement; empty:  limited evidence).     Panel a) For hot extremes, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on daily maximum  temperatures; regional studies using other indices (heatwave duration, frequency and intensity) are used in addition.  Red hexagons indicate regions where there is at least medium confidence in an observed increase in hot extremes.     Panel b) For heavy precipitation, the evidence is mostly drawn from changes in indices based on one-day or five- day precipitation amounts using global and regional studies. Green hexagons indicate regions where there is at least  medium confidence in an observed increase in heavy precipitation.     Panel c) Agricultural and ecological droughts are assessed based on observed and simulated changes in total  column soil moisture, complemented by evidence on changes in surface soil moisture, water balance (precipitation  minus evapotranspiration) and indices driven by precipitation and atmospheric evaporative demand. Yellow  hexagons indicate regions where there is at least medium confidence in an observed increase in this type of drought  and green hexagons indicate regions where there is at least medium confidence in an observed decrease in  agricultural and ecological drought.     For all regions, table TS.5 shows a broader range of observed changes besides the ones shown in this figure.  Note  that SSA is the only region that does not display observed changes in the metrics shown in this figure, but is  affected by observed increases in mean temperature, decreases in frost, and increases in marine heatwaves.           A.4  Improved knowledge of climate processes, paleoclimate evidence and the response of the   climate system to increasing radiative forcing gives a best estimate of equilibrium  climate sensitivity of 3°C with a narrower range compared to AR5.     A.4.1  Human-caused radiative forcing of 2.72 [1.96 to 3.48] W m–2 in 2019 relative to 1750 has warmed  the climate system. This warming is mainly due to increased GHG concentrations, partly reduced by cooling  due to increased aerosol concentrations. The radiative forcing has increased by 0.43 W m–2 (19%) relative to  AR5, of which 0.34 W m–2 is due to the increase in GHG concentrations since 2011. The remainder is due to  improved scientific understanding and changes in the assessment of aerosol forcing, which include decreases  in concentration and improvement in its calculation (high confidence).          A.4.2  Human-caused net positive radiative forcing causes an accumulation of additional energy (heating)  in the climate system, partly reduced by increased energy loss to space in response to surface warming. The  observed average rate of heating of the climate system increased from 0.50 [0.32 to 0.69] W m–2 for the  period 1971–200619, to 0.79 [0.52 to 1.06] W m–2 for the period 2006–201820 (high confidence). Ocean  warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and  atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively (high confidence).    A.4.3  Heating of the climate system has caused global mean sea level rise through ice loss on land and  thermal expansion from ocean warming. Thermal expansion explained 50% of sea level rise during 1971– 2018, while ice loss from glaciers contributed 22%, ice sheets 20% and changes in land water storage 8%.  The rate of ice sheet loss increased by a factor of four between 1992–1999 and 2010–2019. Together, ice  sheet and glacier mass loss were the dominant contributors to global mean sea level rise during 2006-2018.  (high confidence)     A.4.4  The equilibrium climate sensitivity is an important quantity used to estimate how the climate  responds to radiative forcing. Based on multiple lines of evidence21, the very likely range of equilibrium  climate sensitivity is between 2°C (high confidence) and 5°C (medium confidence). The AR6 assessed best  estimate is 3°C with a likely range of 2.5°C to 4°C (high confidence), compared to 1.5°C to 4.5°C in AR5,  which did not provide a best estimate.          19 cumulative energy increase of 282 [177 to 387] ZJ over 1971–2006 (1 ZJ = 1021 J).   20 cumulative energy increase of 152 [100 to 205] ZJ over 2006–2018.      21 Understanding of climate processes, the instrumental record, paleoclimates and model-based emergent constraints (see glossary).       B.  Possible Climate Futures    A set of five new illustrative emissions scenarios is considered consistently across this report to explore the  climate response to a broader range of greenhouse gas (GHG), land use and air pollutant futures than  assessed in AR5. This set of scenarios drives climate model projections of changes in the climate system.  These projections account for solar activity and background forcing from volcanoes. Results over the 21st  century are provided for the near-term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060) and long-term (2081–2100)  relative to 1850–1900, unless otherwise stated.    Box SPM.1:  Scenarios, Climate Models and Projections    Box SPM.1.1:  This report assesses the climate response to five illustrative scenarios that cover the range of  possible future development of anthropogenic drivers of climate change found in the literature. They start in  2015, and include scenarios22 with high and very high GHG emissions (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) and CO2  emissions that roughly double from current levels by 2100 and 2050, respectively, scenarios with  intermediate GHG emissions (SSP2-4.5) and CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle  of the century, and scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions and CO2 emissions declining to net zero  around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions23 (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6)  as illustrated in Figure SPM.4. Emissions vary between scenarios depending on socio-economic  assumptions, levels of climate change mitigation and, for aerosols and non-methane ozone precursors, air  pollution controls. Alternative assumptions may result in similar emissions and climate responses, but the  socio-economic assumptions and the feasibility or likelihood of individual scenarios is not part of the  assessment.    Box SPM.1.2:  This report assesses results from climate models participating in the Coupled Model  Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) of the World Climate Research Programme. These models include  new and better representation of physical, chemical and biological processes, as well as higher resolution,  compared to climate models considered in previous IPCC assessment reports. This has improved the  simulation of the recent mean state of most large-scale indicators of climate change and many other aspects  across the climate system. Some differences from observations remain, for example in regional precipitation  patterns. The CMIP6 historical simulations assessed in this report have an ensemble mean global surface  temperature change within 0.2°C of the observations over most of the historical period, and observed  warming is within the very likely range of the CMIP6 ensemble. However, some CMIP6 models simulate a  warming that is either above or below the assessed very likely range of observed warming.     Box SPM.1.3:  The CMIP6 models considered in this Report have a wider range of climate sensitivity than  in CMIP5 models and the AR6 assessed very likely range, which is based on multiple lines of evidence.  These CMIP6 models also show a higher average climate sensitivity than CMIP5 and the AR6 assessed best  estimate. The higher CMIP6 climate sensitivity values compared to CMIP5 can be traced to an amplifying  cloud feedback that is larger in CMIP6 by about 20%.   {Box 7.1, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, TS.3.2}    Box SPM.1.4:  For the first time in an IPCC report, assessed future changes in global surface temperature,  ocean warming and sea level are constructed by combining multi-model projections with observational  constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as the AR6 assessment of climate sensitivity. For other  quantities, such robust methods do not yet exist to constrain the projections. Nevertheless, robust projected geographical patterns of many variables can be identified at a given level of global warming, common to all  scenarios considered and independent of timing when the global warming level is reached.  {1.6, Box 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 7.5, 9.2, 9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Section Box TS.1}   Future emissions cause future additional warming, with total warming  dominated by past and future CO₂ emissions  Figure SPM.4:  Future anthropogenic emissions of key drivers of climate change and warming contributions by   groups of drivers for the five illustrative scenarios used in this report.

Shown are emissions  trajectories for carbon dioxide (CO2) from all sectors (GtCO2/yr) (left graph) and for a subset of three key non- CO2 drivers considered in the scenarios: methane (CH4, MtCH4/yr, top-right graph), nitrous oxide (N2O,  MtN2O/yr, middle-right graph) and sulfur dioxide (SO2, MtSO2/yr, bottom-right graph, contributing to  anthropogenic aerosols in panel b).    Panel b) Warming contributions by groups of anthropogenic drivers and by scenario are shown as change  in global surface temperature (°C) in 2081–2100 relative to 1850–1900, with indication of the observed  warming to date. Bars and whiskers represent median values and the very likely range, respectively. Within each  scenario bar plot, the bars represent total global warming (°C; total bar) (see Table SPM.1) and warming  contributions (°C) from changes in CO2 (CO2 bar), from non-CO2 greenhouse gases (non-CO2 GHGs bar;  comprising well-mixed greenhouse gases and ozone) and net cooling from other anthropogenic drivers (aerosols  and land-use bar; anthropogenic aerosols, changes in reflectance due to land-use and irrigation changes, and  contrails from aviation; see Figure SPM.2, panel c, for the warming contributions to date for individual drivers).  The best estimate for observed warming in 2010–2019 relative to 1850–1900 (see Figure SPM.2, panel a) is  indicated in the darker column in the total bar. Warming contributions in panel b are calculated as explained in  Table SPM.1 for the total bar. For the other bars the contribution by groups of drivers are calculated with a  physical climate emulator of global surface temperature which relies on climate sensitivity and radiative forcing  assessments.        B.1  Global surface temperature will continue to increase until at least the mid-century  under all emissions scenarios considered. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be  exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO2 and other greenhouse  gas emissions occur in the coming decades.  {2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5} (Figure SPM.1, Figure  SPM.4, Figure SPM.8, Table SPM.1, Box SPM.1)       B.1.1  Compared to 1850–1900, global surface temperature averaged over 2081–2100 is very likely to be  higher by 1.0°C to 1.8°C under the very low GHG emissions scenario considered (SSP1-1.9), by 2.1°C to  3.5°C in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5) and by 3.3°C to 5.7°C under the very high GHG emissions  scenario (SSP5-8.5)24. The last time global surface temperature was sustained at or above 2.5°C higher than  1850–1900 was over 3 million years ago (medium confidence).   {2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 4.3, 4.5, Box TS.2, Box TS.4, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Table SPM.1)      Table SPM.1:  Changes in global surface temperature, which are assessed based on multiple lines of evidence, for  selected 20-year time periods and the five illustrative emissions scenarios considered. Temperature  differences relative to the average global surface temperature of the period 1850–1900 are reported in  °C. This includes the revised assessment of observed historical warming for the AR5 reference period  1986–2005, which in AR6 is higher by 0.08 [–0.01 to 0.12] °C than in the AR5 (see footnote 10).  Changes relative to the recent reference period 1995–2014 may be calculated approximately by  subtracting 0.85°C, the best estimate of the observed warming from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014.  {Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, 4.3, 4.4, Cross-Section Box TS.1}       B.1.2  Based on the assessment of multiple lines of evidence, global warming of 2°C, relative to 1850– 1900, would be exceeded during the 21st century under the high and very high GHG emissions scenarios  considered in this report (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively). Global warming of 2°C would extremely  likely be exceeded in the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5).  Under the very low and low GHG emissions  scenarios, global warming of 2°C is extremely unlikely to be exceeded (SSP1-1.9), or unlikely to be exceeded  (SSP1-2.6)25.  Crossing the 2°C global warming level in the mid-term period (2041–2060) is very likely to  occur under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to occur under the high GHG  emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0), and more likely than not to occur in the intermediate GHG emissions  scenario (SSP2-4.5)26.  {4.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.4, Box SPM.1)    B.1.3  Global warming of 1.5°C relative to 1850-1900 would be exceeded during the 21st century under the  intermediate, high and very high scenarios considered in this report (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5,  respectively). Under the five illustrative scenarios, in the near term (2021-2040), the 1.5°C global warming  level is very likely to be exceeded under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), likely to be  exceeded under the intermediate and high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0), more likely  than not to be exceeded under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) and more likely than not to be  reached under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9)27. Furthermore, for the very low GHG  emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), it is more likely than not that global surface temperature would decline back  to below 1.5°C toward the end of the 21st century, with a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1°C above  1.5°C global warming.  {4.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.4)        25 SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 are scenarios that start in 2015 and have very low and low GHG emissions and CO2 emissions declining to  net zero around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions.  26 Crossing is defined here as having the assessed global surface temperature change, averaged over a 20-year period, exceed a  particular global warming level.  27 The AR6 assessment of when a given global warming level is first exceeded benefits from the consideration of the illustrative  scenarios, the multiple lines of evidence entering the assessment of future global surface temperature response to radiative forcing,  and the improved estimate of historical warming. The AR6 assessment is thus not directly comparable to the SR1.5 SPM, which  reported likely reaching 1.5°C global warming between 2030 and 2052, from a simple linear extrapolation of warming rates of the  recent past. When considering scenarios similar to SSP1-1.9 instead of linear extrapolation, the SR1.5 estimate of when 1.5°C global warming is first exceeded is close to the best estimate reported here.  28 Natural variability refers to climatic fluctuations that occur without any human influence, that is, internal variability combined with  the response to external natural factors such as volcanic eruptions, changes in solar activity and, on longer time scales, orbital effects  and plate tectonics.   29 The internal variability in any single year is estimated to be ± 0.25°C (5–95% range, high confidence).  30 Projected changes in agricultural and ecological droughts are primarily assessed based on total column soil moisture. See footnote  15 for definition and relation to precipitation and evapotranspiration.        B.1.4  Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced  trend, due to substantial natural variability28. The occurrence of individual years with global surface  temperature change above a certain level, for example 1.5°C or 2ºC, relative to 1850–1900 does not imply  that this global warming level has been reached29.    {Cross-Chapter Box 2.3, 4.3, 4.4, Box 4.1, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.1, Figure  SPM.8)      B.2  Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global  warming. They include increases in the frequency and intensity of hot extremes, marine  heatwaves, and heavy precipitation, agricultural and ecological droughts in some  regions, and proportion of intense tropical cyclones, as well as reductions in Arctic sea  ice, snow cover and permafrost. {4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 7.4, 8.2, 8.4, Box 8.2, 9.3, 9.5, Box 9.2, 11.1,  11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 12.4, 12.5, Cross-Chapter Box  12.1, Atlas.4, Atlas.5, Atlas.6, Atlas.7, Atlas.8, Atlas.9, Atlas.10, Atlas.11} (Figure SPM.5,  Figure SPM.6, Figure SPM.8)       B.2.1  It is virtually certain that the land surface will continue to warm more than the ocean surface (likely  1.4 to 1.7 times more). It is virtually certain that the Arctic will continue to warm more than global surface  temperature, with high confidence above two times the rate of global warming.  {2.3, 4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 7.4, 11.1, 11.3, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Atlas.4, Atlas.5, Atlas.6,  Atlas.7, Atlas.8, Atlas.9, Atlas.10, Atlas.11, Cross-Section Box TS.1, TS.2.6} (Figure SPM.5)    B.2.2  With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger.  For example, every additional 0.5°C of global warming causes clearly discernible increases in the intensity  and frequency of hot extremes, including heatwaves (very likely), and heavy precipitation (high confidence),  as well as agricultural and ecological droughts30 in some regions (high confidence). Discernible changes in  intensity and frequency of meteorological droughts, with more regions showing increases than decreases, are  seen in some regions for every additional 0.5°C of global warming (medium confidence). Increases in  frequency and intensity of hydrological droughts become larger with increasing global warming in some  regions (medium confidence). There will be an increasing occurrence of some extreme events unprecedented  in the observational record with additional global warming, even at 1.5°C of global warming. Projected  percentage changes in frequency are higher for rarer events (high confidence).  {8.2, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, TS.2.6} (Figure  SPM.5, Figure SPM.6)          B.2.3  Some mid-latitude and semi-arid regions, and the South American Monsoon region, are projected to  see the highest increase in the temperature of the hottest days, at about 1.5 to 2 times the rate of global  warming (high confidence). The Arctic is projected to experience the highest increase in the temperature of  the coldest days, at about 3 times the rate of global warming (high confidence). With additional global  warming, the frequency of marine heatwaves will continue to increase (high confidence), particularly in the  tropical ocean and the Arctic (medium confidence).  {Box 9.2, 11.1, 11.3, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, 12.4, TS.2.4, TS.2.6} (Figure  SPM.6)    B.2.4  It is very likely that heavy precipitation events will intensify and become more frequent in most  regions with additional global warming. At the global scale, extreme daily precipitation events are projected  to intensify by about 7% for each 1°C of global warming (high confidence). The proportion of intense  tropical cyclones (categories 4-5) and peak wind speeds of the most intense tropical cyclones are projected to  increase at the global scale with increasing global warming (high confidence).  {8.2, 11.4, 11.7, 11.9, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Box TS.6, TS.4.3.1} (Figure SPM.5, Figure SPM.6)    B.2.5  Additional warming is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing, and loss of seasonal snow  cover, of land ice and of Arctic sea ice (high confidence). The Arctic is likely to be practically sea ice free in  September31 at least once before 2050 under the five illustrative scenarios considered in this report, with  more frequent occurrences for higher warming levels. There is low confidence in the projected decrease of  Antarctic sea ice.  {4.3, 4.5, 7.4, 8.2, 8.4, Box 8.2, 9.3, 9.5, 12.4, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Atlas.5, Atlas.6, Atlas.8, Atlas.9,  Atlas.11, TS.2.5} (Figure SPM.8)      Warming at 1 °C aﬀects all continents and  is generally larger over land than over the  oceans in both observations and models.  Across most regions, observed and  simulated patterns are consistent. Across warming levels, land areas warm more than oceans, and the Arctic  and Antarctica warm more than the tropics.  Panel a) Comparison of observed and simulated annual mean surface temperature change. The left map  shows the observed changes in annual mean surface temperature in the period of 1850–2020 per °C of global  warming (°C). The local (i.e., grid point) observed annual mean surface temperature changes are linearly regressed  against the global surface temperature in the period 1850–2020. Observed temperature data are from Berkeley  Earth, the dataset with the largest coverage and highest horizontal resolution. Linear regression is applied to all  years for which data at the corresponding grid point is available. The regression method was used to take into  account the complete observational time series and thereby reduce the role of internal variability at the grid point  level. White indicates areas where time coverage was 100 years or less and thereby too short to calculate a reliable  linear regression. The right map is based on model simulations and shows change in annual multi-model mean  simulated temperatures at a global warming level of 1°C (20-year mean global surface temperature change relative  to 1850–1900). The triangles at each end of the color bar indicate out-of-bound values, that is, values above or  below the given limits.  Panel b) Simulated annual mean temperature change (°C), panel c) precipitation change (%), and panel d) total column soil moisture change (standard deviation of interannual variability) at global warming levels of 1.5°C, 2°C and 4°C (20-yr mean global surface temperature change relative to 1850–1900). Simulated changes correspond to CMIP6 multi-model mean change (median change for soil moisture) at the corresponding global warming level, i.e. the same method as for the right map in panel a).  c) Annual mean precipitation change (%) relative to 1850-1900  Precipitation is projected to increase over high latitudes, the equatorial  Paciﬁc and parts of the monsoon regions, but decrease over parts of the  subtropics and in limited areas of the tropics.    Relatively small absolute changes may appear as large % changes in  regions with dry baseline conditions d) Annual mean total column soil moisture change (standard deviation)  Across warming levels, changes in soil moisture largely follow changes in  precipitation but also show some diﬀerences due to the inﬂuence of  evapotranspiration.   Relatively small absolute changes  may appear large when expressed in units of standard deviation in dry  regions with little interannual  variability in baseline conditions    In panel c), high positive percentage changes in dry regions may correspond to small absolute changes. In panel  d), the unit is the standard deviation of interannual variability in soil moisture during 1850–1900. Standard  deviation is a widely used metric in characterizing drought severity. A projected reduction in mean soil moisture  by one standard deviation corresponds to soil moisture conditions typical of droughts that occurred about once  every six years during 1850–1900. In panel d), large changes in dry regions with little interannual variability in the  baseline conditions can correspond to small absolute change. The triangles at each end of the color bars indicate  out-of-bound values, that is, values above or below the given limits. Results from all models reaching the  corresponding warming level in any of the five illustrative scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and  SSP5-8.5) are averaged. Maps of annual mean temperature and precipitation changes at a global warming level of  3°C are available in Figure 4.31 and Figure 4.32 in Section 4.6. Corresponding maps of panels b), c) and d) including hatching to indicate the level of model agreement at grid-cell  level are found in Figures 4.31, 4.32 and 11.19, respectively; as highlighted in CC-box Atlas.1, grid-cell level  hatching is not informative for larger spatial scales (e.g., over AR6 reference regions) where the aggregated signals  are less affected by small-scale variability leading to an increase in robustness. {TS.1.3.2, Figure TS.3, Figure TS.5, Figure 1.14, 4.6.1, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1}    Projected changes in the intensity and frequency of hot temperature extremes over  land, extreme precipitation over land, and agricultural and ecological droughts in drying regions.    Projected changes are shown at global warming levels of 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, and 4°C and are relative to 1850- 19009 representing a climate without human influence. The figure depicts frequencies and increases in  intensity of 10- or 50-year extreme events from the base period (1850-1900) under different global warming  levels.  Hot temperature extremes are defined as the daily maximum temperatures over land that were exceeded on  average once in a decade (10-year event) or once in 50 years (50-year event) during the 1850–1900 reference  period. Extreme precipitation events are defined as the daily precipitation amount over land that was  exceeded on average once in a decade during the 1850–1900 reference period. Agricultural and ecological  drought events are defined as the annual average of total column soil moisture below the 10th percentile of  the 1850–1900 base period. These extremes are defined on model grid box scale. For hot temperature  extremes and extreme precipitation, results are shown for the global land. For agricultural and ecological  drought, results are shown for drying regions only, which correspond to the AR6 regions in which there is at  least medium confidence in a projected increase in agricultural/ecological drought at the 2°C warming level  compared to the 1850–1900 base period in CMIP6. These regions include W. North-America, C. North- America, N. Central-America, S. Central-America, Caribbean, N. South-America, N.E. South-America,  South-American-Monsoon, S.W. South-America, S. South-America, West & Central-Europe, Mediterranean,  W. Southern-Africa, E. Southern-Africa, Madagascar, E. Australia, S. Australia (Caribbean is not included in  the calculation of the figure because of the too small number of full land grid cells). The non-drying regions  do not show an overall increase or decrease in drought severity. Projections of changes in agricultural and  ecological droughts in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble differ from those in CMIP6 in some regions,  including in part of Africa and Asia. Assessments on projected changes in meteorological and hydrological  droughts are provided in Chapter 11. {11.6, 11.9}    In the ‘frequency’ section, each year is represented by a dot. The dark dots indicate years in which the  extreme threshold is exceeded, while light dots are years when the threshold is not exceeded. Values  correspond to the medians (in bold) and their respective 5–95% range based on the multi-model ensemble  from simulations of CMIP6 under different SSP scenarios. For consistency, the number of dark dots is based  on the rounded-up median. In the ‘intensity’ section, medians and their 5–95% range, also based on the  multi-model ensemble from simulations of CMIP6, are displayed as dark and light bars, respectively.  Changes in the intensity of hot temperature extremes and extreme precipitations are expressed as degree  Celsius and percentage. As for agricultural and ecological drought, intensity changes are expressed as  fractions of standard deviation of annual soil moisture.      B.3  Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle,  including its variability, global monsoon precipitation and the severity of wet and dry  events.  {4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, Box 8.2, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, Atlas.3} (Figure SPM.5,  Figure SPM.6)    B.3.1  There is strengthened evidence since AR5 that the global water cycle will continue to intensify as global temperatures rise (high confidence), with precipitation and surface water flows projected to become more variable over most land regions within seasons (high confidence) and from year to year (medium confidence). The average annual global land precipitation is projected to increase by 0–5% under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), 1.5-8% for the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) and 1–13% under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) by 2081–2100 relative to 1995-2014 (likely ranges). Precipitation is projected to increase over high latitudes, the equatorial Pacific and parts of the monsoon regions, but decrease over parts of the subtropics and limited areas in the tropics in SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 (very likely). The portion of the global land experiencing detectable increases or decreases in seasonal mean precipitation is projected to increase (medium confidence). There is high confidence in an earlier onset of spring snowmelt, with higher peak flows at the expense of summer flows in snow-dominated regions globally. {4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 8.2, 8.4, Atlas.3, TS.2.6, Box TS.6, TS.4.3} (Figure SPM.5)  B.3.2  A warmer climate will intensify very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons, with implications for flooding or drought (high confidence), but the location and frequency of these events depend on projected changes in regional atmospheric circulation, including monsoons and mid-latitude storm tracks. It is very likely that rainfall variability related to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation is projected to be amplified by the second half of the 21st century in the SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. {4.3, 4.5, 4.6, 8.2, 8.4, 8.5, 11.4, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, TS.2.6, TS.4.2, Box TS.6} (Figure SPM.5, Figure SPM.6)  B.3.3  Monsoon precipitation is projected to increase in the mid- to long term at global scale, particularly over South and Southeast Asia, East Asia and West Africa apart from the far west Sahel (high confidence). The monsoon season is projected to have a delayed onset over North and South America and West Africa (high confidence) and a delayed retreat over West Africa (medium confidence). {4.4, 4.5, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, Box 8.2, Box TS.13}  B.3.4  A projected southward shift and intensification of Southern Hemisphere summer mid-latitude storm tracks and associated precipitation is likely in the long term under high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5), but in the near term the effect of stratospheric ozone recovery counteracts these changes (high confidence). There is medium confidence in a continued poleward shift of storms and their precipitation in the North Pacific, while there is low confidence in projected changes in the North Atlantic storm tracks. {TS.4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 8.4, TS.2.3}  B.4  Under scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, the ocean and land carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.  {4.3, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6} (Figure SPM.7)    B.4.1  While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO2 under higher compared to lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decrease with increasing cumulative CO2 emissions. This is projected to result in a higher proportion of emitted CO2 remaining in the atmosphere (high confidence). {5.2, 5.4, Box TS.5} (Figure SPM.7)   B.4.2  Based on model projections, under the intermediate scenario that stabilizes atmospheric CO2 concentrations this century (SSP2-4.5), the rates of CO2 taken up by the land and oceans are projected to decrease in the second half of the 21st century (high confidence). Under the very low and low GHG emissions scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6), where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, land and oceans begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations (high confidence) and turn into a weak net source by 2100 under SSP1-1.9 (medium confidence). It is very unlikely that the combined global land and ocean sink will turn into a source by 2100 under scenarios without net negative emissions32 (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5). {4.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, Box TS.5, TS.3.3}  B.4.3  The magnitude of feedbacks between climate change and the carbon cycle becomes larger but also more uncertain in high CO2 emissions scenarios (very high confidence). However, climate model projections show that the uncertainties in atmospheric CO2 concentrations by 2100 are dominated by the differences between emissions scenarios (high confidence). Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as CO2 and CH4 fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere (high confidence). {5.4, Box TS.5, TS.3.2}  32 These projected adjustments of carbon sinks to stabilization or decline of atmospheric CO2 are accounted for in calculations of  remaining carbon budgets.    Figure SPM.7:  Cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions taken up by land and ocean sinks by 2100 under   the five illustrative scenarios.   The cumulative anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions taken up by the land and ocean  sinks under the five illustrative scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) are  simulated from 1850 to 2100 by CMIP6 climate models in the concentration-driven simulations. Land and  ocean carbon sinks respond to past, current and future emissions, therefore cumulative sinks from 1850 to 2100  are presented here. During the historical period (1850-2019) the observed land and ocean sink took up 1430  GtCO2 (59% of the emissions).  The bar chart illustrates the projected amount of cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions (GtCO2) between  1850 and 2100 remaining in the atmosphere (grey part) and taken up by the land and ocean (coloured part) in  the year 2100. The doughnut chart illustrates the proportion of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions  taken up by the land and ocean sinks and remaining in the atmosphere in the year 2100. Values in % indicate  the proportion of the cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions taken up by the combined land and ocean sinks  in the year 2100. The overall anthropogenic carbon emissions are calculated by adding the net global land use  emissions from CMIP6 scenario database to the other sectoral emissions calculated from climate model runs  with prescribed CO2 concentrations33. Land and ocean CO2 uptake since 1850 is calculated from the net biome  productivity on land, corrected for CO2 losses due to land-use change by adding the land-use change  emissions, and net ocean CO2 flux.   {Box TS.5, Box TS.5, Figure 1, 5.2.1, Table 5.1, 5.4.5, Figure 5.25}  33 The other sectoral emissions are calculated as the residual of the net land and ocean CO2 uptake and the prescribed atmospheric  CO2 concentration changes in the CMIP6 simulations. These calculated emissions are net emissions and do not separate gross  anthropogenic emissions from removals, which are included implicitly.  B.5  Many changes due to past and future greenhouse gas emissions are irreversible for  centuries to millennia, especially changes in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level.  {Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 2.3, 4.3, 4.5, 4.7, 5.3, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, Box 9.4} (Figure SPM.8)   B.5.1  Past GHG emissions since 1750 have committed the global ocean to future warming (high confidence). Over the rest of the 21st century, likely ocean warming ranges from 2–4 (SSP1-2.6) to 4–8 times (SSP5-8.5) the 1971–2018 change. Based on multiple lines of evidence, upper ocean stratification (virtually certain), ocean acidification (virtually certain) and ocean deoxygenation (high confidence) will continue to increase in the 21st century, at rates dependent on future emissions. Changes are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales in global ocean temperature (very high confidence), deep ocean acidification (very high confidence) and deoxygenation (medium confidence). {4.3, 4.5, 4.7, 5.3, 9.2, TS.2.4} (Figure SPM.8)  B.5.2  Mountain and polar glaciers are committed to continue melting for decades or centuries (very high confidence). Loss of permafrost carbon following permafrost thaw is irreversible at centennial timescales (high confidence). Continued ice loss over the 21st century is virtually certain for the Greenland Ice Sheet and likely for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. There is high confidence that total ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet will increase with cumulative emissions. There is limited evidence for low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes (resulting from ice sheet instability processes characterized by deep uncertainty and in some cases involving tipping points) that would strongly increase ice loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet for centuries under high GHG emissions scenarios34.  {4.3, 4.7, 5.4, 9.4, 9.5, Box 9.4, Box TS.1, TS.2.5}  It is virtually certain that global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century. Relative  B.5.3  to 1995-2014, the likely global mean sea level rise by 2100 is 0.28-0.55 m under the very low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-1.9), 0.32-0.62 m under the low GHG emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6), 0.44-0.76 m under the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5), and 0.63-1.01 m under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5), and by 2150 is 0.37-0.86 m under the very low scenario (SSP1-1.9), 0.46- 0.99 m under the low scenario (SSP1-2.6), 0.66-1.33 m under the intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5), and 0.98-1.88 m under the very high scenario (SSP5-8.5) (medium confidence)35. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and 5 m by 2150 under a very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) (low confidence) – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice sheet processes. {4.3, 9.6, Box 9.4, Box TS.4} (Figure SPM.8)  In the longer term, sea level is committed to rise for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep  B.5.4  ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and will remain elevated for thousands of years (high confidence). Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C, 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C and 19 to 22 m with 5°C of warming, and it will continue to rise over subsequent millennia (low confidence). Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: likely 5–10 m higher than today around 125,000 years ago, when global temperatures were very likely 0.5°C–1.5°C higher than 1850–1900; and very likely 5–25 m higher roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C–4°C higher (medium confidence). {2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2.4, 9.6, Box TS.2, Box TS.4, Box TS.9}  34 Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes are those whose probability of occurrence is low or not well known (as in the context of  deep uncertainty) but whose potential impacts on society and ecosystems could be high. A tipping point is a critical threshold beyond  which a system reorganizes, often abruptly and/or irreversibly. {Cross-Chapter Box 1.3, 1.4, 4.7}   35 To compare to the 1986–2005 baseline period used in AR5 and SROCC, add 0.03 m to the global mean sea level rise estimates. To  compare to the 1900 baseline period used in Figure SPM.8, add 0.16 m.   Human activities aﬀect all the major climate system components, with  some responding over decades and others over centuries  Figure SPM.8:  Selected indicators of global climate change under the five illustrative scenarios used in this   report.   The projections for each of the five scenarios are shown in colour. Shades represent uncertainty ranges – more  detail is provided for each panel below. The black curves represent the historical simulations (panels a, b, c) or the  observations (panel d). Historical values are included in all graphs to provide context for the projected future  changes.    Panel a) Global surface temperature changes in °C relative to 1850–1900. These changes were obtained by  combining CMIP6 model simulations with observational constraints based on past simulated warming, as well as  an updated assessment of equilibrium climate sensitivity (see Box SPM.1). Changes relative to 1850–1900 based  on 20-year averaging periods are calculated by adding 0.85°C (the observed global surface temperature increase  from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated changes relative to 1995–2014. Very likely ranges are shown for  SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.   Panel b) September Arctic sea ice area in 106 km2 based on CMIP6 model simulations. Very likely ranges are  shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0. The Arctic is projected to be practically ice-free near mid-century under mid-  and high GHG emissions scenarios.   Panel c) Global ocean surface pH (a measure of acidity) based on CMIP6 model simulations. Very likely ranges  are shown for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.   Panel d) Global mean sea level change in meters relative to 1900. The historical changes are observed (from tide  gauges before 1992 and altimeters afterwards), and the future changes are assessed consistently with observational  constraints based on emulation of CMIP, ice sheet, and glacier models. Likely ranges are shown for SSP1-2.6 and  SSP3-7.0. Only likely ranges are assessed for sea level changes due to difficulties in estimating the distribution of  deeply uncertain processes. The dashed curve indicates the potential impact of these deeply uncertain processes. It  shows the 83rd percentile of SSP5-8.5 projections that include low-likelihood, high-impact ice sheet processes that  cannot be ruled out; because of low confidence in projections of these processes, this curve does not constitute part  of a likely range. Changes relative to 1900 are calculated by adding 0.158 m (observed global mean sea level rise  from 1900 to 1995–2014) to simulated and observed changes relative to 1995–2014.   Panel e): Global mean sea level change at 2300 in meters relative to 1900. Only SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 are  projected at 2300, as simulations that extend beyond 2100 for the other scenarios are too few for robust results. The  17th–83rd percentile ranges are shaded. The dashed arrow illustrates the 83rd percentile of SSP5-8.5 projections  that include low-likelihood, high-impact ice sheet processes that cannot be ruled out.    Panels b) and c) are based on single simulations from each model, and so include a component of internal  variability. Panels a), d) and e) are based on long-term averages, and hence the contributions from internal  variability are small.    C. Climate Information for Risk Assessment and Regional Adaptation  Physical climate information addresses how the climate system responds to the interplay between human  influence, natural drivers and internal variability. Knowledge of the climate response and the range of  possible outcomes, including low-likelihood, high impact outcomes, informs climate services – the  assessment of climate-related risks and adaptation planning. Physical climate information at global,  regional and local scales is developed from multiple lines of evidence, including observational products,  climate model outputs and tailored diagnostics.   C.1  Natural drivers and internal variability will modulate human-caused changes, especially  at regional scales and in the near term, with little effect on centennial global warming.  These modulations are important to consider in planning for the full range of possible  changes.   C.1.1  The historical global surface temperature record highlights that decadal variability has enhanced and masked underlying human-caused long-term changes, and this variability will continue into the future (very high confidence). For example, internal decadal variability and variations in solar and volcanic drivers partially masked human-caused surface global warming during 1998–2012, with pronounced regional and seasonal signatures (high confidence). Nonetheless, the heating of the climate system continued during this period, as reflected in both the continued warming of the global ocean (very high confidence) and in the continued rise of hot extremes over land (medium confidence). {1.4, 3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 3.1, 4.4, Box 7.2, 9.2, 11.3, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Figure SPM.1)  C.1.2  Projected human caused changes in mean climate and climatic impact-drivers (CIDs)36, including extremes, will be either amplified or attenuated by internal variability37 (high confidence). Near-term cooling at any particular location with respect to present climate could occur and would be consistent with the global surface temperature increase due to human influence (high confidence). {1.4, 4.4, 4.6, 10.4, 11.3, 12.5, Atlas.5, Atlas.10, Atlas.11, TS.4.2}  C.1.3  Internal variability has largely been responsible for the amplification and attenuation of the observed human-caused decadal-to-multi-decadal mean precipitation changes in many land regions (high confidence). At global and regional scales, near-term changes in monsoons will be dominated by the effects of internal variability (medium confidence). In addition to internal variability influence, near-term projected changes in precipitation at global and regional scales are uncertain because of model uncertainty and uncertainty in forcings from natural and anthropogenic aerosols (medium confidence). {1.4, 4.4, 8.3, 8.5, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, Atlas.4, Atlas.8, Atlas.9, Atlas.10, Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.2, Atlas.11, TS.4.2, Box TS.6, Box TS.13}  36 Climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that affect an element of  society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of  each across interacting system elements and regions. CID types include heat and cold, wet and dry, wind, snow and ice, coastal and  open ocean.   37 The main internal variability phenomena include El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal variability and Atlantic Multi- decadal variability through their regional influence.   C.1.4  Based on paleoclimate and historical evidence, it is likely that at least one large explosive volcanic eruption would occur during the 21st century38. Such an eruption would reduce global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years, alter the global monsoon circulation, modify extreme precipitation and change many CIDs (medium confidence). If such an eruption occurs, this would therefore temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change. {4.4, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 2.2, 8.5, TS.2.1}  C.2  With further global warming, every region is projected to increasingly experience  concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers. Changes in several climatic  impact-drivers would be more widespread at 2°C compared to 1.5°C global warming  and even more widespread and/or pronounced for higher warming levels.  C.2.1  All regions39 are projected to experience further increases in hot climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) and decreases in cold CIDs (high confidence). Further decreases are projected in permafrost, snow, glaciers and ice sheets, lake and Arctic sea ice (medium to high confidence)40. These changes would be larger at 2°C global warming or above than at 1.5°C (high confidence). For example, extreme heat thresholds relevant to agriculture and health are projected to be exceeded more frequently at higher global warming levels (high confidence).   C.2.2  At 1.5°C global warming, heavy precipitation and associated flooding are projected to intensify and be more frequent in most regions in Africa and Asia (high confidence), North America (medium to high confidence)40 and Europe (medium confidence). Also, more frequent and/or severe agricultural and ecological droughts are projected in a few regions in all continents except Asia compared to 1850–1900 (medium confidence); increases in meteorological droughts are also projected in a few regions (medium confidence). A small number of regions are projected to experience increases or decreases in mean precipitation (medium confidence). {11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.9, Atlas.4, Atlas.5, Atlas.7, Atlas.8, Atlas.9, Atlas.10, Atlas.11, TS.4.3} (Table SPM.1)  38 Based on 2,500 year reconstructions, eruptions more negative than –1 W m–2 occur on average twice per century.   39 Regions here refer to the AR6 WGI reference regions used in this Report to summarize information in sub-continental and oceanic  regions. Changes are compared to averages over the last 20–40 years unless otherwise specified. {1.4, 12.4, Atlas.1, Interactive  Atlas}.   40 The specific level of confidence or likelihood depends on the region considered. Details can be found in the Technical Summary  and the underlying Report.    C.2.3   At 2°C global warming and above, the level of confidence in and the magnitude of the change in droughts and heavy and mean precipitation increase compared to those at 1.5°C. Heavy precipitation and associated flooding events are projected to become more intense and frequent in the Pacific Islands and across many regions of North America and Europe (medium to high confidence)40. These changes are also seen in some regions in Australasia and Central and South America (medium confidence). Several regions in Africa, South America and Europe are projected to experience an increase in frequency and/or severity of agricultural and ecological droughts with medium to high confidence40; increases are also projected in Australasia, Central and North America, and the Caribbean with medium confidence. A small number of regions in Africa, Australasia, Europe and North America are also projected to be affected by increases in hydrological droughts, and several regions are projected to be affected by increases or decreases in meteorological droughts with more regions displaying an increase (medium confidence). Mean precipitation is projected to increase in all polar, northern European and northern North American regions, most Asian regions and two regions of South America (high confidence). {11.4, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5, Atlas.5, Atlas.7, Atlas.8, Atlas.9, Atlas.11, TS.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.5, Figure SPM.6, Figure SPM.9)  C.2.4  More CIDs across more regions are projected to change at 2°C and above compared to 1.5°C global warming (high confidence). Region-specific changes include intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms (medium confidence), increases in river floods (medium to high confidence)40, reductions in mean precipitation and increases in aridity (medium to high confidence)40, and increases in fire weather (medium to high confidence)40. There is low confidence in most regions in potential future changes in other CIDs, such as hail, ice storms, severe storms, dust storms, heavy snowfall, and landslides. {11.7, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5, Atlas.4, Atlas.6, Atlas.7, Atlas.8, Atlas.10, TS.4.3.1, TS.4.3.2, TS.5, Cross-Chapter Box, 11.1, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} (Table SPM.1, Figure SPM.9)  It is very likely to virtually certain40 that regional mean relative sea level rise will continue  C.2.5  throughout the 21st century, except in a few regions with substantial geologic land uplift rates. Approximately two-thirds of the global coastline has a projected regional relative sea level rise within ±20% of the global mean increase (medium confidence). Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 (high confidence). Relative sea level rise contributes to increases in the frequency and severity of coastal flooding in low-lying areas and to coastal erosion along most sandy coasts (high confidence). {9.6, 12.4, 12.5, Box TS.4, TS.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} (Figure SPM.9)  C.2.6  Cities intensify human-induced warming locally, and further urbanization together with more frequent hot extremes will increase the severity of heatwaves (very high confidence). Urbanization also increases mean and heavy precipitation over and/or downwind of cities (medium confidence) and resulting runoff intensity (high confidence). In coastal cities, the combination of more frequent extreme sea level events (due to sea level rise and storm surge) and extreme rainfall/riverflow events will make flooding more probable (high confidence). {8.2, Box 10.3, 11.3, 12.4, Box TS.14}  C.2.7  Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming (high confidence). In particular, concurrent heatwaves and droughts are likely to become more frequent. Concurrent extremes at multiple locations become more frequent, including in crop- producing areas, at 2°C and above compared to 1.5°C global warming (high confidence). {11.8, Box 11.3, Box 11.4, 12.3, 12.4, TS.4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} (Table SPM.1)  Multiple climatic impact-drivers are projected to change in all regions of the world Climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events, extremes) that aﬀect an element  of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneﬁcial, neutral,  or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions. The CIDs are grouped into seven types, which are  summarized under the icons in the ﬁgure. All regions are projected to experience changes in at least 5 CIDs. Almost all  (96%) are projected to experience changes in at least 10 CIDs and half in at least 15 CIDs. For many CIDs there is wide  geographical variation in where they change and so each region are projected to experience a speciﬁc set of CID changes.  Each bar in the chart represents a speciﬁc geographical set of changes that can be explored in the WGI Interactive Atlas.  Number of land & coastal regions (a) and open-ocean regions (b) where each climatic impact-driver (CID) is projected  to increase or decrease with high conﬁdence (dark shade) or medium conﬁdence (light shade)  The height of the lighter shaded ‘envelope’ behind each bar  represents the maximum number of regions for which each  CID is relevant. The envelope is symmetrical about the x-axis  showing the maximum possible number of relevant regions  for CID increase (upper part) or decrease (lower part).  ASSESSED FUTURE CHANGES Changes refer to a 20–30  year period centred around  2050 and/or consistent  with 2°C global warming  compared to a similar  period within 1960-2014  or 1850-1900.   Figure SPM.9:  Synthesis of the number of AR6 WGI reference regions where climatic impact-drivers are   projected to change.   A total of 35 climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) grouped into seven types are shown: heat and cold, wet and dry, wind,  snow and ice, coastal, open ocean and other. For each CID, the bar in the graph below displays the number of AR6  WGI reference regions where it is projected to change. The colours represent the direction of change and the level  of confidence in the change: purple indicates an increase while brown indicates a decrease; darker and lighter  shades refer to high and medium confidence, respectively. Lighter background colours represent the maximum  number of regions for which each CID is broadly relevant.   Panel a) shows the 30 CIDs relevant to the land and coastal regions while panel b) shows the 5 CIDs relevant to  the open ocean regions. Marine heatwaves and ocean acidity are assessed for coastal ocean regions in panel a) and  for open ocean regions in panel b). Changes refer to a 20–30 year period centred around 2050 and/or consistent  with 2°C global warming compared to a similar period within 1960-2014, except for hydrological drought and  agricultural and ecological drought which is compared to 1850-1900. Definitions of the regions are provided in  Atlas.1 and the Interactive Atlas (see interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch).    {Table TS.5, Figure TS.22, Figure TS.25, 11.9, 12.2, 12.4, Atlas.1} (Table SPM.1)   C.3  Low-likelihood outcomes, such as ice sheet collapse, abrupt ocean circulation changes,  some compound extreme events and warming substantially larger than the assessed very  likely range of future warming cannot be ruled out and are part of risk assessment.  {1.4, Cross-Chapter Box 1.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 8.6, 9.2, Box 9.4, Box  11.2, 11.8, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1} (Table SPM.1)   If global warming exceeds the assessed very likely range for a given GHG emissions scenario,   C.3.1  including low GHG emissions scenarios, global and regional changes in many aspects of the climate system,  such as regional precipitation and other CIDs, would also exceed their assessed very likely ranges (high  confidence). Such low-likelihood high-warming outcomes are associated with potentially very large impacts,  such as through more intense and more frequent heatwaves and heavy precipitation, and high risks for  human and ecological systems particularly for high GHG emissions scenarios. {Cross-Chapter Box 1.3, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, Box 9.4, Box 11.2, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, TS.1.4, Box TS.3, Box  TS.4} (Table SPM.1)  C.3.2  Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes34 could occur at global and regional scales even for global  warming within the very likely range for a given GHG emissions scenario. The probability of low-likelihood,  high impact outcomes increases with higher global warming levels (high confidence). Abrupt responses and  tipping points of the climate system, such as strongly increased Antarctic ice sheet melt and forest dieback,  cannot be ruled out (high confidence). {1.4, 4.3, 4.4, 4.8, 5.4, 8.6, Box 9.4, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, TS.1.4, TS.2.5, Box TS.3, Box TS.4, Box  TS.9} (Table SPM.1)  If global warming increases, some compound extreme events18 with low likelihood in past and   C.3.3  current climate will become more frequent, and there will be a higher likelihood that events with increased  intensities, durations and/or spatial extents unprecedented in the observational record will occur (high  confidence).  C.3.4  The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all emission scenarios. While there is high confidence in the 21st century decline, there is only low confidence in the magnitude of the trend. There is medium confidence that there will not be an abrupt collapse before 2100. If such a collapse were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, weakening of the African and Asian monsoons and strengthening of Southern Hemisphere monsoons, and drying in Europe. {4.3, 8.6, 9.2, TS2.4, Box TS.3}  C.3.5  Unpredictable and rare natural events not related to human influence on climate may lead to low- likelihood, high impact outcomes. For example, a sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades has occurred in the past, causing substantial global and regional climate perturbations over several decades. Such events cannot be ruled out in the future, but due to their inherent unpredictability they are not included in the illustrative set of scenarios referred to in this Report. {2.2, Cross-Chapter Box 4.1, Box TS.3} (Box SPM.1)  D. Limiting Future Climate Change  Since AR5, estimates of remaining carbon budgets have been improved by a new methodology first presented  in SR1.5, updated evidence, and the integration of results from multiple lines of evidence. A comprehensive  range of possible future air pollution controls in scenarios is used to consistently assess the effects of various  assumptions on projections of climate and air pollution. A novel development is the ability to ascertain when  climate responses to emissions reductions would become discernible above natural climate variability,  including internal variability and responses to natural drivers.   D.1  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-induced global warming to a  specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2  emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Strong, rapid  and sustained reductions in CH4 emissions would also limit the warming effect resulting  from declining aerosol pollution and would improve air quality.  {3.3, 4.6, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, Box 5.2, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, 6.7, 7.6, 9.6} (Figure  SPM.10, Table SPM.2)   D.1.1  This Report reaffirms with high confidence the AR5 finding that there is a near-linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions and the global warming they cause. Each 1000 GtCO2 of cumulative CO2 emissions is assessed to likely cause a 0.27°C to 0.63°C increase in global surface temperature with a best estimate of 0.45°C41. This is a narrower range compared to AR5 and SR1.5. This quantity is referred to as the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE). This relationship implies that reaching net zero42 anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a requirement to stabilize human-induced global temperature increase at any level, but that limiting global temperature increase to a specific level would imply limiting cumulative CO2 emissions to within a carbon budget43. {5.4, 5.5, TS.1.3, TS.3.3, Box TS.5} (Figure SPM.10)  41 In the literature, units of °C per 1000 PgC are used, and the AR6 reports the TCRE likely range as 1.0°C to 2.3°C per 1000 PgC in   the underlying report, with a best estimate of 1.65°C.    42 condition in which anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are balanced by anthropogenic CO2 removals over a specified   period.   43 The term carbon budget refers to the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic CO2 emissions that would result in  limiting global warming to a given level with a given probability, taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate  forcers. This is referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining  carbon budget when expressed from a recent specified date (see Glossary). Historical cumulative CO2 emissions determine to a large  degree warming to date, while future emissions cause future additional warming. The remaining carbon budget indicates how much  CO2 could still be emitted while keeping warming below a specific temperature level.   Figure SPM.10:       Near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and the increase in global         surface temperature.   Top panel: Historical data (thin black line) shows observed global surface temperature increase in °C since 1850– 1900 as a function of historical cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in GtCO2 from 1850 to 2019. The grey  range with its central line shows a corresponding estimate of the historical human-caused surface warming (see  Figure SPM.2). Coloured areas show the assessed very likely range of global surface temperature projections, and  thick coloured central lines show the median estimate as a function of cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 until  year 2050 for the set of illustrative scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, see Figure  SPM.4). Projections use the cumulative CO2 emissions of each respective scenario, and the projected global  warming includes the contribution from all anthropogenic forcers. The relationship is illustrated over the domain of  cumulative CO2 emissions for which there is high confidence that the transient climate response to cumulative CO2  emissions (TCRE) remains constant, and for the time period from 1850 to 2050 over which global CO2 emissions  remain net positive under all illustrative scenarios as there is limited evidence supporting the quantitative  application of TCRE to estimate temperature evolution under net negative CO2 emissions. Bottom panel: Historical and projected cumulative CO2 emissions in GtCO2 for the respective scenarios. {Figure TS.18, Figure 5.31, Section 5.5}   D.1.2  Over the period 1850–2019, a total of 2390 ± 240 (likely range) GtCO2 of anthropogenic CO2 was emitted. Remaining carbon budgets have been estimated for several global temperature limits and various levels of probability, based on the estimated value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO2 emissions reach net zero. {5.1, 5.5, Box 5.2, TS.3.3} (Table SPM.2)  Table SPM.2:  Estimates of historical CO2 emissions and remaining carbon budgets. Estimated remaining carbon  budgets are calculated from the beginning of 2020 and extend until global net zero CO2 emissions are  reached. They refer to CO2 emissions, while accounting for the global warming effect of non-CO2  emissions. Global warming in this table refers to human-induced global surface temperature increase,  which excludes the impact of natural variability on global temperatures in individual years. {Table  TS.3, Table 3.1, Table 5.1, Table 5.7, Table 5.8, 5.5.1, 5.5.2, Box 5.2}     D.1.3  Several factors that determine estimates of the remaining carbon budget have been re-assessed, and updates to these factors since SR1.5 are small. When adjusted for emissions since previous reports, estimates of remaining carbon budgets are therefore of similar magnitude compared to SR1.5 but larger compared to AR5 due to methodological improvements44. {5.5, Box 5.2, TS.3.3} (Table SPM.2)  D.1.4  Anthropogenic CO2 removal (CDR) has the potential to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and durably store it in reservoirs (high confidence). CDR aims to compensate for residual emissions to reach net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions or, if implemented at a scale where anthropogenic removals exceed anthropogenic emissions, to lower surface temperature. CDR methods can have potentially wide-ranging effects on biogeochemical cycles and climate, which can either weaken or strengthen the potential of these methods to remove CO2 and reduce warming, and can also influence water availability and quality, food production and biodiversity45 (high confidence). {5.6, Cross-Chapter Box 5.1, TS.3.3}  D.1.5  Anthropogenic CO2 removal (CDR) leading to global net negative emissions would lower the atmospheric CO2 concentration and reverse surface ocean acidification (high confidence). Anthropogenic CO2 removals and emissions are partially compensated by CO2 release and uptake respectively, from or to land and ocean carbon pools (very high confidence). CDR would lower atmospheric CO2 by an amount approximately equal to the increase from an anthropogenic emission of the same magnitude (high confidence). The atmospheric CO2 decrease from anthropogenic CO2 removals could be up to 10% less than the atmospheric CO2 increase from an equal amount of CO2 emissions, depending on the total amount of CDR (medium confidence). {5.3, 5.6, TS.3.3}  D.1.6  If global net negative CO2 emissions were to be achieved and be sustained, the global CO2-induced surface temperature increase would be gradually reversed but other climate changes would continue in their current direction for decades to millennia (high confidence). For instance, it would take several centuries to millennia for global mean sea level to reverse course even under large net negative CO2 emissions (high confidence). {4.6, 9.6, TS.3.3}  In the five illustrative scenarios, simultaneous changes in CH4, aerosol and ozone precursor  D.1.7  emissions, that also contribute to air pollution, lead to a net global surface warming in the near and long-term (high confidence). In the long term, this net warming is lower in scenarios assuming air pollution controls combined with strong and sustained CH4 emission reductions (high confidence). In the low and very low GHG emissions scenarios, assumed reductions in anthropogenic aerosol emissions lead to a net warming, while reductions in CH4 and other ozone precursor emissions lead to a net cooling. Because of the short lifetime of both CH4 and aerosols, these climate effects partially counterbalance each other and reductions in CH4 emissions also contribute to improved air quality by reducing global surface ozone (high confidence). {6.7, Box TS.7} (Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1)  44 Compared to AR5, and when taking into account emissions since AR5, estimates in AR6 are about 300–350 GtCO2 larger for the  remaining carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C; for 2°C, the difference is about 400–500 GtCO2.    45 Potential negative and positive effects of CDR for biodiversity, water and food production are methods-specific, and are often  highly dependent on local context, management, prior land use, and scale. IPCC Working Groups II and III assess the CDR potential,  and ecological and socio-economic effects of CDR methods in their AR6 contributions.   D.1.8  Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions is a requirement for stabilizing CO2-induced global surface  temperature increase, with anthropogenic CO2 emissions balanced by anthropogenic removals of CO2. This  is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG removals. For a given GHG emission pathway, the pathways of  individual greenhouse gases determine the resulting climate response46, whereas the choice of emissions  metric47 used to calculate aggregated emissions and removals of different GHGs affects what point in time  the aggregated greenhouse gases are calculated to be net zero.  Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net  zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential are projected to result in a decline in  surface temperature after an earlier peak (high confidence).  {4.6, 7.6, Box 7.3, TS.3.3}      D.2  Scenarios with very low or low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) lead within   years to discernible effects on greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations, and air  quality, relative to high and very high GHG emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5).  Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible differences in trends of global surface  temperature would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years,  and over longer time periods for many other climatic impact-drivers (high confidence).  {4.6, Cross-Chapter Box 6.1, 6.6, 6.7, 9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 11.2, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6,  12.4, 12.5} (Figure SPM.8, Figure SPM.10)     D.2.1  Emissions reductions in 2020 associated with measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 led to  temporary but detectible effects on air pollution (high confidence), and an associated small, temporary  increase in total radiative forcing, primarily due to reductions in cooling caused by aerosols arising from  human activities (medium confidence). Global and regional climate responses to this temporary forcing are,  however, undetectable above natural variability (high confidence). Atmospheric CO2 concentrations  continued to rise in 2020, with no detectable decrease in the observed CO2 growth rate (medium  confidence)48.  {Cross-Chapter Box 6.1, TS.3.3}     D.2.2  Reductions in GHG emissions also lead to air quality improvements. However, in the near term49,  even in scenarios with strong reduction of GHGs, as in the low and very low GHG emission scenarios  (SSP1-2.6 and SSP1-1.9), these improvements are not sufficient in many polluted regions to achieve air  quality guidelines specified by the World Health Organization (high confidence). Scenarios with targeted  reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years compared  to reductions in GHG emissions only, but from 2040, further improvements are projected in scenarios that  combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions with the magnitude of the benefit varying  between regions (high confidence). {6.6, 6.7, Box TS.7}.         46 A general term for how the climate system responds to a radiative forcing (see Glossary).  47 The choice of emissions metric depends on the purposes for which gases or forcing agents are being compared. This report  contains updated emission metric values and assesses new approaches to aggregating gases.  48 For other GHGs, there was insufficient literature available at the time of the assessment to assess detectable changes in their  atmospheric growth rate during 2020.  49 Near term: (2021–2040)     D.2.3  Scenarios with very low or low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) would have rapid and  sustained effects to limit human-caused climate change, compared with scenarios with high or very high  GHG emissions (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5), but early responses of the climate system can be masked by natural  variability. For global surface temperature, differences in 20-year trends would likely emerge during the near  term under a very low GHG emission scenario (SSP1-1.9), relative to a high or very high GHG emission  scenario (SSP3-7.0 or SSP5-8.5). The response of many other climate variables would emerge from natural  variability at different times later in the 21st century (high confidence).  {4.6, Cross-Section Box TS.1} (Figure SPM.8, Figure SPM.10)    D.2.4  Scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions (SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6) would lead to  substantially smaller changes in a range of CIDs36 beyond 2040 than under high and very high GHG  emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5). By the end of the century, scenarios with very low and  low GHG emissions would strongly limit the change of several CIDs, such as the increase in the frequency  of extreme sea level events, heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding, and exceedance of dangerous heat  thresholds, while limiting the number of regions where such exceedances occur, relative to higher GHG  emissions scenarios (high confidence). Changes would also be smaller in very low compared to low  emissions scenarios, as well as for intermediate (SSP2-4.5) compared to high or very high emissions  scenarios (high confidence). {9.6, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.6, 11.9, 12.4, 12.5,  TS.4.3}      "

A multi-organization high-level compilation of the latest climate science information


This is a critical year for climate action. This report by the United Nations and global scientific partner organizations provides a holistic assessment of the most recent climate science. The result is an alarming appraisal of just how far off course we are.
We are still significantly off-schedule to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. This year has seen fossil fuel emissions bounce back, greenhouse gas concentrations continuing to rise and severe human-enhanced weather events that have affected health, lives and livelihoods on every continent. Unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to 1.5∞C will be impossible, with catastrophic consequences for people and the planet on which we depend.
This report is clear. Time is running out. For the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, known as COP26, to be a turning point, we need all countries to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, backed up by concrete long-term strategies, and enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)

which collectively cut global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, compared to 2010 levels.
We need a breakthrough on protecting people and their livelihoods, with at least half of all public climate finance committed to building resilience and helping people adapt. And we need much greater solidarity, including full delivery of the longstanding climate finance pledge to help developing countries take climate action. There is no alternative if we are to achieve a safer, more sustainable and prosperous future for all.

Throughout the pandemic we have heard that we must ""build back better"" to set humanity on a more sustainable path, and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change on society and economies. This report shows that so far in 2021, we are not going in the right direction.
Greenhouse gas concentrations ≠ which are already at their highest levels in three million years ≠ have continued to rise, reaching new record highs this year. Fossil fuel emissions in many sectors are back at the same or at even higher levels than before the pandemic. Global temperatures in 2017≠2021 are among the warmest of any equivalent period since meteorological measurements, with warming evident in many climate indicators such as sea ice, glacier melt and sea-level rise.

I would like to thank the many expert teams involved in creating this report ≠ most notably from Global Carbon Project, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, World Health Organization, UN Environment, the World Climate Research Programme, and the Met Office (UK) ≠ for their collaboration, uniting the climate science community to deliver the latest essential information, in these unprecedented times.

United in Science 2021 delivers on its mission, to present the very latest scientific data and findings related to climate change, to inform policy and decision-makers. This work depends on a global network of scientists and institutions, and on the critical underpinning observation, modelling and research infrastructure, which we must be supported to meet the demands of today's challenges.

∑ The drop in CO2 emissions is temporary, and
based on preliminary estimates, from January≠July 2021 global emissions in the power and industry sectors were already at the same level or higher than in the same period in 2019. Emissions from road transport remained about 5% lower.
∑ Recent emissions trends of N2O, the third most important greenhouse gas after CO2 and CH4, exceed the most greenhouse
gases intense socioeconomic pathways used to explore future climate change.
Global Climate in WMO
∑ The global average mean surface temperature for the period from 2017≠2021 is among the warmest on record, estimated
at 1.06 ∞C to 1.26 ∞C above pre-industrial (1850≠1900) levels.
∑ In every year from 2017 to 2021, the Arctic average summer minimum and average winter maximum sea-ice extent were

identified in the extraordinary North American extreme heat and west European floods.

Key Points
Highlights of AR6: The Physical Science Basis  IPCC
∑ It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the
atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.
∑ The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate
system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.
∑ Human-induced climate change is already increasing the frequency and intensity of many weather and climate extremes in
every region across the globe.
Heatwaves, Wildfires, and Air Pollution: Compounding and Cascading Climate Hazards to Health  WHO/WMO
∑ Rising temperatures are linked to increased heat-related mortality and work impairment, with an excess of 103 billion
potential work hours lost globally in 2019 compared with those lost in 2000.
∑ COVID-19 infections and climate hazards such as heatwaves, wildfires and poor air quality combine to threaten human
health worldwide, putting vulnerable populations at particular risk.
∑ COVID-19 recovery efforts should be aligned with national climate change and air quality strategies to reduce risks from
compounding and cascading climate hazards, and gain health co-benefits.
Sea-level Rise and Coastal Impacts  WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC)
∑ Global mean sea levels rose 20 cm from 1900 to 2018 and at an accelerated rate of 3.7+0.5 mm/yr from 2006 to 2018. ∑ Even if emissions are reduced to limit warming to well below 2 ∞C, global mean sea level would likely rise 0.3≠0.6 m by
2100 and could rise by 0.3≠3.1 m by 2300 (relative to 1995-2014).
∑ If greenhouse emission continue to rise unabated global mean sea level will likely rise 0.6≠1.0 by 2100 (relative to 1995-
2014) and, with less confidence, range from 1.7≠6.8 m (perhaps more) by 2300 with further large rises continuing beyond.
∑ Even with climate stabilization, adaptation to this residual rise will be essential ≠ adaptation strategies are needed where
they do not exist ≠ especially in low-lying coasts, small islands, deltas and coastal cities.
Global Climate in WMO Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update  Met Office/WMO/WCRP
∑ Annual global mean near-surface temperature is likely to be at least 1 ∞C warmer than pre-industrial levels (defined as the
1850≠1900 average) in each of the coming five years and is very likely to be within the range 0.9 ∞C to 1.8 ∞C.
∑ There is a 40% chance that average global temperature in one of the next five years will be at least 1.5 ∞C warmer than
pre-industrial levels but it is very unlikely (~10%) that the 5-year mean temperature for 2021≠2025 will be 1.5 ∞C warmer than pre-industrial levels.
∑ Over 2021≠2025, high latitude regions and the Sahel are likely to be wetter than the recent past.
Emissions Gap  UNEP
∑ Five years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the emissions gap is as large as ever: global emissions need to be 15
GtCO2e lower than current unconditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) imply for a 2 ∞C goal, and 32 GtCO2e lower for the 1.5 ∞C goal.
∑ The COVID-19 crisis offers only a short-term reduction in global emissions. It will not significantly reduce emissions by 2030
unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization.
∑ The increasing number of countries committing to net-zero emission goals is encouraging, with about 63% of global
emissions now covered by such goals. However, to remain feasible and credible, these goals urgently need to be reflected in near-term policy and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030.

Greenhouse Gas Concentrations in the Atmosphere  WMO Global Atmosphere Watch
Levels of Greenhouse Gases in the Atmosphere
Levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) continue to rise. Preliminary analysis of the data ≠ from a subset of the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) greenhouse gas (GHG) observational network ≠ demonstrated that CO2 concentrations1 in the Northern Hemisphere exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm) for most of 2020 and exceeded 415 ppm in the first half of 2021.
A full analysis of the three main GHGs (Figure 1) shows the globally averaged atmospheric concentrations of CO2 at 410.5 ± 0.2 ppm, CH4 at 1877 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and N2O at 332.0 ± 0.1 ppb for 2019 (respectively 148%, 260% and 123% of pre-industrial levels in 1750). The annual increases of CO2 and CH4 were larger in 2019 than the 10-year averaged rate of increase, while the N2O annual increase was slightly less than the 10-year average growth rate (WMO, 2020).

Figure 1. (upper row) Globally averaged CO2, CH4 and N2O mole fraction in ppm (CO2) and ppb (CH4; N2O, respectively) and its growth rates (bottom row) from 1984 to 2019. Increases in successive annual means are shown as the shaded columns in the bottom row. The red line in the upper row is the monthly mean with the seasonal
variation removed; the blue dots and line depict the monthly averages

Final global average concentration data figures for 2020 will not be available until the second half of 2021, but data from all global locations, including flagship observatories, indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to increase in 2020 and 2021 (Figures 2 and 3). In July 2021, CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa (Hawaii, US) and Cape Grim (Tasmania, Australia) reached 416.96 ppm and 412.1 ppm, respectively, in comparison with 414.62 ppm, and 410.03 ppm in July 2020.

Figure 2. Monthly mean CO2 mole fraction in ppm at Mauna Loa observatory from March 1958 to July 2021. The dashed red line represents the monthly mean values, centred on the middle of each month. The black line represents the same, but here the average seasonal cycle has been removed by a statistical treatment. 1In this section, the physical quantity related to the amount of gases in the atmosphere (dry mole fraction) is referred to as ""concentration""


The decline of CO2 emissions due to the COVID-19 crisis (-5.6%, see section ""Global Emissions and Budgets ≠ GCP"") would result in a final change of the annual growth rate of less than 0.2 ppm ≠ well within the 1 ppm ≠ driven by the uptake of the biosphere. This difference can be detected by the GAW network, which has a precision goal that is better than 0.1 ppm, but its detection will require longer than one year of measurements.

The WMO Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System IG3IS () uses atmospheric observation and analysis tools to improve knowledge of greenhouse gas sources and sinks at national and smaller scales. To achieve its objectives, WMO IG3IS is developing good-practice guidelines for producing observation-based emissions estimates for nations, as well as guidelines for estimating emissions from cities and states, and works toward broadening the use of this methodology.

Methane monitoring in support of the temperature target of the Paris Agreement
Methane accounts for about 16% of radiative forcing by long-lived greenhouse gases, making CH4 the second most important anthropogenic GHG. Approximately 40% of methane is emitted into the atmosphere by natural sources, for example, wetlands and termites, and about 60% comes from anthropogenic sources such as ruminants, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfills and biomass burning (Saunois et al., 2020). CH4 emissions also indirectly affect human health and agricultural productivity through the production of tropospheric ozone (UNEP, 2021). To limit global warming, strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in CO2, CH4, and other greenhouse gases are necessary (IPCC, 2021).
The global CH4 increase of 8 ppb in 2019 (WMO, 2020) continues the trend of the past decade, which experienced increases of 5≠10 ppb per year (ppb/yr). Preliminary analysis from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) network demonstrates an increase of CH4 concentration in 2020 of 15 ppb, which is the largest increase within the 37-year (from 1984 to 2020) record ().
Observations of CH4 stable isotopes are used to identify sources of atmospheric CH4 (Nisbet et al., 2016). The observed trend in 13CCH4 is explained by a combined increase in microbial (both natural and anthropogenic) and fossil emissions (WMO, 2020).


Addressing CH4 emissions starts with finding, identifying and quantifying emissions (Nisbet et al., 2020). Satellite data play an important role in locating previously unknown large CH4 emission sources (hotspots), for example, from gas and oil production sites. The satellite TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides CH4 column concentrations with high sensitivity at the Earth's surface, a good spatiotemporal coverage and sufficient accuracy to facilitate inverse modelling of sources and sinks. Data from TROPOMI were used to identify emission hotspots (Figure 4) and can guide action to address methane super-emitters.

Figure 4. This image shows a sample of abnormal methane concentrations over 2019 as measured by Sentinel5P. The size and colour of the circles indicate the size and intensity of the plume detected. The redder the colour, the higher the concentration of the methane plume. This image contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2019), processed by Kayrros.

Substantial methodological development is still needed to improve satellitederived emission estimates, for which accurate measurements on the ground are indispensable. However, with the current capabilities, an important new contribution to regional emission monitoring can already be made. The combination of Sentinel-5P and Sentinel2 Methane measurements show promising results in deriving emission rates (see Figure 5).
Figure 5: Methane emission hotspots over a gas pipeline in Kazakhstan detected by Sentinel-5P (left) and Sentinel2 (right) missions. This image contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2019), processed by Kayrros
Several studies have pointed to the short-term climate benefits and cost-effectiveness of mitigating CH4 emissions, which are well described in the UNEP methane assessment of 2021. There is a strong call to upscale action on CH4 emissions and there are indicative plans for an International Decade for Methane Management to be proposed at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Global CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and land use change in 2019 reached a new high of 43 Gigatonnes of CO2 (Gt, billion metric tonnes), 56% above the level when international climate negotiations started early in the 1990s. Fossil CO2 emissions (coal, oil, gas and cement), which account for about 85% of all CO2 emissions (2010≠2019), peaked at 36.6 GtCO2 in 2019, followed by an extraordinary drop of 1.9 GtCO2 (5.6%) in 2020 (updated from Friedlingstein et al., 2020, Figure 1). The drop in emissions was mainly due to the slowdown of the global economy and lower energy demands during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during the first wave of confinements. The transport sector, particularly road transport, contributed the most to the decline. Although aviation dropped by 75% at the peak of the lockdown in spring 2020, its contribution was smaller given that the sector only accounts for about 2.8% of the total mean annual global emissions (Le QuÈrÈ et al., 2020).

Figure 1. Global fossil CO2 emissions which include coal, oil, gas and cement production. Data updated from Friedlingstein et al. (2020)

The emissions drop in 2020 was almost four times the size of the one during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 (1.5%, compared to the previous year), and was the largest annual drop ever recorded in absolute values (1.9 Gt CO2, Figure 2). Although there is uncertainty about the global post-pandemic recovery, the drop is temporary and initial estimates for 2021 show a strong recovery in emissions with a possible return to pre-COVID levels within a year or two (Figure 3).

Based on preliminary estimates, global emissions in the power and industry sectors were already at the same level or higher in January-July 2021 than in the same period in 2019, before the pandemic, while emissions from road transport remained about 5% lower. Excluding aviation and sea transport, global emissions were at about the same levels as in 2019, averaged across those 7 months.

Figure 2. Annual changes in global fossil CO2 emissions. Data updated from Friedlingstein et al. (2020)

Despite the expected high growth rates in 2021, the medium-term outlook is for slower emissions growth than seen earlier in this century. In fact, slowing growth rates already began before the pandemic, with an average of 1% per year during the last decade, down from 3% in the previous decade (2000≠2009). The emissions growth in 2019, just before the pandemic, was near zero. There is no certainty as to when peak CO2 emission will be reached, given that 150 countries had increasing fossil CO2 emissions during the five years prior to the pandemic, but progress is occurring, with 64 countries recording declining emissions (Le QuÈrÈ et al., 2021).

Figure 3. Changes in fossil fuel CO2 emissions for the world and a selected group of countries for January-May in 2020 and 2021 compared with the same
period in 2019 (Carbon Monitor).

Additional 6.6 ± 2.5 Gt CO2 were added to the atmosphere in 2019 from the net impact of land-use change ≠ that is, deforestation, degradation, reforestation. These emissions are above the average from the past decade (2010≠2019) of 5.8 Gt CO2 due to large land-clearing fires in the Amazon and Indonesia (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). For the first time in the global carbon budget, we provide
estimates for the contributing gross fluxes that make up net land-use change emissions and show that gross emissions, such as land
clearing, shifting cultivation and peat draining, are about 2≠3 times larger (16 ± 2.6 Gt CO2) than the net flux (average for 2010≠2019). However, the trends for land use emissions in the last decade are inconsistent between estimates because of divergent estimates
of forest loss areas. These emissions are only partially offset by anthropogenic sinks such as reforestation and vegetation regrowth
after crop abandonment.

Global GHG Emissions and Budgets  Global Carbon Project (GCP)
The land and oceans sinks removed almost half of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, with oceans sinks remaining close to the decadal average (2000≠2009) in 2019 and 2020. Land sinks were slightly below their average, reflecting several climate anomalies such as wildfires in Australia and elsewhere.

Figure 4. Attribution of changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (parts per million, ppm) to main sources of fossil fuels and cement production. Data from Friedlingstein et al. (2020). Note that atmospheric concentrations are estimated from the NOAA/ESRL network and therefore are not exactly the same as the ones based
on the WMO global network; this choice is determined by data availability at the time of submission of the Global Carbon Budget for publication.

The importance of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions

Nitrous oxide (N2O) is the third most important greenhouse gas contributing to human induced warming, after CO2 and methane (CH4). Its third place often results in its receiving less attention, although N2O is 298 times more effective at trapping heat per unit mass than CO2 (on a 100-y time scale). Once emitted, N2O remains in the atmosphere for 116 ± 9 years, a shorter lifetime than CO2 but much longer than CH4.

Figure 5. Mean global N2O budget for all major anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks for the decade 2007≠2016 (redrawn from Tian et al., 2020).

Global GHG Emissions and Budgets  Global Carbon Project (GCP)
Recent trends in N2O emissions exceed the illustrative socioeconomic pathways used by the global climate community, and show a rapidly departing trajectory from scenarios that are consistent with the Paris Agreement targets (Figure 6). Despite this growth, some regions (for example, Europe) have stable emissions, often resulting from reductions in industrial emissions (through emission abatement technologies) and increased nitrogen use efficiency in agriculture (Thompson et al., 2019). These technological and efficiency improvements are important also in offsetting a growth in N2O emissions from increases in, for example, agricultural activity in some regions, such as North America.

This section provides a summary on the state of change of two important climate indicators (Trewin et al., 2021) ≠ temperature and sea ice ≠ in the five-year period from 2017≠2021. The global average mean surface temperature for 2017≠2021 (2021 data are based on averages for January to May or June, depending on the data set) is among the warmest of any equivalent period on record (Figure 1). It is estimated to be 1.06 ∞C to 1.26 ∞C above pre-industrial (1850≠1900) levels, depending on the data set used.


The 2017≠2021 average global temperature dropped slightly from the record high for 2016≠2020. This is mainly due to the El NiÒo conditions in 2016 which boosted global temperatures (WMO, 2016) and the La NiÒa conditions in early 2021 that contributed to a slight drop of the global annual temperatures. The 2017≠2021 five-year average temperature is likely to be the highest on record for large areas of North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia, eastern parts of the US, parts of Central America, and areas of South America. Only a few land areas were close to or slightly cooler than the 1981≠2010 average, most notably an area of North America (Figure 2).

Figure 2. 2017-2021 five-year average temperature anomalies relative to the 1981-2010 average. Data is from NASA GISTEMP v4. Date updated to July Arctic sea ice has seen a long-term decline every month since the beginning of the satellite era (1979≠present), with the largest relative losses in late summer, around the time of the annual minimum in September (Figure 3), albeit with regional variations. For the 2016≠2020 period, the average arctic sea-ice extent in September was 28% below the 1981≠2010 average while the average March maximum was around 6% below the 1981≠2010 average.
In every year from 2017 to 2021, the Arctic average summer minimum and average winter maximum sea-ice extent were below the 1981≠2010 long term average. In September 2020, the Arctic sea-ice extent reached its second lowest minimum on record.
There has also been a marked decline in the fraction of older, usually thicker, ice. At the time of the March maximum, the fraction of ice older than one year has declined from around 60% in 1985 to around 27% in 2021.1 The fraction of ice older than four years has declined from 30% in 1985 to less than 5% in 2021.
Antarctic sea-ice extent increased slowly from the start of the satellite era to around 2015. However, in the three years following 2015, ice extent dropped rapidly (Figure 3). The drop was associated with ocean warming, combined with incursions of warm air during the spring and an unusual weakening of the mid-latitude westerly winds.2 Since then, ice extent has returned close to the long-term average.


An exceptional and dangerous heatwave devastated the US northwest and Western Canada in June /July
The all-time Canadian heat record was broken when Lytton, British Columbia, recorded a high of 49.6 ∞C on 29 June 2021. Using published peer-reviewed methods (van Oldenborgh et al., 2021), the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative investigated the role of human-induced climate change in the likelihood and intensity of this extreme heatwave. The occurrence of a heatwave with the high maximum daily temperatures observed in the area 45≠52 ∫N, 119≠123 ∫W, was virtually impossible without human-caused climate change (World Weather Attribution; Philip et al., 2021). The temperatures were so extreme that they were far beyond the range of historically observed temperatures. This makes it hard to quantify with confidence how rare the event was. In the most realistic statistical analysis, the event is estimated to be a 1 in 1000 year event in today's climate. An event such as the Pacific Northwest 2021 heatwave is still rare or extremely rare in today's climate, yet would be virtually impossible without human-caused climate change. As warming continues, it will become a lot less rare (Philip et al., 2021).human-caused climate change. As warming continues, it will become a lot less rare (Philip et al., 2021).

Severe Flooding Event in Germany and neighbouring countries

Very pronounced heavy rainfall occurred in Germany and neighbouring countries in connection with the low-pressure system ""Bernd"", especially in the period from 12≠15 July 2021. This led to severe flooding, particularly in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. The flooding resulted in a high number of fatalities (186 deaths and 26 missing) and considerable infrastructure damage ≠ estimated around  5 billion (US$ 5.9 billion) by insurers. The flooding was triggered by long-lasting heavy precipitation that fell on already saturated ground and, in many parts, rocky underground. Wide areas experienced 100 litre (l) /m2 within 12 to 72 hours, some areas even 150 l/m2 within 12 to 24 hours (Figure 4). In the current climate, for a given location within the larger area north of the Alps to the Netherlands on average it is expected one such event every 400 years (Kreienkamp et al., 2021).
The World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative analyzed how human-induced climate change affected maximum 1-day and 2-day rainfall events in the summer season (April≠September) in two small regions where recent flooding has been most severe (Ahr-Erft region, Germany; and the Meuse, Belgium) as well as anywhere over a larger region including Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands (Kreienkamp et al., 2021).

Figure 4. Maximum return period (years) of rainfall with durations between 1 and 72 hours from 12.07.2021 05:50 UTC to 19.07.21 05:50 UTC based on an hourly precipitation sum from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD, Germany's National Meteorological Service) radar network adjusted to rain gauge observations.


All available evidence taken into consideration, including physical understanding, meteorological observations as well as different regional climate models, give high confidence that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood and intensity of such an event to occur and these changes will continue in a rapidly warming climate (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). Under future climate change, such events will occur more frequently.
Weather, climate and water in 50-year disaster data
The recent WMO Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes (WMO-No. 1267) shows that of the 22 326 disasters recorded worldwide from 1970 to 2019 over 11 000 were attributed to weather, climate and water-related hazards. Those disasters resulted in 2.06 million deaths and US$ 3.64 trillion in losses. Some 44% of the disasters were associated with floods (riverine floods 24%, general floods 14%) and 17% with tropical cyclones (Figure 5). Tropical cyclones and droughts were the most prevalent hazards with respect to human losses, accounting for 38% and 34% of disaster related deaths respectively. In terms of economic losses, 38% were associated with tropical cyclones, while different types of floods account for 31%, riverine floods (20%), general floods (8%) and flash floods (3%) (WMO, 2021).

Figure 5. Distribution of number of disasters globally covering the period 1970≠2019 (WMO, 2021)
Although the number of recorded disasters rose by a factor of five over the period the number of deaths decreased almost threefold. This is due, in part, to better multi-hazard early warning systems, which are improving prevention, preparedness and response.

It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.
Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by human activities. Their concentrations have continued to increase in the atmosphere. Land and ocean have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences. Human-caused radiative forcing of 2.72 [1.96≠3.48] W m≠2 in 2019 relative to 1750 has warmed the climate system. This warming is mainly due to increased GHG concentrations, partly reduced by cooling due to increased aerosol concentrations. The radiative forcing has increased by 0.43 W m≠2 (19%) relative to the previous IPCC report (AR5, published in 2013), of which 0.34 W m≠2 is due to the increase in GHG concentrations since 2011. The remainder is due to improved scientific understanding and changes in the assessment of aerosol forcing, which include decreases in concentration and improvement in its calculation. Each of the last four decades has been successively warmer than any decade that preceded it since 1850. Global surface temperature in the first two decades of the twenty-first century (2001≠2020) was 0.99 [0.84≠1.10] ∞C higher than 1850≠1900. Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95≠1.20] ∞C higher in 2011≠2020 than 1850≠1900, with larger increases over land (1.59 [1.34≠1.83] ∞C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68≠1.01] ∞C). For the period when attribution studies are available, the observed warming from 1850≠1900 to 2010≠2019 is 1.06 [0.88≠1.21] ∞C, and the best estimate of total human-caused warming is 1.07 ∞C, with a likely range of 0.8≠1.3 ∞C. It is likely that well-mixed GHGs contributed a warming of 1.0≠2.0 ∞C, other human drivers (principally aerosols) contributed a cooling of 0.0≠0.8 ∞C, natural drivers changed global surface temperature by -0.1≠0.1 ∞C, and internal variability changed it by -0.2≠0.2 ∞C (Figure 1).

Details of observed changes in other parts of the climate system, such as the land, oceans, cryosphere and biosphere, and their attribution to human influence, can be found in the Summary for Policy Makers and the Technical Summary (IPCC, 2021).
The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years.
In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than at any time in at least 2 million years and concentrations of CH4 and N2O were higher than at any time in at least 800 000 years. Global surface temperature has increased faster since 1970 than in any other 50-year period over at least the last 2000 years (Figure 2). Temperatures during the most recent decade (2011≠2020) exceed those of the most recent multi-century warm period, around 6500 years ago [0.2≠1 ∞C relative to 1850≠1900]. Prior to that, the next most recent warm period was about 125 000 years ago when the multi-century temperature [0.5 ∞C≠1.5 ∞C relative to 1850≠1900] overlaps the observations of the most recent decade.

Panel a): Changes in global surface temperature reconstructed from paleoclimate archives (solid grey line, 1≠2000) and from direct observations (solid black line, 1850≠2020), both relative to 1850≠1900 and decadally averaged. The vertical bar on the left shows the estimated temperature (very likely range) during the warmest multi-century period in at least the last 100 000 years, which occurred around 6 500 years ago during the current interglacial period (Holocene). The Last Interglacial, around 125 000 years ago, is the next most recent candidate for a period of higher temperature. These past warm periods were caused by slow (multi-millennial) orbital variations. The grey shading with white diagonal lines shows the very likely ranges for the temperature reconstructions. Panel b): Changes in global surface temperature over the past 170 years (black line) relative to 1850≠1900 and annually averaged, compared to CMIP6 climate model simulations
In 2011≠2020, late summer Arctic sea-ice area was smaller than at any time in at least the past 1000 years). The global nature of glacier retreat, with almost all of the world's glaciers retreating synchronously, since the 1950s is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. Global mean sea level has risen faster since 1900 than over any preceding century in at least the last 3000 years. The global ocean has warmed faster over the past century than since the end of the last deglacial transition (around 11 000 years ago).

Highlights of IPCC Climate Change 2021, The Physical Science Basis for the current state of climate
Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region around the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes ≠ such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones ≠ and, in particular, their attribution to human influence has strengthened since the publication of the previous IPCC report (AR5) in 2013.
It is virtually certain that hot extremes (including heatwaves) have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes (including cold waves) have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-induced climate change is the main driver of these changes. Some recent hot extremes observed over the past decade would have been extremely unlikely to occur without human influence on the climate system. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s, and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006.
The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land area for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis, and human-induced climate change is likely the main driver. Humaninduced climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration.
Decreases in global land monsoon precipitation from the 1950s to the 1980s are partly attributed to human-caused Northern Hemisphere aerosol emissions but increases since then have resulted from rising GHG concentrations and decadal to multi-decadal internal variability. Over South Asia, East Asia and West Africa increases in monsoon precipitation due to warming from GHG emissions were counteracted by decreases in monsoon precipitation due to cooling from humancaused aerosol emissions over the twentieth century. Increases in West African monsoon precipitation since the 1980s are partly due to the growing influence of GHGs and reductions in the cooling effect of human-caused aerosol emissions over Europe and North America.
It is likely that the global proportion of major (Category 3≠5) tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades, and the latitude where tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific reach their peak intensity has shifted northward; these changes cannot be explained by internal variability alone. There is low confidence in long-term (multidecadal to centennial) trends in the frequency of all-category tropical cyclones. Event attribution studies and physical understanding indicate that human-induced climate change increases heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones but data limitations inhibit clear detection of past trends on the global scale.
Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s. This includes increases in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts on the global scale; fire weather in some regions of all inhabited continents; and compound flooding in some locations.

Heatwaves, Wildfires and Air Pollution: Compounding and Cascading Climate Hazards to Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic  WHO/WMO

The severe short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 are an additional burden for communities worldwide already dealing with the existing climate threats to health. Individuals infected with COVID-19 and exposed to climate hazards such as heat, wildfires or air pollution are at risk of experiencing more severe health outcomes compared to the risks from individual hazards. In addition, each individual climate hazard and COVID-19 impact can undermine and complicate public health responses to other climate hazards and COVID-19 impacts, compounding the stresses on health care quality and capacity. Heat and wildfire exposure combined with COVID-19 dynamics may lead to significant increases in hospital admissions whilst reducing health care services and infrastructural capacities ≠ medical equipment is limited, medical staff may be affected and health care facilities may be impaired (Figure 1). Climate hazards and COVID-19 impacts could also interact to make specific and routine interventions less effective, more challenging or more risky.


Heat impacts: Mechanisms and vulnerabilities
Heat can affect human health in several ways. Direct impacts include increased morbidity and mortality due to heat stress, heatstroke and exacerbations of cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular diseases (Figure 2). Heat can also impair human behaviour (e.g., physical and mental activities), health service delivery, air quality and critical infrastructure, leading to indirect health effects. Some population groups are particularly vulnerable: people over the age of 65, infants and children, individuals with disabilities or preexisting medical conditions, outdoor workers and people with low socioeconomic status. In urban areas, the dense concentrations of structures and the beehive of human activities can produce higher temperatures ≠ the urban heat island effect ≠ which may, for example, alter and deprive people of sleep at night.
Heat and health threats in recent years
Rising temperatures and more frequent, longer and persistent heatwaves in recent years are affecting human health, increasing heat-related mortality and impairment of capacity to work. Global heat-related mortality in people older than 65 years increased by 53.7% from 2000≠2004 to 2014≠2018, reaching 296 000 deaths in 2018, with the majority occurring in Japan, eastern China, northern India and central Europe. 37% of heat-related deaths can be attributed to human-induced warming, according to a global analysis including

data from 43 countries between 1991≠2018 (Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). In addition, rising temperatures were responsible for an excess of 103 billion potential work hours lost globally in 2019 compared with those lost in 2000 (Watts et al., 2020).
Combined risks of COVID-19 and heat
Susceptibility to COVID-19 overlaps significantly with susceptibility to heat, exacerbating the risks of compounding and cascading negative effects on health for vulnerable populations. Higher COVID-19 mortality rates were found among the elderly and individuals with underlying chronic conditions. Prevalent co-morbidities associated with increased COVID-19 severity include respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy and chronic kidney disease, which are also risk factors for heat-related complications (Emami et al., 2020).
Wildfire smoke impacts: Mechanisms and vulnerabilities
Rising global temperatures and heatwaves increase the likelihood of wildfires, which in turn drive further global warming by increasing CO2 emissions. Wildfire smoke contains a complex mixture of particles and significantly reduces air quality. Wildfire smoke can compromise air quality, which can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, affect the immune system and increase the risk of lung infections. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), specifically, can penetrate deep into the lungs, where they pose a particular risk to human health. Vulnerable population groups include the elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, people with co-morbidities and outdoor workers ≠ all of whom are also vulnerable to heat and COVID-19. The specific health impacts of wildfire smoke still need to be better understood, given that the chemical composition might differ from air pollutants from other sources, potentially affecting health in different ways.
Wildfire, air pollution and health threats in recent years
In 114 countries, there was an increase in the number of days people were exposed to very high or extremely high risk of danger from fire in 2016≠2019 compared with 2001≠2004, translating into an increase in population exposure to wildfires in 128 countries (Figure 3, Watts et al., 2020). The increased occurrence of wildfires leads to peaks in air pollution concentrations that represent not only a risk factor for respiratory diseases but also a significant factor associated to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Karanasiou et al., 2021).
Combined risks of COVID-19, wildfires and air pollution in recent years
Long-term exposure to air pollution is linked to chronic diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, heart diseases, effects on the nervous system and diabetes. Cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, diabetes, hypertension and cancer have been suggested to be associated with adverse prognosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected people (Wu et al., 2020). A significant fraction of COVID-19 infections lead to adverse long-term conditions affecting the heart, lungs and other organ systems, which could be worsened by air pollution exposure (Brunekreef et al., 2021). While quantification is difficult, emerging evidence suggests that the compound effects of air pollution and COVID-19 may lead to increased COVID-19 mortality. In the US, an increase of 1 g/m3 in the long-term PM2.5 was associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate (Wu et al., 2020). In addition, long-term exposure to particulate matter was estimated to contribute to approximately 15% of COVID-19 mortality worldwide (Pozzer et al., 2020).

Strategic response to future increases in climate hazards and health impacts
Efforts to protect and rebuild local communities from public health, economic and societal consequences of COVID-19 will need to be sustained and aligned with national climate change strategies. This is not currently happening. Since the start of the pandemic, close to half of stimulus spending by G20 countries on energy-producing and consumer activities has gone to coal, oil and gas. In the absence of effective mitigation and adaptation, population exposure to compounding and cascading effects of climate hazards will continue to grow as scientists expect extreme temperature and wildfire events to occur with increased frequency, duration and magnitude in coming years due to climate change. Besides addressing impacts of individual climate hazards, public health researchers and decision-makers need to analyze and integrate health risks of compounding climate impacts into health adaptation plans and projections, target actions to protect vulnerable population groups, and promote COVID-19 recovery investments that both protect human health and reduce environmental and climate impacts (WHO, 2020).
Global mean sea levels rose 20 cm from 1900 to 2018 at an e) accelerating rate of 3.7 ± 0.5 mm/yr from 2006 to 2018 (IPCC, 2021). This is due to human-induced global warming which is causing thermal expansion of ocean water and melting land-based ice. The rate of ice sheet loss in Greenland and Antarctica increased by a factor of four between 1992-1999 and 2010-2019, so that ice sheet and glacier mass loss were the dominant contributors to sea level rise from 2006 to 2018. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2021) projects that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise unabated (i.e., a SSP1-8.5 8.5 emission pathway), global mean sea level will likely rise 0.6≠1.0 metres by 2100 (relative to 1995≠2014) and, with less confidence, range from 1.7≠6.8 m (perhaps more) by 2300 (Figure 1), with continued large changes beyond. The large increases in sea level by 2300 would be mostly attributable to significant inputs from the melting of the large ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. A substantial reduction in future greenhouse gas emissions would substantially reduce global sealevel rise. If emissions are reduced to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2 ∞C"" (i.e., an SSP12.6 emissions pathway), global mean sea level would still likely rise 0.3≠0.6 m by 2100 (relative to 1995≠2014) and with less confidence range from 0.3≠3.1 m by 2300. This is a lower rise; but since the future emissions pathway is unknown at this point, and the ice sheet response to a given temperature rise is also highly uncertain, future sea-level rise might be substantially higher (IPCC, 2021).
Sea-level rise threatens the world's coastal areas through a range of biophysical impacts and changes (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) which include:
∑ permanent submergence of land by rising mean sea levels and high tides ∑ more frequent and deeper coastal flooding ∑ enhanced coastal erosion ∑ degradation, change and loss of coastal ecosystems ∑ salinization of soils and of ground and surface water ∑ impeded drainage and waterlogging.

These biophysical impacts will in turn have socioeconomic impacts on coastal residents and their livelihoods, such as direct damage to buildings and infrastructure and disruption of economic activities. In 2020, an estimated 267 million people (or about 4% of the

Sea Level and Coastal Impacts ≠ WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC)
world's population) were living within 2 m above sea level (Hooijer and Vernimmen, 2021). This number is growing due to both sealevel rise and demographic trends. It has long been recognized that small islands, deltas and coastal cities are especially threatened due to their high exposure and/or vulnerability. When considering the impacts of sea-level rise, it is important to note that most of these occur because of increases in extreme sea-level events produced by combinations of tides, storm surges and waves that rise with mean sea level. Further impacts are due to local relative sea-level change rather than global mean sea-level rise because of both regional and local climatic ≠ oceanic circulation changes, local hydrology, gravitational changes linked to ice melting, etc ≠ and non-climatic components ≠ land uplift/ subsidence ≠ which also contribute to local sea levels (Figure 2). Hence, global changes need to be downscaled when evaluating future impacts and adaptation needs. In coastal areas where land is rising significantly today, for example, Alaska and northern Scandinavia, relative sea-level rise is reduced or may even be falling. In contrast, human-induced land subsidence in densely populated sedimentary coastal plains due to groundwater withdrawal and related processes is causing local substantial relative sea-level rise ≠ for example, sometimes exceeding 1 cm/yr and up to 10 cm/yr in Jakarta. Due to the concentration of people in subsiding coastal areas, such subsidence is of global significance (Nicholls et al., 2021). The Asian coast is particularly prone to this process reflecting its geological heritage (often comprising deltas and alluvial plains) and associated high and growing urban populations (e.g., Jakarta, Bangkok, Shanghai).
Adaptation to sea-level rise can be conducted using a range of contrasting methods, (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) including:
∑ Protection which reduces the likelihood of coastal impacts and can be implemented with (i) hard engineered structures such
as dikes, seawalls, breakwaters and surge barriers, and (ii) sediment-based (or soft) protection such as beach and shore nourishment and dunes. It is also important to note that protection always leaves a residual risk--due to extreme events that exceed protection standards ≠ and hence flood damage cannot necessarily be completely prevented.
∑ Advance creates new land by building seaward and upward or raises existing floodprone land. It can be achieved through
land reclamation above sea levels and polderization, the gain of new low land enclosed by dikes. Advance is widely practiced around coastal cities where land is scarce and valuable and needs to take full account of sea-level rise in the future.

Sea Level and Coastal Impacts ≠ WCRP (WMO/IOC/ISC)
∑ Accommodation involves floodproofing and elevating buildings and infrastructure and is supported by early warning systems
for floods. It does not entirely prevent coastal impacts but reduces the vulnerability of coastal residents, infrastructure, and associated activities.
∑ Planned or managed retreat reduces exposure to coastal impacts by moving people, infrastructure and human activities out
of the exposed area ≠ or by avoiding development of the coastal floodplain in the first place.
∑ Forced migration due to sea-level rise and/or extreme events may also occur.
Ecosystem-based or nature-based adaptation is of growing interest as these solutions recognizes the natural protection provided by coastal ecosystems, an advantage that was often ignored in the past. Coral and oyster reefs, mangroves, marshes and seagrass meadows act as protective buffers that attenuate extreme water levels (surges, waves), reduce rates of erosion and can raise elevation or create new land by trapping sediments and building up organic matter and detritus.
Effective use of these physical adaptation responses requires planning and institutional arrangements. Such plans might define standards for dike heights, building codes and/or setbacks for the flood plain, incentives for risk management, and disaster preparedness and early warning systems. Given the high uncertainties about future sea levels, adaptation pathways are being increasingly explored in coastal areas as an effective way of making adaptation decisions today (Haasnoot et al., 2019). However, these natural systems are poorly understood compared to engineered approaches so further research, development and learning is required to support wider and more confident application and promulgation for the future.
The challenge posed by climate-induced sea-level rise is massive and deeply uncertain, especially beyond 2100. To meet this challenge, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), which is jointly sponsored by WMO, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and the International Science Council (ISC), leads an integrated sea level research agenda reaching from the global down to the regional and coastal scales.
Strong mitigation efforts are needed now to avoid the multiple metres of sea-level rise over the next centuries that threatens all the coastal regions of the world. But even with such efforts, sea levels will continue to slowly rise for decades and centuries to come. Thus, coastal adaptation is essential in any future, but it will be easier and more likely to be successful when combined with stringent mitigation. There is a need to start exploring long-term adaptive strategies now if they are not already initiated. Such efforts should be linked to wider coastal management and development objectives. Small islands, deltas and coastal cities are key targets for such action. In addition, the establishment of coastal early warning systems, especially multi-hazard ones, is crucial, considering the multiple sources of coastal flooding in addition to sea-level rise. The WMO Coastal Inundation Forecasting Initiative (CIFI), which establishes early warning systems to enable vulnerable communities to respond and act fast when hazards threaten, is one of many UN activities aimed at coastal adaptation.

Climate Predictions for The WMO Lead Centre for Annual to Decadal Climate Prediction produces a summary of predictions for the coming five years (Hermanson et al., 2021). These predictions are the best estimate of the near-term climate as they are based on the world's leading decadal prediction systems from WMO designated Global Producing Centres and non-designated contributing centres. They include multiple realizations (100 in total) with both observed initial conditions, of the type used in seasonal prediction, and boundary forcing, of the type used to drive long-term climate projections. The predictions do not include the small effects of changes in emissions ≠ such as those due to the COVID-19 lockdowns ≠ and they assume that no major volcanic eruptions occur in the period covered.

Figure 1. Predictions for 2021≠2025 near surface temperature anomalies relative to 1981≠2010. Ensemble mean (left) and probability of above average (right). As this is a two-category forecast, the probability for below average is one minus the probability shown on the right (WMO, 2021; Hermanson et al., 2021)

Predicted temperature patterns for 2021≠2025 show a high probability for temperatures above the 1981≠ 2010 average almost everywhere, with enhanced warming at high northern latitudes and over land compared to the ocean (Figure 1). The Arctic (north of 60 ∞N) anomaly is more than twice as large as the global mean anomaly.

Figure 2 shows the predicted annual mean global near surface temperature for the five-year period 2021≠2025 relative to 1981≠2010. The global mean near surface temperature is predicted to be between 0.9 ∞C and 1.8 ∞C above pre-industrial conditions (taken as the average over the period 1850 to 1900). The chance of at least one year exceeding 1.5 ∞C above pre-industrial levels is 40%, with a small chance (10%) of the five-year mean exceeding this level. It is important to note, that this is not the same as surpassing the Paris Agreement 1.5 ∞C level, which refers to the climatological condition over a long-term average. Instead this metric shows the increasing likelihood of a temporary exceedance of the 1.5 ∞C temperature level as the climate warms, which is likely to occur as Earth's climate draws closer to the Paris level. Confidence in forecasts of global mean temperature is high. Skill scores are shown in the right panels of Figure 2. Although the global coronavirus pandemic caused changes in emissions of greenhouse gases ≠ and aerosols were not included in the forecast models ≠ the impact of these changes on greenhouse gas levels is small (WMO, 2021).

Figure 2. Multi-annual predictions of annual global mean near surface temperature relative to 1981≠2010. Annual mean observations in black, forecast in blue, hindcasts in green and uninitialized simulations in grey. The shading indicates the 90% confidence range. The probability for above average in the five-year mean of the forecast is given at the bottom the main panel (in brackets the probability for above average in the first year). The inset in the main panel, referring to the right axis, is the probability of global temperature exceeding 1.5 ∞C above pre-industrial levels for at least one year during the five years starting in the indicated year (Smith et al. 2018). Observed temperatures are an average of three observational data sets (Hansen et al., 2010, updated; Karl et al., 2015, updated; Morice et al., 2021, updated), they are near surface (1.5 m) over land and surface temperatures over the ocean. Model temperatures are near surface throughout (WMO, 2021; Hermanson et al., 2021). Correlation and Mean Squared Skill Score (MSSS) for annual means in the forecast are shown in the upper right panel. A contingency table for the probabilistic skill is shown in the lower right.

Global Climate in WMO Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update
Precipitation forecasts for 2021≠2025 (Figure 3) suggest wetter than average conditions are likely to occur at high latitudes in both hemispheres and across the Sahel. The pattern of increased precipitation in the tropics and midlatitudes and reduced precipitation in the subtropics compared to the 1981-2010 reference period is consistent with an increased hydrological cycle that is expected as the climate warms. There is moderate but significant correlation skill over the Sahel, Greenland and across northern Europe and Eurasia (Hermanson et al, 2021), giving medium confidence in the forecast for an increased chance of precipitation in these regions. This work is done in collaboration with the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and supports the development of climate services. These forecasts are used by several National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and in research projects worldwide. They will soon be used by WMO Regional Climate Centres to provide advance warnings to minimize the impact of climate hazards.
Figure 3. Predictions for 2021≠2025 precipitation anomalies relative to 1981≠2010. Ensemble mean (left) and probability of above average (right). As this is a two-category forecast, the probability for below average is one minus the probability shown in the right column (WMO, 2021; Hermanson et al., 2021)
Based on paleoclimate and historical evidence, it is likely that at least one large explosive volcanic eruption would occur during the twenty-first century. Such an eruption would reduce global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years, alter the global monsoon circulation, modify extreme precipitation and change many CIDs (medium confidence). If such an eruption occurs, this would therefore temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change (IPCC, WG1, 2021)
Five years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the emissions gap is as large as ever

The emissions gap has not been narrowed and is, as yet, unaffected by COVID-19 (Figure 1). By 2030, annual emissions need to be 15 GtCO2e (range: 12≠19 GtCO2e) lower than current unconditional National Determined Contributions (NDCs) imply for a 2 ∞C goal, and 32 GtCO2e (range: 29≠36 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.5 ∞C goal. Full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs would reduce each of these gaps by around 3 GtCO2e. Collectively, current policies fall 3 GtCO2e short of meeting the level associated with full implementation of the unconditional NDCs.
The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2 ∞C, 1.8 ∞C or 1.5 ∞C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated global total GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of the NDCs.
As of mid-November 2020, when the latest Emissions Gap Report was published, none of the major emitters had submitted new or updated NDCs with stronger targets for 2030 and NDC target updates from 2019 were projected to reduce total emissions by less than 1% by 2030.
NDCs as at mid-November 2020 remained blatantly inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and would lead to a temperature increase of at least 3 ∞C by the end of the century. Countries must collectively increase their NDC ambitions threefold to get on track to a 2 ∞C goal and more than fivefold to get on track to the 1.5 ∞C goal.
Preliminary estimates of the impact of NDC target updates during the first six months of 2021, including by the US, the EU27 and the United Kingdom, and the announcements of Canada, China and Japan, indicate that emissions projections under the unconditional NDC scenario could be reduced by 12%≠15% compared with the projection in the 2020 edition of the Emissions Gap Report. However, this is still far from sufficient to bridge the emissions gap in 2030. The 2021 edition of the Emissions Gap Report will provide a full assessment of the emissions and warming implications of the updated NDC targets.

The COVID-19 crisis likely only offers a short-term reduction in global emissions
COVID-19 containment measures significantly reduced global GHG emissions in 2020 (Figure 2). CO2 emissions decreased by about 7% compared with 2019 emission levels, with a smaller drop in GHG emissions, as non-CO2 is less affected (Emissions Gap Report, 2020). However, unless the containment measures are followed by economic rescue and recovery measures that support a low-carbon transition, this dip in global GHG emissions is estimated to result in no more than a 0.01 ∞C reduction of global warming by 2050, which by then is expected to have exceeded 1.5 ∞C (Forster et al., 2020).

Emissions Gap ≠ United Nations Environment Programme
Explorative projections based on available studies indicate that global GHG emissions are only significantly reduced by 2030 if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue strong decarbonization (Figure 3, IEA sustainable recovery scenario). This could result in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCO2e by 2030, a reduction of 15 GtCO2e (just over 25%) by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19/current policies scenario, and considerably below global emissions in 2015.
Figure 3. Global total GHG emissions by 2030 under a current policies scenario based on pre-COVID-19 studies and various ""what if"" scenarios using explorative calculations (post-COVID-19) (median and 10th to 90th percentile range), UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2020
So far, fiscal rescue and recovery measures have not accelerated a low-carbon transition
COVID-19-related fiscal spending by governments is of unprecedented scale, amounting to roughly US$ 12 trillion globally as at October 2020, or 12% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. So far, the COVID-19 fiscal spending of G20 members has primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic production or had neutral effects on GHG emissions (Figure 4). All G20 members have implemented several immediate rescue measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These are mostly assessed neutral in terms of GHG emissions impact (for example, health-care-related spending) or supporting high-carbon industries without conditions for a low-carbon transition attached. As at November 2020, only around a quarter of G20 members had dedicated shares of their packages (accounting for up to 3% of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures. Most G20 members have brought forward measures and packages supporting a highcarbon status quo of their economies or are even fostering new high-carbon investments. Policies with positive impacts on reducing GHG emissions have been slightly more prevalent in fiscal recovery measures than rescue measures. This is noteworthy, as the next stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating that there is potential for increased implementation of low-carbon measures.

UNCDF-2020-4.txt,"MAKING FINANCE WORK FOR THE POOR Supporting SDG Achievement in the Last Mile ANNUAL REPORT 2019  FOREWORD  As we enter the Decade of Action, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires accelerating transformational change, driven by innovation, risk-taking, and partnerships.  Modeling financial pathways that are inclusive of last mile communities will be a key ingredient to enable such change and ensure no one is left behind. Accelerating SDG action has become even more urgent in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, which is reinforcing existing challenges and posing particularly grave risks to poor and vulnerable communities in the least developed countries (LDCs), including women, youth, informal workers, migrants, and smallholder farmers. The pandemic's unprecedented impacts increase the risk that vulnerable communities in LDCs will be left behind. The crisis highlights the critical role to be played by a range of financing solutions, including Official Development Assistance to leverage other forms of capital. Rapid international collective action to scale up the deployment of innovative financing approaches that create new pathways to reach last mile communities in LDCs will be critical to supporting resilient and sustainable local economic development. The current international financial architecture does not favor local economic investment in LDCs, so UNCDF works to tackle this challenge. Committed to market development approaches that can transform how public and private finance flows to the last mile, UNCDF creates demonstration effects and viable models that crowd in other actors, and can be replicated and brought to scale.  The results we achieved in 2019 contributed to i) develop markets for inclusive digital finance and economy solutions that reach the poor; ii) build ecosystems and provide catalytic finance to support small SDG positive businesses; and iii) create transformative change that enables local governments to access capital to build stable, dynamic, and resilient local economies. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the valuable roles to be played by digital solutions, sub-national finance, and small business finance to support communities through the worst of the crisis and to emerge with strong foundations for recovery. As we look ahead to 2021, when we will develop our next Strategic Framework and accompany the process to define the Fifth UN Conference on the LDCs, we reaffirm our commitment to support accelerated SDG action in the LDCs to assure that the next decade of action is more resilient to future shocks, more sustainable, and more inclusive of the last mile. We thank our many public and private sector partners, notably our LDC government partners and donors who co-create innovation with us, take risks with us, and recommit with each initiative to the goal of leaving no one behind. UNCDF ANNUAL REPORT 2019 As we enter the Decade of Action, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires accelerating transformational change, driven by innovation, risktaking, and partnerships. Modeling financial pathways that are inclusive of last mile communities will be a key ingredient to enable such change and ensure no one is left behind. BUSINESS MODEL Where Did We Work  1. INNOVATION: UNCDF identifies problems that need to be solved in the last mile of LDCs and creates programs and initiatives to solve them. UNCDF invites collaboration with public and private sector actors to co-create solutions and test them in base-of-the-pyramid areas and sectors. 2. CONSOLIDATION: UNCDF consolidates the lessons learned from the innovation stage and works with government and private  sector partners to embed them in local institutions, policies, and systems. 3. SCALE-UP: UNCDF and its partners work with national and international funding partners to expand successful initiatives. This may involve replication across institutions, localities, and/ or countries.  Least Developed Countries and the Changing Development Context  When the United Nations launched the ""Decade of Action"" to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in January 2020, the message was clear: delivering sufficient and well-targeted financing to achieve the SDGs by 2030 would be the critical priority over the next 10 years. This includes ensuring that finance will flow to the areas with the greatest development needs, notably the least developed countries (LDCs). While progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda has been uneven over the past five years, a number of shifts in the development landscape bring important opportunities for LDCs. · The digital finance revolution is profoundly impacting the global economy and transforming LDC societies. The number of registered global mobile money accounts surpassed 1 billion in 2019, with 469 million such accounts in sub-Saharan Africa alone. The digital revolution helps drive increased access to financial services and is changing how poor people save, receive social payments and remittances, and buy products and services. It is also changing how micro, small and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) can access financing to grow their businesses and deliver services and SDG solutions more efficiently. With only one in six people connected to the internet in LDCs, significant investment and support will be needed to fully tap these digital opportunities and make sure LDCs are not left behind. · The growing realization that local government action is essential to achieve a majority of the SDGs. With often dramatic economic and social differences between capital cities, secondary cities and rural areas within a given country, development requires local approaches.  Local development policies, fiscal decentralization and targeted local investments are key to tackle specific local challenges to reduce inequalities and accelerate sustainable development. To further unlock the powerful role of local governments requires strengthening capacities and defining more effective channels for public and private development finance to flow to the local level. · The importance of the private sector in driving SDG innovations and inclusive growth. SMEs create the majority of jobs in LDCs and they increasingly recognize the business opportunities and benefits from investing in sustainable business approaches. Fully unleashing the development potential of the local private sector in LDCs will require dramatically improving access to investment capital needed to grow small businesses, as existing domestic and international financial institutions and investors often view them as too small and risky and are not set up to service them. The COVID-19 pandemic is now causing significant socio-economic hardships for LDCs, in particular for vulnerable population groups, and the crisis risks halting or even reversing any progress made on the SDGs. At the same time, the crisis has demonstrated the critical roles digital solutions, local government finance and SME finance play in mitigating and responding to its impacts. Accelerating investments and support in these areas will be important components of LDCs' response, recovery and longer term development plans.  Leveraging the Digital Finance Revolution: Financial Inclusion Practice area  Meaningful digital financial inclusion must provide opportunities for low-income accountholders to engage in the economy to meet their daily needs and improve their skills, productivity and marketability in the digital-economy age.  By building inclusive digital economies through a market development approach, UNCDF supports last mile communities to use digital services in ways that contribute to accelerating achievement of the SDGs. In 2019 UNCDF launched its new strategy, ""Leaving No One Behind in the Digital Era,"" which builds on its deep experience in promoting financial inclusion and helping to connect 18 million people to the financial ecosystem over recent years. The strategy focuses on accelerating the development of digital economies that are inclusive, contribute to green growth, and bring long-term benefits for last mile populations, by working with governments, the private sector, communities and academia. ""Leaving No One Behind in the Digital Era"" focuses on communities that are often marginalized--namely women, youth, migrants, refugees and MSMEs.  By building inclusive digital economies through a market development approach, UNCDF supports last mile communities to use digital services in ways that contribute to accelerating achievement of the SDGs.   The approach is organized in four workstreams, which constitute the strategy for achieving this goal. The key strategic instruments comprise the tools that UNCDF employs across the workstreams.   RESUME  UNCDF served 3 million unbanked and underbanked clients with financial services in 2019, supporting the mobilization of an estimated $237 million in savings, as well as deployment of $3.3 billion in digital payment transactions. Among the 3 million clients, 2.3 million were reached using digital financial products and services. At the policy level, UNCDF supported governments and regulators in tackling the complex challenges of managing digital transitions, with the goal of creating inclusive, sustainable digital economies. UNCDF launched its Africa Policy Accelerator initiative in 2019 to improve the capacities of African financial regulators to promote financial innovations, as well as to remove barriers to digital financial services and enable them to reach unbanked and underbanked populations.  UNCDF also supported governments across SubSaharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific in designing national road maps for financial inclusion and in implementing policy solutions to leverage financial services that advance the SDGs. Inclusive finance for clean energy: UNCDF continued to expand its work to demonstrate how decentralized energy solutions can be both financially viable and effective in reaching customers in last mile LDC markets. UNCDF's approach complements a traditional focus on grid expansion and connectivity by providing support and finance for companies delivering decentralized clean energy solutions that replace polluting energy sources and combat deforestation.    IN FOCUS: Empowering Women, Youth, Farmers and Migrants in the Last Mile The digital divide remains a key challenge to ensuring that no one is left behind. This is why UNCDF works to equip traditionally unbanked and underbanked populations to use digital services and promotes the development of tailored services that meet the needs of women, youth and rural populations. UNCDF supports financial service providers, mobile network operators and fintech firms in piloting and scaling digital financing solutions in support of the real economy in LDCs. In Papua New Guinea, UNCDF supported Women's Microbank Limited (WMBL) to use biometric identification to open digital savings accounts, which allowed customers lacking formal ID and living in financially underserved areas to access financial services. The savings service enrolled 33,000 new customers in 2019, 97 per cent of whom were women. UNCDF also supported youth financial inclusion combined with employment opportunities in five countries in West Africa (The Gambia, Guinea, Niger, Senegal and Ghana). Since 2018, UNCDF has contributed to a net increase of almost 124,000 clients served by its partners, of whom 45 per cent are women and 40 per cent are youth. UNCDF also worked with a variety of partners to offer digital solutions to smallholder farmers. In Nepal, UNCDF partnered with Prabhu Management on digitizing payments in the dairy value chain and Prabhu Bank to create a digital credit product for rural and farmer clients. In Uganda, UNCDF worked with Mobipay and Yo Uganda to digitize agriculture value chains, resulting in over 120,000 farmers actively using mobile money. International remittance flows is another area where digital financing has wide-reaching implications for low-income migrants and their families. In 2019, UNCDF supported an innovation using blockchain technology to link remittances sent by Nepali migrants to digital savings and credit products, helping migrants and their families generate more income. Drawing on this experience, UNCDF is scaling up in 2020 with a new programme to provide low-cost digital remittance services and remittance-linked financial products, with the goal of reaching at least 900,000 migrants and their families by 2023.  WOMEN 97% MEN 3% PAPUA NEW GUINEA 33,000 new customers opened digital savings accounts, 97 per cent of whom were women. UGANDA 120K Number of farmers actively using mobile money in Uganda   UNCDF ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Strengthening Localization of Development: Local Development Finance practice (LDFP)  Achieving the SDGs requires local approaches. With 33% of LDC populations now living in urban areas, cities, local authorities and communities have a critical role to play in implementing the SDGs. However, local authorities continue to face challenges in mobilizing finance for development.  UNCDF leverages its experience in fiscal decentralization and local development finance to expand access to capital for cities and local governments to invest in climate adaptation, women's economic empowerment, food security, health, and local economic development. UNCDF's Local Development Finance Practice (LDFP) serves as a centre of excellence for local development finance in LDCs, promoting the transformative role of subnational governments to finance the SDGs. In 2019, UNCDF engaged with 443 local governments in 22 LDCs and carried out 363 local investment projects. LDFP supports the engagement of public and private actors to invest in strategic local development projects that conform with its dual key system--a multi-factor assessment that enables UNCDF to consider both the potential development impact and the financial impact (sustainability and follow-on investment capital) of a given localized investment. In 2019, UNCDF's innovative dual key system was recognized with an honourable mention by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for ""Product Innovation of the Year.""  FIGURE TWO DUAL KEY INVESTMENTS BY THEME (THEMATIC BREAKDOWN OF PROJECTS PROCESSED THROUGH DUAL KEY AS OF 2019)  STRENGTHENING LOCALIZATION OF DEVELOPMENT  To advance climate resilience at the local level, UNCDF's Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL) provides a standard country-based mechanism designed to effectively deliver domestic and international climate finance to the local level. This financing enables local governments to assess risks, plan, implement, and monitor climate-resilient development. This mechanism was recognized by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2019 as a technical guidance tool for localizing national adaptation plans in LDCs. UNCDF's Local Development Finance Practice (LDFP) serves as a centre of excellence for local development finance in LDCs, promoting the transformative role of subnational governments to finance the SDGs. In 2019, LoCAL was being implemented in 14 countries, engaging with 280 local governments, representing over 10 million people. Since its inception it has mobilized $80 million in grants and technical assistance, resulting in 600 local adaptation projects. The LoCAL mechanism is also being scaled up nationally among participating governments. In Bhutan, the Government is expanding the LoCAL mechanism to 100 local governments with support from the European Union. In Cambodia, the mechanism has brought localized climate adaptation investments to over 50 districts with support from the Government of Sweden and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).  In order to address gender inequalities and advance women's economic empowerment at the local level, UNCDF, in a joint programme with UNDP and UN Women, helps channel and unlock financing to improve economic opportunities for women. Through this joint programme, grants and loans of $2.9 million financed 22 investments in women-owned businesses and gender-responsive infrastructure. These catalytic investments helped unlock an additional $4 million in local financial resources. In Bangladesh, the initiative helped the Central Bank establish a credit guarantee scheme to increase finance for small enterprises owned by women. In its pilot phase, the guarantee unlocked US$ 2.2 in private capital for every dollar of guarantee committed. The joint programme has also produced a Women's Economic Empowerment Index with gender-sensitive investment criteria to assess and rank private sector and infrastructure investment projects, which has been integrated into investment decision making processes and is being adopted by key partner institutions. In addition, the joint-programme has developed and is deploying a gender-responsive local assessment tool to identify economic opportunities and challenges in a locality from a gender perspective. As of 2019, over 27,000 local women in four countries have benefited from this programme. UNCDF also assisted local governments to develop effective local financing mechanisms. In Uganda, UNCDF supported the stabilization of the conflict-affected northern region by helping local institutions in 18 districts develop municipal asset management plans to help better manage and maintain local government assets. IN FOCUS: Systemic Approaches to Local Development Finance for Climate Resilience, Infrastructure Projects and Transboundary Water Investments In 2019, UNCDF prepared for the launch of the International Municipal Investment Fund (IMIF), a blended finance fund targeting urban and municipal infrastructure projects. The third party-managed IMIF will channel private sector finance towards climate-resilient infrastructure projects sponsored by cities and local governments. In 2019, UNCDF signed an agreement with Meridiam, a fund manager specializing in long-term public infrastructure projects, to manage the IMIF. UNCDF has also partnered with United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) and the Global Fund for Cities Development (FMDV) to support municipalities in identifying investable projects with strong development impact for IMIF consideration, and to provide policy and regulatory assistance services that would allow subnational governments to access private capital. UNCDF also supported the ""Blue Peace"" initiative, launched by the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) to introduce innovations in financing transboundary and multi-sectoral water infrastructure to leverage water's potential for enhancing cooperation and peace. Blue Peace seeks to catalyze private and public capital into projects that ensure the sustainable production and consumption of water related to all its uses (energy, agriculture, transport, potable water, ecosystem protection etc.). In 2019, the Gambia River Basin countries agreed to work with UNCDF to pilot an innovative financing mechanism through the Gambia River Basin Development Organization (OMVG) over the next two years. Catalyzing Investment Finance: Least Developed Country-Investment Platform (LDC-IP)  With a growing loan and guarantee portfolio, UNCDF seeks to demonstrate that investing in last mile settings creates positive development outcomes, can be commercially viable with the right blend of instruments and support, and can be scalable.  As of December 2019, UNCDF established and managed a pilot portfolio of 15 transactions representing $2.7 million in disbursed concessional loans and guarantees. Investments with an average ticket size of $220,000 were made in SMEs with strong development impact potential in food security/agribusiness, clean energy, women's economic empowerment and financial inclusion in Myanmar, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda, and Papua New Guinea. Six of these investments, with a value of $1.1 million, had unlocked a total of $2.6 million in additional follow-on capital. The portfolio has continued to grow, even with adjustments in 2020 due to COVID impacts. Initial work has begun on expanding capital instrument deployment through other UN programs, thereby increasing the number of SDGs that can be supported through innovative finance solutions using UNCDF's balance sheet. With its policies, operational guidance, risk assessment and management, and due diligence systems all in place, and an increasingly sizable unmet demand from the UN System and from the LDCs, UNCDF is ready for the one-time capitalization of its $50 million revolving Investment Fund, as outlined in the Strategic Framework 2018-2021. UNCDF's higher risk tolerance, focus on smaller ticket sizes, and  more robust technical assistance and monitoring for recipient institutions, combines to fill a critical gap in the current international financial architecture. It also provides a critical foundation on which UNCDF has built a strategic partnership for the launch of a third-party managed blended finance investment vehicle, the `BUILD Fund', tailored to bring capital to missing middle SMEs, especially in the LDCs. The initiative is a partnership with the impact investment firm Bamboo Capital Partners. UNCDF has a sub-advisory role and will pre-screen candidate investments for SDG impact and financial viability for SMEs that have potential for strong development impact, have a need for growth capital, but have trouble accessing commercial finance and/or are below the radar (risk, ticket size) of other funders. UNCDF has also launched a technical assistance facility to provide pre- and post-investment support to the pipeline of investable enterprises. The BUILD Fund is one of the few funds in the market with a focus on the LDCs, and will break new ground for this segment of the market.   CATALYZING INVESTMENT FINANCE IN FOCUS: Catalytic Capital to Support LastMile Sustainable Development Six UNCDF transactions have been structured as subordinated loans to directly unlock additional investments from local banks. For example, UNCDF gave a $250,000 loan to Aptech Africa, which provides a pay-as-you-go service for solar-powered water pumps in Uganda. Due to lack of collateral and credit history, Aptech had been unable to raise growth finance from traditional lenders. However, following a year of timely repayment to UNCDF, Aptech was successfully offered an $800,000 facility by a local commercial bank that included invoice discounting, bid guarantees and import loans. UNCDF's catalytic use of development finance resources to unlock commercial capital demonstrates how effective de-risking can help attract new private sector resources to promising SMEs. Additionally, UNCDF guarantees are structured to secure senior loan financing from local banks. For instance, UNCDF provided a partial loan guarantee of $226,000 to an agricultural poultry processing firm in Uganda, which unlocked a $650,000 loan from an impact investment fund. UNCDF's support for the Women's Microbank Limited in Papua New Guinea to support the launch of its biometrics capabilities (see IN FOCUS: Empowering Women, Youth, Farmers and Migrants in the Last Mile) was complemented by financing in order to meet new on-lending demand. In the second half of 2019, the bank received a $244,000 loan from the LDC Investment Platform. The loan will be used for on-lending to female entrepreneurs to grow their microbusinesses through WWBL's MamaBanks.  How we did it  UNCDF's Resource Mobilization Targets UNCDF is entirely funded by voluntary contributions from UN Member States, multilateral organizations, foundations and other sources. These contributions are provided as regular (core) resources, or other resources earmarked for specific purposes. UNCDF'S strategic funding targets include: $25 million in regular resources per year, $75 million in other resources per year, and a $50 million one-time capitalisation of its LDC Investment Fund. Regular resources provide a foundation for UNCDF's ability to innovate, ensure maximum presence in the LDCs, and provide robust support to the UN system at country level. Regular resources remained stable, at $13.3 million in contributions from 15 member states, $12m short of the Strategic Framework target of $25 million per year. Full financing of the core resources envelope will allow UNCDF to meet unmet demand for innovative financing solutions; to expand presence from 31 to 40 LDCs in this Decade of Action; to ensure more robust (senior) representation on UN Country Teams for strategic financing expertise; and to deepen our cutting edge expertise on emerging finance models that can work for the poor in LDCs. Donors contributed a total of $94.5 million of earmarked (non-core) resources for programming in 2019, a portion of which is multi-year funding. This reflects a 69 per cent increase from the 2018 figure of $56 million. FIGURE THREE STRATEGIC FUNDING TARGETS  Total revenues from development partners ­ bilateral and multilateral ­ grew by 114 per cent, from $29.6 million in 2018 to $63.3 million in 2019. Revenues from United Nations joint funds and programmes also increased 143 per cent, from $11.2 million in 2018 to $24.6 million in 2019. The top five donors in 2019 were the European Union, the Government of Sweden, the UN inter-agency pooled funds, the Government of the Swiss Confederation, and the Government of Norway; these five donors accounted for 68 per cent of UNCDF's total revenue in 2019. The one-time capitalization of the LDC Investment Fund with $50 million remains a top priority, to bring the initial $3m capitalization to scale. This will enable UNCDF to respond to unmet demand within the UN system and from LDCs for deployment of our capital instruments. UNCDF expenditures increased 18 per cent, from $64.2 million in 2018 to $75.9 million in 2019. This reflects increased programme delivery for local development financing, which grew from $18.4 million in 2018 to $30 million in 2019.  IN FOCUS: Last Mile Finance Trust Fund The Last Mile Finance Trust Fund (LMF-TF) was launched with support from Sweden in 2016, to offer donors a pooled funding vehicle for lightly earmarked resources for shared thematic priorities. LMF-TF enables UNCDF to test new models, innovate solutions, de-risk investments, and catalyze follow-on financing to support SDG achievement. Many of UNCDF's 2019 results were supported by LMF-TF funds--financing models to expand clean energy access; supporting local governments to access international climate adaptation funds; and demonstrating viable pathways for investing in small-ticket, high-impact businesses in LDCs. The LMF-TF welcomed two new donors in 2019: the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Government of the Netherlands. The SDC's donation will support its Blue Peace initiative to improve the shared use of transboundary water sources [See IN FOCUS: Systemic Approaches to Local Development Finance for Climate Resilience, Infrastructure Projects and Transboundary Water Investments.] The Netherlands' donation will allow UNCDF to expand its team of investment advisors across Africa to identify, structure, and manage the UNCDF investment pipeline. From one donor and USD 2.45 million in 2016, the LMF-TF has expanded to five donors and USD 43.4 million committed through 2021. Other LMF-TF donors are the Government of Andorra, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)."" Partnering with UNDP and the UN system UNCDF collaborates closely with the wider UN development system, including UNDP, (and UNV and UNOSSC), FAO, IFAD, ILO, UNESCAP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNOPS, UNWOMEN, and WFP. UNDP is UNCDF's main UN partner, with the two entities engaged in 26 joint programmes in 2019 and a range of collaborative exploratory and thematic initiatives. One flagship UNCDF and UNDP collaboration is the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP). As of 2019, PFIP has enrolled a total of 1.18 million Pacific Islanders as clients in financial services, with 49 per cent of new clients being women. Increasingly, UNDP and other UN entities are also looking to leverage UNCDF's finance expertise and capital mandate. For example, in the Gambia, UNCDF partnered with UNDP to establish a $10 million guarantee mechanism that de-risks and attracts commercial investments to a 10.5-megawatt solar power plant project. Select Strategic Initiatives and Partnerships UNCDF served as secretariat for the United Nations Secretary-General's Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals, co-chaired by UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner and the former CEO of ABSA Bank, Maria Ramos. UNCDF has established partnerships with Task Force members to pilot innovative solutions leveraging digital financing in a number of countries. The Better Than Cash Alliance, hosted by UNCDF, is a global partnership focused on accelerating the transition from cash to digital payments. In 2019 its membership grew to 30 national governments, 34 international organizations and eight businesses. In 2019, UNCDF supported the establishment of UNITLIFE, an innovative financing instrument aimed at funding interventions tackling global chronic childhood malnutrition; it operates from Station F, the world's largest start-up campus in Paris. In close collaboration with Government and foundation partners, along with UN Women and the Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office, UNCDF acts as the secretariat for UNITLIFE, offering its innovative financing expertise and helping to capitalize the initiative. The Malaga Global Coalition for Municipal Finance, first launched by UNCDF and UCLG in 2018, reconvened in Malaga in October 2019 for the Second Annual Conference to work towards a financial ecosystem for municipalities to achieve the SDGs.  RESUME  A UNCDF partnership with Meridiam for a third-party managed fund, The International Municipal Investment Fund (IMIF), was announced to provide direct access to finance for cities in the global south to achieve SDG 11 on Sustainable Cities and SDG 13 on Climate Action. Partnering with LDCs Among UNCDF's most important partners are the people, communities, civil society organizations, companies, and local and national governments of the LDCs. In 2019, UNCDF partnered with 443 local governments, 67 LDC-based financial service providers, 197 small and medium-sized enterprises, 88 fintech firms and more than 50 non-governmental organizations. UNCDF also collaborates closely with strategic network organizations such as United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), which includes thousands of local governments and cities in LDCs. As the United Nations marks its 75th anniversary in 2020, UNCDF continues to work with LDCs to advocate for their financing needs, particularly in the last mile.  Knowledge Leadership UNCDF has played a key role in raising global awareness about the role of blended finance in LDCs. Partnering with the OECD and others, UNCDF issued critical reports on this topic in 2018 and 2019. The 2019 report -- ""Blended Finance in the LDCs""-- shows that between 2012 and 2018, only 6 per cent of private capital mobilized for all developing countries through blended finance approaches reached LDCs. UNCDF also contributed to the launch of the 2019 World Observatory on Subnational Government Finance and Investment report, which compiles the world's largest database on subnational government finance, in partnership with the OECD and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG). UNCDF continued to build important knowledge resources around digital payments and finance. This includes a 2019 publication with the Mastercard Foundation, sharing findings from a joint multi-year project to support the growth of digital finance ecosystems in Benin, Senegal and Zambia.  What Did We Learn? UNCDF constantly works to capture lessons learned through its programmatic work and through independent evaluations. These include: INCLUSIVE DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES AND DIGITAL ECONOMIES ARE INTRINSICALLY LINKED UNCDF's financial inclusion programmes were found to play a strong convening role in developing digital finance markets for the poor and building the capacity of regulators, financial service providers and fintech stakeholders. As UNCDF moves towards promotion of broader digital economies, its lessons from creating inclusive financial services that clients can access, afford and find valuable are essential. To ensure inclusion also requires better data and measurement. This was the motivation behind UNCDF's creation of the Inclusive Digital Economy Scorecard (IDES), a new tool to measure the development and inclusion of digital economies. LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE IS CRITICAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND THE SDGS According to UCLG, an estimated 65% of SDG targets cannot be achieved without local action led by local governments. This includes efficient planning and infrastructure development in areas such as waste, energy, and transport. Local investments in sectors such as these need to be gender responsive and climate resilient. UNCDF's approach to local climate adaptation (LoCAL) was evaluated to be relevant to the climate finance agenda both nationally and internationally, demonstrating that UNCDF is filling a specific gap by developing replicable and scalable financial pathways for governments and vertical funds to channel climate finance to local governments. FILLING THE ""MISSING MIDDLE"" REQUIRES A VARIETY OF TOOLS, PARTNERS AND SOLUTIONS In 2019, UNCDF completed its pilot round of deploying catalytic loans and guarantees to address last mile finance gaps. Filling this critical gap requires the right mix of official development assistance, concessional and commercial finance in combination with appropriate business and investment advisory support. The gap exists as much because of the perception of risk in the domestic banking sector as because of a range of barriers related to Know your Customer (many first time customers in the SME sector), ticket size, currency risk, and others. Therefore, it is critical to engage relevant domestic partners (government, banks) as well as potential international investors in identification and due diligence processes from the earliest stages. This helps build support and ""demystify"" last mile investment. Having boots on the ground in such settings is a critical success factor to ensure robust support and monitoring, another reason that a UN actor like UNCDF has a particular comparative advantage in the last mile space.  In 2019, UNCDF completed its pilot round of deploying catalytic loans and guarantees to address last mile finance gaps  2020: UNCDF's Response To Covid-19  The COVID-19 crisis that has consumed the world's attention in 2020 is still unfolding in the LDCs, and its full impact is still unknown. While this annual report reflects results in 2019 before the pandemic, UNCDF has taken quick action to help LDCs reduce economic and social hardship. UNCDF has worked to:  · Repurpose local finance pathways to support subnational authorities for local response and recovery: UNCDF created guidelines for local governments to use existing fiscal transfer systems to deploy emergency financial resources for COVID-19 response efforts at the local level in line with WHO guidelines. UNCDF is also using grant funds to pilot immediate financial transfers to the local level for testing, disinfecting and treatment. In Bangladesh for example, UNCDF supports local governments to accelerate COVID-19 response efforts with resources from Sweden and the EU, channeling funds through the fiscal transfer system to 72 local governments. This is used to purchase sanitizing materials, masks and gloves, and printing publicity materials regarding social distancing · Deploy accelerated digital solutions: UNCDF supports accelerated digital payments solutions for the government and private sector to keep payments flowing, while financing innovations such as chatbots, contact tracing apps, digital pivots for local businesses, and e-commerce solutions in more than 20 countries. UNCDF and UNDP also worked with Switzerland, the United Kingdom and other Member States and partners to launch a global Call to Action to keep remittances flowing and to reduce transfer costs for migrants during the COVID-19 crisis.  · Provide support and finance solutions to overcome capital constraints for SMEs: UNCDF has accelerated its financial instruments deployment capacity for short-term bridge loans and other financial stimulus to reach small and micro enterprises most at risk. UNCDF also supports companies to adjust business models to survive the crisis. In Uganda, the main ride-hailing company, ""SafeBoda,"" is being supported to shift activities away from passenger transport to delivering essential goods and services to the local population, as well as using e-commerce and digital payment solutions. This has helped save jobs for SafeBoda's 18,000 drivers; provide food and medicines to 50,000 customers per day in Kampala; and keep 800 MSMEs afloat during the crisis. UNCDF also launched a survey of more than two thousand SMEs in all 47 LDCs to collect data about how Covid-19 is affecting them and to understand the type of financing and other support they need. Looking Ahead: Delivering Meaningful Scale to Spur Transformation  In the remaining two years of the UNCDF Strategic Framework, and in the context of the Decade of Action and COVID-19 response, UNCDF will:  1. Expand support for broader inclusive digital economies through its strategy ""Leaving No One Behind in the Digital Era"", promoting digital solutions for real economy sectors as a driver for resilient, sustainable, and inclusive economic transformation to help LDCs progress on the SDGs and rebuild better and more sustainably from COVID-19. 2. Strengthen the role of local governments in achieving the SDGs and responding to the COVID-19 crisis. UNCDF will continue to grow its role as a centre of excellence for local government finance, including with a strong focus on expanding access to local climate finance through its Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility (LoCAL); and by enhancing access to municipal investment capital by capitalizing and launching the International Municipal Investment Fund (IMIF). 3. Pursue the full capitalization of the $50 million UNCDF-balance sheet Investment Fund to scale up its catalytic support to higher risk, lower ticket size last mile investments, while also supporting the UN system pursuit of financial instrument deployments across the wider SDG spectrum. In parallel, UNCDF will continue its support for the full launch of the third-party managed BUILD Fund for SMEs in LDCs.  4. Across all its work, UNCDF will continue to expand its partnerships to deliver meaningful scale. This will include: · Seeking to deepen collaboration with UNDP and UN system to make best use of its capital mandate and offer more joint and impactful support to LDCs. · Expanding strategic partnerships with the private sector and other development partners to create innovative ways to attract more private finance to LDC markets. This includes introducing new collaborations with capital markets, fund managers, family offices and investors, as well as with multilateral and bilateral Development Finance Institutions. · Continuing to support the SecretaryGeneral's Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance to accelerate the flow of private sector capital to SDG-positive investments, particularly in developing countries. 5. Finally, UNCDF will engage closely with partners to support preparations for the Fifth United Nations Conference on the LDCs (LDC-V) and the development of the next 10-year programme of action for LDCs.

UNCDF-2020-5.txt,"Yearbook of Global Climate Action 2020 Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action  Global Climate Action    Patricia Espinosa Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC  Five years after the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, we find the world facing the worst global health crisis we have experienced for at least a century. The COVID-19 pandemic has, in less than a year, infected more than sixty million people, caused the loss of jobs, income and livelihoods at an unprecedented scale across the world, and set back almost all human development indicators by decades.  Under the leadership of the High-Level Climate Champions, Mr. Gonzalo Muñoz from Chile, and Mr. Nigel Topping from the UK, a groundswell of initiatives and actions, catalyzed by the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and other initiatives, and amplified by the Race to Zero campaign, has created the knowledge and impetus for ambitious and forward-looking Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs.  Yet, this is but a small sample of the damage and human suffering that a full-scale climate emergency will inflict unless we take urgent action to rapidly reduce emissions, increase resilience, and ensure a fair and equitable transition to a climate smart society. Climate change is not pausing because of COVID-19. The global pandemic and the climate change crisis have exposed humanity's weakest vulnerabilities and magnified its most urgent challenges. But they also offer a slim window of global opportunity to build a better future. Recovery from COVID-19 offers nations a chance to reorient policies and plans that will help build resilience, as well as building cities and communities that are clean, green, healthy and sustainable. In turn, this reorientation of plans and policies can also help address climate change at the speed and scale needed, along with other major challenges reflected in the 2030 Agenda.  This 2020 edition of the Yearbook of Global Climate Action not only reflects the contribution of non-Party stakeholders over the past five years, but also summarizes thematic Climate Action Pathways, laying out concrete and specific roadmaps for how to reach netzero emissions by mid-century. The Yearbook also outlines where the work of the Champions, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, and the wider community of non-Party stakeholder should go from here. I thank the High-Level Champions and all partners for contributing to this Yearbook, which offers both hope and optimism. It shows how we can work together, Parties and non-Party stakeholders alike, to create the future we both want and need.  Climate action by non-Party stakeholders is more important than ever for the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Agreement is a covenant among nations and their governments, but its implementation requires full support by all parts of society.   Making 2021 the Most Impactful Year for Climate Action Five years ago in Paris, governments of the world did something extraordinary when they agreed on the need to limit the global temperature rise. As the world prepares to celebrate the anniversary of this historic climate agreement, we are reminded once again of the urgent need for all actors to scale-up the ambition of the pledges made in 2015 in order to keep the dream of Paris alive. The enhanced role taken by entities which usually sat outside the intergovernmental process ­ such as subnational governments, the private sector and civil society at large ­ helped make Paris possible and became a core part of its success. Much has changed since then. During the intervening years, the world has witnessed fundamental step changes in how local communities, cities, CEOs and countries view and respond to the climate challenge. Perhaps the most visible shift in how actors are meeting this challenge is that the concept of net zero has taken shape as the guiding star that we are all pursuing. The race to zero has well and truly begun. Alongside countries such as China, Japan and the Republic of Korea signaling net zero, thousands of actors have now joined our Race to Zero campaign. Even amid the global pandemic, net-zero commitments have doubled in the last 12 months. Companies are now committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. This is the ambition loop in motion: a positive feedback loop in which bold government action and private sector leadership reinforce each other, and together take climate action to the next level.  But the question is: how can we transform systemically to reach our shared destination at the pace required? The answer lies in adopting a breakthrough approach that embraces radical collaboration and champions exponential change. The focus must be on systems change ­ environmental, economic and social ­ to collectively strive to create a zero carbon and resilient world. This is why the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action revamped the Climate Action Pathways last month. Each Pathway sets out the near- and long-term milestones for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C in the areas of energy, cities and other human settlements, industry, land use, oceans and coastal zones, transport, water and resilience. Collectively, they provide a blueprint to coordinate climate ambition among cities, regions, businesses and investors to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century, and limit warming to 1.5°C. As we look ahead from this anniversary towards COP 26 in Glasgow, it is clear we have a unique opportunity to make 2021 the most impactful year for climate action. This year's slimmer edition of the Yearbook reflects our work together with Marrakech Partnership stakeholders in 2020 to create Climate Action Pathways, offering a valuable assessment of where we stand with respect to non-Party action, and points to areas where success might be gained. The climate crisis upon us now requires that both Parties and nonParty stakeholders step up their climate action. We are all part of the solution. We must unite behind the science, working together in the spirit and practice of a new global multilateralism, with an intergovernmental process led by Parties involving all non-Party stakeholders in the quest for solutions to climate change. We can only win this race to zero together.  Executive Summary  In December 2020 we celebrate the fifth anniversary of a historic moment. The Paris Agreement, reached in December 2015, was unique in that 196 Parties committed to transforming their development trajectories towards a sustainable and resilient world, and limiting warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. Five years later, a total of 188 Parties have presented their first Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), embodying the efforts each of these countries are making towards reducing national emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change. However, though 103 of these Parties have stated their intention to enhance ambition by 2020, only 16 countries ­ representing nearly five per cent of global emissions ­ have submitted a revised 2020 NDC so far. The year of 2020 is also an atypical year, in which a worldwide pandemic of massive proportions caused a range of disruptions to people's lives and the world economy, upending all plans and processes. Like many other multi-stakeholder meetings, the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to the UNFCCC, which inaugurates a new phase of the Paris Agreement, had to be postponed to 2021. Climate action has not paused, however. Likewise, the work under the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action ­ launched four years ago to strengthen collaboration between governments and non-Party stakeholders and scale up the global response to climate change ­ has not stopped. In 2020, the High-Level Champions, Mr. Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) and Mr. Nigel Topping (UK), with the support of the UNFCCC secretariat, have focused on enhancing the Climate Action Pathways and mobilizing actors outside national governments to join the Climate Ambition Alliance through the Race to Zero campaign, launched in June. Both the Pathways and the campaign are aimed at encouraging actors to ramp up ambition and effective action on the ground in order to reach a net-zero resilient world by 2050. This Yearbook ­ the fourth produced by the High-Level Champions ­ presents the current range and state of global climate action by non-Party stakeholders (cities, regions, businesses, investors, and civil society), examines the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities for a green resilient recovery. It also explores the key elements of the Pathways, and delivers key messages and reflections from the Champions on the future of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action.  State of Global Climate Action 2020 The Global Climate Action Portal, launched in 2014, provides an online platform where governmental and non-governmental actors from around the globe can display their commitments to act on climate change. As of November 2020, the Portal registered 27,174 climate actions from 18,279 actors all around the world, representing a significant increase in actions and actors being recognized compared to COP 21 in 2015. There was also a significant increase in subnational and corporate net-zero targets in the past year, nearly doubling from late 2019 to late 2020 with 826 cities and 103 regions (representing about 11 per cent of the global population) and 1,565 companies making commitments despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn that it brought about. A large part of the actors pledging net-zero emissions examined by the report are already taking part in the Race to Zero campaign, which at the moment encompasses 23 regions, 524 cities, 1,397 businesses, 569 universities and 74 of the biggest investors aiming for zero emissions. Impacts of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world in the first months of 2020 rapidly evolved from a global health crisis to a socioeconomic one of massive proportions. The pandemic, which today impacts all countries, all peoples, and all parts of the economy, shares similarities with the climate change crisis that has been looming over the past decades. Both have been foreseen, their impending occurrence has been underestimated, and their impacts are wide-ranging. The socioeconomic fallout of COVID-19 is projected to last for months or years to come, affecting societies in a number of ways from here on out. Seeing that the planet's unfolding environmental crisis also poses a deep emergency, the recovery process needs to be turned into an opportunity to tackle both challenges in tandem, and build a better future. A range of actors are calling for a green resilient recovery, and various analyses show how recovery plans focusing on low-carbon sustainable measures can also create better socioeconomic outcomes and a healthier environment for all. A number of tools and inputs are being made available to help governments and other stakeholders in shaping sustainable recovery plans. NonParty stakeholders have also been instrumental in responding to the crisis, and in providing studies, tools and resources to help decision-makers shape a recovery that addresses challenges beyond those that are in their field of vision at the moment. Three vital recommendations enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can help provide guidance on how to address the compounding crises and reach the goals both frameworks seek to achieve: (i) enhance cooperation; (ii) seek balance; and (iii) build resilience. This will ultimately be the key for our transition into a more equitable, resilient and sustainable world. Looking Forward First launched in 2019, the Climate Action Pathways set out sectoral visions for achieving a 1.5oC resilient world in 2050. The 2020 Pathways incorporate insights about the exponential nature of the necessary systemic and technological change within sectors, but also focus on the synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas in order to assist all actors to take an integrated approach.  In 2020, the High-Level Champions also started work in response to a request by COP 25 to improve work under the Marrakech Partnership to enhance ambition. In order to do so, the Champions are working with a diverse range of actors to clarify and align around a shared vision to achieve net zero, fostering collaboration to trigger the rapid systemic change needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, and amplifying the progress and evidence of this exponential transformation already underway. With this work, the Champions' aim is to transform the Marrakech Partnership into an even stronger engine of collaboration and alignment, setting up for significant breakthroughs in 2021. The vision of an improved, evolved and updated Marrakech Partnership is to enable step change on the road to COP 26 carrying us to rapid and decisive implementation. Seeing that the decade ahead will be crucial in setting up the necessary pace and ambition to achieve a net-zero climate resilient world, the Champions see their role and that of the Marrakech Partnership as a core and go-to space in which leadership can converge, collaborate and execute together. The High-Level Champions look forward to continuing to work closely with Parties and non-Party stakeholders to refine this vision and develop a concrete plan in the early part of 2021.  The key aim of the 2020 Pathways is to be ambitious, resilient, adaptable, science-based, experimental and equitable. The Champions hope that climate trailblazers will be inspired by these Pathways to take bold steps towards achieving the various milestones.   The Paris Agreement, reached in December 2015 during COP 21, defined as its central goal to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as well as to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change and make financial flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.  Acknowledging the urgency of the matter, Parties agreed to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible, undertaking rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science. The Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are the means by which Parties agreed to present their planned efforts to reduce national emissions, including voluntary emission reduction pledges, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Five years later, a total of 188 Parties ­ accounting for 92.7 per cent of global emissions ­ have submitted their first NDC. Of these, 103 Parties (representing 129 countries and 44.8 per cent of global emissions) have stated their intention to enhance ambition by 2020, and 16 countries (representing 4.6 per cent of global emissions) have already done so, by submitting a 2020 NDC. A total of 20 Parties, representing 40 countries and 26.5 per cent of global emissions have submitted long-term strategy documents1. However, the Emissions Gap Report 2019 warned that current NDC pledges are not enough to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal in time. For 'well below 2oC', countries need to increase ambitions threefold ­ and more than fivefold if we are to achieve the 1.5oC limit2. During the Paris Conference, Parties also agreed that it would be necessary to mobilize stronger and more ambitious climate action, and acknowledged the engagement of a host of non-Party actors ­ such as cities, regions, businesses, investors, and civil society ­ in scaling up the global response to climate change. In order to ensure a durable connection between the Convention and the many voluntary and collaborative actions that were already taking place, Parties decided to appoint two High-Level Champions, with a new Champion being appointed each year, so that they represent both the current and the incoming COP Presidencies.  Building on the Lima-Paris Action Agenda, established during COP 20, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action was launched by the High-Level Champions in 2016, during COP 22. The Partnership aims at strengthening collaboration between governments and key stakeholders to lower emissions and increase resilience against climate impacts, and particularly to help increase the pace and ambition of climate action in the pre-2020 period and beyond. In order to provide a consistent and structured approach to facilitating climate action, the Marrakech Partnership implemented a work programme aligned under seven themes ­ Land Use, Oceans and Coastal Zones, Water, Human Settlements, Transport, Energy and Industry, with Resilience and Finance as additional cross-cutting areas ­ so that specific priorities could be addressed by the community of actors within each of them. The Yearbook of Global Climate Action is one of the tools developed by the High-Level Champions with the support of the UNFCCC secretariat to track progress, impacts and results, and to identify best practices and lessons learned. Its main objective is to reflect the range and state of global climate action from nonParty stakeholders and to bring key messages to the international community to encourage a higher level of ambition by Parties and non-Party stakeholders alike. Tracking Progress The first Yearbook, launched in 2017, showed that climate action had been indeed increasing since the lead-up to the Paris Climate Change Conference, and that, by 2016, cities and  regions representing over a billion people had already committed to reducing greenhouse gases and strengthening resilience, as had businesses with revenues of USD 36.6 trillion. The 2018 edition of the Yearbook stressed the urgency for immediate climate action raised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, which outlined the stakes for ecosystems and humans of allowing global temperatures to increase by even half a degree Celsius more. The report warned that, to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, with no or limited overshoot, global CO2 emissions would need to fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach net zero around 20503. The 2018 Yearbook took notice of the increased number of pledges launched during the UN Global Climate Action Summit in September 2018 and throughout the year, in the wake of renewed interest by non-Party stakeholders and society in general. It also noted that the potential emissions savings from a selection of cooperative initiatives were much higher than the aggregate of the individual commitments. If countries were to implement their NDCs fully and the cooperative initiatives were to meet their commitments without displacing action elsewhere, global emissions in 2030 would be in a range consistent with the longterm trajectory to meet the Paris Agreement goal of well below 2°C. The 2019 edition of the Yearbook noted that, while global ambition was still not strong enough and the pace of action was too slow to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement, a growing number of international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) had delivered action that, taken together, increased the likelihood of achieving desired environmental and social impacts. Their performance increased significantly ­ between 2013 and 2019, ICIs (often with Parties and non-Party actors working together) that achieved high to medium-high output performance increased from just over 30 per cent to nearly 70 per cent. The 2019 Yearbook also showed global mobilization in the regional Climate Weeks carried out throughout the year, pointing to the specific needs of each region, and growing participation of youth movements demanding more ambitious climate action, such as the Youth Climate Summit, hosted by the United Nations (UN) Secretary-General in September, ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit, and which served as a platform for more than 500 young activists, entrepreneurs and change agents to engage with international decision-makers. The year of 2020, which marks the fifth Anniversary of the Paris Agreement, was dubbed the year of ambition and implementation. However, due to the health and safety measures put in place worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main negotiation processes such as COP 26 and the subsidiary body  sessions had to be postponed to 2021. This does not mean a pause in climate action ­ much to the contrary. The bulk of the operational rules of the Paris Agreement is in place and ready for implementation, and Parties are expected to submit highly ambitious NDCs coherent with the urgency necessary to reach the Agreement goals. Capitalizing on the experience from the June Momentum for Climate Change, a series of virtual events was planned for November/December 2020 (UNFCCC Climate Change Dialogues), aimed at advancing work and providing a platform for Parties and other stakeholders to showcase progress made in 2020. Likewise, the 2020 High-Level Champions, Mr. Gonzalo Muñoz (Chile) and Mr. Nigel Topping (UK), are focused on enhancing the Climate Action Pathways and mobilizing actors outside national governments to join the Climate Ambition Alliance through the Race to Zero campaign, launched in June. The Pathways, whose revamped version was launched in November 2020, outline the longer-term sectoral visions for a 1.5oC climate-resilient world, and set out the necessary actions to achieve it. In order to showcase the revised Pathways, reflect on progress made on mitigation and adaptation across the Marrakech Partnership community, and inform the UNFCCC Climate Change Dialogues, the Champions hosted a series of dialogues between 9-19 November (Race to Zero Dialogues). As Parties are encouraged to drive their ambition in achieving the Paris Agreement goals to help the world build back better, so are non-Party stakeholders. In consonance with the High-Level Champions' objective, this Yearbook reflects the state and scope of global climate action in 2020, outlining the progress in the number of initiatives across the seven thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership and the range of actors involved, as well as the growing number of net-zero pledges made in the past few months. In the next chapters, it examines the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities for a green resilient recovery, explores the key elements of the Pathways, and delivers key messages and reflections from the High-Level Champions on the future of the Marrakech Partnership. State of Global Climate Action 2020 The Global Climate Action Portal was launched in 2014 as the NAZCA portal, aimed at providing an online platform where actors from around the globe could display their commitments to act on climate change. Today, the Portal compiles actions, initiatives and associated data from a range of partner organizations, aimed at presenting a clear and comprehensive view of global climate action from governmental and non-governmental actors, and covering all thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership. The actions registered in the Portal consist of individual commitments, referred to as individual actions, and participation in cooperative initiatives, referred to as cooperative actions. These cooperative initiatives are multi-actor and in many cases multisectoral, and though their main focus is climate change, these partnerships may address multiple goals under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As of November 2020, the Portal registered 27,174 climate actions from 18,279 actors all around the world, ranging from cities (10,691) and regions (243) to companies (4,052) and investors (1,136) and other organizations (1,966). It represents a significant increase in actions and actors being recognized compared to COP 21 in 2015, where 10,825 climate actions and 5,098 actors were registered. This is a result of both the Portal's evolution to capture a greater diversity of climate action and stakeholders, and the groundswell of global climate action. There are also currently 149 cooperative initiatives involving a total of 20,098 participants. The total number of registered initiatives includes 43 that were announced at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit, and are recognized in the Portal on a dedicated page. Figure 1 above shows the distribution of actors registered in the Global Climate Action Portal that are engaged in individual and cooperative climate actions per UN world region. Although a strong focus is given to emission reduction targets, in order to close the emissions gap necessary to keep warming below the 1.5oC limit, a diversity of actions contemplating both mitigation and adaptation goals is crucial to meet the Paris Agreement, seeing that climate change affects society in a number of direct and indirect ways, most of which are interlinked. A significant number of actions have tangible, scalable and replicable outcomes, albeit they may not be necessarily quantifiable. Building resilience is of particular importance, as all thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership are vulnerable to the various impacts of a changing climate. On that note, an upcoming report on State and Trends on Adaptation will feature a chapter on cooperative initiatives and highlight patterns of implementation and progress of initiatives that address adaptation and mitigation. The report, developed by the Global Center on Adaptation, will be published mid-January 2021. The columns on the following pages illustrate the different types of challenges faced across the Marrakech Partnership thematic areas, and the types of initiatives that are aimed at tackling them.  Land Use Land use (encompassing agriculture, forestry and other land uses) accounts for approximately 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, land absorbs approximately 29 per cent of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions4, and natural climate solutions (conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions) can provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilize warming below 2oC5. The sector is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change: climate-induced changes in temperature and rainfall patterns could significantly undermine yields of staple crops and impact global food security, in addition to the economic impacts to countries' global domestic product (GDP) and a considerable portion of the world's population that directly rely on forests to provide some or all of their livelihoods. A changing climate can also affect a range of ecosystem functions and services provided by land that are essential for humanity. Although tropical forests can provide up to 30 per cent of the climate change mitigation needed to meet the Paris Agreement goals, finance for forests in deforestation countries accounts for just over one per cent of global mitigation-related development funding6. There are currently 24 individual and 437 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 19 cooperative initiatives. A total of 345 actors (115 countries, 6 cities, 11 regions, 171 companies, 10 investors and 32 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing emissions from agriculture, forestry and land use, and restoring deforested and degraded areas to increasing climate resilience and food security and mobilizing financial means to increase the capacity of early warning systems.   Oceans and Coastal Zones Oceans and coastal zones provide ecosystem services as well as social and economic services globally, including fisheries, transport, tourism and habitat. Moreover, the ocean plays a central role in regulating the climate ­ it has absorbed around 28 per cent of CO2 emissions from human activities since the 1980s and over 90 per cent of excess heat in the climate system since the 1970s7. While the ocean mitigates climate change, increased ocean temperatures since the beginning of the 20th century have led to impacts such as acidification, deoxygenation, coral bleaching and changes in the geographic distribution of fish. Coral reefs are at a critical stage due to repeated coral bleaching ­ the goods and services provided by almost one fifth of the global reef area have already been lost, and if local and global threats are left unchecked, many tropical coral reefs could rapidly die by 2050 due to ocean acidification and warming8. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are projected to increasingly experience adverse impacts such as submergence, coastal flooding and coastal erosion due to sea level rise, as well as the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme meteorological events9. This is particularly concerning, considering that about 40 per cent of the global population is settled on the coastal zones (100km from the coast) and rely on its resources for income generating and living10. There are currently 54 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 5 cooperative initiatives. A total of 46 actors (33 countries, 4 investors and 9 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing coastal erosion hotspots and protecting population in priority flooding areas to reducing overfishing and driving investment into coastal natural capital.  Water The water thematic area is inclusive of all freshwater ecosystems ­ as water is essential to life on Earth, the scope is inherently cross-cutting, covering activities in sectors such as forest and land management, agriculture, industry, transportation, energy and urban systems. Emissions in the sector are largely linked to energy use, such as for water sourcing, treatment and distribution. Wastewater treatment processes can also produce large amounts of methane and nitrous oxide, which further increase the carbon footprint of the water sector11. Water is also the primary medium through which the effects of climate change are felt ­ from changes in snow and ice dynamics to increased incidences of flooding and droughts, the impacts are projected to intensify in the coming years. Ninety per cent of natural disasters are directly water-related12, and by 2050, the number of people at risk of floods will increase from 1.2 billion to 1.6 billion, while the number of people living in potential severely water-scarce areas is projected to increase from 1.9 billion in the early to mid-2010s to 3.2 billion in 205013. There is potential to reduce carbon emissions in the water sector significantly, particularly when it comes to urban water and wastewater treatments, which are critical for the safe provision of fresh water and sanitation to all. Investment in improved hydrological data, early warning systems, hydro-meteorological networks, institutional capacity, education and knowledge-sharing can also help reduce the risk of impacts to communities. There are currently 2 individual and 180 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 7 cooperative initiatives. A total of 171 actors (58 countries, 18 cities, 65 companies, 3 investors and 27 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing city-wide emissions from the water sector to measuring and minimizing risks and impacts related to water and climate change.   Human Settlements Cities and urban populations are significant drivers of climate change ­ they are currently responsible for about 75 per cent of global CO2 emissions14. In addition to energy use and buildings, urban transport systems remain a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions15, all of which are projected to increase as more people move into urban centres and push infrastructure construction, especially in fast-growing cities in developing countries. Today, more than 50 per cent of the world's population live in cities, and projections estimate that by 2050 two-thirds of the global population will live in urban areas16. Additionally, urban consumption, especially in the food, clothing, vehicles, aviation and electronics sectors, is responsible for high and growing levels of consumption-based emissions. Consumption represents as much as 10 per cent of global emissions in just 94 of the world's largest cities and could nearly double by 2050 if left unchecked17. Cities are also on the front line of climate change impacts. Heatwaves and flooding, and associated risks such as adverse impacts on health, biodiversity and water security, are already affecting cities around the globe. Population growth, rampant urbanization and growing social inequalities further exacerbate the vulnerability of city dwellers. As hubs of economic activity and intellectual capital, cities are naturally positioned to use available technologies and lead the transition to low-carbon and resilient forms of human settlement. However, city-level climate action should not be confined to mega cities, as smaller and medium-sized urban areas with fewer than one million inhabitants can account for half of all urban emission reduction potential by 203018. There are currently 858 individual and 10,800 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 24 cooperative initiatives. A total of 10,728 actors (147 countries, 10,357 cities, 74 regions, 42 companies, 17 investors and 91 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing region-wide final energy consumption and increasing efficiency to creating climate smart urban projects and enhancing resilience to climate shocks and extreme events and putting climate risk at the centre of decision making.  Transport Transport infrastructure contributes to economic growth at all levels of GDP and supports personal well-being, and social and economic development. It is also crucial to connect countries and help increase trade, economic growth and regional integration. However, the transport sector account for around 14 per cent of global GHG emissions19, and it is still 93 per cent dependent on oil20. Even with the implementation of current policy ambitions, the growth in transport demand is projected to lead to an increase of 60 per cent in transport CO2 emissions, a growth driven mainly by an increased demand for freight and non-urban passenger transport, both of which are projected to grow by 225 per cent by 205021. Currently there are a number of opportunities for mitigating urban transport emissions. However, freight, non-urban and maritime transport and aviation remain challenging as demand for these services continues to grow while limited opportunities for decarbonization exist. Adaptation measures are also necessary. Transport infrastructure is vulnerable to the effects of climate change such as the risks posed by flooding and extreme temperatures to roads, railroads, ports and harbours. There are currently 76 individual and 464 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 19 cooperative initiatives. A total of 508 actors (73 countries, 78 cities, 20 regions, 294 companies, 8 investors and 35 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing city- or region-wide emissions from transport and from airport operations to accelerating the energy transition of vehicle fleet, doubling the share of public transport and doubling vehicle fuel efficiency globally. Energy Energy production and use is the main contributor to GHG emissions and is a critical ingredient in most economic endeavours. At present, the energy sector accounts for nearly three quarters of global emissions22, but the International Energy Agency (IEA) data shows that global energy-related CO2 emissions flattened in 2019, following two years of increases. This is mostly due to the expanding role of renewable sources, fuel switching from coal to natural gas, and higher nuclear power output, but weaker global economic growth also played a role23. While these trends are promising, the transformation of the energy sector still lags behind what is necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement and sustainable development objectives. To meet the Paris goals, electricity needs to be decarbonized by 2050 and energy by the third quarter of the century. Energy efficiency needs to improve at much faster rates than has generally taken place historically. Energy infrastructure is also vulnerable to the impacts of climate change ­ for example, hot weather and water shortages have affected cooling water for nuclear plants24, and storms have damaged power cables. Hydropower plants are also directly affected by changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, as well as extreme weather events, all of which are likely to increase. Technology is key ­ the confluence of smart-energy networks, digital solutions that better allow for controlling energy demand and trade, electrification, and ample, lowcost renewable power has the potential to transform the energy sector. There are currently 313 individual and 15,206 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 49 cooperative initiatives. A total of 13,687 actors (182 countries, 10,510 cities, 75 regions, 1,877 companies, 264 investors and 779 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing local government energy consumption, and increasing the share of renewables in city- and region-wide electricity consumption to improving energy efficiency of appliances and equipment and buildings and increasing global installed capacity for geothermal power generation.  Industry The industry thematic area considers industrial activities over the entire value chain, from extraction, through manufacturing to the final demand for products and their respective services, and therefore has an essential role to play in reducing GHG emissions. Direct industrial processes are responsible for about five per cent of GHG emissions, but energy use in industry alone accounts for another 24 per cent of all global emissions25. Some of the biggest challenges lie in the major harder-to-abate sectors, such as cement, steel, chemicals, plastics and heavy-goods transport. The transition towards achieving the 1.5oC goal of the Paris Agreement requires industrial sectors to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions within themselves by mid-century26. The financial and physical assets, operations and supply chains of many businesses and industrial actors are also highly vulnerable to the effects of a changing climate, including variable temperatures and rainfall patterns, and also intensifying natural disasters. The various industry sectors each have particular challenges and opportunities in tackling climate change, which may benefit from sectoral approaches and customized solutions. Research indicates that it is technically and economically possible for hard-to-abate industrial sectors to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury at a cost to the economy of less than 0.5 per cent of global GDP, and with a minor impact on consumer living standards. A more circular economy can cut emissions from harder-to abate industrial sectors by 40 per cent27. Many industries also have the potential to bring about wider behavioural change through their impact on consumers as well as their own supply chains. There are currently 1,307 cooperative actions registered in the Portal addressing this thematic area, as well as 25 cooperative initiatives. A total of 1,109 actors (79 countries, 68 cities, 29 regions, 475 companies, 380 investors and 78 organizations) participate in initiatives with goals ranging from reducing CO2 emissions from cement production and promoting a shift in cooling technology towards natural refrigerants to setting Science Based Targets aligned with a 1.5oC trajectory and integrating climate risk into corporate value chains.   The pledges registered in the Global Climate Action Portal are not only diverse in the types of goals established, but also in terms of when they are to be achieved. Most individual targets, however, have 2030 as their target year (Figure 2).  Figure 2 Individual and cooperative actions per target year  At present, the Global Climate Action Portal does not track  progress of the commitments made. However, together with    the Camda climate action data and analysis community, work is  underway to enhance the credibility of the climate actions and  commitments registered in the Portal. At COP 25 in Madrid, a  workshop was held by Camda to establish a framework for tracking  progress of non-Party Stakeholder climate actions, resulting in a    statement communicated to the COP 25 Presidency. Associated  with this, decision 1/CP.25 Chile Madrid Time for Action requested 'the secretariat to continue engaging with non-Party stakeholders  and enhancing the effectiveness of the Non-State Actor Zone   for Climate Action platform, including the tracking of voluntary  action'.    The work has been advanced through 2020, during which priority  metrics were drafted for tracking the progress of individual  climate actions and initiatives. To help provide an assessment of   progress that goes beyond the emissions reductions achieved,  the metrics are considered in relation to a conceptual framework    that considers different types of progress, including ambition,  robustness, implementation and substantive progress. Following  stakeholder consultation, the aim is to apply the metrics and    framework to the Portal, where they will provide a greater  insight into the progress of climate actions. Further underlining the importance of developing an understanding of whether  non-Party stakeholders are achieving their emissions reduction  targets, a report, associated with the work of the Camda group,  is planned for spring 2021, which will aim to provide an aggregate  assessment on the progress of individual non-Party actors and  initiatives towards their targets.    One of the Global Climate Action Portal data partners, CDP, has    seen a substantial growth in disclosure in the past few years.  The organization is one of the longest running global disclosure    platforms for investors, companies, cities, states and regions to  manage their environmental impacts. In 2016, one year after the  implementation of the Paris Agreement, over 5,800 businesses    responded to the climate change questionnaire. In 2020, over  9,500 businesses submitted the questionnaire, representing a    64 per cent increase. The disclosure platform for cities, states  and regions will remain open until December 2020 to allow more  time for cities to disclose in what has been a difficult year due  to COVID-19. However, in 2016, 633 cities, states, and regions  disclosed data to CDP and by 2019, disclosures increased by 51  per cent, with a total of 957 cities, states and regions disclosing. In 2020, 4,921 companies (representing 51.7 per cent of those that disclosed on climate change) declared that they have an emissions reduction target. Of those, 673 have committed to set a science-based target through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi),   and 391 have already had their SBTi target approved. Nearly five years after the Paris Agreement, and the launch of the SBTi, over 1,000 companies spanning 60 countries and nearly 50 sectors, and with a combined market capitalization of over USD 15.4 trillion ­ including one-fifth of the Global Fortune 500 ­ are working with the SBTi to reduce their emissions at the pace and scale necessary. Net-Zero Pledges and the Race to Zero Campaign  Drawing the analysis from nine reporting platforms, the reports found that there was a significant increase in subnational and corporate net-zero targets in the past year, nearly doubling from late 2019 to ate 2020. As of October, subnational governments (826 cities and 103 regions) representing about 11 per cent of the global population and a GHG emissions footprint of more than 6.5 gigatonnes have committed to net-zero targets, as well as 1,565 companies, responsible for a combined revenue of over USD 12.5 trillion, and covering 3.5 gigatonnes in GHG emissions. It is worth noting that this increase happened despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn that it brought about.  As mentioned above, an ambitious level of emission reductions across all sectors is necessary in order to meet the Paris Agreement goals. While the Global Climate Action Portal provides a clear and comprehensive view of the scale of commitments, in terms of number and how they are distributed, it does not focus on mitigation outcomes. A couple of reports endorsed by the High-Level Champions as part of the Race to Zero campaign and developed by Data-Driven EnviroLab and NewClimate Institute examined the current scale of net-zero commitments from cities, regions, and business actors, and the nuances in net-zero approaches29.  Pledges may vary from sector-specific targets (i.e., buildings or specific emission scopes) to economy ­ or company-wide targets, and there are differences on the intended timelines for achieving them ­ while a few actors have already achieved their goal, most have established timelines around 2030, 2040 or 2050 for their net-zero targets. Although the regional distribution of subnational net-zero pledges is diverse (Figure 3 below), the momentum is particularly strong in Europe (with the participation of 291 cities and 39 regions, representing 36 per cent of the EU's total population), Latin  America (209 cities and five regions, covering 81 million people) and the East Asia and Pacific region (including 164 cities and 31 regions, representing over 223 million people). Participating regions in Australia alone represent over 95 per cent of the country's total population, while in North America, participating actors (27 regions and 118 cities) correspond to about 60 per cent of the region's total population. Though there are few cities in Sub-Saharan Africa with net-zero targets, those that do are often large mega-cities like Lagos, whose actions help steer national economies and emissions trajectories. The reports note that, so far, 75 per cent of subnational governments with specified targets (i.e., that have reported a percentage reduction target of at least 80 per cent and a target year of 2050 or sooner) have net-zero plans, and 36 per cent have already incorporated them into binding legislation. The reports also stress that, for these targets to be meaningful, they need to cover a large share of their actors' total GHG emissions and drive very steep reductions. The large emissions footprints of the actors examined in the reports suggest that, if their net-zero targets encompass a substantial portion of their emissions, and if they are fully implemented, these targets could have a significant impact on global and national emissions. As for the business sector, companies across a wide range of sectors have made net-zero commitments, with the services industry leading the way (290 companies, representing a combined revenue of USD 4.2 trillion), followed by manufacturing (120 companies, encompassing over USD 2.8 trillion in revenue). Although only seven companies from the energy sector have set net-zero targets, those that have, have set aggressive target years ­ with the earliest median target year at 2025. Even in sectors traditionally considered hard to abate, such as steel and cement, some actors are setting ambitious targets. The reports  show that not only are businesses pledging to decarbonize their own activities, but some are targeting emissions outside their immediate control as well, such as from their supply chain or derived from down-stream consumption. The complexities involved in setting net-zero targets, ranging from tackling indirect emissions to considering the use of offsets, are more thoroughly addressed in the report about nuances in target implementation approaches. A large part of the actors pledging net-zero emissions examined by the reports are already taking part in the Race to Zero campaign, which at the moment encompasses 23 regions, 524 cities, 1,397 businesses, 569 universities and 74 of the biggest investors aiming for zero emissions. These actors join 120 countries in the largest ever alliance committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest ­ the Climate Ambition Alliance, which was launched at the UN Climate Action Summit 2019 by the President of Chile, Sebastián Piñera. The objective of the campaign is to build momentum around the shift to a decarbonized economy, and send governments a strong signal that business, cities, regions and investors are united in meeting the Paris goals and creating a more inclusive and resilient economy. The 2020 UN Climate Ambition Summit, which takes place on 12 December to commemorate the anniversary of the Paris Agreement, will set the stage for a number of countries and non-Party stakeholders to step up ambition and announce netzero commitments. It will also host the launch of campaigns and initiatives, such as the Race to Resilience campaign, which aims to catalyze a step-change in global ambition for climate change, and the Net Zero Asset Manager, which shows how financial institutions are raising ambition.  As mentioned in the previous Chapter, 2020 is deemed a critical year for setting the world on the right path to achieve the Paris Agreement goals in time. In addition to the high level of expectation for countries to revise their NDCs and close the emissions gap, the massive scale of bushfires ravaging Australia during the 2019­2020 fire season, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought30, were a stark reminder of what is at stake. Every year, extreme events such as droughts, floods and hurricanes cost billions of dollars to the economy, in addition to the lives lost and livelihoods affected ­ and climate change is making them deadlier and costlier31. The Economist Intelligent Unit's Climate Change Resilience Index estimates an average global GDP loss of three per cent by 2050 due to climate change, with the developing world being affected the most32.  The World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual Global Risks Report has consistently ranked climate-related risks such as ""extreme weather"" and ""climate action failure"" in their top five global risks both in terms of likelihood and impact since 2011. The 15th Edition, launched in January 2020, however, was the first ever to have climate change dominate all of the top-five long-term risks by likelihood. Incidentally, the report also warned that health systems worldwide were underprepared for significant outbreaks of infectious diseases and that, while no country was found to be fully prepared to handle a potential epidemic or pandemic, 'our collective vulnerability to the societal and economic impacts of infectious disease crises appears to be increasing'33. Although the world was taken by surprise in the first few months of 2020 by the quick spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis it brought along, experts have been arguing that it should not be considered a 'black swan' ­ meaning, a high impact but extremely rare and therefore unforeseen event ­ but rather a 'gray rhino' event. The term, introduced by policy analyst Michele Wucker at the WEF in Davos in January 2013, refers to a highly probable but neglected threat with potentially enormous impact. In that, COVID-19 crisis is very similar to the climate change crisis that has been looming for decades now, and it additionally threatens to worsen the challenges that both the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development seek to address. At the core of both lies the recognition that social, environmental and economic issues are interlinked, and therefore should be tackled ­ as well as solutions be devised ­ taking all dimensions into consideration. Similarly, the complex ways in which human societies and nature  are interconnected became quite clear with the COVID-19 pandemic ­ what seemingly started as a health crisis caused by a zoonotic disease rapidly evolved into a socioeconomic crisis of global proportions, exposing the systemic vulnerabilities already referred to by the WEF report. The first and foremost challenge to be addressed is the health crisis ­ by early December, the World Health Organization had compiled over 63 million confirmed cases and nearly 1.5 million deaths reported globally as a result of the disease. Rather than a panacea, it is more likely that a combination of measures ­ vaccines, effective treatments and changes in social interaction ­ will curb the health crisis and stabilize infection and death rates34. However and whenever the end of the pandemics is officially declared, one thing is clear ­ 'business as usual' is a scenario that is unlikely to be returned to. A series of changes and adaptations that were implemented during the crisis may be incorporated into day-to-day life, affecting societies in a number of ways from here on out. This leads to another pressing challenge. An overview of the socioeconomic outcomes of COVID-19 crisis shows the alarming and profound impacts it is projected to have over the next months and years. The International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook expects a negative GDP per capita growth in 170 countries, compared to their 2019 averages, implying a    cumulative loss to the global economy of over USD 12 trillion over 2020­2021. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated global working-hour losses at 17.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019, with the lower-middle-income countries expected to be the hardest hit, showing a decline of around 23.3 per cent35. The World Bank estimates that the pandemic is likely to push between 88 and 115 million people into extreme poverty in 2020, setting back poverty reduction by around three years36. Meanwhile, the number of people experiencing food crises is projected to double, with about 270 million people in low- and middle-income countries expected to face acute food insecurity by the end of 2020. In April, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that, though the impact of COVID-19 is both immediate and dreadful, the planet's unfolding environmental crisis also poses a deep emergency37. In order to protect Earth from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption, the recovery process needs to be turned into an opportunity to tackle both challenges in tandem, and build a better future. As mentioned before, the COVID-19 crisis is not the only 'grey rhino' out there, and the climate crisis has not been put on pause while societies figure a way out of the pandemic. Throughout the year, more large-scale wildfire events spread across the Western United States, Indonesia and Brazil, driven by hotter, dryer seasons38. Meanwhile, the hurricane season is inching closer to a record-breaking year39, and 2020 is poised to be one of the warmest years to date, despite La Niña ­ a natural event which traditionally has a cooling effect on global temperatures40. The impacts of the crises are compounded by one another.  While the lockdown measures resulted in a drop of about four per cent in energy demand in the first quarter of 2020 and the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects a decline of about 8 per cent in CO2 emissions in 2020 in comparison with 2019, these numbers are to be seen with caution. First, the unprecedented nature of these declines means emissions are expected to rebound once these activities are resumed, as it happened after the economic crisis of 200841. Any such dramatic drop in annual emissions is hard to sustain without specific measures decoupling emissions from economic growth. Second, a single annual decline has little impact on the concentrations of long-lived GHGs in the atmosphere. These concentrations, the World Meteorological Organization alerts, are still on the rise42. In July 2020, flagship observatories in Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) registered CO2 concentrations of 414.38 ppm and 410.04 ppm, respectively, up from 411.74 ppm, and 407.83 ppm in July 201943. The Emissions Gap Report 2019 estimates that global emissions need to decrease by about 7.6 per cent/year between 2020 and 2030 to meet the 1.5oC goal. This means decarbonizing the economy now. By 2025, the cut needed would increase to 15.5 per cent/year, making it a lot harder to achieve44. The fact that it took a complete shock to the system to drive the emissions down to the required level shows the complexity of the task. The need to salvage and revitalize economies can finally provide the incentive to decarbonize them, all the while creating better socioeconomic outcomes and a healthier environment for all. The UN Secretary-General proposed six climate-related principles to shape these recovery plans: (1) The money to be spent on recovery from the coronavirus must deliver new jobs   and businesses through a clean, green transition; (2) Where taxpayers' money is used to rescue businesses, it needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth; (3) Fiscal firepower must drive a shift from the grey to green economy and make societies and people more resilient; (4) Public funds should be used to invest in the future, not the past, and flow to sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and the climate. Fossil fuel subsidies must end, and polluters must start paying for their pollution; (5) Climate risks and opportunities must be incorporated into the financial system, as well as all aspects of public policymaking and infrastructure; and (6) All need to work together as an international community45. According to the UN report on its comprehensive response to COVID-19, 'transforming energy systems could boost global GDP by USD 98 trillion by 2050, delivering 2.4 per cent more GDP growth than current plans. Boosting investments in renewable energy alone would add 42 million jobs globally, create health care savings eight times the cost of the investment, and prevent a future crisis'46. An analysis carried out by the We Mean Business Coalition in support of its Build Back Better campaign also showed that with the same cost to governments, a green recovery plan provides a similar immediate boost to output and employment in comparison with a reduced value-added tax (VAT) recovery plan encouraging households to resume spending, but a consistently larger impact in terms of stimulus and jobs and potentially longer-term economic benefits. By prioritizing five measures (namely, public investments in energy efficiency in buildings and upgrading electricity grids, subsidies for wind and solar power and electric vehicles, and a tree planting programme), this plan estimates CO2 emission reductions by around 7 per cent/year by 2030 (in addition to a projected reduction of two per cent/year due to COVID-19 impacts)47.  At the local level, Cities Climate Finance Leadership Alliance is completing a paper that focuses on the funding that has been announced to support a green recovery for cities since the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020, and provides recommendations for where and how to better channel future assistance for a more resilient recovery. Other stakeholders are also looking at the role of finance in promoting a green recovery. The City of London Corporation and the Green Finance Institute, supported by WEF, hosted a major summit in November (Green Horizon Summit) focusing on the role of financial services in supporting a green recovery and an economy-wide transition to net zero, and on the concrete actions and commitments financial firms need to make ahead of COP 26 in Glasgow. The Finance in Common Summit, also carried out in November, in Paris, brought together the world's Public Development Banks to discuss how to reconcile short-term countercyclical responses with sustainable recovery measures that will have a long-term impact on the planet and societies. Non-Party stakeholders have been instrumental in responding to the crisis, and in providing studies, tools and resources to help governments and other decision-makers shape a recovery that addresses challenges beyond those that are in their field of vision at the moment. The boxes below provide an overview of the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 crisis across the Marrakech Partnership thematic areas, as well as potential opportunities and resources developed by actors in those areas to help devise policies and measures that take these specific impacts and concerns into consideration in the longer term.  As a response to a call on governments to focus on a faster and fairer transition towards a sustainable economy, a number of tools and inputs are being made available to help governments and other stakeholders in shaping sustainable recovery plans. In September, the Japanese Ministry of the Environment, in cooperation with UNFCCC, launched an online platform for sustainable and resilient recovery from COVID-19 (Platform for Redesign 2020), to which non-State actors were invited to contribute. The platform collates climate and environmental policies and actions that countries are planning or already implementing in the context of recovery from COVID-19. Similarly, Carbon Brief established an interactive grid to track measures proposed, agreed and implemented by major economies around the world, including stimulus measures that have a direct bearing on climate change or energy. These measures range from planting trees and investing in better fire management in Chile and the installation of five million home solar systems in Nigeria to a 'green homes grant' voucher scheme to fund home efficiency improvements in the United Kingdom and expanding low-carbon and distributed energy systems in South Korea.   Impacts across the Marrakech Partnership Thematic Areas  As mentioned before, the COVID-19 crisis has had impacts across all levels of society. Similarly, all thematic areas defined under the Marrakech Partnership were affected in their own particular way, often in an interconnected, compounded and/or cascading manner. Impacts on the energy, transport and industry sectors were the most obvious, as lockdowns caused immediate changes in all three. In April, the IEA estimated that energy demand had fallen by about 25 per cent/ week on average in economies experiencing full lockdown, while countries with partial lockdown had an average decline of 18 per cent/week. Global energy demand declined by a total 3.8 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Electricity demand was also affected: there was a decline of 20 per cent or more during full lockdown in a number of countries, mainly due to a halt in industrial and commercial operations. This in turn resulted in a lift in the share of renewables in the electricity supply, as their output is largely unaffected by demand. In fact, not only were renewables the sole source to see a growth in demand, but the expectation is that this trend will continue, due to low operating costs, preferential access and recent growth in installed capacity. Demand for all other fuels is projected to decline48. As for transport, changes in mobility and lockdown measures caused a decline of about 50 per cent in global average road transport activity in March 2020 in comparison with 2019. The sharp decrease in air travel also resulted in a decline of 60 per cent in global aviation activity by the end of the first quarter, with some European countries experiencing a decline of more than 90 per cent49. While air cargo has also declined, freight-only flights have grown, with some passenger aircraft converted to cover for the share of cargo that it would usually carry along with passenger luggage50. The International Transport Forum (ITF) estimates that mobility restrictions could reduce global freight transport by up to 36 per cent by the end of 202051. In shipping, ITF reported a decline in global container trade volumes of 8.6 per cent in February 2020 compared to the same month of 201952. Lockdowns affected most industries, with some having to shut down almost completely, and most having to reduce activities. Small and medium -size enterprises (SMEs) were particularly affected, as they are typically more vulnerable to economic and social shocks. Impacts on businesses vary from a reduction or loss in demand and revenues, employee health concerns, liquidity shortages and disruptions in the supply chain53. As hubs of economic and social activities, human settlements were directly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Many cities around the world have locked down, with impact on local commerce, public transportation, recreational venues and healthcare systems. Residents of poor crowded areas, informal settlements and remote villages were particularly vulnerable in their exposition to the virus and/or lack of access to essential services. The socioeconomic impacts of the health crisis on urban centres, affecting urban access, equity, finances, public services, infrastructure and transport, also affected those who are more socially vulnerable disproportionally.

Areas that rely primarily on less diversified economic bases may see an even sharper decline, such as those based on tourism, for example. These financial shrinkages may in turn have a negative impact on infrastructure investments and public services, undermining broader sustainable urban development efforts54. In the land use sector, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned that the pandemic may lead to an increase in deforestation and forest degradation, since the crisis may cause people in rural areas to look for forests and forest products for subsistence, and quick financial returns and employment may be prioritized by stimulus programmes over longer-term climate and sustainability objectives. The forest sector may suffer from disruptions affecting entire value chains, but micro, small and medium enterprises ­ which account for over 50 per cent of total forest-related employment ­ and forest and farm producer organizations risk being hit the hardest, due to their lower capacity to delay spending without earnings55. The International Labour Organization (ILO) additionally notes that, as a consequence of COVID-19, many park guides and rangers lost their jobs,  leaving forests open to poaching and illegal logging. ILO also warned that the pandemic has 'exacerbated the vulnerability of indigenous and tribal peoples and other forest-dependent communities, who were already facing the consequences of climate change, deforestation, forest fires and illegal logging'. These communities tend to suffer from poorer health than the rest of the population, and often have limited access to health care56. As for the agricultural sector, COVID-19 affected all actors in the entire chain of the food system, from producers and workers to consumers. The first two are impacted by reduced production capacity, limited market access, loss of remittances and lack of employment. Consumers may experience shortages and lack of access, food price inflation and food insecurity ­ which already affected more than 820 million people before the COVID-19 crisis57. Rural communities, especially in the developing world, are largely dependent on agriculture for livelihood and food security. Urban communities including residents in informal settlements also rely heavily on fresh markets and rural-urban supply chains, and were particularly affected by disruptions in it, as well as the associated increase in food prices combined with income loss58. The COVID-19 crisis heightened the awareness of the need to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for the world's population. Access to reliable water supplies for frequent adequate handwashing is the first line of defense against the spread of the virus59. However, according to the UN, in 2017 three out of five people in the world had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water, compared with less than one out of three in least developed countries. Globally, about three billion people are still unable to properly wash their hands at home. One out of four health-care facilities in the world also lacked basic drinking water services, affecting over two billion people. Additionally, high water stress already affects billions of people in the world, with millions expected to be displaced by 2030 by intense water scarcity, heightened partly by climate change60. Global warming was already a challenge to the resilience of water and sanitation systems, in addition to other trends, such as rapid urbanization and aging infrastructure. The International Finance Corporation estimates a need to invest about USD 114 billion/year up to 2030 in developing countries to close the water sector infrastructure gap, in addition to the cost of maintaining and upgrading existing networks in the developed world. It also notes that COVID-19 is projected to slow down most investments in the water sector worldwide. In addition to that, a decline was observed in water demand by large industrial and commercial users due to lockdowns and other restrictions, which resulted in reduced revenues to water utilities, and deeper revenue loss is projected across the whole water supply chain. As a response to the crisis, and based on the importance of hygiene in reducing the spread of the virus, measures such as partial suspension of water billing for low-income users and moratoriums on water service  cut-offs were implemented around the world. As a result, water and wastewater utilities around the world expect revenue collections reductions of 15 per cent on average, which could be compensated in the medium term by well-governed markets (through installment payments of deferred amounts, government transfers, and possibly tariff adjustments). The water and sewerage industry is labour-intensive, and people working on the sector were identified by many governments as essential workers. However, the increased risk of contagion among utility staff and the necessary social distancing protocols meant that only operationally critical staff can be retained on site, which may cause disruptions to the continuity of operations62. The impacts of COVID-19 on the ocean and coastal zones are mixed. In the near term, the decrease in sectoral pressures that lead to pollution, overfishing, and habitat loss and conversion has led to a healthier environment. Participants in an informal poll conducted by The Economist in one of its World Ocean Initiative webinars ranked tourism and fisheries as the ocean sectors most impacted by the crisis, followed by offshore oil and gas, shipping, offshore renewables and aquaculture. But once these activities resume, so will the pressures, and their impact. On the other hand, the socioeconomic impact in some of these activities may linger for a long time, such as those on coastal tourism jobs and businesses. The livelihoods and food security of millions of people who depend on the ocean and coastal zones to survive may also be seriously affected in the near to mid-term63. Additionally, the UN alerted that a number of the existing global observing systems were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with impacts on the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services. This is the result of the reduction of aircraft-based observations and oceanographic research vessels being recalled to home ports, in addition to disruptions in manually operated weather stations and other setbacks. The UN expects the impacts on climate change monitoring to be long-term, which will introduce gaps in the historical time series of essential climate variables needed to monitor climate variability and change and associated impacts.   Energy Universal access to sustainable energy is one of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 (SDG 7), and the importance of reaching such goal becomes even clearer in face of a health and socioeconomic crisis. IEA published a special report on sustainable recovery, where it proposes a Sustainable Recovery Plan with three main goals: boosting economic growth, creating jobs and building more resilient and cleaner energy systems. The Plan presents over 30 sector-specific energy measures that governments can include in their economic recovery plans, focusing on cost-effective measures that could be implemented between 2021­2023. Spanning six key sectors ­ electricity, transport, industry, buildings, fuels and emerging low-carbon technologies ­ the plan would increase global GDP by 1.1 per cent in each of the next three years. It would also create nearly 9 million new energy-related jobs (mainly in construction and manufacturing) over the same period, and result in a reduction of annual energy-related GHG emissions of 4.5 billion tonnes in 2023 in comparison with what they would be otherwise. Air pollution emissions would also decrease by five per cent as a result of the plan, reducing health risks around the world. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) also published a report, titled the Post-COVID Recovery, an Agenda for Resilience, Development and Equality, where it posits that an accelerated energy transition could add 5.5 million more jobs by 2023, employing people in all regions of the world, even where fossil-fuel jobs are now concentrated. Immediate investment increases could put renewable power generation on track to grow five times faster, and each million dollars invested in renewables or energy flexibility would create at least 25 jobs, while each million invested in efficiency would create about 10 jobs. Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), an organization working in the intersection of SDG 7 and the Paris Agreement, has also launched a series of regional guides addressing how countries can `Recover Better', prioritizing clean energy investments in their recovery plans and stimulus packages and helping reset their economies and close energy access gaps. Transport As stated by ITF, 'Intervention to support aviation during the crisis will need to be compatible with the long-term policy objectives of fostering efficient aviation markets and meeting agreed climate change mitigation targets'. While the Forum projects a serious decline in future demand for air travel, and the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, it also notes that neither will have significant and durable impacts on CO2 emissions from the sector. ITF mentions some of the sector existing measures to reduce emissions, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization's  (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and work on biofuels. Additionally, it suggests prioritization of technological innovation in government support for aircraft manufacturing for post-COVID-19 recovery, warning that 'aid to the sector must align with existing sectoral policies to increase social welfare outcomes, both in terms of environmental impacts and consumer benefits'65. Likewise, state support packages to help the maritime sector to deal with the negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis should align with broader public policy objectives66. Industry In a publication about the consequences of COVID-19 for the decade ahead, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) notes that recovery packages should be structured so as to ensure the most vulnerable members of society get the best deal, and in the context of business, that means prioritizing the interests of workers and SMEs. It also posits that investments should ideally be used to kickstart the decarbonization of economies, and create jobs in the process67. The WBCSD has a dedicated page on COVID-19 response programme aimed at helping address the crisis and support the critical role of business through projects focusing on employee health and business recovery, vital supply chains, and the long-term impacts of the crisis. WEF has established a COVID Action Platform, focused on galvanizing the global business community for collective action, protecting people's livelihoods and facilitating business continuity, and mobilizing cooperation and business support for the COVID-19 response. ILO has a policy brief providing guidance to companies on good practices on restructuring in response to the COVID-19 crisis, consistent with the provisions of international labour standards. Human Settlements In a report on challenges and opportunities post-COVID-19, WEF notes that many of the most able and agile responses to the crisis came from municipal governments. It also observed that a number of cities around the world are rethinking their design so as to make sure they are more sustainable and inclusive, taking into consideration present and future threats so as to implement resilient models. The report posits that the pandemic will 'trigger enduring changes to the built-space, city plans, building codes and the rules governing city life everywhere', and that 'cities that pivot to resilience, focus on their most vulnerable and adopt a zero-tolerance for inequality will be the ones that survive and thrive in the 21st century'68.   19 Chapter 2 Impacts of the COVID-19 Crisis  The UN published a Policy Brief in June addressing how cities can take conscious policy choices with respect to inequalities, local capacities and a green, inclusive recovery to manage the crisis and emerge as hubs of energy, resilience and innovation. The Under2 Coalition launched a report in October (Building back greener) collecting case studies from state and regional governments on how they are seizing the opportunity to recover better, even while dealing with the effects of a devastating crisis. The C40 network of cities has created an implementation guide on 'How to build back better with a 15-minute city' to encourage cities working on COVID-19 recovery revive urban life safely and sustainably. Land Use Another Policy Brief launched by the UN focused on Food Security and Nutrition, and how to avoid some of the worst impacts of the pandemic on the sector while supporting the necessary green transition. The Brief suggests sets of priority actions to address the immediate, near- and medium-term needs to protect people during and beyond the crisis, and ultimately to reshape and build resilient food systems. FAO has set a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme aimed at addressing the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic in a proactive and sustainable manner. It encompasses a series of policy tools aimed at supporting policy analyses and assessing the impact of COVID-19 on food and agriculture, value chains, food prices, and food security across the globe. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs developed a Policy Brief which highlights the opportunities provided by investing in sustainable forest management and forestry jobs in green recovery plans, and proposes recommendations to ensure that forest-based solutions are considered in such plans. Water The changes in water use observed during the COVID-19 pandemic pinpoint the need for water resources management capacity to respond to sudden shocks, while addressing the longer-term adaptation to climate-related impacts on water resource availability and demand. Resilient and financially robust water and wastewater utilities are in a better position to deal with future climate and health related shocks. There is an opportunity for decision-makers to reprioritize the water sector both in terms of investment and policies, including increased investments in digital solutions, such as automation and remote-control processes, that could help improve efficiency and quality of water and sanitation services69.  The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), in collaboration with UNICEF, has mapped some of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) initiatives implemented by various countries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also established a website dedicated to offer short- and longterm advice for governments, regulators and utilities in how to respond to the COVID-19 crisis in the water and sanitation sector. The UN High-Level Experts and Leaders Panel (HELP) on water and disasters released a set of Principles on how to address water-related disaster risk reduction (DRR) under COVID-19. The aim is to offer practical advice to stakeholders, such as political leaders and managers of DRR and COVID-19, on how to prepare and respond to avoid magnified impacts due to cooccurring disasters. Oceans and Coastal Zones WEF proposes five ways in which the ocean can contribute to a green post-COVID recovery, highlighting opportunities for equitable, ecological and economically attractive growth from food production and sustainable fisheries to renewable energy. These proposed interventions can also catalyze the growth of future industries and provide jobs, setting ocean economy on a sustainable path, while significantly reducing their carbon footprint. The High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy launched a report in July (A Sustainable Ocean Economy for 2050) that builds on a previous report on 'the Ocean as a Solution to Climate Change' to showcase the opportunities of a blue recovery, as stakeholders such as policymakers, financial institutions and local communities seek to reset, rebuild and enhance resilience in a post-COVID-19 world. This research finds that investing USD 2 to 3.7 trillion globally across four key areas ­ conserving and restoring mangrove habitats, scaling up offshore wind production, decarbonizing international shipping, and increasing the production of sustainably sourced ocean-based proteins ­ from 2020 to 2050 would generate USD 8.2 to 22.8 trillion in net benefits, a rate of return on investment of 450­615 per cent. Resilience The Climate and Development Knowledge Network (CDKN), the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) and the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) have initiated the Voices from the Frontline project, under which a coalition of grassroots organizations and knowledge partners have come forward to document the challenges and solutions emerging from community-led responses to the COVID-19 crisis. These lessons shine a light on how local communities are self-organizing to combat the spread of the virus and supporting the most vulnerable within their communities. They may also help to identify how these can be used to build climate resilience, and at the same time deliver wider benefits, for example in terms of food security.   Yearbook of Global Climate Action 2020 Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action  Crises are moments of profound change. But they can also be used as a lesson on how to improve and avoid other crises, especially those that are already on the horizon. As Michele Wucker summed up, 'The important part [of a grey rhino event] is that it gives you a choice ­ either you get trampled, or you hop on the back of the rhino and use the crisis as an opportunity'70. In this sense, this unprecedented crisis can provide the opportunity to shift to a more resilient and prosperous world. This is the moment to devote time to a more thorough analysis of how future public and private spending can be directed towards more sustainable measures, which will accrue far larger long-term benefits and stability at all levels. Besides the sectoral opportunities provided above, three main recommendations enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development can help provide guidance on how to address the compounding crises and reach the goals both frameworks seek to achieve:  Seek Balance  The increase in highly transmissible zoonotic diseases has a direct correlation with the instability caused by the encroachment of human activities in natural systems. About 75 per cent of new infectious diseases affecting humans come from animals, and the drivers for this emergence are usually human changes to the environment, such as land use change and loss of habitat, which cause closer interaction between wildlife and human settlements72. But the increased incidence of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases is just one facet of the problem. The excesses in human activities ­ that is, our collective ecological footprint ­ are collapsing the Earth's capacity. We are currently using the equivalent to 1.6 Earths per year in ecological resources and services, exhausting our global budget way before the Earth can regenerate.  Enhance Cooperation  One thing to take from the COVID-19 crisis is the immense capacity human systems have for cooperation during times of distress. People and communities around the world rallied to help one another. Scientists and professionals from diverse fields collaborated in a number of studies to tackle some of the challenges posed by the pandemic. Local and regional governments partnered up not only with their own federal-level governments, but also with other countries, academia, businesses and institutions at each and every level to provide for safety equipment, medical resources and other solutions, such as the development of vaccines.  As Professor Ngaire Woods pointed out in her article for WEF's 'Challenges and Opportunities in the Post-COVID-19 World', global leaders in the 1940s understood that cooperation was the key to rebuild from two World Wars interspersed by an unprecedented economic recession ­ a lesson learned from their previous failure to do so right after the First World War. Redeveloping a global economy within which every country can recover and grow requires cooperative planning, putting aside geopolitical differences to fight a common enemy71.  Stressing one of the key messages from the UN Comprehensive Response report, it will take a concerted effort to chart a course out of the COVID-19 crisis and towards a better future, and in order to do so, it will be necessary to strengthen the structures for cooperating at the global level so that we are better prepared for the next such crisis.  The imbalances in how we are using the natural systems are also translated into imbalances in how the Earth population is impacted. The most vulnerable in society are the first to suffer the consequences, and in a disproportionate manner. This became clear during the COVID-19 pandemic as well ­ the poor, the elderly and the infirm are at higher risk of infection and the socioeconomic impacts of the crisis. Women are also affected the harder during any economic crisis, as they tend to earn less, have fewer savings, have less access to social protections, occupy the larger proportion in the informal economy and are more likely to take on unpaid care and domestic work. They also make up 70 per cent of all health workers and first responders, but earn less for the same job73. These economic vulnerabilities are partly the reason women are also at higher risk from the impacts of climate change74. It should be noted that, in addition to potential future pandemics, the impacts of climate change on health will also lead to spillovers, such as increased number of deaths by malaria, diarrhea and heat stress, for example. As it is the case with other adverse impacts, the poorest and most vulnerable will be affected the most75. The fact is that the pandemic has both deepened and exposed pre-existing global imbalances on all fronts. For instance, while income inequality has increased in some countries and declined in others in the past few decades, globally, income and wealth are increasingly concentrated at the top ­ meaning the richest one per cent of the population now own half the world's total wealth. And though inequality among countries has been declining in relative terms, there are still sharp differences among some countries and regions. The average income of people living in Northern America is 16 times higher than that of people in sub-Saharan Africa, for example76. With the pandemic's socioeconomic hit to global growth, however, poverty levels are increasing and inequality is accelerating between and within countries. The poorer parcels of the world population are bearing the brunt of the crisis ­ both   21 Chapter 2 Impacts of the COVID-19 Crisis  in developing and developed countries. While over 44 million people lost their jobs in the United States (US) between April and June 2020, for instance, the country's top billionaires saw an increase in wealth of 26 per cent. In fact, during this period, the combined wealth of US billionaires actually increased to a total of USD 3.6 trillion ­ considerably more than the entire wealth of all 54 countries on the African continent77. As pointed out in WEF's report on challenges and opportunities in the post-COVID-19 world, 'Our chain is only as strong as its weakest link'78. A recovery process that is truly sustainable and transformative has to address the systemic imbalances that exacerbates our vulnerabilities to present and future shocks, so that we can build healthier societies.  Build Resilience  Resilience is a concept that is not only very familiar, but also quite dear to the climate community. It perfuses all thematic areas of the Marrakech Partnership and it features strongly in the Climate Action Pathways that are the subject of the next chapter. The concept of climate resilience varies, but can largely be understood as the ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events, trends, or disturbances related to climate79.  The concept of building resilience as a way to cope with disturbances is also being progressively incorporated into other areas, and linked with other mechanisms traditionally used to address potential threats and prevent crises, such as risk management procedures80 and asset valuations. The WBCSD predicts that the costs associated with transition and physical climate risks will be a natural requirement by financial markets, for example81.  In order to build resilience to any shock successfully, it is necessary to go beyond short-term solutions and think in the longer term. When put into the perspective of likely future disasters instead of eventual ones, for example, the cost-effectiveness of a range of measures that would otherwise seem too expensive may be perceived more positively.  In consonance with this approach, the WBCSD has also launched an Issue Brief specifically focusing on how companies can build greater long-term resilience through improved approaches to corporate risk management, human and social capital, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) information, aimed at better preparing for future events and disruptions.  As one of its recommendations, the Brief notes businesses should accept that a company's resilience encompasses ecosystems, communities, economies, the rule of law, effective governance and governments, and more. It also warns that collaboration ­ with peers, partners, governments and regulators, for example ­ is  crucial to achieving long-term resilience, and that 'even the best-run organizations will not be able to successfully tackle and survive disruptions while operating in a flawed and fundamentally unsustainable system'82. Building greater resilience at all levels of society, as it turns out, will depend on a better cooperation among actors and a more balanced relationship of humans within our natural and social systems. This will ultimately be the key for our transition into a more equitable, resilient and sustainable world. An important lesson learned from COVID-19 is how much we depend on each other for our health systems, as well as for our food systems and supply chains. This dependency further emphasises the need for cooperation and multilateralism as the way forward. In particular, it underlines the importance of the Marrakech Partnership in the context of helping the world to recover better by ensuring a bridge between Parties and non-Party stakeholders to amplify and intensify the climate action needed at this moment. The High-Level Champions are working on innovative ways to cooperate, such as greater participation in the Marrakech Partnership with a broader regional distribution, facilitated by virtual connectivity. The Race to Zero campaign is an example of how to promote a more ambitious level of cooperation. In parallel, in understanding the importance of building resilience and reducing risks in both the COVID-19 and climate crises, the Champions will also launch a sister campaign focused on resilience. In order for this recovery to be sustainable, it is essential to transition to a fairer and more resilient society. The Climate Action Pathways, which will be discussed in the next chapter, outline the actions needed to achieve a world that is resilient and in line with the 1.5oC limit. More than just seeking to reduce emissions, the actions delineated by the Pathways aim to be in balance with the natural systems. It is now crucial for stakeholders to pivot and put nature at the heart of their organizations. COP 26 has been postponed due to COVID-19. This interruption may have seemed to have slowed the negotiations, but it has not halted action ­ especially from non-Party stakeholders. On the contrary, despite the impacts from the COVID-19 crisis, a large number of non-Party stakeholders are determined to build back better by investing in more resilient and more sustainable action. The commitment of these stakeholders to a green resilient recovery can provide a blueprint and great encouragement for Parties to follow suit, and use this extra year to catalyze action on the road to the COP. Inspired by the solidarity and cooperation among actors that this crisis has shown possible, there is hope for a healthier and safer path not just to Glasgow but to a better future.

Chapter 23 Chapter 3 Looking Forwards  Looking Forwards  The Climate Action Pathways  The Climate Action Pathways are a vital part of the Marrakech Partnership tools to enhance climate action and ambition towards fully implementing the Paris Agreement. First launched in 2019, they set out sectoral visions for achieving a 1.5oC resilient world in 2050, with overarching transformational milestones, and key impacts that need to be achieved to realize them. The Pathways are the result of the consolidated work, outcomes and recommendations throughout the year of the Marrakech Partnership and related forums under the leadership of the HighLevel Champions. As such, they are intended as living documents, to be updated periodically with the latest information and lessons learned as the state of climate action evolves.  For this year, the Champions' vision was to update the actions and milestones needed for system transformations within sectors, by also focusing on the synergies and interlinkages across the thematic and cross-cutting areas, thereby assisting all actors to take an integrated approach. The 2020 Pathways aim to provide a roadmap to help Parties and non-Party stakeholders alike to identify actions needed by 2021, 2025, 2030 and 2040 as steps to get to the 2050 vision. The 2020 Pathways incorporate insights about the exponential nature of the necessary systemic and technological change. The Pathways use the same thematic approach as the Marrakech Partnership to help coordinate climate action across every thematic area, thus maximizing the opportunities for cooperation and accelerated progress. It recognizes that all stakeholders need to work together to effect real and lasting change, and acknowledges that each stakeholder group has something unique to bring. Within the context of the Pathways, these stakeholders can be broadly defined as policymakers (national, subnational, local), business and service providers, financial institutions, technology providers and innovators and civil society. The 2020 Pathways anticipate that the transition to net zero will occur through exponential change. The term `exponential' helps capture the speed of change expected (i.e. very rapid) as well as the nature of that change (i.e. non-linear). The image of a hockey-stick is often used to illustrate the very sudden and sharp shift in trajectory that exponential change brings. It breaks with conventional notions of step-by-step, consequential change, replacing it instead with something altogether more dramatic and urgent.  For the High-Level Champions, the best image to illustrate exponential change is that of an S Curve. The shape of the ""S"" captures the exponential course they envision for the net zero transition; namely, moments of slow or imperceptible change followed by periods of dramatic progress. The snaking curve of the ""S"" figure illustrates that the nature of the change ahead will not only be non-linear but is also likely to be multi-stage. This reflects the existence of many potential catalysts for change, which may not necessarily be triggered at the same time. As each catalyst emerges, so new momentum and energy will be given to the transition process. Exponential, non-linear change has been central to all major shifts in human history - think of the shift from horse and cart to the automobile, or from coal power to gas, for example. Exponential change is also increasingly how change occurs on a digitally-connected planet of inter-dependent economies and cross-cutting systems of government. Ripple effects no longer undulate, they surge. The Pathways set out to help identify and mobilize precisely these kinds of breakthrough moments or `tipping points'. These can potentially emerge from top-down changes, such as the introduction of new public policies and a shift in investment patterns, or from bottom-up phenomena, such as consumer pressure and technological innovation. The Pathways make provision for both eventualities.   Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action  While each of the individual Pathways addresses a specific thematic area, they are intentionally designed to be in continual conversation with one another. This is because each Pathway area is, in reality, a sub-system of an overarching and interconnected macro-system. Fixing one sub-system in isolation will not deliver the net-zero world we need; we require all these sub-systems to be fixed and working in concert. The Pathways are therefore best seen as playing an interactive role, with changes in one thematic area facilitating or accelerating change in another. Below are some illustrative examples: » Transport liquid fuels: The Energy Pathway sets out a vision for the production of 652 billion litres per year of advanced liquid biofuels. For this breakthrough measure to stick it will require demand. Hence, the milestones laid out in the Transport Pathways for carbon-intensive transport industries such as aviation and shipping to shift away from fossil fuels and to adopt more sustainable alternatives. » Low-carbon mining: The Industry Pathway anticipates a substantial uptake in renewable energy by mining companies and metal producers. Ideally, for example, 50 per cent of electricity consumed by mine operators around the world will be zero-emission by 2030. This feeds into the phased increase in renewable power generation foreseen in the Energy Pathway, which includes a milestone of 60 per cent of all electric power coming from zero-carbon sources by the same date.  » Zero-emission fleets: One of the significant strands to the retail sector's net zero transition is to reduce the footprint of its transport fleets. The Industry Pathway sets a course for retailers to have 100 per cent zero-carbon fleets of light goods vehicles by 2030 and heavy goods vehicles by 2040. Retailers are not automakers, however, which is why the Transport Pathway's inclusion of the need for vehicle manufacturers to phase out combustion engine models is so important. Likewise, its plans for the full electrification of rail should accelerate retailers' efforts to achieve net-zero transport emissions. The Champions and the Marrakech Partnership community also set out key guidelines for the development of the 2020 Pathways. Namely, they should be: Ambitious: Every Pathway makes provision for self-reinforcing feedback. This is seen most clearly in the attention given to positive demand signals. These signals take many different forms, from large corporate buyers expressing a preference for low-carbon freight to citizen groups increasing their leisure use of restored coastal zones. These actions have the effect, either direct or indirect, of encouraging other stakeholders to act. Whoever the intended audience, the intention is to apply the push-pull logic of demand and supply to build a virtuous circle of support for net-zero action.  » Sustainable coastal communities: The Oceans and Coastal Zones Pathway sets out an ambitious strategy for increasing the resilience and adaptive capacity of coastal communities. Part of this will be achieved by nature-based solutions, such as the restoration of salt marshes, seagrasses and other coastal landscapes. This dovetails with the vision laid out in the Land Use Pathway, which sets out a goal of restoring at least 200 million hectares of degraded land between 2020 by 2030. The two Pathways also concur in the key role that citizen groups have to play in both informing and delivering these land-based solutions. » Waste-free cities: Waste is a major cause of unnecessary energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, the driving ambition of the Human Settlements Pathway to create zero-waste cities. This includes goals to reduce and ultimately eliminate the release of waste pollutants into urban water courses. This will only be possible if urban water management is radically improved. Fortunately, this is a central goal of the Water Pathway, which sets the ambition for governments around the world to integrate urban wastewater management into their NDCs by 2025. Similarly, it envisions a transition to aerobic technologies such as composting toilets, a boon for cities in low-income countries where use of nonflush latrines is still widespread. In turn, this also supports the ambition of the Resilience Pathway to improve the resilience of 600 million slum dwellers by 2030.  Resilient: As mentioned in the previous Chapter, building resilience is of the utmost importance to ensure a safer and sustainable future. Nation states and other stakeholders face demands on all sides, from support for economic recovery and environmental conservation to the provision of social mobility and global security. The measures laid out in the Pathways rest on a belief that transitioning to net zero can help deliver multiple outcomes. Climate action is not an 'either-or' equation, in other words; a net-zero system should be as anti-exclusion and pro-prosperity system as it is climate-safe. A good example of resilience's many virtues is the Pathway's promotion of a more circular use of raw materials. Not only will a more circular approach to manufacturing and consumption decrease emissions, it will also create green jobs, protect biodiversity, and improve the security of future supply. Adaptable: Despite the clear milestones and sense of direction provided by the Pathways, they should not be seen as rigid or immutable. Transitioning to net zero is a dynamic affair. Actors need to be able to adapt in light of events. Such events could take the form of breakthrough technologies, for instance, or unexpected shocks like the current COVID-19 pandemic. With this in mind, the Pathways leave space within their overarching transition strategies for fresh innovation and responsive decision-making.   Science-based: Reflecting the science-oriented nature of the Paris Agreement, the Champions ensured scientific rigor in the Climate Action Pathways by receiving feedback from scientists to the draft. The milestones included in the Pathways, for example, are aligned with the end goal of keeping average temperature rise within 1.5oC and achieve climate resilience. The measures suggested are also strongly grounded in existing scientific observation and analysis. This same commitment to scientific rigor extends to the more cutting-edge proposals included in the Pathways.  Experimental: As with any innovation process, the transition to net zero involves a degree of experimentalism. This is often where breakthrough moments occur. Yet, such experimentation is always conceived within the judicious parameters of the scientific and evidence-based method. By their very nature, the viability of proposed solutions is difficult to assess ex-ante to bring them to fruition. A solution may appear hugely impactful on paper, only to prove ineffective when applied in practice. This has to do not only with the efficacy of the solution itself, but the wider context in which it is deployed. Many factors need to sync up for a tipping point to be reached. Early experimentation in real-world conditions is therefore essential. Hence, the injunction in most of the Pathways to carry out large-scale pilots for high-potential solutions. The lessons and insights from these pilots can then inform a wider roll-out.  Equitable: The Pathways are universal in scope and holistic in vision. They seek the optimal result for the entire planet and for society as a whole. At the same time as being more climate-secure, a net-zero world is one that is more inclusive, more prosperous, and fairer for all. That said, the Champions express a particular concern for those most affected by the impacts of climate change. For this reason, a number of measures place special emphasis on protecting the lives and livelihoods of at-risk populations, many of whom are already vulnerable from pre-existing social, environmental or economic factors.     For the High-Level Champions, the chief ambition is for the Pathways to help normalize the idea of a net-zero future. The goal of achieving a 1.5o C climate-resilient world is already a political reality. As this fact takes root and net zero becomes understood as our common destiny, so momentum will build and opportunities for collective action will increase.  Achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement requires us to undertake a major transition, from where we are today to where we need to be by 2050. The journey is challenging and time is short. For both these reasons, it is vital that we have a clear map of the route ahead. The Climate Action Pathways are that map. They lay out a shared plan for arriving at the future destination we have collectively agreed upon; namely, the creation of a climate-resilient world based on achieving a 1.5oC future.  It is the Champions' hope that climate trailblazers will be inspired by the Pathways to take bold steps towards achieving the various milestones. Not only will this make a direct difference, but it will also encourage others to see climate action as the unavoidable response to the challenges we face. Similarly, by embracing the Pathways' vision for change, the signal goes back to decision-makers that demand for climate solutions is strong. In these ways, ambition spreads and aspiration level rise.   At its twenty-fifth session, the Conference of the Parties (COP) acknowledged the important role of non-Party stakeholders, welcomed the continuation of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and decided to continue appointing High-Level Champions until 2025, requesting the Champions to explore ways to improve work under the Marrakech Partnership for enhancing ambition. In response to this request, the High-Level Champions have been conducting a robust and thorough process for the past year, and will continue to do so in 2021. Despite the delay in COP 26 due to COVID-19, the work of the Marrakech Partnership and the High-Level Champions was on full speed in 2020. Building on work carried out last year with the launch of the Climate Ambition Alliance and the first version of the Climate Action Pathways, the Marrakech Partnership stakeholders and the Champions have continued to ramp up work across all sectors and with all types of actors. As laid out in the work programme for 2020-2021, the High-Level Champions have focused on: significantly increasing non-Party commitments and action toward achieving a resilient net-zero economy through the Race to Zero campaign ­ and the development of a sister campaign, Race to Resilience; working with a diverse range of influential actors within and across sectors to clarify and align around a shared vision and roadmap to achieve net zero; fostering collaboration in support of the concrete actions needed from Parties and non-Party stakeholders to activate the ambition loop in order to trigger the rapid systemic change needed to achieve the Paris Agreement goals; and amplifying the progress and evidence of this exponential transformation already underway. Through vitalized collaboration among Parties and non-Party stakeholders, across and within sectors and through all levels of government, the High-Level Champions intend to drive systemic breakthroughs in all major sectors, targeting breakthroughs in at least ten sectors in 2021. Doing so requires identifying key actors, aligning them around a shared vision, and getting a critical mass across the system to commit to doing their part. Chapter 3 Looking Forwards  To comply with the COP 25 request, the High-Level Champions also conducted an open process to gather feedback, including 42 written submissions from Parties, groups of Parties (representing in total more than 100 Parties), non-Party stakeholders and meetings with negotiating groups. They have also received input and feedback through informal discussions with hundreds of stakeholders, and have been learning by doing together throughout the year ­ all of which has begun to crystallize a vision for how best to strengthen the Global Climate Action Agenda to be a driver of action in the short-term, to ensure the Paris Agreement long-term goals are met. A number of core themes and messages have emerged clearly in the feedback and discussions:  Be Bold.   The time is now to move into implementation, accelerate progress  and work together to raise ambition for driving down emissions,  building resilience and scaling up finance. The science is clear,  the Paris framework has set a clear direction, the negotiations of  the rulebook are progressing to be completed, there is no time  to waste, and there is support from all sides to strengthen the  Marrakech Partnership into a central driver of implementation  and action.  Innovate.  Parties and non-Parties alike have expressed their support for  innovation and change, recognizing the shift into a new phase  of the climate crisis and our collective response to it. While  feedback on the Marrakech Partnership' activities over the past  five years has been positive, it was mentioned that the Champions  must be creative and innovative on the look ahead, to ensure  the Marrakech Partnership is updated and fit-for-purpose at this  critical time.  Increase inclusion and diversity.  A broader diversity of actors should be meaningfully and  consistently involved. It is clear that more involvement and  representation from developing countries and an updated  structure that empowers local actors in all regions, connecting  them to each other and to the global structure, are needed.  Establish a sustained, coherent structure.  Many have identified the need for a more permanent and  predictable infrastructure to support continuity of implementation  and foster genuine and sustained solutions-oriented collaboration  among Parties and non-Party stakeholders. The Marrakech  Partnership must support working together in a regular rhythm  throughout the year and around the world to drive real action  on the ground.  Strengthen accountability, tracking and narrative.  There were repeated calls to the global climate action community  to help provide a widely understood and shared sense of progress,  both to ensure accountability and build a stronger and compelling  narrative around opportunity and leadership, what is working  and where, and how all the activity and action comes together  toward a common goal, including contributing substantively and  constructively to the global stocktake.  Strengthen Party and non-Party connection.  Successful implementation of the Paris Agreement depends  on all actors coming together. The Marrakech Partnership is a  unique and important bridge between Parties and non-Parties,  and both are asking that it be set up to do more to help bring  them together. The High-Level Champions are being called to help  link the growing momentum and action in the non-negotiation  space more directly in support of NDCs, National Adaptation  Plans (NAPs), and long-term strategies' implementation and  enhancement. These instruments can also be helpful in driving a  green resilient recovery.   Improving the Marrakech Partnership to Drive Action It is clear that the Marrakech Partnership is a unique platform to foster collaboration, align influential actors around a shared vision to galvanize action and drive truly systemic change across the economy, as is the role of the High-Level Champions. As the formal space for non-Party stakeholders in the UNFCCC process, it must serve as a bridge between Parties and non-Parties to accelerate the positively reinforcing ambition loop on both sides, enabling them to accelerate the collective implementation of the Paris Agreement. The mandate of the High-Level Champions and the Marrakech Partnership have been extended through 2025, a critical period in which there is a need to see a step change in climate action and progress in order to get on track to limit warming to 1.5oC. The improved, evolved and updated Marrakech Partnership must be a key enabler of that step change, starting on the road to COP 26 in 2021 and carrying us to this decisive decade of implementation.  off for the decade of delivery with a COP 26 that is energized, inclusive and solutions-oriented, and that sets increased ambition and bold action. The core principles around which the Champions are organizing the breakthrough approach to a stronger and nimbler architecture that serves as the backbone for climate action globally, regionally and locally have the following guidelines: Be guided by science ­ To limit warming to 1.5oC and curb the impacts of climate change, scientific evidence dictates a carbon neutral world should be achieved by 2050 at the latest. As such, the goal of a net-zero resilient world is the guiding star of the Champions' work, and the base of their definition for ambition, as the Race to Zero and Race to Resilience campaigns show. Take a systems approach ­ In order for increased ambition and bold action to be realized, common pathways must be defined, relevant actors must be mapped ­ as well as potential barriers and enablers ­ and all levers should be utilized to push for change.  As the UN Secretary General says, there is a need to enter a new era of ""inclusive multilateralism"". Now is the time to build and refine a new infrastructure for ambitious climate action that will steadily build momentum across the economy. Improving the Marrakech Partnership is not only about updating the governance or structure of this work stream. The High-Level Champions' aim is to contribute to the Parties for a step change in the way the world comes together to address climate change, connecting the massive movement of global climate action underway with the formal process under UNFCCC. The Champions intend to kick  Foster vitalized collaboration ­ Any potential divides should be bridged, so as to best connect actors within and across systems and support them where they need it most, facilitating coordination, reducing fragmentation and bringing new initiatives together.   Drive exponential change ­ Analyses around the pace and shape of technological change should be used as examples to ensure that the Climate Action Pathways and any other plans are informed by a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of exponential growth that drive the diffusion and deployment of technologies and solutions. Similarly, sectoral S curves defining the technology adoption rates needed to deliver sectoral pathways should be provided to encourage more ambitious action.    Accelerate the ambition loop ­ Aligning non-Party stakeholders with the ambition mechanisms of the Paris Agreement can help accelerate the positive feedback loop in which bold government policies and non-Party stakeholder leadership reinforce each other, and together they can take climate action to the next level. Likewise, it is important to strengthen the support from the nonstate actor community to Parties so that they can identify and accelerate opportunities for ambition enhancement. Maximize diversity and inclusion ­ Bringing in all actors from across sectors and society, and from around the world in a transparent way will ensure inclusive and creative problem solving, in a platform where all feel safe, empowered and have a role to play. Looking ahead to the Global Stocktake in 2023, already next year the High-Level Champions intend to develop and put into practice a strong, objective, transparent and replicable process for assessing the state of systems transformation in key sectors with clear linkages to NDCs and the needs of Parties. This is to ensure that the non-Party stakeholders provide concrete and actionable information into the stocktake, and align themselves around opportunities to accelerate progress and support increased ambition in the next five year cycle. The first such `non-Party stakeholder stocktake of progress' should be published ahead of COP 26 and become a key annual deliverable of the Marrakech Partnership.  The High-Level Champions are also planning to review and refresh criteria for participation in the Marrakech Partnership that embeds alignment with a 1.5 oC resilient future, and update governance focused on science-based ambition, inclusive, vitalized collaboration and solutions oriented-convenings and work programs. The decade ahead will be crucial for achieving the Paris Agreement goals ­ a small and closing window in which the need for urgent action can still be met in time, if collective action is taken swiftly and with shared purpose and direction. This calls for leadership in all corners of society. The Marrakech Partnership and the Champions can and must provide a core and go-to space in which that leadership can converge, collaborate and execute together. In order for this to happen, the High-Level Champions look forward to continuing to work closely with Parties and non-Party stakeholders to refine this vision and develop a concrete plan in the early part of 2021.  The Champions intend to create an open source set of supporting tools and progress indicators, building on the Marrakech Partnership Climate Action Pathways, in order to scale up support to Parties in their development and implementation of enhanced NDCs, NAPs, and long-term strategies, around which the climate action community can align and organize their work, including collaboration with financial institutions and policymakers.  They also aim to create a renewed architecture for the Marrakech Partnership that establishes an agile, but durable infrastructure, with a balance representation around the world, supporting the work of implementation of the Paris Agreement, bridging between Parties and non-Party stakeholders throughout the year. For this agile, durable and balanced architecture to be possible, it should include a sustainable and predictable support infrastructure in the UNFCCC secretariat and in the Champions team to assist the High-Level Champions and the Marrakech Partnership. Support should also be provided in underrepresented regions to amplify connectivity and work throughout the year in support of nonParty stakeholders working on climate action. The intention is not to duplicate existing non-Party initiatives and work, but to add value and provide the central backbone around which the community can organize itself through shared system-wide goals and pathways, address gaps and to strengthen connectivity between Champions year on year so each Champion can hit the ground running.

""The G20 are some of the biggest economies on the planet ­ what they do will make or break the world's ability to tackle the climate crisis. They must listen to the voices of their people, especially of their future generations, who will inherit the
consequences of actions ­ or inactions ­ of G20 leaders.""
Executive

Summary

The world will not be able to tackle the climate crisis without bold action by the world's largest economies. The Group

of 20 (G20), made up of 19 countries and the European

Union, account for over 80% of global gross domestic product

(GDP), 60% of the world's population, and more than 75% of

global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The G20 countries also have immense

impacts across sectors, including 90% of global vehicle sales, 75% of the global

potential for renewables between 2010 and 2030, 60% of the world's agricultural land,

and 80% of world's trade in agricultural products. Given the breadth of their impact, the

actions that G20 governments take to tackle the climate crisis will be critical to the future

of the planet.

In the run-up to the G20 Summit in Rome, and ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the University of Oxford are publishing the G20 Peoples' Climate Vote.

The G20 Peoples' Climate Vote polled over 689,000 people across 18 of the G20 countries from October 2020 until June 2021. This includes over 302,000 young people under the age of 18. It leverages, an innovative survey methodology using mobile gaming networks. The margin of error of the results is on average +/- 2%.

In some countries, it is the first time that the voices of young people ­ who in many countries will be entering the workforce, reaching voting age, and engaging more in civic life in just a few years ­ are heard on climate change. This means the survey has significant value as a predictor of where public opinion is headed on climate policy. It also indicates where stronger efforts to educate the public may be required. .

The G20 and the Climate Emergency
· On average, across the G20 countries surveyed, 65% of adults thought that climate
change is a global emergency, compared with 35% who disagreed. Perception of a climate emergency was higher among under-18s, at 70%. This indicates broad public support for G20 leaders to take urgent action and step up on climate ambition, while also suggesting that this will continue to strengthen in the years to come.
Public Opinion and Climate Finance Policy
· There was majority support for more funding of green businesses and jobs in fourteen
out of the eighteen G20 countries surveyed, with the greatest support among adults in the United Kingdom (74%), followed by Germany, Australia, and Canada (all 68%). Among under-18s, support was highest in Australia (73%).
· In many countries, making companies pay for their pollution was more popular among adults than under-18s. In Japan, Mexico and the Republic of Korea there was a stark difference between these two groups (42% vs 31%, 43% vs 36%, and 41% vs 36%, respectively), indicating more public education is needed.
Public Opinion and Cutting Emissions
· Stopping burning polluting fuels was a popular policy in the United Kingdom, Australia,
Canada, Germany, and France, with majority support among both under-18s and adults in these countries. There were much lower levels of support elsewhere, with just 30% of adults in India and Saudi Arabia supporting this policy, compared to 36% and 32% of under-18s in these countries, respectively.
· Promoting renewable energy was generally a more popular policy among under-18s than
adults, with a generational divide as high as thirteen percentage points in the United States. Support for this policy from under-18s was also high in emerging economies, such as with 64% for Brazil and Turkey, and 62% for Argentina.
· Similarly, there was higher under-18 support for electric vehicles and bicycles, with ten percentage
point differences in Australia and Italy, suggestive of coming shifts in public demand.
· Reducing energy waste received mixed support overall, and some significant levels of
intergenerational differences. For example, in Germany 59% of adults supported this policy as opposed to 44% of under-18s, while Russia saw the opposite outcome: 32% of adults compared to 38% of under-18s.
· Support among adults and under-18s on policies such as conserving forests and land to
address climate change varied depending on the country. It was ten percentage points higher among adults than under-18s in the United Kingdom, for example, whereas in Brazil, Russia and India it was higher among under-18s than adults, ten percent, nine percent and nine percent higher, respectively.
Public Opinion and Climate Adaptation Policy
· There were majority levels of support among adults in twelve of the G20 countries
surveyed for building more resilient infrastructure to protect people and property from extreme weather events. The policy attracted greater support in adults than under-18s, such as for the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Germany.
· Installing more early warning systems to support disaster preparedness was a relatively
popular policy in general and featured higher levels of public support among under-18s than adults in all countries. Support among under-18s was eight percentage points higher than for adults in both France and the United States, and six for Brazil and Turkey.
· There were surprisingly higher levels of support among under-18s than adults for
increasing access to insurance, which can help families, businesses, and communities rebuild after extreme weather events. Under-18s backed this policy with support higher than among adults in the United States (where there was a fourteen percentage point difference), Italy (twelve), and Brazil, France and Japan (where the generational gap was eleven points).
Introduction
On 27 January 2021, the Peoples' Climate Vote was published by the UN Development Programme and the University of Oxford. The survey used an innovative polling methodology by utilizing mobile gaming networks, and delivered the world's largest ever survey of public opinion on climate change, with 1.2 million respondents across 50 countries.
A key finding was that a majority of people in all countries surveyed believe that climate change is a global emergency. In many of the countries, it was also the first time that public opinion on climate policies had ever been gathered. The survey was discussed in government meetings on climate action, and parliaments, all over the world.
The Peoples' Climate Vote is unusual in that, since it uses mobile gaming networks to engage participants, it attracts a very large sample of under-18s whose voices tend to be overlooked in political decision-making1. In a matter of years, these future voters will soon be influencing political decisions, so it is imperative that governments already consider their voices when making decisions that will affect them more and for longer than anyone else.
The G20 Peoples' Climate Vote report gives unique insights into never-before-shared data and a new analysis of people's opinions on climate change from the G20 countries. It compares what under-18s think about the climate to what adults think. This approach is both important and insightful: by looking into data on under-18s, we can predict how the policy priorities of the G20 countries will shift once the new generation of voters enter the workforce, reach voting age, and have greater influence.
This new analysis comes at an incredibly important time on the global stage, not only in the timing ahead of G20 Rome Summit and COP26, but also because of the increasingly important role the G20 plays in the world's economy and trade, COVID-19 stimulus packages which will shape the course of the world, and population growth.
How the Survey was Conducted
The survey was conducted over the course of a year from October 2020 to June 2021, with a sample of over 689,000 people across G20 countries, including more than 302,000 under-18year-olds (under-18s).
Participants were asked two questions about whether they believe climate change is a global emergency and, if so, what speed of action they think the world should take. Then they were asked a series of questions about the different kinds of climate policies that they would like their government to enact. The data were collated and processed by analysts at

For more information on the survey methodology and data availability for different countries, please see the Methodology section of this report.
Public Opinion & Climate Change in the G20
G20 members are not only responsible for around 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)2, but also account for over 80% of global GDP, 75% of international trade, and 60% of the world's population3. This group of countries is therefore in a unique position for its collective decisions to significantly influence the success of the world in combating climate change.
Following the G20 Rome Summit, governments will participate in multilateral climate negotiations in Glasgow at COP26, where they are expected to increase their ambition on climate action, including concrete ways to halve global emissions by 2030 and to pursue net zero pathways. All parties, including the G20, are meant to solidify progress toward the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement that was signed at COP21 in Paris in 2015. Notably, under the Paris Agreement, all countries must bring forward ambitious national plans to reduce their emissions across sectors of their economy, known as Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs.
As of mid-October 2021, just 16 parties in the G20 have submitted their updated NDCs. While we see some strengthened emission targets from Argentina, Canada, South Africa, the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and the United States, others such as China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey (noting recent ratification of the Paris Agreement for Turkey) have yet to submit. Some countries, such as the Republic of Korea and Japan (currently submitted interim), have announced plans to strengthen their targets from what they have previously submitted and will be expected to submit their new NDCs soon. Others, such as Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, submitted updated/revised NDCs that are considered the same or weaker than their previous pledges. The ambition of the G20 NDCs will impact generations. It is therefore time for the governments to listen to the people ­ young and old.
A Climate Emergency?
In the G20 Peoples' Climate Vote, people aged 18 and over (adults) and those under 18 (under-18s), were asked whether they considered climate change a global emergency7. In all countries, large majorities of adults said that climate change is a global emergency, ranging from the United Kingdom (81%) and Italy (80%), to Argentina and India, on 57% and 58% respectively.
On average across the G20 countries surveyed, 65% of adults thought that climate change is a global emergency, compared with higher support among under-18s, at 70%. This indicates there is broad public support across the G20 for leaders calling to step up on ambition and suggests this will strengthen in the years to come.
There was meanwhile a significantly bigger difference between under-18s and adults on the question of whether climate change is a global emergency in some countries than in others. For example, 82% of Australian under-18s for example believe in a climate emergency, compared with 72% of adults, a difference of ten percentage points (see Figure 1). This difference was also significant in the United States (ten percentage points), India (nine) and Canada (eight), indicating that a near-term significant shift in public opinion can be expected in these countries.

Public Support for Different Climate Policies in the G20 ­ differences among adults and under-18s
It is important to recognize that it is not always the case that young people are more supportive of action on climate change than adults. There are educational factors at play here, as the most profound socio-demographic driver of belief in the climate emergency and climate action is a person's educational background4. This is shown in the following table, which presents support among adults and under-18s for 14 different climate policies. Figure 2. Public support for 14 climate policies, comparing participants 18 and over (adults) with those under 18 (under-18s)
The three most popular climate policies among both adults and under-18s were conserving forests and land (56% vs. 59%), promoting renewables (54% vs. 57%), followed by climate-friendly farming (53% vs. 57%). However, the policies where support was greater among under-18s than adults were good and affordable insurance (a difference of five percentage points relative to adults), followed by, more electric cars and buses, and bicycles (five percentage points). Good and affordable insurance is seen by experts as essential for protecting people from damage to property and infrastructure by increased extreme weather events, in particular from flooding events, which are becoming more intense and frequent in many countries, including in the G20 countries. The climate policies where adults were significantly more supportive than under-18s were: making companies pay for their pollution (four percentage points), and building infrastructure and conserving nature to protect people from the impacts of climate change (three percentage points).
The Most Popular Climate Policies in the G20
Participants in the survey, young and old, were asked whether they support climate policies across different topics.
The findings from this survey are presented here, grouped in different sections ­ financing climate action, cutting emissions, and adapting to climate change ­ reflecting the three main areas of negotiation at the climate talks.
Financing Climate Action
The cost of the transition to a low-emissions economy that limits global warming to a safe 1.5°C is estimated at US$3.5 trillion per year5, compared to a total global economy of approximately US$85 trillion per year6. There is no way that this can be achieved without G20 members, which comprise over 80% of global GDP.
But with trillions having been spent already on the COVID-19 pandemic, what are the implications for climate finance? The impacts have been particularly severe for developing countries and emerging economies, and have exacerbated debt pressures on low and middle-income, and climate-vulnerable countries. However, if these countries fail to introduce sustainable recovery packages, global climate goals will be impossible to meet7.
So, what do G20 citizens think? The Peoples' Climate Vote asked them about three policy options.
1. Provide more money for green businesses and jobs
The G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group was recently re-established under the Italian G20 Presidency, which coordinates efforts towards a global green and sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic8. As an inter-governmental forum, the G20 can help facilitate discussion and collective action among and within G20 governments to promote green businesses and jobs.
Figure 3. Public support for more funding for green businesses and jobs
There was majority support for more funding of green businesses and jobs in most of the G20 countries surveyed, showing both adults and under-18s see the importance of a green economy. Support among the under-18s was greater than adults in eleven countries, and was highest in Australia (73%). The greatest support among adults was in the United Kingdom (74%), followed by Germany, Canada, and Australia (all at 68%). Meanwhile in the Republic of Korea, support for more green investment was significantly higher among adults (56%) compared with under-18s (49%).
2. Make companies pay for their pollution
There are different ways of making companies pay for the pollution that causes climate change, but these typically involve some form of carbon tax or pricing9. The G20 FinanceMinisters officially endorsed carbon pricing for the first time in 202110 and it is gaining momentum in recent months, with initiatives having been launched in China and Germany, while the emissions price in the EU has risen above 50/ton11.
Figure 4. Public support for making companies pay for their pollution
In ten countries out of the eighteen surveyed in the G20, more adults than under-18s wanted to make companies pay for their pollution. In Japan, Mexico and the Republic of Korea there was a stark difference between these two groups (42% vs 31%, 43% vs 36%, and 41% vs 36%, respectively), and support among adults soared in countries such as the United Kingdom (72%), Canada (69%), Australia and Germany (both 66%). These results could indicate that adults are more in favor of using economic instruments, like tax, to help reduce emissions.
3. Require companies to reveal more about how their products are made
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that industry-related GHG emissions are continuing to rise12. With 75% of both global GHG emissions and trade attributed to G20 countries, there is a leading role to be played in requiring companies to become more transparent on how products are made. This can enable more informed purchases, which could incentivize companies to reduce GHG emissions, among other environmental benefits. Figure 5. Public support for more transparency on how products are made
Requiring companies to report more on how products are made was a less popular policy choice among Peoples' Climate Vote respondents in G20 countries, falling to just 29%
support in the Republic of Korea and Saudi Arabia among the adults. These results indicate more education is required on the environmental impact of supply-chain pollution. Apart from in the United States, there was little difference between adults and under18s on this question. There, the policy has narrow majority support among under-18s, compared with just 45% support among adults. This policy was most popular in Canada and Australia, with majority support among both adults and under-18s in these countries, as well as in France.
Cutting Emissions
The IPCC has found that to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C, global CO2 emissions must decrease by 45% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. Given G20 members are responsible for such a high proportion of the world's GHG emissions, deeper and faster reductions are required among the biggest emitters and more advanced economies to reach these targets, which will involve huge efforts across every area of the economy and government policy. In the G20 Peoples' Climate Vote, we asked respondents which climate policies they supported that reduce GHG emissions in both energy, transportation and industry, and nature.
Cutting Emissions in Energy, Transport & Industry
1. Stop burning fuels that pollute
The energy mix of many G20 countries still includes a large share of fossil fuels13 which, when burned, produce carbon dioxide emissions. The transition away from these fuels is a recurring topic in G20 discussions, especially on action to reform fossil-fuel subsidies. A peer review system between the G20 countries was established in 2013 to increase transparency and speed up the energy transition away from fossil fuels. However, G20 action on reducing fossil fuel subsidies has slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic while it recognizes the political challenges that governments face in implementing enduring reform14. It is also complicated by some countries' reliance on domestic production of fuels, and the large numbers of jobs dependent on this activity. Thus, when phasing out fossil fuels, countries must not only consider the transition of its energy source and energy security of people, but also to ensure a just transition for affected communities to adjust through social protection and new skills for green jobs.
Update-2021.pdf
Figure 6. Public support for stopping burning fuels that pollute
Stopping burning fuels that pollute was a popular policy in Australia, Canada, and the European G20 members, with majority support among under-18s and adults, apart from Italy. There were much lower levels of support elsewhere, with just 30% of adults supporting this policy in India and Saudi Arabia, compared to 36% and 32% of under-18s in these countries, respectively. In some countries, there were significantly more under-18s supporting this policy, most notably the United States (by twelve percentage points), and Argentina and India (by six percentage points).
2. Waste less energy
Following many of the large economies of the G20, the last two decades saw many emerging markets and developing economies constructing infrastructure needed to attend to a rapidly developing economy. This is an energy and emissions intensive process and with two-billion people set to be added to the world's population by 2050, this trend will not easily slow down. It is thus predicted that electricity demand will grow rapidly, especially in emerging market and developing economies. The focus now is not only on the clean electrification of the existing and new economies but also on the improvement of energy intensity and efficiency, and a behavioral change in all levels of energy use15. Figure 7. Public support for wasting less energy in homes, buildings, and factories
There is strong support for reducing energy waste in a few countries, with majority support among both adults and under-18s in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and the United States. In some of these countries there were notable large discrepancies between adults and under-18s, as it may be indicating who is paying the bills. This generational gap hits fifteen percentage points in Germany. This trend was not universal however: in Russia, for example, under-18s were six percentage points more likely to support action to reduce energy wastage, and in Argentina they were three percentage points more likely.
3. More renewable energy
Greening and decarbonizing the energy mix and extending the electrification to more people through renewable energy is center of the transition strategies for countries. In fact, the share of renewables is expected to increase from 30% of electricity generation globally in 2020 to about 45% in the next ten years, with solar energy alone expected to increase with an average of 125GW of new capacity globally from 2021 to 202516. The Italian Presidency of the G20 has made energy security and the energy transition a key priority in 2021. Currently the G20 hosts approximately 81% of the global installed renewable power generation capacity, as well as 75% of the global potential for deploying renewables between 2010 and 203017. As such, G20 members are playing a pivotal role in the development and deployment of renewable energy18.
Energy.pdf
There was majority support for renewable energy among both adults and under-18s in many of the G20 countries surveyed. More strikingly this policy was more popular among under18s than adults in twelve of eighteen countries, and by as much as ten percentage points in the United States, eight percentage points in France, and seven in Brazil, Russia, and India.
4. More clean electric cars and buses, and bicycles
The transport sector is responsible for nearly one quarter of the world's GHG emissions, with motor vehicles responsible for over three quarters of these. The G20 accounts for over 90% of global vehicle sales, meaning G20 policies on personal transport can significantly influence the trajectory of these emissions, as well as improvements in air quality.19 Despite COVID-19 impacts on sales, about 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020 worldwide. G20 members led the way, with 1.4 million new registrations in Europe, 1.2 million in China, and 295,000 in the United States. While the European Green Deal proposed an effective ban on the sales of petrol and diesel cars starting 2035 in their 27-country bloc20, and the United States targets 50% electric vehicle sales share by 203021, G20 governments are on a race to introduce electric vehicles through subsidies and other policies. However, electric vehicles make up just 5% of all car sales worldwide today, indicating greater incentives and more consumer education are required.22 There is also a recognition that other forms of transport need to be incorporated into sustainability plans, including non-motorized transport modes (such as cycling and walking). Increasing the infrastructure for this will reduce air pollution, congestion, and have positive health benefits.23 Figure 9. Public support for the use of more clean electric vehicles and bicycles
The G20 Peoples' Climate Vote results marked out electric vehicles and bicycles as a future trend, with consistently higher support for them among under-18s than among adults in all countries for which there is available data. The difference was greatest in the United States, at thirteen percentage points, or 68% versus 55%. The generational divide was also high in Australia and Italy (ten percentage points), France and Germany (nine), and Russia (seven).
5. Transport goods using clean energy
The transport of goods around the world is a hard-to-abate sector ­ meaning it is a technologically difficult sector to decarbonize ­ in the case of planes, ships and trucks. Railways are however easier, and there are more and more technologies available to help reduce GHG emissions from this part of the economy. With G20 accounting for 75% of the world's trade, it is important to note that there are calls to promote more sustainable and efficient trade24. Transportation sector is often trade-exposed and highly carbon intensive while concerned about losing its competitiveness towards countries with lower prices. Therefore, educating businesses and citizens about the benefits of common policy to scale up action collectively, and to build societal ownership in this effort is key to decarbonizing the sector. Figure 10. Public support for transporting goods with vehicles that run on clean energy
Among G20 countries, the use of clean energy in the transportation of goods was generally less popular than many other policies, with support among adults falling to just 31% in Saudi Arabia. Often people are less aware of the pollution caused by this sector, at least when compared with personal transportation. However, there was a high level of support among both under-18s and adults in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, where 67% of adults support this policy, the highest of the G20 countries surveyed. There were also some marked differences between support among adults and under-18s in different countries. In Germany, support was fourteen percentage points higher among adults, for example, and in the United Kingdom, ten. Meanwhile in the United States, support was six percentage points higher among under-18s. In contrast, in Mexico, Russia, Brazil and Argentina, there was only a minimal difference in support between the two groups.
Cutting Emissions in Nature
Land-use change plays a crucial role in tackling the climate crisis. The land-use sector, such as forestry and agriculture, is responsible for just under a quarter of GHG emissions25. There needs to be efforts to mitigate climate change through land-use activities, such as through conserving and restoring forests.
1. Conservation of forests and land
In 2020, G20 members committed to a Global Initiative on Reducing Land Degradation and Enhancing Conservation of Terrestrial Habitats, with the aim of sharing knowledge and best practice on ways to protect, conserve and sustainably manage land.26 This is an important mitigation strategy for countries, and is reflected through projects such as REDD+, which advances forest protection27. This reflects majority support for the conservation of forests and land in G20 countries in sixteen out of eighteen G20 countries surveyed.
Figure 11. Public support for conservation of forests and land
In some countries, many more under-18s supported this policy than adults, for example Russia (69% vs. 60%), India (52% vs. 43%), Argentina (63% vs. 57%), France (77% vs. 73%) and the United States (73% vs. 69%). Protecting forests and land had the highest levels of support among adults in the United Kingdom (82%), Canada and Germany (both 79%). In some countries, significantly more adults than under-18s supported this policy, most strikingly by ten percentage points in the United Kingdom.
2. Support environmental stewards
G20 members are home to populations that are vulnerable to climate impacts, such as indigenous peoples, local communities and women, who may manage lands in ways that protect them from destruction. Through these actions emissions can be prevented, such as through stopping the release of carbon associated with deforestation. Often however these groups lack legal claims to their land, or they are excluded from decision-making. This means supporting these environmental stewards is an important step towards addressing the climate crisis. In recognition of this, and ahead of the Rome Summit, the G20 reiterated its support for ensuring local communities and indigenous populations are able to effectively participate in all relevant local decision-making28. Figure 12. Percentage approval for supporting indigenous peoples, local communities and women who are environmental stewards
Popular support for environmental stewards was relatively inconsistent among under-18s and adults, and between countries, likely driven by cultural and social differences. Support was highest among under-18s in Australia (64%) and adults in the United Kingdom (61%), and was relatively low in Saudi Arabia, India, and the Republic of Korea. The greatest differences were found in Germany, where adult support was eleven percentage points higher than among under-18s, and in Russia, where support was eight percentage points higher than among under-18s. The protection of land by environmental stewards is a global challenge, indicating a stronger effort at public education is required.
Adapting to Climate Change
The growth in human emissions over the last two centuries has contributed already to global heating of 1.1 °C. According to the IPCC, this warming trend will continue in coming decades and the world must take dramatic and urgent action to reduce emissions and avoid increasingly devastating impacts. In 2021, global temperature rise has already caused an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heating and cooling events, as well as floods, storm surges, and forest fires. These can cause deaths and injury, and damage crops and property. The world will have to invest large amounts of money and resources into adapting to climate change in order to cope more effectively with these impacts. However just 20% of climate finance today is directed towards climate change adaptation. Besides their own defenses, many G20 countries will need to fund adaptation in poorer countries, to prevent disastrous socio-economic impacts as well. What do the people think? The G20 Peoples' Climate Vote asked respondents whether they supported three different climate change adaptation policies.
1. Build up resilient infrastructure
The G20 Environment Ministers discussed how to increase resilience to climate change around the world through better infrastructure and nature conservation in 202129. However, the G20 Peoples' Climate Vote survey indicates that support for this as a policy is mixed. Figure 13. Public support building infrastructure and conserving nature to protect lives and livelihoods
There were high levels of support in half of the G20 countries surveyed, with majorities backing building more resilient infrastructure among both adults and under-18s. The majorities were significantly higher among adults than under-18s in Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Korea, Japan and Italy. Only in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina was support for this policy higher among under-18s at a level that is statistically significant.
2. Early warning systems
Extreme weather events such as droughts, flooding, storms, and fires, are becoming more frequent and more intense around the world as a result of climate change. These can often be monitored, and warnings issued, giving people valuable time to make decisions about protecting themselves and their property. With the onset of climate change effects around the world, early warning systems are a key part of adaptation strategies and disaster risk reduction. G20 countries can coordinate and fund these systems, both at home and abroad. Figure 14. Public support for installing more early warning systems for disasters
Installing more early warning systems to support disaster preparedness received mixed levels of support. There were higher levels of support among under-18s than adults in all countries for which there is data, with the generational divide hitting eight percentage points in France and the United States.
3. Climate-friendly farming
The G20 members contain approximately 60% of the world's agricultural land and 80% of world trade in agricultural products30, putting them in a prime position to lead the way on reducing emissions in agriculture, which produces as much as a quarter of global emissions. In addition, the adaptation of farming techniques to the new climatic conditions is critical to securing the livelihoods of millions of farmers in the G20 countries, such as to delayed monsoon and drought in India31. The G20 reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural systems in its September 2021 declaration32. Figure 15. Public support for climate-friendly farming
Only in Germany and the Republic of Korea was support higher, and statistically significant, among adults than under-18s for more climate-friendly farming. In turn, support for this policy was often higher among under-18s than adults. The United States saw the largest difference, with 72% of under-18s support climate-friendly farming, compared with just 60% of adults, and India, where 51% of under-18s support, compared with 43% of adults. This indicates a need for more education among adults on the benefits of climate-friendly farming.
4. Insurance as a climate adaptation policy
When extreme weather hits, the effects can be devastating to people and property. They can cause huge economic damage too. Insurance provides a means for families, businesses and communities to get back on their feet more quickly. And yet, much of the world does not even have access to affordable insurance services. Given the G20 countries make up around 60% of the world's population, they have a responsibility to ensure people have access to affordable insurance, to help protect lives and livelihoods. They can also encourage the provision of insurance services to countries beyond the G20. Government has an important role to play here, as insurance is often a heavily-regulated industry. Figure 16. Public support for providing good and affordable insurance
The results of the G20 Peoples' Climate Vote indicate a significant split between under-18s and adults on the merits of supporting access to insurance. In no country in the poll was there majority support among adults for this policy, and yet there were majorities among under-18s in the United States (61%), Canada (58%), Australia (57%), and the United Kingdom (53%). There were also large generational divides in different countries, for example, the United States (fourteen percentage points), Italy (twelve), Brazil, France and Japan (all eleven), Argentina (ten), and Australia, the Republic of Korea and Russia (all eight).
Methodology
While numerous surveys measure belief in climate change in developed countries, UNDP wanted to reach new audiences and poll countries where less was known about public opinion. Given UNDP's unique role in supporting 120 countries to develop their national pledges under the Paris Agreement through its flagship Climate Promise initiative, it also wanted to help governments to gauge public sentiment on specific policy solutions that could be at the heart of those national pledges.
The Peoples' Climate Vote involved two ""big picture"" questions followed by six policy questions where the respondent could select up to three preferences per question (18 total). For demographic information, respondents were asked to identify their gender from man, woman, or ""X"", their age as under-18, 18-35, 36-59, or 60+, and when they left their education.
The first two ""big picture"" questions asked the respondent if they thought climate change was a global emergency and, if so, the urgency of action required to address it. The second part of the survey asked respondents which of the 18 policies they favored to tackle climate change. The policy options were framed around six of the most impactful solution areas: energy, economy, transportation, farms and food, protecting people, and nature. The content draws from the Sustainable Development Goals, portfolio and approaches by the United Nations and UNDP, and analyses conducted by the IPCC and NASA, and NGOs such as Project Drawdown. The content was simplified to enable mass participation and reviewed by some of the world's leading experts on climate policy.
Survey Delivery
The Peoples' Climate Vote used an entirely new way of polling developed by UNDP and partners. The survey was distributed to people via advertising on mobile gaming networks. This meant invitations to participate popped up as adverts when people were playing the most popular mobile games. Nearly 4,000 apps were targeted including games that are popular internationally, such as Words with Friends, Angry Birds, Dragon City, Temple Run, or Subway Surfers, as well as those that are popular locally. Instead of seeing a traditional advert in their game, the player would be invited to participate in the Peoples' Climate Vote. The look and feel of the vote was developed as an inviting, fun, and playful way for people to send a message to world leaders.
The adverts were placed randomly and served only once to each individual by the mobile gaming advertising network. No personally identifiable information was collected by UNDP or any Mission 1.5 partner. With 16 million invitations issued in 18 G20 countries, the survey yielded over 689,000 responses, a response rate of 4.2% across the 18 countries. This report is based on analysis of respondents who answered all three demographic questions and at least the first question on climate change.
Processing
As there were more responses from some demographic groups than others, the raw ""votes"" from the survey were not representative of the population of any of the participating countries. An expert team from the University of Oxford weighted (or rebalanced) the data to generate estimates to be as representative as possible of the joint distribution of age, gender and education in each country. These more representative estimates can reveal much about public opinion in participating countries or groupings of countries. All crosscountry averages were population-weighted, and so these results are strongly influenced by larger countries such as India. For the first ""big picture"" question about the climate emergency, there are representative results for all 18 countries.
For current national population breakdowns by age and gender, the 2020 projected figures from the 2019 revision of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs' Population Division `World Population Prospects' report (United Nations Population Division 2019) were used. Estimates of the numbers of people for each level of education come from the 2020 projections from the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (2018), using International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) levels, for different combinations of age and gender within each country.
To reconcile the different measures of education from the Peoples' Climate Vote and the Wittgenstein Centre data, it was necessary to estimate the approximate level of education for each respondent using information on the age the respondent left education, and their actual age. The respondent was asked what year they left school and the following mapping was applied:
· Never attended school --> Never attended school (ISCED level 0) · Left school aged less than 12 --> Primary level education (ISCED level 1) · Left school aged 12 to 19 --> Secondary level education (ISCED levels 2 and 3) · Left education aged 20 or over --> Post-secondary level education (ISCED levels 4+) · Still in education and under 18 years of age --> Secondary level education (ISCED levels 2
and 3)
· Still in education and 18 years or older --> Post-secondary level education (ISCED levels 4+)
Overall population estimates are for the resident population of each country that is over 14 years old and identifies as either male or female. The survey did not ask respondents precisely how old respondents were. All those who were under age 18 were assumed to have been over 14. This means that the opinions of any respondents who were aged 14 or under are treated as if they were equivalent to those of 15-to 17-year-olds for the purposes of overall population weighting.
Those who said their gender was ""X"" (i.e., not identifying as male or female) are not included in the published estimates because the target demographic data from the UN and Wittgenstein data does not provide population estimates for the size of non-binary populations within each country. However, the attitudes to climate change of those giving gender as ""X"" within the Peoples' Climate Vote were very similar to those of respondents who identified as male or female.
In some countries, there were difficulties reaching enough people from more difficult-to-reach sub-populations, typically older groups and those with only primary or no formal education.
To ensure the integrity of published estimates, sampling targets were generated for all possible combinations of age group, gender, and education level, based on the groups used for weighting. It was expected that the survey would elicit responses from a minimum target number for each such age-gender-education combination. Those minimum targets were based on a perfectly representative sample of 2,000 people from a given country.
For any given survey question, no overall estimates of public opinion for a country are published unless the numbers of respondents answering that question and all three demographic questions meet all the age-gender-education sampling targets within 30% or within 20 people, or there are at least 35 respondents for any given age-gender-education combination. The latter criterion implies some large weighting in certain instances, but the response distributions are sufficiently regular that the weighting makes relatively little difference to the overall figures. These conditions were not met for the policy questions for Indonesia and South Africa.
Where those conditions were met and overall estimates are published for a question, estimates for sub-populations (defined by age or gender or education level) are also published if there is an adequate number of respondents for the estimates to be a reliable guide to how that group differs from the overall population. For this, the number of respondents was at least 250. Also, we do not publish figures for very small groups: ones that constitute less than 3% of the population aged over 14.
In some countries, adequate samples of sub-populations were achieved even though the requirements for publishing overall population estimates were not met. For these, estimates of the response distribution for a question for a particular demographic group are published if all the sampling targets have been met within that group and the total number of respondents is at least 500. This means, for instance, that some countries have published estimates of opinion on certain questions for, say, under 18-year-olds, if there are sufficient numbers of them for each combination of gender and education based on the sampling targets. This applies for under-18s in Indonesia and South Africa for the policy questions, where the data are not adequate to publish figures for those 18 and over.
The margin of error for percentages quoted in this report will technically vary according to the sample size for the particular question, country and group being discussed. As a general rule for the country-level data, margins of error are no larger than + or - two percentage points. For differences between countries, or genders, gaps of five points or more are significant.66
Some of the respondents who answered the initial questions (about belief in a climate emergency and preferences for speed of global action) did not go on to answer further questions about their views on which climate policies their country should pursue. Those who answered the policy questions were somewhat more likely, than those who did not, to have said in the initial questions that they believed in a climate emergency and that the world should do everything necessary about it. Some of this attrition is already accounted for by the fact that the data is weighted for the joint age-gender-education distribution separately for each climate question. If there were further adjustment for the pattern of attrition, support for the policy options would be no more than one to three points lower than published.
Country groupings
In this report, the term country, used interchangeably with government, state or economy, does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.
UNDP, together with the UN system, mobilizes international support and advocates for ambitious climate action. With regard to the analysis and results of the Peoples' Climate Vote, we have attempted to provide insights across various groups including economic classification.
Comparing adults and under-18s
In this report, we specifically looked at how under-18s and adults supported climate policies. To do this, we calculated averages of under-18 support per policy per country, and also the average for the 18+ bracket.
The under-18s group was weighted to the education*gender profile of the 15, 16 and 17 year old population in each country.
Where differences between adults and under-18s were noted, this was based on the response after rounding. For example, if 54.93% of adults and 57.21% of under-18s supported one policy, this was rounded to 55% and 57%. The difference between adults and under-18s was therefore taken to be 3% (not 2.28%).

GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OUTLOOK
GEO-6
SUMMARY FOR POLICYMAKERS
GEO-6 Assessment Process


The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), focusing on the theme ""healthy planet, healthy people"", aims to help policymakers and all of society achieve the environmental dimension of the Sustainable Development Goals, internationally agreed environmental goals and the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analyzing current and past environmental policy, and identifying future options for achieving sustainable development by 2050.
The original request to prepare GEO-6 came from Member states at the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), when, in paragraph 8 of resolution 1/4, the Executive Director of UNEP was requested, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook, supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global, intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNEP/EA.1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer-reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policymakers, to be endorsed by the Environment Assembly no later than in 2018.
At its third session, the Environment Assembly, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of its decision 3/1, requested the Executive Directorio issue the sixth Global Environment Outlook at least three months before the fourth session of the Assembly; to schedule the negotiations on the Summary for policymakers at least six weeks in advance of the fourth session of the Assembly; and to present the Outlook and the Summary for consideration and possible endorsement by the Assembly at its fourth session.

Scope
GEO-6 builds on previous GEO reports and continues to provide an analysis of the state of the global environment, the global, regional and national policy response as well as the outlook for the foreseeable future. It differs from previous GEO reports in its emphasis on Sustainable Development Goals and in providing possible means of accelerating achievement of these goals. GEO- 6 is made up of four distinct but closely linked parts.
❖ Part A assesses the state of the global environment in relation to key internationally agreed goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals.
❖ Part B provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the policy response to these environmental challenges.
❖ Part C reviews the scenarios literature and assesses pathways towards achieving Agenda 2030 as well as achieving a truly sustainable world in 2050.
❖ Part D identifies future data and knowledge necessary to improve our ability to assess environmental impacts.
The GEO-6 also considers key policy questions. These include:
❖ What are the primary drivers of environmental change?
❖ 
What is the current state of the environment and why?
❖ How successful have we been in achieving our internationally agreed environmental goals?
❖ Have there been successful environmental policies?
❖ What are the policy lessons learned and possible solutions?
❖ Is the current policy response enough?
❖ What are the business as usual scenarios and what does a sustainable future look like?
❖ What are the emerging issues and megatrends including their possible impacts?
❖ What are the possible pathways to achieving Agenda 2030 and other internationally agreed environmental goals?
The development of GEO-6 involved extensive collaboration both within UN Environment and between UN Environment and a network of multidisciplinary experts and research institutions.
The intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation mentioned above (Oct. 2014) requested that experts for content development, including reviewers and advisory groups, be nominated by governments and other main stakeholders based on their expertise and using a transparent nomination process while considering geographic and gender balance.
The following three GEO-6 specialized advisory bodies were convened to support the assessment process:
High-Level Intergovernmental and Stakeholder Advisory Group
The panel included 25-30 high-level government representatives from all six UN Environment regions as well as 8-10 key stakeholders. The High-level Group provided strategic advice and initial guidance on the structure and content of the GEO-6 Summary for Policymakers and further guidance to the experts in finalizing the draft Summary, in preparation for the final intergovernmental negotiation.
Science Advisory Panel
The Panel included 22 distinguished scientists who met face to- face five times. The Panel was responsible for providing advice on the scientific credibility of the assessment process. The Panel provided scientific advice; standards and guidelines for the assessment and review process; and reviewed the findings of the mid-term evaluation of the assessment process.
Assessment Methodologies, Data and Information Working Group
This working group of 12 professionals met face-to-face three times between 2015 and 2018 and provided support and guidance to the assessment process on the use of core datasets and indicators.
This Summary for Policymakers is based on and consistent with the findings of the GEO-6 assessment. The GEO-6 Summary for Policymakers was negotiated and endorsed at an intergovernmental meeting from 21 to 24 January 2019 in Nairobi, Kenya.


Summary for Policymakers: Sixth Global Environment Outlook


1. What is the Global Environment Outlook?



The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) is the result of a consultative and participatory process to prepare an independent assessment of the state of the environment, the effectiveness of the policy response in addressing environmental challenges and the possible pathways to achieving various internationally agreed environmental goals. The GEO is a series of studies that inform environmental decision-making for Governments and other stakeholders. {1.1}
The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), under the theme ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"", aims to provide a sound, evidence-based source of environmental information to help policymakers and all of society to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals, and to implement the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analysing current and past environmental policies and identifying future options to achieve sustainable development by 2050. {1.1}
Since the first edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) in 1997, there have been many examples of environmental improvement, especially where problems have been well- identified, manageable, and where regulatory and technological solutions have been readily available. Much more can be achieved in that regard through more effective implementation of existing policies. {Chapters 12 to 17}
Nevertheless, the overall condition of the global environment has continued to deteriorate since the first edition of GEO, despite environmental policy efforts across all countries and regions. Environmental policy efforts are being hindered by a variety of factors, in particular unsustainable production and consumption- patterns in most countries and climate change. GEO-6 concludes that unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society. {Chapters 4 to 9}
Urgent action at an unprecedented scale is necessary to arrest and reverse this situation, thereby protecting human and environmental health and maintaining the current and future integrity of global ecosystems. Key actions include reducing land degradation, biodiversity loss, and air, land and water pollution; improving water management and resource management; climate change mitigation and adaptation; resource efficiency; addressing decarbonization, decoupling and detoxification; and the prevention and management of risk and disasters. Those all require more ambitious and effective policies, including sustainable consumption and production, greater resource efficiency and improved resource management, integrated ecosystem management, and integrated waste management and prevention.1 2 3 4 {Chapter 22}

Mainstreaming environmental considerations into social and economic decisions at all levels is of vital importance. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, GEO-6 shows that environmental issues are best addressed in conjunction with related economic and social issues, taking into account synergies and trade-offs between different goals and targets, including consideration of eguity and gender dimensions. Governance can be improved at the local, national, regional and global levels, including broad coordination between policy areas. More ambitious and effectively implemented environmental policies are necessary, but alone they are not sufficient to meet sustainable development objectives. At the same time as ensuring sustainable sources of financing for sustainable development and aligning financing flows with environmental priorities, capacities have to be strengthened and scientific information taken into account for environmental management. Strong commitment from all stakeholders, partnerships and international cooperation would greatly facilitate the realization of environmental goals.
{Chapters 22, 23, 24}
GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is the best foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being. As figure SPM.1 illustrates, human behaviour has had various impacts on biodiversity, atmosphere, oceans, water and land.
That environmental degradation, which ranges from serious to irreversible, has had a negative impact on human health. Atmospheric pollution has had the most severe negative impact, followed by degradation of water, biodiversity, ocean and land environment. It is therefore important that opportunities for prosperity and well-being that maintain or regain the integrity of ecosystems should be attained through sustainable development pathways that are shared and pursued globally. {24.4}
The following sections highlight the main global drivers of environmental change, the condition of the environment, the scale and effectiveness of policy responses, the potential pathways for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in an increasingly complex world, and the data and information needs and opportunities that can support decision-making towards achieving those Goals.

Note: The figure shows the degree of impact of human activity on the health of the planet (ranging from good health to irreversible damage) and the impact of the health of the planet on human health (ranging from low damage to high damage). Some environmental and health impact may be remediable in the short or long term, but ""irreversible"" environmental impact can only be remedied over the very long term, if at all.

2. What is happening to our environment and how have we responded?



2.1 Drivers of environmental change, megatrends and governance challenges
Human population dynamics or trends, particularly population pressure, and economic development have been acknowledged for many decades as the primary drivers of environmental change (well established). More recently, rapid urbanization and accelerating technological innovation have been additional influences. There are wide disparities globally in the consumption and production patterns that lie behind those drivers. {2.1.1,2.2}
Those driving forces are also strongly intertwined, complex, and spread widely and unevenly across the world (well established). They are megatrends, developing at speeds with which responses by established governance structures at all levels - urban and rural, local, national, regional, global and supranational - are thus far insufficient to keep pace. {2.1.1}
The global population in 2018 is some 7.5 billion, with median projections estimating nearly 10 billion by 2050 and nearly 11 billion by 2100 (United Nations figures) (well established). Increases in life expectancy and reductions in infant and other mortality mean that population growth rates will continue to remain positive in all regions except Europe and certain parts of Asia. Unequal access to education, and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, all contribute to high birth rates. Without changes in production and consumption patterns, population growth will continue to increase environmental pressures. {2.3, 2.3.4, 2.1.1}
Urbanization is happening at an unprecedented rate globally and cities have become the foremost drivers of economic development across the world (well established). More people, especially in emerging and developing economies, are living in cities and towns, and the world's urban population is expected to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 (well established). Approximately 90 per cent of city growth will occur in Africa and Asia. Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing region, and is also the region expected to experience the highest population growth (well established). Some 30 per cent of urban residents globally have no access to basic services or social protection, with poor women in low-income urban neighbourhoods being particularly vulnerable. {2.4, 2.4.3}
Almost all coastal cities of any size and small island developing States are increasingly vulnerable to rising sea-levels, floods and storm surges caused by climate change and extreme weather events (established but incomplete). In general, those cities in developing countries that are urbanizing most rapidly are in a more vulnerable situation. In contrast, sustainable urbanization can represent an opportunity to increase citizens' well-being while decreasing their environmental impact. Lower- impact urban lifestyles can be facilitated by improved governance, infrastructure, services, sustainable land-use planning and technological opportunities. Investment in rural areas can reduce pressure to migrate. {2.4.4,17.3}

Economic development has lifted billions of people out of poverty and enhanced access to health and education in most regions of the world (well established). Nevertheless, the ""Grow now, clean up later"" economic approach used in certain regions has not accounted for climate change, pollution or degraded natural systems. That approach has also contributed to increasing inequality within and between countries and will ultimately be more costly. It will not be able to sustainably support 10 billion healthy, fulfilled and productive people in 2050 without profound and urgent changes in consumption and production patterns. {2.5.1}
Decoupling of environmental degradation and resource use from economic growth and associated production and consumption patterns is required for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (well established). Partial decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth can already be observed for some impacts and resources in certain countries. Further decoupling reguires the scaling-up of existing sustainable practices and more fundamental transitions in the ways in which we produce, consume and dispose of goods and materials across society. Those transitions are likely to be more effective if supported by long-term, comprehensive, science- based targets that provide the objective basis for future directions and actions. {2.5.1}
The growth in technological innovation since the 1990s has been unprecedented, both globally and historically, bringing many benefits to people's lives, but has also had some negative consequences (established but incomplete). Some technological and social innovations can reduce the environmental pressures associated with unsustainable consumption and production. Enhancing access to existing environmental technologies that are adapted to domestic circumstances could help countries to achieve environmental objectives more quickly. Application of precautionary approaches, according to international agreements (where applicable), to new technological innovations can reduce unintended negative consequences for human and ecosystem health. {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4}
Countries that prioritize low-carbon, resource-efficient practices may gain a competitive advantage in the global economy (established but incomplete). Well-designed environmental policies and appropriate technologies and products can often be implemented in tandem at limited or no cost to growth and competitiveness and can expand the capacity of countries to develop and diffuse innovative technologies. That may be positive for employment and development, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, facilitating sustainable development (established but incomplete). {2.5.1}
Climate change is a priority issue affecting both human systems, including human health, and natural systems - air, biological diversity, freshwater, oceans and land - and which alters the complex interactions between those systems (well established). Historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions have committed the world to an extended period of climate change (well established), which is leading to global warming of air and ocean; rising sea-levels; melting glaciers, permafrost and Arctic sea ice; changes in carbon, biogeochemical and global water cycles; food security crises; fresh water scarcity; and more frequent and extreme weather events. Higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide also lead to ocean acidification and affect the composition, structure and functionality of ecosystems. Time is running out to prevent irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are radically reduced, the world is on course to exceed the temperature threshold set out in the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That makes climate change a global driver of environmental, social, health and economic impact and heightened society-wide risks. {2.7.3}
Society-wide risks associated with environmental degradation and climate change effects are generally more profound for people in a disadvantaged situation, particularly women and children in developing countries (established but incomplete). Many of the impacts outlined above are serious or irreversible and may lead to loss of livelihood, increased morbidity and mortality, and economic slowdown, and have greater potential for violent conflict, human mass migration and decreasing social resilience. Measures for more effective adaptation are now urgently required, especially for populations and regions which are in a vulnerable situation. {2.7.3}
The increasing scale, global reach and speed of change in those drivers of environmental change pose urgent challenges for managing environmental and climate change problems
(well established). In many domains, our scientific understanding of adverse, increasingly high impact is becoming more widespread, as is the understanding that the nature of change may sometimes be irreversible. The thematic priorities addressed by GEO-6 have been chosen and analysed with that context in mind and the summaries by theme have been organized to provide decision-makers with the most crucial insights within themes, including links to drivers and optional avenues for action. {2.7.3}

2.2 The state of the environment
2.2.1 Air

Emissions generated by human activity continue to alter the composition of the atmosphere, leading to air pollution, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and exposure to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (well established). {5.3}
Air pollution is the main environmental contributor to the global burden of disease, leading to between 6 million and 7 million premature deaths (well established) and welfare losses estimated at US$5 trillion annually (established but incomplete). Air pollution exposure, especially to fine particulate matter, is highest for urban residents in some countries with rapid urbanization trends (established but incomplete) and for the approximately 3 billion people who depend on burning fuels such as wood, coal, crop residue, dung and kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting (well established). The elderly, very young, ill and poor are more susceptible to the impact of air pollution (well established).
{5.2.4, 5.4.1}
Globally, decreasing emission trends from local air pollutants in certain sectors and regions have been offset by larger increases in others, including some rapidly developing countries and areas of rapid urbanization (well established). Available data indicate that emissions decrease significantly when regulations are put in place. {5.2} International agreements have been successful in addressing specific chemicals. Both improvement of energy efficiency and pollution control techniques may be used to achieve lower air pollutant emissions. As controls have been placed on power plants, large industrial facilities and vehicles, the relative contribution of other sources, including agriculture, domestic fuel use, construction and other portable equipment, and forest or open fires, has grown in importance (established). Electricity generated from non-renewable resources and the fossil fuel production and consumption sectors (""energy"") is the largest anthropogenic emitting sector of S02 and non-methane volatile organic compounds and the main emitting sector of other air pollutants, including greenhouse gases.
Global increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have taken place in many parts of the world. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in C02 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases continue to increase, driven primarily by fossil fuel extraction and use for electricity generation, industry and transport, although they are also affected by land use, land-use change, agriculture and forestry (well established). The evidence of current global climate change is unequivocal (well established). Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has increased by between approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius and 1.2 degrees Celsius (very likely). Eight of the ten warmest years on record have occurred within the past decade (virtually certain). If greenhouse gas emissions persist, global average temperatures will continue to increase at the current rate, crossing the temperature target agreed as part of the Paris Agreement between 2030 and 2052 (very likely). The Paris Agreement committed countries to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that doing so would significantly reduce the risks and impact of climate change. Current nationally determined contributions, presented in Paris in 2015, constitute only one third of the mitigation required to establish a least- cost pathway for staying well below 2 degrees Celsius (well established). {2.2, 2.7, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.3.4} To maintain a good chance of remaining well below a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, emissions need to drop by between 40 and 70 per cent globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to net zero by 2070.
{2.7.4}
Achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires transformational changes leading to deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of emission sources and sinks (established but incomplete). In addition to emissions reductions for C02 the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (also called forcers), specifically black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons, provide opportunities to limit warming in the short term and are a critical component of an integrated climate change mitigation and air-quality management programme. However, since long-lived greenhouse gases dominate climate forcing in the long term, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants in the short term needs to be combined with mitigation of long-term greenhouse gases.
(well established). {4.2.1, 5.3.4} Non-C02 emissions in pathways that limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius show deep reductions that are similar to those in pathways limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius.
Government capacity and political will to manage air pollution and climate change varies significantly (well established).
Some regions have well-developed systems of national-to-local policies and compliance and enforcement programmes (well established), although ambition levels in terms of both scope and policy may differ. In other regions, international agreements or national legislation may exist, but implementation and compliance and enforcement are often affected by weak national-to-local institutional capacity (established but incomplete). Future policy efforts can build upon renewed attention to those issues in international forums and several decades of experience with various governance strategies in different countries. Between 1998 and 2010, there was a five-fold increase in the number of national climate laws (more than 1,500 laws and policies worldwide) and by 2012 those laws covered 67 per cent of all emissions (well established). Some city and subnational governments are leading the way with benefits for other parts of their countries (well established). {5.4, 5.5,12}

2.2.2 Biodiversity
A major species extinction event, compromising planetary integrity and Earth's capacity to meet human needs, is unfolding. Biodiversity refers to the diversity of living things at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels. It helps to regulate climate, filters air and water, enables soil formation and mitigates the impact of natural disasters. It also provides timber, fish, crops, pollination, ecotourism, medicines, and physical and mental health benefits (well established). {6.1,6.4.2}

Environmental and human health are intricately intertwined, and many emerging infectious diseases are driven by activities that affect biodiversity (established but incomplete). Changes to the landscape (through natural resource extraction and use, for example) can facilitate disease emergence in wildlife, domestic animals, plants and people. Zoonoses are estimated to account for more than 60 per cent of human infectious diseases. {6.1, 13.1; boxes 6.1,13.1}
Genetic diversity is declining, threatening food security and the resilience of ecosystems, including agricultural systems and food security (well established). {6.5.1}
Populations of species are declining and species extinction rates are increasing. At present, 42 per cent of terrestrial invertebrates, 34 per cent of freshwater invertebrates and 25 per cent of marine invertebrates are considered at risk of extinction. Between 1970 and 2014, global vertebrate species population abundances declined by on average 60 per cent (well established). Steep declines in pollinator abundance have also been documented. {6.5.2}
Ecosystem integrity and functions are declining. Ten out of every fourteen terrestrial habitats have seen a decrease in vegetation productivity and just under half of all terrestrial ecoregions are classified as having an unfavourable status (well established). {6.5.3}
Native and non-native invasive species threaten ecosystems, habitats and other species. The economic costs, both direct and indirect, amount to many billions of dollars annually. {6.4.2}



Biodiversity loss is also an equity issue, disproportionately affecting poorer people, women and children. If current rates of decline continue, future generations will be deprived of the health benefits of biodiversity. The livelihoods of 70 per cent of people living in poverty directly depend on natural resources (well established). {6.1,6.6.5; boxes 6.5,13.2}
The critical pressures on biodiversity are habitat change, loss and degradation; unsustainable agricultural practices; the spread of invasive species; pollution, including microplastics; and overexploitation, including illegal logging and trade in wildlife. Illegal trade in wildlife, fisheries and forest products is worth between US$90 billion and US$270 billion per annum. There is evidence to suggest that climate change will pose the gravest threat in the future, as species, including disease vectors, migrate with temperature shifts (well established). {6.5}
Although governance efforts are progressing, greater efforts are required to achieve international objectives, such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets within the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Over 190 National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans have been submitted to the Convention, although their guality and reliability, as well their subseguent implementation, remains uneven; the Cartagena and Nagoya Protocols to the Convention provide a deeper governance context. There is increasing international collaboration between various law enforcement authorities in combatting illegal wildlife trafficking. {Annex 6-1}
The science-policy interface for biodiversity and the contribution that nature makes to people was strengthened in 2012 through the establishment of the Intergovernmental Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity are negotiating the post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Negotiations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea continue towards an agreement on the sustainable use and conservation of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction. {6.7.2, 6.7.4,13.1}
Several multilateral environmental agreements provide additional governance architecture on biodiversity, including the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The continual updating of the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species and other independent monitoring efforts, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the consideration of the multiple values of biodiversity and the inclusion of the value of biodiversity in national economic valuation methods, will support and inform the implementation thereof. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to expand ecosystem assessments to better understand the global state of ecosystems and the trends therein. {6.5.3, 6.7.4, annexes 6.1 and 13.1}
Protecting species and ecosystems requires conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources (well established). Species and ecosystems are most effectively safeguarded through the conservation of natural habitats (well established) and there is clear evidence that conservation can help to reduce biodiversity loss. Implementation, management and representative coverage of different ecosystems within protected areas remains insufficient. Less than 15 per cent of terrestrial habitats, including inland waters, and less than 16 per cent of coastal and marine areas within national jurisdiction are protected areas. {6.7.3}
Biodiversity is slowly being mainstreamed or integrated into health, gender and other equity concerns through such efforts as the 2015-2020 Gender Plan of Action under the Convention on Biological Diversity and its relationship to the Convention's Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020 and the achievement of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (well established). Indigenous peoples and local communities play a key role in biodiversity protection by offering bottom-up, self-driven and innovative solutions, based on traditional knowledge and the ecosystem approach. However, protected areas can adversely affect indigenous communities if access to natural resources within protected areas is denied. {13.1}
Ex situ conservation of genetic material provides safeguards for maintaining adaptive potential, in particular of crop and agricultural species. Gene banks and seed collections complement in situ conservation of genetic resources, yet the conservation status of genetic diversity for most wild species remains poorly documented. Yet accelerating biodiversity loss and the large, escalating costs of inaction, including numerous threats to human health, reguire an urgent increase in global investment in sustainable use and conservation, and the consistent integration of biodiversity concerns into all facets of economic and social development. {6.5.1,13.2.4}
Greater focus on strengthening governance systems; improving policy frameworks through research; policy integration; implementation; and encouraging partnerships and participation, are all measures that have the potential to address the greatest pressures on biodiversity. Efforts to combat biodiversity loss must also address poverty eradication, food security challenges, gender inequality, systemic inefficiencies and corruption in governance structures and other social variables. Identification of the countries of origin of genetic resources, in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol thereto, will help to ensure progress against the objectives of those instruments and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the commercial utilization of those resources with such countries. {6.8}

2.2.3 Oceans and coasts
The principal drivers of change facing oceans and coasts are ocean warming and acidification, ocean pollution and the increasing use of oceans, coasts, deltas and basins for food production, transportation, settlement, recreation, resource extraction and energy production (well established). The main impacts of those drivers are marine ecosystem degradation and loss, including death of coral reefs (well established), reduced marine living resources and the resulting disturbance of marine and coastal ecosystem food chains (well established), increased nutrient and sediment run-off (well established) and marine litter (established but incomplete). Those impacts interact in ways that are just beginning to be understood and their interaction may amplify their effect (Inconclusive). If left unaddressed, there is a major risk that they will combine to produce a destructive cycle of degradation and that the ocean will no longer provide many vital ecosystem services (for example, livelihoods, income, health, employment, and aesthetic, cultural and religious values).

What is happening to our environment and how have we responded?

More effective compliance, enforcement and other instruments are needed, as current efforts are not sufficient to achieve the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 14. Interventions based on emerging technologies, taking into account a precautionary approach, in accordance with international agreements (where applicable), and strategic management approaches, such as resilience-based management and ecosystem-based management, can contribute to improved conservation of marine ecosystems and marine living resources. {7.1,14,14.2.1,14.2.3,14.2.4}
A holistic, integrated monitoring and assessment of the marine environment needs to be fostered hand in hand with the implementation of pollution reduction measures to achieve and maintain the targets of ""Good Environmental Status11 of the marine environment, including harmonization of assessment criteria and methods at all levels. To be effective, such measures should be combined with actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change and reduce the input of pollution and litter to the oceans while promoting their conservation and sustainable use. {7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3}
The rate of human-induced release of greenhouse gases is driving rising sea levels, changes in ocean temperatures and ocean acidification. Coral reefs are being devastated by those changes (well established). Mass coral bleaching, induced by chronic heat, has damaged many tropical reefs beyond recovery (well established). The collective value of coral reefs has been estimated at US$29 billion per annum. The loss of coral reefs has an impact on fisheries, tourism, community health, livelihoods and marine habitats (well established). Interventions based on emerging technologies and sustainable management approaches (such as resilience-based management, integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based management) are key to building resilience and may help to preserve some areas of reef (unresolved), but Governments should prepare for a dramatic decline (if not a collapse) (well established) of coral reef-based industries and ecosystem services, as well as negative effects on food chains related to the decline and collapse of coral reefs. {7.3.1,14.2.1}
The oceans play an important role in the global economy and are likely to become increasingly important. Fisheries and aquaculture currently generate US$252 billion annually. Small-scale fisheries support the livelihoods of between 58 million and 120 million people (established but Incomplete). Fish provide 3.1 billion people with over 20 per cent of their dietary protein and contain nutrients important for their health. Ensuring the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture requires significant investment in monitoring, assessment and operations management and, in many cases, strong local community- based approaches. Investment in fisheries monitoring and gear technologies can improve selectivity of target species when harvesting and reduce habitat impact, both in ocean fisheries and aquaculture. {14.2.4}
Measures to minimize the effects of fishing on the ecosystem have had mixed success (established but incomplete). Where resource assessments and monitoring, control, and surveillance and enforcement measures are not available, overfishing and illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing continues and may be expanding (established but incomplete). {14.2.3,14.4,14.5}
Marine litter, including plastics and microplastics, is now found in all oceans, at all depths (established but incomplete). The scale and importance of the problem has received increasing attention in recent years, but there are still large gaps in knowledge. Current estimates suggest that input of plastic marine litter linked to domestic waste mismanagement in coastal areas amounts to some 8 million tonnes annually, (established but incomplete) 80 per cent of which originates from land-based sources. Marine plastic litter can result in a significant ecological impact from entanglement and ingestion, and can also act as a vector for the transport of invasive species and other pollutants (established but Incomplete). Abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear (ALDFG) is a major source of marine litter. Not only is ALDFG highly harmful, it also reduces numbers offish stock and constitutes a significant economic threat, given its ability to damage maritime vessels, fisheries and ecosystem services. {7.3.3, 7.4.3}
The growing presence and abundance of microplastics has potential adverse effects on the health of both marine organisms (established but Incomplete) and humans (unresolved). Furthermore, marine litter has a significant economic impact on a range of coastal sectors, such as tourism and recreation, shipping and yachting, fisheries, aquaculture, agriculture and human health (established but incomplete). The damage to fishing gear in Europe alone is estimated at more than US$72 million per annum and the cost of cleaning beaches is estimated at US$735 million per annum, a figure which is increasing (established but incomplete). {7.4.4}
Improving waste management, including recycling and end- of-life management, is the most urgent short-term solution to reducing input of litter to the ocean (well established). Longer-term solutions include improved governance at all levels, and behavioural and systemic changes that reduce plastic pollution from the production and use of plastic, and increase recycling and reuse.
A holistic and evidence-based approach, taking into account the full life-cycle approach to waste management should be applied. Cleaning up coasts and beaches can provide environmental, social and economic benefits, and trapping surface litter in the ocean may be effective in small areas, but such efforts should not distract from action to stop litter entering the ocean. While many relevant international agreements exist, there is no global agreement that addresses the issue of marine litter and microplastics in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Coordination and cooperation between international bodies could be enhanced to progress international agreement. {14.2.2}
Policy-sensitive indicators used to track progress in addressing key pressures and drivers may not fully capture the multiple dimensions of pressures and drivers (well established). Area- based indicators, such as Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 on the coverage of marine protected areas under national jurisdiction, do not alone establish that such areas are effectively managed; nor can they guard against the impact of climate change or pollution (well established). Efforts to develop methods to evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas and their contribution to overall ocean health are therefore critical. The lack of standardization and compatibility between the methods used and the results obtained in various bottom-up projects makes an overall assessment of the status of marine litter across large geographic areas difficult (well established). {14.3,14.3.1,14.3.2,14.3.3}
2.2.4 
Land and soil
Food production is the largest anthropogenic use of land, using 50 per cent of habitable land (well established). Livestock production uses 77 per cent of agricultural land for feed production, pasture and grazing (well established) (see figure SPM.4). Furthermore, traditional livestock provides livelihoods for many indigenous and local communities. Sustainable land management can address food security while preventing the loss of the contribution made by nature and promoting gender and social equality (established but incomplete). Adequately feeding 10 billion people by 2050 will require an increase of 50 per cent in food production (well established), while some 33 per cent of global edible food is lost or wasted, of which approximately 56 per cent occurs in developed countries (well established). Increasing productivity has slowed down the expansion of agricultural land, but inefficient or unsustainable farming systems are often associated with environmental and soil degradation and biodiversity loss (unresolved), and an increase in crop specialization and distribution can raise the risk of poor harvests. {8.5.1, 8.5.3, 8.4.1}
Securing land rights for local communities can help to turn land assets into development opportunities and secure more sustainable use of land. For most people, land is their most important asset (well established). Women represent 43 per cent of those active in agriculture, yet they hold the title to less than 20 per cent of agricultural land. Insecure access to land resources hinders sustainable land management (well established). Indigenous and other forms of community-managed land could generate billions of US dollars' worth of ecosystem benefits through, among other things, carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and erosion control (established but incomplete). Those benefits could justify securing land tenure and the right to inheritance for women and indigenous and local communities. Decreasing the gender gap in access to information and technology, and access to and control over production inputs and land, could increase agricultural productivity and reduce hunger and poverty (established but incomplete). Policies
empowering women, indigenous peoples, family farmers and pastoralists to ensure that those groups have secure access to land resources, fertilizers and other inputs, knowledge, extension services, financial services, markets, opportunities for adding value and non-farm employment can facilitate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and reduce environmental impact (established but incomplete), increase agricultural productivity and contribute to reducing poverty and hunger (well established). {8.6, 8.5.3}
Land degradation and desertification have increased (established but incomplete), with land degradation hotspots covering approximately 29 per cent of global land, where some
3.2 billion people reside (well established). Investing in avoiding land degradation and restoring degraded land makes sound economic sense and the benefits generally far exceed the costs. {8.4.2}
Whilst the pace of deforestation has slowed, it continues globally. Furthermore, although many countries are now taking steps to increase their forest cover, it is primarily being done through plantations and reforestation (well established), which may not provide the same range of ecosystem services as natural forests. {8.4.1}
Urban clusters - meaning urban centres and their suburbs - have grown by a factor of approximately 2.5 since 1975 (well established), and in 2015 accounted for 7.6 per cent of global land, affecting, among other things, the hydrological cycle and soil functions, causing urban heat islands. {8.4.1}
Achieving the land-related Sustainable Development Goals requires adequate land and water resource management
(well established). Innovative technologies, sustainable land management strategies, nature-based solutions and land- resource stewardship (such as sustainable forest management, agro-silvo-pastoral production systems, conservation agriculture, integrated crop production and agroforestry) can contribute to making agriculture sustainable. Payment for ecosystem services, land restoration and land titling need to be more effectively promoted and adopted. When compatible with local culture, such strategies contribute to better management and conservation of land resources (well established) and are integral for the reduction of hunger (Sustainable Development Goal 2). Economic incentives for agriculture, including distortive agricultural production subsidies, contribute to land degradation, and their reduction and removal will be important for the achievement of sustainable agriculture.
{8.5.1}
Sustainable land-use planning and management can protect high-quality, fertile agricultural soil from competing interests, thus maintaining land-based ecosystem services such as food production, and preventing land from flooding and disaster. Frameworks targeting land degradation, such as the Land Degradation Neutrality initiative under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, may also contribute to climate change mitigation and resilience (well established). Yet the policy framework on land management remains complex and incomplete. {8.4.1,8.5.3, 8.5.4}
2.2.5 
Fresh water
Population growth, urbanization, water pollution and unsustainable development are all increasing pressure on water resources across the world, and that pressure is further exacerbated by climate change. In most regions, slow-onset disasters, such as water scarcity, drought and famine, lead to increased migration (well established). Increasing numbers of people are also being affected by severe storms and floods. Increasing glacial and snowpack melt as a result of global warming will affect regional and seasonal water availability, especially in Asian and Latin American rivers, which provide water for some 20 per cent of the global population (well established). Changes to the global water cycle, including extreme events, are contributing to water quantity and quality problems, with impact distributed unequally across the world. {9.1,9.1.2, 9.2}
In most regions, water quality has worsened significantly since 1990, owing to organic and chemical pollution, such as pathogens, nutrients, pesticides, sediments, heavy metals, plastic and microplastic waste, persistent organic pollutants and salinity. Some 2.3 billion people (approximately 1 in 3 of the global population) still lack access to safe sanitation (likely). Approximately 1.4 million people die annually from preventable diseases, such as diarrhoea and intestinal parasites, that are associated with pathogen-polluted drinking water and inadequate sanitation (well-established). {9.5, 9.5.7, 9.5.2}
Without effective counter-measures, human illnesses due to antimicrobial-resistant infections may become a major cause of death from infectious diseases worldwide by 2050 (established but Incomplete). Water plays a key role in this, as antimicrobial- resistant bacteria are now found in sources of treated drinking water worldwide (well-established), stemming from antibiotics entering the water cycle through domestic sewage and industrial wastewater disposal, agriculture, intensive livestock rearing and aquaculture. In addition, various endocrine-disrupting chemicals are now widely distributed through the freshwater system on all continents (well established), with long-term impact on foetal underdevelopment and male infertility (established but incomplete). {9.5.1, 9.5.7}
On the positive side, 1.5 billion people gained access to basic drinking water services over the 15-year period from 2000 to 2015. However, women and girls still carry most of the physical burden of transporting water in many developing countries, reducing the time available for them to participate in productive activities and education. The positive impact of women being able to spend time on other activities should be widely acknowledged, since economic surveys indicate that they typically reinvest up to 90 per cent of their income in their families, improving family health and nutrition, and increasing access to schooling for their children. {9.7.1}
Worldwide, agriculture uses an average of 70 per cent of all fresh water withdrawals, rising to 90 per cent in many poorer countries. The competition for more water from cities and industry creates an imperative to improve the efficiency of agricultural water use while at the same time producing more food and using fewer and less harmful inputs (well established).


Many aquifers are depleting rapidly due to overabstraction for irrigation, drinking water, industrial and mining uses (established but incomplete). More sustainable management and better monitoring of surface and groundwater is urgently needed.
{9.4.2, 9.9.5}
Promoting water-use efficiency water recycling, rainwater harvesting and desalination is becoming increasingly important to ensure greater water security and more equitable water allocation for different users and uses. The agricultural sector needs substantial improvements in water-use efficiency and productivity. The industrial and mining sectors also have strong potential for increasing water-use efficiency, recycling and reuse, as well as for limiting water pollution. Broader adoption of water- sensitive urban design, including infrastructure to manage storm water, grey water, wastewater and managed aquifer recharge, would improve water management and urban water outcomes. {9.9, 9.9.3, 9.9.5}
Freshwater ecosystems are among the world's most biodiverse habitats and valuable natural infrastructures. Wetlands buffer against impact from climate change (both drought and floods) and improve water quality, but 40 per cent of all wetlands have been lost since 1970 through agricultural development, urbanization, infrastructure development and overexploitation of water resources. Severe consequences include the loss of inland fisheries, which affects the livelihoods of millions of people (likely). The total annual economic cost of wetland losses over the 15-year period from 1996 to 2011 has been estimated at US$2.7 trillion (likely). Greater investment, both public and private, would facilitate more sustainable wetland management and restoration. {9.6}
The decomposition, due to human intervention, of peatlands, a type of wetland that stores more carbon than all the world's forests combined, currently contributes approximately 5 per cent of annual global carbon emissions (established but incomplete). The thawing permafrost in boreal peatlands, agricultural conversion of some tropical peatlands and the transformation and loss of other peatlands are causing increased carbon emissions, infrastructure damage and wildfires. Protection and restoration of peatlands, including rewetting of drained peatlands, is an important climate change mitigation strategy. {9.6.2}
Innovative and integrated policy mixes are essential to manage interactions between water, food, energy, transport, climate change, human health and ecosystems. Good governance includes integrated water resource management, as illustrated by integrated flood risk management (established but incomplete), ecosystem-based approaches in subnational and transboundary basins (well established), circular economy and other approaches that promote sustainable consumption and production as one approach towards achieving sustainable development (established but incomplete) and substantive progress on decoupling water use from economic growth through increasing water efficiency (established but incomplete). Such approaches support improved land-use planning and cross- sectoral policy coordination between government departments (well established). {9.8, 9.9.4}
Social equity and gender equality remain key aspects for achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 on fresh water (well established). Enhanced participatory processes will enable greater knowledge input from local and indigenous communities into decision-making (well established). Goal 6 can only be achieved by engaging the public, private and non-governmental sectors, civil society and local actors, and by taking into account other interlinked Sustainable Development Goals. {20.3, 9.10,16.4}
Multilateral environmental agreements governing water resources and water-related ecosystem management and climate change can support the embedding of integrated water resource management in the rule of law through national and local legislation. Increased investment in the scope and rigour of standardized water data is essential to improve policy and governance for sound water management. {9.10}

2.2.6 Cross-cutting issues
Several issues cut across all environmental themes. Some, such as human health, gender, urbanization and education, relate to people and livelihoods; others, such as climate change, polar regions, mountains and environmental disasters, are concerned with changing environments; and yet others, such as the use of resources, solid waste disposal, energy, chemicals and the food system, reflect the use of resources and materials. Those topics all have Interdependent dynamics across environmental themes.
People and livelihoods
Environmental and social conditions interact to both support and damage human health (well established). Poor environmental conditions which can be changed (""modifiable conditions"") cause approximately 25 per cent of global disease and mortality (established but incomplete). In 2015, environmental pollution caused some 9 million deaths (established but incomplete), In particular from outdoor and household air pollution, but also from contaminated water (well established). Environmental health effects take a particular toll on vulnerable or disadvantaged groups related to age (children and old people), Ill-health, poverty (within and between countries) and race (established but incomplete). The risks are systemic and solutions need to be wide- ranging, tackling not only sources of pollution, but also aiming for co-benefits (established but incomplete). Major changes may be needed, with ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"" potentially being central to our understanding of genuine progress. {4.2.1}
The scale and magnitude of global consumption, especially in urban areas, is affecting global resource flows and planetary cycles. Cities and their surrounding areas will continue to grow in both population and size and to act as generators of economic growth (established but incomplete). The process and prospect of that urbanization represent an enormous challenge for existing subnational governance structures, but also provide an opportunity to Improve human well-being, with potentially decreasing environmental Impact per capita and per unit of production (inconclusive). Given the current pace of urbanization, seizing this opportunity for future benefits depends on planning decisions made today (well established). {4.2.5}
Gender equality has a multiplier effect in advancing sustainable development, environmental protection and social justice (well established). All aspects of the environment, Including drivers, pressures, Impacts, perceptions, policies and responses, are shaped by gender relations and mutually constituted considerations of gender norms and responsibilities, and they shape one another Bringing gender perspectives to bear on environmental policies and governance, especially by supporting participation, leadership and decision-making by women, ensures that new and different questions and viewpoints, as well as gender-disaggregated data, are Integrated Into environmental assessments (well established), and public resources are more likely to be directed towards human development priorities and Investments. Decreasing the gender gap In access to Information and technology can strengthen women's control over land and other resources. {4.2.3}
Education for sustainable development is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, promoting a more sustainable society and accommodating unavoidable environmental changes (well established). Significant progress has been made around the world In Implementing education for sustainable development In all educational sectors (well established). However, scaling It up Is essential so that It can be Included as a core element of education system structures globally (well established). Policies that eliminate economic and gender barriers will Improve access to education. Education for sustainable development can be scaled up by Informal and non-formal education, Including by the media. Community engagement and local (place-based) learning also have an Important role to play. {4.2.4}
Changing environments
Climate change alters weather patterns, which in turn has a broad and deep impact on the environment, economics and society, threatening the livelihoods, health, water, food and energy security of populations (well established). In turn, that Increases poverty (well established), migration, forced displacement and conflict (established but incomplete), with particular Impact on populations In a vulnerable situation (well established). Negative effects are expected, even If the current warming Is halted; for example, If the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius Is achieved, sea levels will still continue to rise. Those risks will be amplified under conditions of warming above the 1.5 degrees Celsius target established by the Paris Agreement (established). {4.3.1}
Increases in polar surface temperature are more than two times greater than the mean global temperature rise (well established). This amplified warming has cascading effects on other components of the polar climate system, with sea Ice In the Arctic retreating, permafrost thawing, snow cover extent decreasing, and Ice sheets, Ice shelves and mountain glaciers continuing to lose mass (well established). {4.3.2} In turn, those effects have global repercussions, such as accelerated global sea level rises and the disturbance of climate and weather patterns.
The number of people affected by both slow and sudden-onset environmental disasters is increasing due to compounding effects of multiple and interacting drivers. Those drivers Include climate change and environmental degradation, poverty and social Inequality, demographic change and settlement patterns, Increasing population density In urban areas, unplanned urbanization, unsustainable use of natural resources, weak Institutional arrangements, and policies which do not take risks fully Into account. Disasters undermine human security and well-being, resulting In loss and damage to ecosystems, property, Infrastructure, livelihoods, economies and places of cultural significance, forcing millions of people to flee their homes each year Disasters disproportionately affect some of the more vulnerable populations, Including women. {4.2.2}


Resources and materials
Consumption rates and linear activities (extract-make- use-dispose) have Increased resource exploitation beyond the recovery ability of ecological systems, with harmful consequences at all levels from the local to the global (established but incomplete). Globally, two out of every five people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. Inadequate and sometimes illegal practices include those related to food waste, e-waste, marine litter, waste trafficking and crime. Developed countries have policies in place to promote reduced waste and resource efficiency, while developing countries still face basic management challenges, such as uncontrolled dumping, open burning and inadequate access to services (well established). Sound policies for resource accounting and waste management in the context of broader sustainable consumption and production include a circular economy as one of the approaches to achieving sustainable development through reducing, reusing, remanufacturing and refurbishing products (■established but incomplete). {4.4.1}
Global energy consumption is expected to rise significantly during the period from 2014 to 2040 (by as much as 63 per cent, according to one estimate), much of which is attributed to expected consumption in countries that currently depend on fossil energy sources (very likely). Equity and gender Issues, such as universal access to Improved final energy services, are still a problem that Is far from being resolved. Despite the fast deployment and cost reduction of renewables and Improvements In efficiency, without further and effective, ambitious measures, energy-related greenhouse gas emissions will result In the Paris Agreement temperature targets being missed (very likely). {4.4.2}
Despite the many benefits brought to humanity, in this, the most chemical-intensive era in history, the pollution that is associated with chemicals poses a global problem, because toxic substances can spread to the most remote environments, including to receiving water systems worldwide (well established). Products In everyday use contain toxic compounds that Interfere with the health of humans, other species and the environment (well established). {4.3.3}

Multilateral environmental agreements and concerted national initiatives have made progress in addressing several of the most concerning chemicals. However, significant gaps in assessing and regulating harmful chemicals continue to exist, due, inter alia, to insufficient national legislation or enforcement to address associated risks and to missed innovation opportunities. Failure to address the risks posed by such chemicals can result in adverse impact on human health and the environment, with estimated costs amounting to hundreds of billions of US dollars (established but incomplete). Emerging Issues requiring more science-based Information, precaution, In accordance with International agreements (where applicable), and risk assessment and management Include endocrine disruption, widespread antibiotic resistance and the use of nanotechnology. Global chemical safety requires best management practice In all countries, Including the provision of access to Information and public awareness (well established). Regulations, assessment and monitoring, and Industry and consumer responsibility In Informing and substituting the use of chemicals of global concern with safer alternatives when technically and economically feasible are needed {4.3.3}.
The food system, in response to growing and changing consumer demand, is increasing pressure on local ecosystems
and the global climate (well established). Agriculture Is the largest consumer of water and, when not sustainably managed, food production Is a major driver of biodiversity loss and polluter of air, fresh water and oceans, as well as a leading source of soil degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. Changing environmental conditions and consumption patterns are both Increasing such pressures and presenting new food security challenges, reflecting malnourlshment, Including In the form of overnourishment, as well as undernourishment. Providing nourishing and sustainable food for all, as envisaged In Sustainable Development Goal 2, remains challenged by climate change, natural resource constraints, demographic trends and national capacities, and necessitates significant changes In food production, distribution, storage, processing and consumption patterns (well established). {4.4.3}
3 Effectiveness of environmental policies

Most countries have introduced environmental policies and established a governance structure for such policies, and there are now hundreds of multilateral environmental agreements in existence. Part B of GEO-6 addresses the question: ""How effective have these policy innovations and governance approaches been in addressing the problems and achieving the agreed targets?"" The analysis combines an evaluation of case studies on implemented policies with an indicator-based approach covering a diversity of policy approaches from various levels in the thematic areas of the report, including the following: {10.5,10.7}
❖ Provision of information: for example, access to data on air quality or coral reefs;
❖ Voluntary agreements: for example, voluntary reporting on the use of water, voluntary guidelines for sustainable soil management or standard-setting for best management practice and sustainability reporting;
❖ Economic incentives and market-based instruments: for example, free water allowances, individual transferable quotas for fishers, or payments for ecosystem services;
❖ Planning for the environment: for example, adaptive water management and urban biodiversity management;
❖ Promotion of innovation: for example, innovation for sustainable agriculture or financing for clean cookstoves;
❖ Regulatory approaches: for example, car exhaust emission standards or regulating wildlife trade through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora;
❖ Governance approaches that include communities, and private sector and civil society actors: for example, city actions to limit food waste or to promote community-based conservation.
Indicators for the evaluation include, for example for air, annual mean PM25 concentrations (population-weighted), ozone- depleting substance emissions and long-lived greenhouse gas emissions. The indicators address a wide range of multilateral environmental agreements and Sustainable Development Goals.
There has been innovation in environmental policies and instruments to reduce emissions and resource depletion (well established). There is no single superior approach that addresses the wide variety of barriers to sustainable development and that is applicable in all contexts. A diversity of approaches and innovation in policymaking is justified. {10.3}
Policy design is at least as important as the choice of policy instrument for policy effectiveness (well established). Common elements of good policy design include the following: (i) setting a long-term vision through inclusive, participatory design processes; (ii) establishing a baseline of environmental conditions, quantified science-based targets and milestones; (iii) effectively integrating environmental, social and economic concerns; (iv) conducting ex ante and ex post cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analysis to ensure that public and private funds are being used with optimal efficiency and effectiveness and that social aspects are being considered in sufficient detail; (v) building-in monitoring regimes during implementation that support adaptive policies, ideally involving affected stakeholders; and (vi) conducting postintervention evaluation of policy outcomes and impacts to close the loop for future policy design improvement. {11.2.3}
In many cases, environmental policymaking does not meet the suggested criteria for effective policies, meaning that it does not reach its full potential (established but incomplete).
For example, in many cases neither ex ante nor ex post cost- effectiveness analysis of policy outcomes has been attempted, making success or failure difficult to evaluate, or clear and measurable targets are missing. {Chapter 18}
Policy innovation increasingly takes place in developing countries (established but incomplete). This includes market- based and regulatory approaches that provide environmental improvements while also meeting access rights for the poor. Examples exist of environmental policy instruments that provide access to natural resources and income for the poor, such as the provision of free water in South Africa and sustainable fisheries policies in Chile. {Chapters 12 to 17}
Environmental policymaking can become more dynamic through scaling-up over time (established but incomplete). Policies are revised and improved, based on experience; for example, by increasing the level of ambition or choosing more effective instruments. However, such ratcheting-up is not applied on a systematic basis. There are few policies which have policy feedback mechanisms built in; hence the potential of temporal dynamics is not fully exploited. In many cases, no baseline of existing environmental conditions, which would be necessary for ex post or ex ante evaluation, is established. {11.2.2}
Policy diffusion between countries is increasingly taking place (well established). Successful policies serve as role models for adoption in other countries when national circumstances, priorities, capabilities and legislation allow for it. Multilateral agreements and policy networks at the subnational level serve as catalysts for policy learning between countries. However, there are indications that policy diffusion takes place more often in the field of voluntary and innovation promotion, while market-based instruments or redistributive policies, such as the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies or regulatory approaches, are less often subject to policy diffusion. {11.2.1}
Multilevel governance is a source for policy innovation (well established) at the international level and multilateral environmental agreements support environmental policymaking at the national level to pursue related policies. Stakeholder participation in all phases of the policy cycle from design to implementation to monitoring and evaluation is crucial. At the subnational level, communities, cities and the private sector are all establishing their own policy approaches, which is also supportive for advancing policies at other levels. {11.4}
An integrated approach is key for effective policies (well established). The integration of environmental concerns into the various sectors of policymaking at all levels, including agriculture, fisheries, tourism, forestry, industry, manufacturing and processing, energy and mining, transport, infrastructure and health, is key for effective protection of the environment.
Social and economic aspects require particular consideration when environmental policy is being developed. Similarly, a gender-integrative approach could support more effective and transformative environmental policies and interventions. {11.3}
There is no consistent consideration of environmental aspects in other sectors. Environmental aspects find consideration In other sectors when demonstrating economic and social co-benefits (established but incomplete). Tools for ex ante assessment can reveal potential co-benefits. For example, ""green investment"" of just 2 per cent of global gross domestic product would deliver long-term growth over the period from 2011 to 2050 that could be at least as high as an optimistic business-as- usual scenario, while minimizing the adverse impact of climate change, water scarcity and the loss of ecosystem services. Although analyses such as strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and assessments of natural resources are increasingly being carried out, their potential has not yet been fully exploited. Environmental integration is insufficient If there are no benefits to other sectors or If costs are Imposed on Influential groups while benefits are widely dispersed In society (well established). Departments of the environment are often too weak to enforce environmental policy Integration. Effective legal, procedural and Institutional mechanisms for environmental policy Integration are not widely applied or Implemented (well established). {11.3, 11.3.3}
An analysis of policy-related indicators shows that despite considerable innovation and effort in advancing environmental policies, the efforts and effects to date remain insufficient (well established). Existing policies have proven Insufficient to address the backlog of environmental problems, and policy gaps remain In the agenda areas of pollution control, efficiency Improvement and planning for the environment. Besides more ambitious and better-designed policies, urgent action Is needed, as resource depletion and growing emissions have a partially Irreversible Impact on ecosystems, human health and economic costs.
{Chapters 12 to 17}
To pursue the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieve the internationally agreed environmental goals on pollution control, clean-up and efficiency improvements will not be sufficient (established but incomplete). Instead, transformative change, in the sense of reconfiguration of basic social and production systems and structures, Including their Institutional framework, social practices, cultural norms and values, Is necessary. Transformative change enables and combines visionary, strategic and Integrated policymaking with the enabling of bottom- up social, technological and Institutional Innovation and the systematic use of experience drawn from such experimentation. {Chapter 18}
Successful models of environmental governance should be built upon well-designed policies and their implementation, compliance and enforcement. Such models should pay close attention to early signals from science and society and ensure adequate oversight capacity and Investment In knowledge systems, such as data, Indicators, assessments, policy evaluation and sharing platforms. Greater Investment Is needed In environmental accounting systems to ensure that external costs are addressed and that processes are Incorporated that will Identify possible future risks, opportunities and conflicts. {Chapter 18}
Greater application of the precautionary approach, in accordance with international agreements (where applicable), can reduce environmental risk. Coalitions between government Institutions, businesses and civil society to agree on pathways for tackling societal risks can achieve progress, even In conditions of great uncertainty. Multilevel coordination between local and national policy levels will be Instrumental In accelerating the transition towards sustainable development models. {Chapter 18}


4 Changing the path we are on
4.1 The need for urgent, sustained and inclusive action
Without additional policies, trends in environmental degradation are projected to continue at a rapid rate and the related Sustainable Development Goal targets and internationally agreed environmental goals are not expected to be achieved, including on climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, excess nutrient run-off, land degradation and ocean acidification (well established). Current patterns of consumption, production and inequality are not sustainable, adding to other severe environmental pressures. Many environmental indicators are projected to move in the wrong direction. Projected population growth, urbanization trends and economic development will significantly increase demand for natural resources, such as food, energy and water, towards 2050. Under a business-as-usual scenario, resource efficiency in production and consumption, agricultural yields and nutrient use, water and energy efficiency are projected to increase, thereby partially offsetting demand for key environmental resources. However, such improvements will be inadequate to reduce the pressure on already-stressed environmental systems. {21.3.1–21.3.5}
Indicators related to human development are projected to improve, but trends are insufficient to meet related targets (established but incomplete). Improvements are projected on global hunger, and access to safe drinking water, adequate sanitation and modern energy services, but significant inequality of access remains, and those improvements are not expected to take effect quickly enough for many countries to achieve the related Sustainable Development Goal targets. Preventable environment-related health risk factors are projected to remain prominent in 2030. Related global child mortality is projected to decrease, but not sufficiently for many developing countries to achieve the related Development Goal target, in particular in sub- Saharan Africa. Furthermore, air pollution is expected to continue to contribute to millions of premature deaths in the coming decades. {21.3.2, 21.3.3, 21.3.4, 21.3.6}
Overall, the world is not on track to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals by 2050. Urgent action is now needed to reverse those trends and restore both environmental and human health to the planet (established but incomplete). Future projections show that development is either too slow to achieve the targets or even that it moves in the wrong direction (see figure SPM.8). Continuing failure to take urgent action is leading to ongoing and further potentially irreversible adverse impact, including on critical environmental resources and human health. {Section 2.2} Current patterns of consumption and production may be more expensive in the long term for many countries, as it often costs more to clean up later than it does to prevent damage now, added to which cleaning up later may not always be possible. For example, a further delay in climate action increases the cost of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, and at some point will make it impossible to achieve them.
{21.3.3, 21.4, 24.4}
4.2 Transformative change and an integrated approach are needed
Pathways exist that show that the healthy planet needed for sustainable development can be achieved (established but incomplete). The literature includes many scenarios that provide information on the ways in which the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals can be achieved.
Those pathways emphasize a number of key transitions in moving towards a healthy planet. They are associated with achieving sustainable consumption and production patterns for energy, food and water in order to provide universal access to those resources, while preventing climate change, air pollution, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, water scarcity, and overexploitation and pollution of oceans. They include changes in lifestyle, consumption preferences and consumer behaviour on the one hand, and cleaner production processes, resource efficiency and decoupling, corporate responsibility and compliance on the other hand. {22.3}
Transformative changes are needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements and related internationally agreed environmental goals. They go beyond what can be achieved by environmental policies alone (established but incomplete). The rate of change in the pathways indicates that incremental environmental policies alone will not suffice. A mix of social and technological improvements and innovations is required, facilitated by effective policy measures and cooperation on a scale from the local to the international. {22.4.1}
Meeting the targets related to climate change, reducing air pollution and providing sustainable energy for all is possible. Measures can be combined in different ways but need to be implemented rapidly and at an unprecedented scale (well established). It involves investment in energy access, enhancing the development and implementation of energy-efficiency improvements, lifestyle changes, a more rapid introduction of low greenhouse gas-emission technologies (including sustainable and eguitably-produced bioenergy, hydropower, solar, wind and carbon-capture-and-storage), air pollution control and reducing emissions and increasing removals from land use and land-use change and forestry of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (including non-C02 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture). Pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement are characterized by a reduction of carbon intensity in the global economy of 4 to 6 per cent per annum between now and 2050 (compared with 1 to 2 per cent per annum historically), which would reduce energy system greenhouse gas emissions to almost zero by 2050. {22.3.2}
Eliminating hunger, preventing biodiversity loss and halting land degradation is possible by combining measures related to consumption, production, waste and redistribution of food, and nature conservation policies (established but incomplete). Scenarios achieving those social and environmental targets are typically characterized by a 50 per cent faster improvement in agricultural yields than a business-as-usual scenario, but depend heavily on changes on the consumption side and improvements in food distribution. Plaiting biodiversity loss would also require measures related to landscape management and protected areas. Ecological infrastructure can buffer farmers and rural and urban communities against climate shocks such as droughts and floods, mitigate water pollution and increase water supply, while at the same time protecting biodiversity. Sustainable agriculture also requires a reduction in the nitrogen and phosphorus imbalance to reduce pollution of freshwater systems, groundwater and coastal zones in oceans. Reducing water scarcity requires more efficient water use, increasing water storage and investing in desalination. Ambitious scenarios in the literature typically show higher water- use efficiency rates than in business-as-usual scenarios, but still fail to reach full water security. {22.3.1,22.3.3, 22.3.4}
Synergies exist between specific measures and a broad range of sustainability targets, including measures related to education, promoting sustainable consumption, specifically a healthy diet and reducing air pollution (well established). Improved education, especially for women and girls, has a particularly strong connection with health outcomes, economic growth, reduced poverty and better environmental management. Meat products require more land than crops (see figure SPM.4). Therefore, promoting sustainable and healthy diets, reducing food waste in both developing and developed countries, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices would contribute towards meeting the nutritional needs of the 9-10 billion people projected to be on the planet in 2050. In doing so, synergies could be realized between improving health and nutrition, while reducing biodiversity loss, advancing habitat restoration and preventing land degradation and water scarcity. Phasing out the use of fossil fuels and moving towards lower-carbon-emission fuels, including sustainable bioenergy, would lead to important cobenefits, achieving both climate and air-quality targets, the latter also having synergies with improving human health, increasing agricultural production and reducing biodiversity loss. {22.4.2}
There are also potential trade-offs between achieving different sustainability targets. Land-based climate change mitigation, namely bioenergy crop production, and agricultural intensification are key measures for achieving climate and food targets respectively, but could have significant detrimental effects on other environmental targets if not managed carefully (well established). While nearly all scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement rely on land-based mitigation measures, their use increases demand for land and could thus have a potentially massive influence on land-use patterns and eventually lead to higher food prices, which would in turn affect food security. Increasing agricultural yields would improve overall food availability and reduce pressure on natural land. Applying unsustainable agriculture practices could lead to land degradation, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. {22.4.2}

Understanding the interlinkage between measures and targets is crucial for synergistic implementation and policy coherence
(well established). Integrated approaches would enable synergies to be grasped and potential trade-offs to be dealt with so that environmental targets could be achieved simultaneously. {22.4.2}
4.3 Innovation for systemic transformation to achieve environmental goals
Coordinated and ambitious policy coupled with social and technological innovation, could enable the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, related multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (established, but incomplete). Transformative pathways to sustainable development reguire the following:
(i) vision to guide systemic innovation towards sustainability;
(ii) social and policy innovation; (iii) phasing-out of unsustainable practices; (iv) policy experimentation; and (v) engaging and enabling diverse actors, including local and indigenous people. Integrated approaches can help to deal with the synergies and potential trade-offs between the various policies and measures.
A vision for sustainable development and leadership can energize popular support. Examples of integrated policies for achieving sustainability goals include providing economic incentives, including the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies, improving price structures and introducing taxes to internalize social and environmental costs. {24.3}
Transformative projects and innovative solutions exist that could collectively help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, the aims of multilateral environmental agreements and internationally agreed environmental goals (unresolved). Social, policy and technological innovation is needed. At the local level, many transformative projects and innovative solutions already exist that could be scaled appropriately. Reviewing bottom-up initiatives reveals ideas, actions and programmes that seek to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and involve a wide range of public and private stakeholders, including the following: (i) nature-based solutions, including those that draw on indigenous knowledge, such as ecological infrastructure and ecological restoration; (ii) monitoring and reporting innovations, including Earth observation systems, for better information on environmental conditions, citizen science initiatives that involve citizens in environmental monitoring and which involve decentralization of technologies to educate and engage citizens (for example, web applications that allow citizens to monitor water quality and report problems to relevant government agencies), and natural capital accounting that integrates economic, social and environmental components;
(iii) circular and sharing economy innovations that involve the increased efficiency of resource use, specifically through new business models that better engage with waste products of other production processes and innovations related to the peer-to-peer sharing of goods and services; (iv) innovations and policies that help to reduce toxic substances and solid waste, including plastic waste; (v) improving public awareness and building relevant skills through sustainability and environmental education; (vi) an emphasis on gender equality, the empowerment of women and solutions that promote the fair treatment of all, from the local level to the global arena; and (vii) smart, sustainable cities that, for example, use modern digital technologies to engage and connect with citizens in addressing key sustainability challenges for cities, such as transportation, consumption patterns, energy, nutrition, water and waste management. {17.7, 23.11.1}

Financial investment and engagement of individuals, businesses and other non-governmental stakeholders are critical to the achievement of this agenda (established, but incomplete). Unsustainable products and industrial processes could be phased out by introducing the following: (i) new regulatory mechanisms setting standards (for example, securing land tenure rights); (ii) financial mechanisms to boost sustainability investment (for example, on rural electrification), improve chemical use efficiency and minimize harmful chemicals, and to account for both market and non-market risks and impact;
(iii) environmental education and education for sustainable development to enhance awareness and competencies for sustainability-driven consumer choices, entrepreneurship, greater corporate social responsibility and promoting viable business models; (iv) exploration and promotion of pathways that provide opportunities for all stakeholders to participate in a well-being economy; (v) overcoming the inertia of existing unsustainable technologies and vested interests and (vi) economic instruments that set a price on pollution. {23.11,24.3}
Transformative change requires adaptive policy, the creation of an enabling environment for niche innovations and the removal of barriers to change (established, but incomplete). Political, institutional and lifestyle changes can enable a sustainable and inclusive transition to environmental sustainability. Local- scale policy experiments provide space for policy tailoring and innovation that is closely monitored, and also allow for the inclusion of systems of local and indigenous knowledge for improved environmental management. Redress for environmental degradation through legal mechanisms such as access to courts and justice also provide an important mechanism for ensuring inclusive access to a clean and healthy environment for all. {23.11,24.2}
Participatory approaches can help decision-makers and non-State actors to identify and pursue innovative solutions towards sustainability (established but incomplete). Participatory and grassroots approaches could provide a useful set of initiatives and aspirational visions, pathways and solutions from stakeholders to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements. That includes inclusive innovation, in which power and decision-making is relatively decentralized and externalities are internalized. Furthermore, such approaches can highlight gaps and blind spots in distributional equity, responsibility and capacity to address global environmental problems and their solutions. Participatory approaches can help to deliver context-relevant solutions. For example, decentralized renewable energy and microgrids fit neatly into many bottom-up sustainable visions that challenge traditionally modelled large- scale, centralized energy transitions. Accounting for regional differences, gender and other demographics are important for assessing and addressing problems, including the need for disaggregated data. Sustainable Development Goal policy design and implementation requires alignment of the collective wellbeing of actors from the local to other levels, taking into account in particular the needs of the vulnerable and most marginalized in society. Information and communications technology can drive change, if risks such as privacy are minimized. {23.9.2, 23.14, 24.3.5}
Strengthened international cooperation, including support to least developed countries, is needed to tackle this agenda (well established). International cooperation and support, coupled with financial commitment and international funding, are critical If this agenda Is to be achieved. Effective governance solutions to improve multilevel and multi-country cooperation and harmonization across scales include improved management of interdependencies to reduce Interregional inequalities. Bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral environmental treaties are important governance mechanisms for achieving inclusive and sustainable development across knowledge systems. {11.4,19.1,23, 14}
4.4 The benefits that will result from following more sustainable future pathways
Investments in policies that address environmental issues promote human health and well-being, prosperity and resilient societies (well established). Mobilizing financial resources for sustainable development Is necessary to resolve environmental problems and ensure environmental protection, especially In developing countries. Sustainable future pathways are intended to create a ""healthy planet, healthy people"". A healthy planet will result In people who live longer, healthier lives: nearly one quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations In a vulnerable situation and in developing countries. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets on hunger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services could reduce deaths in children under 5 related to malnutrition, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections by more than 400,000 per year by 2030. Furthermore, air pollution is the largest environmental health risk and is projected to continue to have significant negative effects on health, with scenario studies estimating between 4.5 million and 7 million premature deaths by mid-century under a business-as-usual scenario. Combined climate and air pollution policies could reduce those numbers significantly. {5.4.1, 21.3.3, 21.3.6, 22.3.2, 22.3.5, 23.12, 24.4}
Improved health outcomes have significant economic benefits (through a larger and healthier labour force), as well as demographic implications (established but incomplete). The health co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants can outweigh the costs of mitigation. For example, global health savings for reaching a 2 degrees Celsius target are estimated to be approximately US$54 trillion, compared with global policy costs of approximately US$22 trillion. Decreased child and maternal mortality, especially when combined with female education and access to sexual and reproductive health services, Including modern contraception, is likely to lead to lower fertility rates in the longer term, curbing population growth, one of the major drivers of environmental degradation, thus highlighting the fact that healthy people can also support a healthy planet. {2.3, 22.3.5, 24.4}

5. Knowledge for action



5.1 Improved data and greater knowledge enable better and more effective actions and solutions in more places
Though actions must be undertaken on the basis of the knowledge already at hand, the world needs openly accessible data, information, analysis, knowledge and science to better inform and guide what needs to be done to achieve sustainability across all environmental dimensions (established but incomplete). Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, internationally agreed environmental goals and science-based targets will require an integrated approach that considers linkage across different environmental and non-environmental components, building upon disaggregated data generation and incorporating traditional knowledge and citizen science. Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets needs to be followed up upon and reviewed, using the global indicators, complemented by indicators at the national and regional levels, and work is needed to develop the baselines for those targets for which national and global baseline data do not yet exist. Integrated data and analysis can prioritize needs, shape effective policies and strengthen monitoring and evaluation outcomes. {3.1,25.1}
Advances in collecting official statistics and other evidence that feed into geographic information systems for environmental monitoring and accounting have expanded knowledge, while highlighting data gaps in every environmental domain (well established). Such gaps limit our capacity to formulate and implement policy solutions. More data will assist in linking people with the environment. Time series data is vitally important in that regard, as it forms the basis for monitoring change. Regular standardized data collection can be translated into statistics and indicators that highlight vulnerabilities within and between communities. Disaggregated data that captures information by gender, ethnicity, race, income, age and geographic region identify critical differences and promote effective policy design. {3.5, 3.7}
In addition to filling knowledge gaps with new data, enormous gains can be made from consolidating, curating, harmonizing and increasing open access to existing data which are widely dispersed and cannot be easily combined or compared (well established). Common frameworks, initiatives and political will are needed to merge data sources and make better use of what is available. In that context, the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and the System of National Accounts are robust consensus statistical frameworks and methodological approaches that could be broadly adopted (see figure SPM.9). Rationalizing both existing and newly collected data is essential for the development of indicators. {3.3}
Whether an indicator can be measured by Earth observation is a major factor in data availability (well established). A revolution in the quality and cost-effectiveness of Earth observation data means that indicators that can be measured remotely have far greater spatial coverage than those that cannot. For example, satellites can estimate deforestation and land use change with increasing accuracy, but cannot monitor all aspects of subsurface ocean environments. Data are particularly sparse for biodiversity, which is measured mostly by in situ observation and genetic analysis. Some freshwater components, such as groundwater and water use, are also data-deficient due to measurement challenges. The dichotomy in the volume of remotely sensed data versus in situ data will Inevitably grow as Earth observation technologies improve. {3.4}
More inclusive and open access to data will assist in achieving equity, transparency and best use of data for sustainability and development (established but incomplete). The ""open data"" movement has gained significant traction in recent years, working towards data being freely available to all. Education is a key component of access and countries should be forward-thinking in building capacity to analyse and Interpret environmental data. For many measures, there is a strong Imbalance In data access between developed and developing countries. That contributes to global differences In the ability of nations to understand the environment, its Implications for human health and the use of environmental data for socioeconomic gain. {25.2.2}
5.2 Opportunities from emerging data sources and the Earth-human systems modelling revolution
Emerging data sources, such as Earth observation and Earth-human systems models, when combined with socioeconomic data and contextual analysis, can enable better policy decisions towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and multilateral environmental agreements (established but incomplete). ""Big data"", generated through new approaches and technologies, is emerging as a valuable resource which can Inform environmental assessment processes. Evolving artificial intelligence and technological analytics, including algorithms, programming and mechanical methods, can advance evidence-based Information for decision-making, forming part of what some refer to as the ""fourth Industrial revolution"". There is enormous potential for advancing environmental knowledge if big data can be effectively harnessed and Interrogated. Stronger collaboration between the public and private sectors, especially large corporations involved In big data collection, are critical for promoting economically viable and equitable solutions. Protocols for big data use are continually being developed and refined, but the extreme pace at which big data Is evolving creates the potential for misinterpretation and misuse, raising Issues of ethics, privacy and protection, for which urgent policy attention Is required. {25.1.2}
Future sensor technology should allow detailed data disaggregation of spatial and demographic information
(established but incomplete). A combination of satellites and airborne and ground-based networks can help to monitor developments and Impact at the local, regional and global levels in near-real time. The resulting data and Information, together with rapidly emerging digital infrastructure, can enable rapid response to changing circumstances. Realizing those benefits, however, depends on appropriate governance and national circumstances for data collection, processing, curation and use, along with combining environmental data with context-relevant socioeconomic information. {25.1.2}

While Earth observation is the primary contributor to remotely-sensed big data, citizen science enables timely, cost-effective collation of in situ data from dispersed sources
(well established). When coupled with emerging technologies, such as smart sensors, mobile devices and web applications, citizen science enables the collection and analysis of large volumes of geographically-referenced data to Inform and support decision-making, educate the public about environmental issues and enhance public participation. There are, however, significant challenges in ensuring that citizen science data are of appropriate quality, representative, can be soundly analysed and that results are effectively disseminated. {25.1.1}
Traditional knowledge is a globally underutilized resource which can complement science-based knowledge (well established). In 2007, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples helped indigenous peoples to document, revive and strengthen their knowledge, but capacity-building Is needed to develop practices for managing the collection of information and the Integration of traditional knowledge with other knowledge systems. Collaborative work between traditional knowledge holders, academia and Governments has led to Innovative processes, procedures and tools for data generation, and knowledge production and enrichment, which can help In understanding and caring for the environment. {25.1.3}
Importantly, data gaps will be an ongoing reality for the foreseeable future and should not delay urgent action (well established). Decision-makers at all levels cannot wait for new data before acting, but should Implement evidence-based management from current knowledge, then be adaptive and responsive as new knowledge becomes available. Governments and society need to embrace the evolving data landscape, facilitate the development of new Information technology skills and adopt a holistic approach In utilizing both existing and emerging data and knowledge tools. {25.2.4}
International cooperation and sharing of data and information resulting from observational networks on Earth and in space are key to success (well established). Continued Investment in education and training of the next generation of experts and decision-makers Is essential for maintaining the pace of progress on the multigenerational challenges associated with the ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"" theme of GEO-6. {25.3}
5.3 The way forward
The sixth Global Environmental Outlook has set out many of the challenges and opportunities faced by the world today, moving forward from today to 2030 and beyond that to 2050.
The ongoing revolution In data and knowledge of all types at the local, national and multinational levels offers an opportunity to Increase our capacity to address environmental and governance challenges and accelerate progress. Most Important Is the need to take bold, urgent, sustainable and inclusive action that Integrates environmental, economic and social activity on pathways to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, Internationally agreed environmental goals and other science-based targets.

Executive Summary


Executive summary - Emissions Gap Report 2020
 


Introduction
This eleventh edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report has been produced in a year where the COVID-19 crisis has dominated the news and policymaking and has caused immense suffering and economic and social disruption worldwide. This economic disruption has briefly slowed - but far from eliminated - the historic and ever-increasing burden of human activity on the Earth's climate. This burden is observable in the continuing rise in extreme weather events, including wildfires and hurricanes, and in the melting of glaciers and ice at both poles. The year 2020 has set new records - they will not be the last.
As in previous years, this report assesses the gap between estimated future global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges and the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between ""where we are likely to be and where we need to be"" is known as the 'emissions gap'.
The report also examines two areas that are highly relevant for bridging the gap and which have become even more relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: the shipping and aviation sectors, where international emissions are not covered by nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and lifestyle change.
Reflecting the unusual circumstances, the 2020 report deviates from its usual approach of exclusively considering consolidated data from previous years as the basis for assessment. To maximize its policy relevance, preliminary assessments of the implications of the pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures are included throughout the report.
Are we on track to bridging the gap? Absolutely not.
Although 2020 emissions will be lower than in 2019 due to the COVID-19 crisis and associated responses, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, with the immediate reduction in emissions expected to have a negligible long-term impact on climate change. However, the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 economic recovery measures presents the opening for a low-carbon transition that creates the structural changes required for sustained emissions reductions. Seizing this opening will be critical to bridging the emissions gap.

The United Nations Secretary-General is calling on governments to use COVID-19 recovery as an opportunity to create more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. Aligned with this, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has stressed that governments could integrate and specify some of their post-COVID-19 recovery plans and policies in their new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies, both of which countries are requested to submit in 2020.
The most significant and encouraging development in terms of climate policy in 2020 is the growing number of countries that have committed to achieving net-zero emissions goals by around mid-century. These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. The litmus test of these announcements will be the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030.
As in previous years, the 2020 Emissions Gap Report has been guided by a distinguished steering committee and prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.
   GHG emissions continued to increase • in 2019.
► Global GHG emissions continued to grow for the third consecutive year in 2019, reaching a record high of 52.4 GtC02e (range: ±5.2) without land-use change (LUC) emissions and 59.1 GtC02e (range: ±5.9) when including LUC.
► Fossil carbon dioxide (C02) emissions (from fossil fuels and carbonates) dominate total GHG emissions including LUC (65 per cent) and consequently the growth in GHG emissions. Preliminary data suggest that fossil C02 emissions reached a record 38.0 GtC02 (range: ±1.9) in 2019.
► Since 2010, GHG emissions without LUC have grown at 1.3 per cent per year on average, with preliminary data suggesting a 1.1 percent increase in 2019. When including the more uncertain and variable LUC emissions, global GHG emissions have grown 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, with a more rapid increase of 2.6 per cent in 2019 due to a large increase in vegetation forest fires. LUC emissions account for around 11 per cent of the global total, with the bulk of the emissions occurring in relatively few countries.
► Over the last decade, the top four emitters (China, the United States of America, EU27+UK and India) have contributed to 55 per cent of the total GHG emissions without LUC. The top seven emitters (including the Russian Federation, Japan and international transport) have contributed to 65 per cent, with G20 members accounting for 78 per cent. The ranking of countries changes dramatically when considering per capita emissions (figure ES.2).
► There is some indication that the growth in global GHG emissions is slowing. However, GHG emissions are declining in Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies and increasing in non-OECD economies. Many OECD economies have had a peak in GHG emissions, with efficiency improvements and growth in low-carbon energy sources more than offsetting the growth in economic activity. Despite improving energy efficiency and increasing low-carbon sources, emissions continue to rise in countries with strong growth in energy use to meet development needs.
► There is a general tendency that rich countries have higher consumption-based emissions (emissions allocated to the country where goods are purchased and consumed, rather than where they are produced) than territorial-based emissions, as they typically have cleaner production, relatively more services and more imports of primary and secondary products. In the 2000s, the gap between consumption and production was growing in rich countries but stabilized following the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Even though rich countries have had higher consumption-based emissions than territorial-based emissions over the last decade, both emission types have declined at similar rates.



C02 emissions could decrease by about • 7 per cent in 2020 (range: 2-12 per cent) compared with 2019 emission levels due to COVID-19, with a smaller drop expected in GHG emissions as non-C02 is likely to be less affected. However, atmospheric concentrations of GHGs continue to rise.
► The reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 due to COVID-19 is likely to be significantly larger than the
1.2 per cent reduction during the global financial crisis in the late 2000s. Studies indicate that the biggest changes have occurred in transport, as COVID-19 restrictions were targeted to limit mobility, though reductions have also occurred in other sectors (figure ES.3).
► Although C02 emissions will decrease in 2020, the resulting atmospheric concentrations of major GHGs (C02, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N20)) continued to increase in both 2019 and 2020. Sustained reductions in emissions to reach net- zero C02 are required to stabilize global warming, while achieving net-zero GHG emissions will result in a peak then decline in global warming.

   The COVID-19 crisis offers only a short- • term reduction in global emissions and will not contribute significantly to emissions reductions by 2030 unless countries pursue an economic recovery that incorporates strong decarbonization.
► Assessments of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures on emissions by 2030 are still few and highly uncertain. However, this report provides explorative projections based on available studies (figure ES.4).
► The impact of the general slowdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery responses is expected to reduce global GHG emissions by about 2-4 GtC02e by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario (figure ES.4 - current trends scenario). This assumes a pronounced short-term dip in C02 emissions, after which emissions follow pre-2020 growth trends.
► If the initial short-term dip in C02 emissions is followed by growth trends with lower decarbonization rates due to countries' potential rollback of climate policies as part of COVID-19 responses, the decrease in global emissions by 2030 is projected to be significantly smaller at around 1.5 GtC02e and may actually increase by around 1 GtC02e (figure ES.4 - rebound to fossil fuels second-hit and single-hit scenarios, respectively) compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario.
► Global GHG emissions are only projected to be significantly reduced by 2030 if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue strong decarbonization (figure ES.4 - IEA sustainable recovery scenario). This could result in global GHG emissions of 44 GtC02e by 2030, a reduction of 15 GtC02e (just over 25 per cent) by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario.
► There is a significant opportunity for countries to integrate low-carbon development in their COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures, and to incorporate these into new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies that are scheduled to be available in time for the reconvened twenty- sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) in 2021.

 The growing number of countries that are • committing to net-zero emissions goals by around mid-century is the most significant and encouraging climate policy development of 2020. To remain feasible and credible, it is imperative that these commitments are urgently translated into strong near-term policies and action, and are reflected in the NDCs.
► At the time of completing this report, 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global GHG emissions have net-zero goals that are formally adopted, announced or under consideration. If the United States of America adopts a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, the share would increase to 63 per cent.
► The following G20 members have net-zero emissions goals: France and the United Kingdom, which have legally enshrined their 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goals; the European Union, which aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; China, which announced plans to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060; Japan, which announced a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050; the Republic of Korea, the president of which committed the country to becoming carbon neutral by 2050 in a speech to parliament; Canada, which has indicated its intention to legislate a goal of net- zero emissions (though it is unclear if this refers to just C02 or all GHGs) by 2050; South Africa, which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050; and Argentina and Mexico, which are both part of the UNFCCC Climate Ambition Alliance working towards net-zero emissions by 2050.
► 
There has been limited progress of G20 members in terms of providing formal submissions to the UNFCCC by 2020 of mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies and new or updated NDCs. As at mid-November 2020, nine G20 members (Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) have submitted long-term low GHG development strategies to the UNFCCC, all of which were submitted before net-zero emissions goals were adopted. No G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC target.
► Although the recent announcements of net- zero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030. Furthermore, there is inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those projected under current NDCs by 2030, and, more importantly, those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
► To make significant progress towards achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two steps are urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, and second, new and updated NDCs need to become consistent with the net-zero emissions goals.

Collectively, G20 members are projected to overachieve their modest 2020 Cancun Pledges, but they are not on track to achieve their NDC commitments. Nine G20 members are on track to achieve their 2030 NDC commitments, five members are not on track, and for two members there is a lack of sufficient information to determine this.
▶ In line with previous Emissions Gap Reports, this report pays close attention to G20 members, as they account for around 78 per cent of global GHG emissions and thereby largely determine global emission trends and the extent to which the 2030 emissions gap will be closed.
▶ Collectively, the G20 members are projected to overachieve their 2020 Cancun Pledges, even without considering the expected impact of COVID-19. According to the latest pre-COVID-19 scenario studies, South Africa is now projected to likely achieve its Cancun Pledge. The United States of America is also projected to achieve its Cancun Pledge, though only when the expected impact of COVID-19 is considered. It is still unlikely or uncertain whether Canada, Indonesia, Mexico and the Republic of Korea will achieve their Cancun Pledges, even when COVID-19 implications are considered.
Collectively, the G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDC commitments based on pre-COVID-19 projections. Nine of the 16 G20 members (counting the EU27+UK as one), are on track (Argentina, China, EU27+UK, India, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Turkey). Five G20 members are projected to fall short and therefore require further action (Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America). Projections for Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are inconclusive.
The impacts of COVID-19 and economic recovery measures on 2030 emissions of individual G20 members may be significant, although estimates are still highly uncertain and vary across the few studies available.

The emissions gap has not been narrowed compared with 2019 and is, as yet, unaffected by COVID-19. By 2030, annual emissions need to be 15 GtCO e (range: 12–19 GtCO e) change mitigation pathway that starts long-term reductions from 2020. These are calculated from 22 the scenarios that were compiled as part of the lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for a 2°C goal, and 32 GtCO2e (range: 29–36 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.5°C goal. Collectively, current policies fall short 3 GtCO2e of meeting ▶ the level associated with full implementation of the unconditional NDCs.
▶ The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2°C, 1.8°C or 1.5°C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated global total GHG ▶ emissions resulting from a full implementation of the NDCs.
▶ The three temperature scenarios allow for various interpretations of ‘well below 2°C’, by covering the ▶ entire range of below 2°C to below 1.5°C (table ES.1). Each scenario considers a least-cost climate mitigation pathway assessment of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C.
The NDC and current policies scenarios are based on updated data provided by 10 modelling groups. As at mid-November 2020, none of the major emitters have submitted new or updated NDCs with stronger targets for 2030. Overall, NDC target updates from 2019 are expected to reduce total emissions by less than 1 per cent by 2030.
Collectively, 2030 emission levels fall short of what the NDCs imply: the deficit is about 3 GtCO2e under the unconditional NDC scenario, and about 5 GtCO2e under the conditional NDC scenario.
The emissions gap between estimated global total emissions by 2030 under the NDC scenarios and under pathways limiting warming to below 2°C and 1.5°C is large (see figure ES.5). Full implementation of unconditional NDCs is estimated to still result in a gap of 15 GtCO2e (range: 12–19 GtCO2e) by 2030 compared with the below 2°C scenario. ▶ The emissions gap between implementing the unconditional NDCs and the below 1.5°C pathway is about 32 GtCO2e (range: 29–36 GtCO2e). Full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs would reduce each of these gaps by around 3 GtCO2e.
▶ Since there have been no updates to the temperature scenarios and only minor updates to the NDC scenarios, the estimated emissions gap
remains unchanged from 2019. Similarly, the gap is as yet unaffected by COVID-19.
However, the current policies scenario is likely to be affected by COVID-19. As shown in figure ES.4, current projections imply effects on 2030 emissions ranging from +1 GtCO2e to -15 GtCO2e compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario shown in figure ES.5. This could bring emissions by 2030 to below the levels associated with the NDC scenarios. A reduction in global GHG emissions of 15 GtCO2e would bring 2030 emissions within the range consistent with least- cost scenarios that keep global warming to below 2°C, but not in line with 1.5°C.



7 Current NDCs remain seriously inadequate • to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and would lead to a temperature increase of at least 3°C by the end of the century. Recently announced net-zero emissions goals could reduce this by about 0.5°C, provided that short-term NDCs and corresponding policies are made consistent with the net-zero goals.
► A dramatic strengthening of ambition is needed if the Paris Agreement goals are to be achieved. In line with the findings of previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report, countries must collectively increase their NDC ambitions threefold to get on track to a 2°C goal and more than fivefold to get on track to the 1.5°C goal.
► The lack of sufficient mitigation action to date has added significantly to the challenge of meeting the Paris Agreement goals. Global average emissions reductions required per year to meet emission levels by 2030 that are consistent with the 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios have increased remarkably. By now, they are approximately more than double and four times what they would have been respectively had serious collective climate action started in 2010. Failure to significantly reduce global emissions by 2030 will make it impossible to keep global warming below 1.5°C.
► Unconditional NDCs are consistent with limiting warming to 3.2°C by the end of the century (66 per cent probability). If both conditional and unconditional NDCs are fully implemented, this estimate is 0.2°C lower. The pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario, on the other hand, results in higher emissions by 2030, which unless strengthened would result in an average global temperature rise of 3.5°C by 2100.
► COVID-19 containment measures have significantly reduced global GHG emissions in 2020. However, unless these are followed by economic rescue and recovery measures that support a low-carbon transition, this dip in global GHG emissions is estimated to result in no more than a 0.01°C reduction of global warming by 2050, which by then is expected to have exceeded 1.5°C.
► The temperature projections change when considering the potential effects of the recently announced net-zero emissions goals. Preliminary estimates suggest that, collectively, these goals could further lower the temperature projections consistent with unconditional NDCs by about half a degree Celsius to around 2.7°C. If the United States of America also adopts a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, projections until the end of the century are estimated to be 0.6°C-0.7°C lower in aggregate compared with the global warming estimate for current unconditional NDCs, i.e. around 2.5-2.6°C.
8 COVID-19-related fiscal spending by • governments is of unprecedented scale, currently amounting to roughly US$12 trillion globally, or 12 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. For G20 members, fiscal spending amounts to around 15 per cent of GDP on average for 2020.
► To date, most governments have focused on funding rescue measures to protect lives and businesses in their immediate economic response to COVID-19, with some including conditions that encourage businesses to decarbonize. Given the varied COVID-19 impacts and response timelines, some governments are also starting to fund recovery measures to reinvigorate their economies.
► There are large disparities in fiscal spending around the world. Average fiscal spending of G20 members currently hovers around 15 per cent, reaching as high as 40 per cent for some members. For middle-income and developing countries, however, this figure is much lower at less than 6 per cent of GDP.
9 So far, the opening for using fiscal rescue and • recovery measures to stimulate the economy while simultaneously accelerating a low- carbon transition has largely been missed. It is not too late to seize future opportunities, without which achieving the Paris Agreement goals is likely to slip further out of reach.
► As at October 2020, COVID-19 fiscal spending has primarily supported the global status quo of high- carbon economic production or had neutral effects on GHG emissions. While it is understandable that immediate rescue measures were directed to incumbent industry, later rescue and recovery measures could have supported low-carbon development, without forsaking opportunities for economic gain.
► Based on four main trackers of COVID-19 fiscal investments, few G20 members have put words into action in terms of low-carbon rescue and recovery measures (i.e. those resulting in reduced GHG emissions). Around one-quarter of G20 members have dedicated shares of their spending (up to 3 per cent of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures. For most, spending has been predominantly high- carbon (implying net negative effects on GHG emissions) or neutral (having no discernible effects on GHG emissions). In a number of cases, it is still unclear what effect countries' measures will have on GHG emissions (figure ES.6).
► Policies with positive impacts on reducing GHG emissions have been slightly more prevalent in fiscal recovery measures than rescue measures. This is noteworthy, as the next stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating that there is potential for increased implementation of low-carbon measures.
► It is still in the hands of policymakers whether global economic rescue and recovery responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to decreased or increased global GHG emissions in the longer term. The future can still be shaped through decisions yet to be made on the composition and implementation of announced recovery packages and future recovery actions.
   Early COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery • measures provide valuable insight for policymakers designing measures for the immediate future.
► Many fiscal rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support rapid, employment-intensive and cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition. Broad categories include:
• support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, for example, low-carbon and renewable energy, low-carbon transport, zero- energy buildings and low-carbon industry
• support for research and development of zero- emissions technologies
• fossil fuel subsidies through fiscal reform
• nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation.
► Conversely, some fiscal rescue and recovery measures are likely to perpetuate high-carbon and environmentally damaging development. These include:
• fossil fuel-based infrastructure investments or fiscal incentives for high-carbon technologies and projects
• waivers or rollbacks of environmental regulations
• bailouts of fossil fuel-intensive companies without conditions for low-carbon transition or environmental sustainability (such as airlines, internal combustion automotive companies, industrial industries and fossil energy companies).
  Domestic and international shipping and • aviation currently account for around 5 per cent of global C02 emissions and are projected to increase significantly. International emissions from shipping and aviation are not covered under the NDCs and, based on current trends, are projected to consume between 60 and 220 per cent of allowable C02 emissions by 2050 under IPCC illustrative 1.5°C scenarios (figure ES.7).
► Combined, the shipping and aviation sectors currently account for approximately 2 GtC02 per year (distributed evenly across the two sectors) and emissions have increased in the past decades. About 71 per cent of the C02 emissions from shipping and 65 percent of emissions from aviation are international and are not included in national totals reported to the UNFCCC but are instead added as memo items. International emissions are not covered under the NDCs of most signatories to the Paris Agreement. However, because ships and aircraft are often active on both domestic and international routes, there are synergies in addressing domestic and international shipping and aviation emissions.
H Current policy frameworks to address I • emissions are weak and additional policies are required to bridge the gap between the current trajectories of shipping and aviation and GHG emissions pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Changes in technology, operations, fuel use and demand all need to be driven by new policies.
► International aviation currently intends to meet its International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) goals through heavily relying on carbon offsets, which do not represent absolute reductions, but at best provide time to transition to low-carbon fuels and implement energy efficiency improvements. At worst, offsets create a disincentive for investment in sector decarbonization and delay the necessary transition. Current carbon offsetting is therefore not a long-term solution and its role should only be temporary.
► Improvements in technology and operations can improve the fuel efficiency of transport if policies incentivize them, but projected increases in demand (even considering potential impacts of the current global COVID-19 pandemic) mean that the improvements will not result in decarbonization and absolute reductions of CO2 for either the aviation or shipping sectors.
▶ Both sectors, will therefore need to maximize their energy efficiency while rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels. Although there are technologically mature production processes for non-fossil fuels, rapid scale-up of new production and supply chains is required and hinges on policies to mandate the use of these fuels, as their costs are much higher.
▶ Biofuels and synthetic kerosene from biomass or CO2 and hydrogen have lower carbon footprints than fossil hydrocarbon fuels, provided the biomass is sourced sustainably. These are probably the most realistic fuel alternatives for aviation and shipping in the short to medium term, but will compete with other uses, such as road transport.
▶ Long-term fuel alternatives, such as electricity or (CO2 -free) hydrogen will require different aircraft and ship designs and will likely only be applicable for certain purposes.
▶ Regardless of the feedstock and process, the cost of fuel will increase severalfold, raising the overall cost of both aviation and shipping. This will likely suppress demand, especially for aviation, which may ultimately be the most effective means to manage the sector’s emissions.
13. Lifestyle changes are a prerequisite for sustaining reductions in GHG emissions
▶ For ships, CO2-free ammonia is an option, given
that a ship’s design is less constrained than that of a plane in terms of volume, fuel mass and safety. ▶
▶ The hydrogen feedstock used in ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbon fuel will only present net benefits if the production is powered by renewable electricity, CO2 is produced from non-fossil sources, or CO2 is removed from the atmosphere.
and for bridging the emissions gap. Around two thirds of global emissions are linked
to the private household activities according to consumption-based accounting. Reducing emissions through lifestyle changes requires changing both broader systemic conditions and individual actions.
Lifestyle emissions are influenced by social and cultural conventions, the built environment and financial and policy frameworks. Governments have a major role in setting the conditions under which lifestyle changes can occur, through shaping policy, regulations and infrastructure investments. At the same time, it is necessary for citizens to be active participants in changing their lifestyles through taking steps to reduce personal emissions and fostering societal change as consumers, citizens, owners of assets and members of communities. The participation of civil society is necessary to bring about wider changes in the social, cultural, political and economic systems in which people live.

Lifestyle emissions are linked to many sources and sectors. Foremost among these are mobility, residential and food, each of which contributes close to 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions, thus implying strong mitigation potential in these ▶ areas. For example, foregoing one long-haul return flight has the potential to reduce annual personal emissions by 1.9 tCO2e per capita on average. Home energy emissions can be tackled through improving existing and new housing stock. The use of renewable electricity by households could also reduce emissions by approximately 1.5 CO2 per capita per year for those on higher incomes.
In terms of food, shifting consumption towards low-carbon diets has strong emissions reduction ▶ potential. Moving to a vegetarian diet, for example, could reduce emissions by an average of 0.5 tCO2e per capita per year.
▶ There are numerous examples of good practices in both the developing and developed world that show it is possible to lead more sustainable lifestyles. Such examples include: replacing domestic short-haul flights with rail journeys and providing incentives and the infrastructure necessary for cycling and car-sharing, while restricting petrol cars; improving the energy efficiency of housing and renewable energy defaults from grid providers; ensuring the provision of low-carbon food in the public sector and developing policies to reduce food waste.

14. Equity is central to addressing lifestyles. The emissions of the richest 1 per cent of the global population account for more


Compliance with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement will require reducing consumption emissions to a per capita lifestyle footprint of around 2–2.5 tCO2e by 2030. This means that the richest 1 per cent would need to reduce their current emissions by at least a factor of 30, while per capita emissions of the poorest 50 per cent could increase by around three times their current levels on average (figure ES.8).
COVID-19 has provided insight into how rapid lifestyle changes can be brought about by governments (who must create conditions that make lifestyle changes possible), civil society actors (who must encourage positive social norms and a sense of collective agency for lifestyle changes) and infrastructure (which must support behaviour changes). The lockdown period in many countries may be long enough to establish new, lasting routines if supported by longer- term measures. In planning the recovery from COVID-19, governments have an opportunity to catalyse low-carbon lifestyle changes by disrupting entrenched practices.

UNEP-2020-7.txt,"Emissions Gap Emissions Gap Report 2020   This glossary is compiled according to the Lead Authors of the Report drawing on glossaries and other resources available on the websites of the following organizations, networks and projects: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and World Resources Institute.  As the world deals with the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis has not gone away. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions hit a new high in 2019. The year 2020 is on course to be the warmest on record. Wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc while glaciers melt at unprecedented rates. The pandemic-linked economic slowdown is expected to cause a drop of up to 7 per cent in carbon dioxide emissions this year. However, as the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2020 shows, this dip will have an insignificant impact on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2∞C, and pursuing 1.5∞C, unless the international community prioritizes a green recovery. The report says that the expected 2020 fall in emissions translates to a 0.01∞C reduction of global warming by 2050. Overall, we are heading for a world that is 3.2∞C warmer by the end of this century, even with full implementation of unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. There is good news in the finding that a green pandemic recovery could shave up to 25 per cent off the emissions we would expect to see in 2030 with implementation of unconditional NDCs ≠ bringing the world close to the 2∞C pathway. The report identifies recovery measures to deliver these cuts while supporting other environmental, social and economic goals. These include direct support for zero-emissions technologies and infrastructure, reducing fossil fuel subsidies, and backing nature-based solutions ≠ including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation.  carbon neutrality by 2060, South Africa by 2050, and the Japanese and European Union net-zero GHG target of midcentury ≠ they are yet to be reflected in updated NDCs. Governments must go greener in the next stage of COVID-19 fiscal interventions and increase their NDC ambitions in 2021. The report finds that stronger action must include facilitating, encouraging and mandating changes in consumption behaviour by individuals and the private sector ≠ enabling consumers to avoid high-carbon consumption by, for example, redesigning cities, making housing more efficient and promoting better, less wasteful diets. The wealthy bear the greatest responsibility in this area. The combined emissions of the richest 1 per cent of the global population account for more than twice the combined emissions of the poorest 50 per cent. This elite will need to reduce their footprint by a factor of 30 to stay in line with the Paris Agreement targets. The pandemic is a warning that we must urgently shift from our destructive development path, which is driving the three planetary crises of climate change, nature loss and pollution. But it is clearly also a major opportunity. I urge governments, businesses and individuals ≠ particularly those with the greatest climate footprint ≠ to take this opportunity to protect our climate and nature for decades to come.  Some G20 members have already announced green recovery measures. Yet COVID-19 fiscal spending, as at October 2020, had overwhelmingly supported the status quo or fostered new high-carbon investments. While there have also been stronger pledges on climate ≠ including China targeting  Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme  XIII   Emissions Gap Report 2020 Executive summary ≠ Emissions Gap Report 20Introduction This eleventh edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report has been produced in a year where the COVID-19 crisis has dominated the news and policymaking and has caused immense suffering and economic and social disruption worldwide. This economic disruption has briefly slowed ≠ but far from eliminated ≠ the historic and ever-increasing burden of human activity on the Earth's climate. This burden is observable in the continuing rise in extreme weather events, including wildfires and hurricanes, and in the melting of glaciers and ice at both poles. The year 2020 has set new records ≠ they will not be the last. As in previous years, this report assesses the gap between estimated future global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges and the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. This difference between ""where we are likely to be and where we need to be"" is known as the `emissions gap'. The report also examines two areas that are highly relevant for bridging the gap and which have become even more relevant in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic: the shipping and aviation sectors, where international emissions are not covered by nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and lifestyle change. Reflecting the unusual circumstances, the 2020 report deviates from its usual approach of exclusively considering consolidated data from previous years as the basis for assessment. To maximize its policy relevance, preliminary assessments of the implications of the pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures are included throughout the report. Are we on track to bridging the gap? Absolutely not. Although 2020 emissions will be lower than in 2019 due to the COVID-19 crisis and associated responses, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, with the immediate reduction in emissions expected to have a negligible long-term impact on climate change. However, the unprecedented scale of COVID-19 economic recovery measures presents the opening for a low-carbon transition that creates the structural changes required for sustained emissions reductions. Seizing this opening will be critical to bridging the emissions gap.  The United Nations Secretary-General is calling on governments to use COVID-19 recovery as an opportunity to create more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies. Aligned with this, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has stressed that governments could integrate and specify some of their post-COVID-19 recovery plans and policies in their new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies, both of which countries are requested to submit in 2020. The most significant and encouraging development in terms of climate policy in 2020 is the growing number of countries that have committed to achieving net-zero emissions goals by around mid-century. These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. The litmus test of these announcements will be the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. As in previous years, the 2020 Emissions Gap Report has been guided by a distinguished steering committee and prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.  1. GHG emissions continued to increase in 2019.    Global GHG emissions continued to grow for the  third consecutive year in 2019, reaching a record  high of 52.4 GtCO2e (range: ±5.2) without land-use  change (LUC) emissions and 59.1 GtCO2e (range:  ±5.9) when including LUC.    Fossil carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (from  fossil fuels and carbonates) dominate total  GHG emissions including LUC (65 per cent) and  consequently the growth in GHG emissions.  Preliminary data suggest that fossil CO2 emissions  reached a record 38.0 GtCO2 (range: ±1.9) in 2019.    Since 2010, GHG emissions without LUC have  grown at 1.3 per cent per year on average, with  preliminary data suggesting a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. When including the more uncertain and variable LUC emissions, global GHG emissions have grown 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, with a more rapid increase of 2.6 per cent in 2019 due to a large increase in vegetation forest fires. LUC emissions account for around 11 per cent of the global total, with the bulk of the emissions occurring in relatively few countries. ▶ Over the last decade, the top four emitters (China, the United States of America, EU27+UK and India) have contributed to 55 per cent of the total GHG emissions without LUC. The top seven emitters (including the Russian Federation, Japan and international transport) have contributed to 65 per cent, with G20 members accounting for 78 per cent. The ranking of countries changes dramatically when considering per capita emissions (figure ES.2). ▶ There is some indication that the growth in global GHG emissions is slowing. However, GHG emissions are declining in Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies and  increasing in non-OECD economies. Many OECD economies have had a peak in GHG emissions, with efficiency improvements and growth in low-carbon energy sources more than offsetting the growth in economic activity. Despite improving energy efficiency and increasing low-carbon sources, emissions continue to rise in countries with strong growth in energy use to meet development needs. ▶ There is a general tendency that rich countries have higher consumption-based emissions (emissions allocated to the country where goods are purchased and consumed, rather than where they are produced) than territorial-based emissions, as they typically have cleaner production, relatively more services and more imports of primary and secondary products. In the 2000s, the gap between consumption and production was growing in rich countries but stabilized following the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. Even though rich countries have had higher consumption-based emissions than territorial-based emissions over the last decade, both emission types have declined at similar rates.    2. CO2 emissions could decrease by about 7 per cent in 2020 (range: 2≠12 per cent)  compared with 2019 emission levels due  to COVID-19, with a smaller drop expected  in GHG emissions as non-CO2 is likely to    be less affected. However, atmospheric  concentrations of GHGs continue to rise.    The reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 due to  COVID-19 is likely to be significantly larger than the  1.2 per cent reduction during the global financial  crisis in the late 2000s. Studies indicate that the  biggest changes have occurred in transport,  as COVID-19 restrictions were targeted to limit mobility, though reductions have also occurred in other sectors (figure ES.3). Although CO2 emissions will decrease in 2020, the resulting atmospheric concentrations of major GHGs (CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) continued to increase in both 2019 and 2020. Sustained reductions in emissions to reach netzero CO2 are required to stabilize global warming, while achieving net-zero GHG emissions will result in a peak then decline in global warming.  3. The COVID-19 crisis offers only a short-term reduction in global emissions and will  not contribute significantly to emissions  reductions by 2030 unless countries pursue  an economic recovery that incorporates  strong decarbonization.      Assessments of the implications of the COVID-pandemic and associated recovery measures  on emissions by 2030 are still few and highly  uncertain. However, this report provides explorative  projections based on available studies (figure ES.4).    The impact of the general slowdown of the economy  due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated   rescue and recovery responses is expected to  reduce global GHG emissions by about 2≠4 GtCO2e  by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current  policies scenario (figure ES.4 ≠ current trends  scenario). This assumes a pronounced short-term  dip in CO2 emissions, after which emissions follow  pre-2020 growth trends.    If the initial short-term dip in CO2 emissions  is followed by growth trends with lower  decarbonization rates due to countries' potential  rollback of climate policies as part of COVID-19  responses, the decrease in global emissions by  2030 is projected to be significantly smaller at  around 1.5 GtCO2e and may actually increase  by around 1 GtCO2e (figure ES.4 ≠ rebound to fossil fuels second-hit and single-hit scenarios, respectively) compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. Global GHG emissions are only projected to be significantly reduced by 2030 if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue strong decarbonization (figure ES.4 ≠ IEA sustainable recovery scenario). This could result in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCO2e by 2030, a reduction of 15 GtCO2e ( just over 25 per cent) by 2030 compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. There is a significant opportunity for countries to integrate low-carbon development in their COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures, and to incorporate these into new or updated NDCs and long-term mitigation strategies that are scheduled to be available in time for the reconvened twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 26) in 2021.   4. The growing number of countries that are committing to net-zero emissions goals by    around mid-century is the most significant  and encouraging climate policy development  of 2020. To remain feasible and credible, it  is imperative that these commitments are  urgently translated into strong near-term  policies and action, and are reflected in  the NDCs.    At the time of completing this report, 126 countries  covering 51 per cent of global GHG emissions  have net-zero goals that are formally adopted,  announced or under consideration. If the United  States of America adopts a net-zero GHG target   by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate  plan, the share would increase to 63 per cent.    The following G20 members have net-zero  emissions goals: France and the United Kingdom,  which have legally enshrined their 2050 net-zero  GHG emissions goals; the European Union, which  aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050;  China, which announced plans to achieve carbon  neutrality before 2060; Japan, which announced  a goal of net-zero GHG emissions by 2050;   the Republic of Korea, the president of which  committed the country to becoming carbon neutral  by 2050 in a speech to parliament; Canada, which  has indicated its intention to legislate a goal of net-  zero emissions (though it is unclear if this refers  to just CO2 or all GHGs) by 2050; South Africa,  which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions  by 2050; and Argentina and Mexico, which are  both part of the UNFCCC Climate Ambition Alliance  working towards net-zero emissions by 2050.  There has been limited progress of G20 members in terms of providing formal submissions to the UNFCCC by 2020 of mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies and new or updated NDCs. As at mid-November 2020, nine G20 members (Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America) have submitted long-term low GHG development strategies to the UNFCCC, all of which were submitted before net-zero emissions goals were adopted. No G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC target. Although the recent announcements of netzero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030. Furthermore, there is inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those projected under current NDCs by 2030, and, more importantly, those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To make significant progress towards achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two steps are urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, and second, new and updated NDCs need to become consistent with the net-zero emissions goals. 5. Collectively, G20 members are projected to overachieve their modest 2020 Cancun Pledges, but they are not on track to achieve their NDC commitments. Nine G20 members are on track to achieve their 2030 NDC commitments, five members are not on track, and for two members there is a lack of  sufficient information to determine this.    In line with previous Emissions Gap Reports, this  report pays close attention to G20 members, as  they account for around 78 per cent of global GHG  emissions and thereby largely determine global  emission trends and the extent to which the 2030  emissions gap will be closed.    Collectively, the G20 members are projected to  overachieve their 2020 Cancun Pledges, even  without considering the expected impact of   COVID-19. According to the latest pre-COVID-19  scenario studies, South Africa is now projected  to likely achieve its Cancun Pledge. The United  States of America is also projected to achieve its  Cancun Pledge, though only when the expected  impact of COVID-19 is considered. It is still unlikely or uncertain whether Canada, Indonesia, Mexico and the Republic of Korea will achieve their Cancun Pledges, even when COVID-19 implications are considered. Collectively, the G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDC commitments based on pre-COVID-19 projections. Nine of the 16 G20 members (counting the EU27+UK as one), are on track (Argentina, China, EU27+UK, India, Japan, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa and Turkey). Five G20 members are projected to fall short and therefore require further action (Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America). Projections for Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are inconclusive. The impacts of COVID-19 and economic recovery measures on 2030 emissions of individual G20 members may be significant, although estimates are still highly uncertain and vary across the few studies available.  6. The emissions gap has not been narrowed compared with 2019 and is, as yet, unaffected by COVID-19. By 2030, annual emissions need to be 15 GtCO2e (range: 12≠19 GtCO2e) lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for a 2∞C goal, and 32 GtCO2e (range: 29≠36 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.5∞C goal. Collectively, current policies fall short 3 GtCO2e of meeting  the level associated with full implementation of the unconditional NDCs.    The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the  difference between global total GHG emissions  from least-cost scenarios that keep global  warming to 2∞C, 1.8∞C or 1.5∞C with varying levels  of likelihood and the estimated global total GHG   emissions resulting from a full implementation of  the NDCs.    The three temperature scenarios allow for various  interpretations of `well below 2∞C', by covering the   entire range of below 2∞C to below 1.5∞C (table  ES.1). Each scenario considers a least-cost climate change mitigation pathway that starts long-term reductions from 2020. These are calculated from the scenarios that were compiled as part of the mitigation pathway assessment of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5∞C. The NDC and current policies scenarios are based on updated data provided by 10 modelling groups. As at mid-November 2020, none of the major emitters have submitted new or updated NDCs with stronger targets for 2030. Overall, NDC target updates from 2019 are expected to reduce total emissions by less than 1 per cent by 2030. Collectively, 2030 emission levels fall short of what the NDCs imply: the deficit is about 3 GtCO2e under the unconditional NDC scenario, and about 5 GtCO2e under the conditional NDC scenario. The emissions gap between estimated global total emissions by 2030 under the NDC scenarios and    under pathways limiting warming to below 2°C and 1.5°C is large (see figure ES.5). Full implementation of unconditional NDCs is estimated to still result in a gap of 15 GtCO2e (range: 12–19 GtCO2e) by 2030 compared with the below 2°C scenario. The emissions gap between implementing the unconditional NDCs and the below 1.5°C pathway is about 32 GtCO2e (range: 29–36 GtCO2e). Full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs would reduce each of these gaps by around 3 G tCO2e. ▶ Since there have been no updates to the temperature scenarios and only minor updates to the NDC scenarios, the estimated emissions gap   remains unchanged from 2019. Similarly, the gap is as yet unaffected by COVID-19. ▶ However, the current policies scenario is likely to be affected by COVID-19. As shown in figure ES.4, current projections imply effects on 2030 emissions ranging from +1 GtCO2e to -15 GtCO2e compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario shown in figure ES.5. This could bring emissions by 2030 to below the levels associated with the NDC scenarios. A reduction in global GHG emissions of 15 GtCO2e would bring 2030 emissions within the range consistent with least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to below 2°C, but not in line with 1.5°C.     7. Current NDCs remain seriously inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement and would lead to a temperature increase of at least 3oC by the end of the century. Recently announced net-zero emissions goals could reduce this by about 0.5oC, provided that short-term NDCs and corresponding policies are made consistent with the net-zero goals.    A dramatic strengthening of ambition is needed if  the Paris Agreement goals are to be achieved. In  line with the findings of previous editions of the  Emissions Gap Report, countries must collectively  increase their NDC ambitions threefold to get on  track to a 2∞C goal and more than fivefold to get on  track to the 1.5∞C goal.    The lack of sufficient mitigation action to date has  added significantly to the challenge of meeting the  Paris Agreement goals. Global average emissions  reductions required per year to meet emission  levels by 2030 that are consistent with the 2∞C and  1.5∞C scenarios have increased remarkably. By  now, they are approximately more than double and  four times what they would have been respectively  had serious collective climate action started  in 2010. Failure to significantly reduce global  emissions by 2030 will make it impossible to keep  global warming below 1.5∞C.  plan, projections until the end of the century are estimated to be 0.6∞C≠0.7∞C lower in aggregate compared with the global warming estimate for current unconditional NDCs, i.e. around 2.5≠2.6∞C.  8. COVID-19-related fiscal spending by governments is of unprecedented scale, currently amounting to roughly US$12 trillion globally, or 12 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. For G20 members, fiscal spending amounts to around 15 per cent of GDP on average for 2020.    To date, most governments have focused on  funding rescue measures to protect lives and  businesses in their immediate economic response  to COVID-19, with some including conditions that  encourage businesses to decarbonize. Given the  varied COVID-19 impacts and response timelines,  some governments are also starting to fund  recovery measures to reinvigorate their economies.    There are large disparities in fiscal spending  around the world. Average fiscal spending of G20  members currently hovers around 15 per cent,  reaching as high as 40 per cent for some members.  For middle-income and developing countries,  however, this figure is much lower at less than per cent of GDP.    Unconditional NDCs are consistent with limiting  9. warming to 3.2∞C by the end of the century (66 per cent probability).

Domestic and international shipping and aviation currently account for around 5 per cent of global CO2 emissions and are projected to increase significantly. International emissions from shipping and aviation are not covered under the NDCs and, based on current trends, are projected to consume between 60 and 220 per cent of allowable CO2 emissions by 2050 under IPCC illustrative 1.5∞C scenarios (figure ES.7).    Combined, the shipping and aviation sectors  currently account for approximately 2 GtCO2 per  year (distributed evenly across the two sectors)  and emissions have increased in the past decades.  About 71 per cent of the CO2 emissions from  shipping and 65 per cent of emissions from aviation  are international and are not included in national  totals reported to the UNFCCC but are instead  added as memo items. International emissions are  not covered under the NDCs of most signatories  to the Paris Agreement. However, because ships  and aircraft are often active on both domestic  and international routes, there are synergies in  addressing domestic and international shipping  and aviation emissions.  12. Current policy frameworks to address emissions are weak and additional policies are required to bridge the gap between the current trajectories of shipping and aviation and GHG emissions pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Changes in technology, operations, fuel use and demand all need to be driven by new policies.    International aviation currently intends to meet  its International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  goals through heavily relying on carbon offsets,  which do not represent absolute reductions, but at  best provide time to transition to low-carbon fuels  and implement energy efficiency improvements.

Long-term fuel alternatives, such as electricity or (CO2-free) hydrogen will require different aircraft and ship designs and will likely only be applicable for certain purposes.  Both sectors, will therefore need to maximize their  energy efficiency while rapidly transitioning away from fossil fuels. Although there are technologically mature production processes for non-fossil fuels, rapid scale-up of new production and supply chains is required and hinges on policies to mandate the use of these fuels, as their costs are much higher.  Regardless of the feedstock and process, the cost of fuel will increase severalfold, raising the overall cost of both aviation and shipping. This will likely supress demand, especially for aviation, which may ultimately be the most effective means to manage the sector's emissions.  Biofuels and synthetic kerosene from biomass or CO2 and hydrogen have lower carbon footprints than fossil hydrocarbon fuels, provided the biomass is sourced sustainably. These are probably the most realistic fuel alternatives for aviation and shipping in the short to medium term, but will compete with other uses, such as road transport. For ships, CO2-free ammonia is an option, given that a ship's design is less constrained than that of a plane in terms of volume, fuel mass and safety. The hydrogen feedstock used in ammonia and synthetic hydrocarbon fuel will only present net benefits if the production is powered by renewable electricity, CO2 is produced from non-fossil sources, or CO2 is removed from the atmosphere.  13. Lifestyle changes are a prerequisite for sustaining reductions in GHG emissions and for bridging the emissions gap. Around two thirds of global emissions are linked to the private household activities according to consumption-based accounting. Reducing emissions through lifestyle changes requires changing both broader systemic conditions and individual actions.    Lifestyle emissions are influenced by social and  cultural conventions, the built environment and  financial and policy frameworks. Governments  have a major role in setting the conditions under  which lifestyle changes can occur, through shaping  policy, regulations and infrastructure investments.  At the same time, it is necessary for citizens to  be active participants in changing their lifestyles  through taking steps to reduce personal emissions   Emissions Gap Report 2020  and fostering societal change as consumers,  ensuring the provision of low-carbon food in the  citizens, owners of assets and members of  public sector and developing policies to reduce  communities.

The economic disruption has briefly slowed ≠ but far from eliminated ≠ the historic and ever-increasing burden of our activity on the Earth's climate. This burden is manifested in the continuing rise in extreme weather events, including wildfires and hurricanes, and in the melting of glaciers and of ice at both the poles. This year, Arctic sea ice cover shrank to its second lowest extent since the beginning of modern record-keeping (National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] 2020), the USA is about to break the record on climate-related weather events costing more than US$1billion each (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2020) and 2020 is on course to become the warmest year on record globally (CarbonBrief 2020). The year 2020 has set new records: they will not be the last.  to create more sustainable, resilient and inclusive societies (United Nations 2020). Aligned with this, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has stressed that governments can integrate and specify some of their post-COVID-19 recovery plans and policies in their new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as well as in their long-term mitigation strategies ≠ both of which countries are requested to submit this year (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2020). The most significant and encouraging climate policy development of 2020 is the growing number of countries that have announced net-zero emissions goals around the middle of this century. These commitments are broadly consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goal, provided they are achieved globally. The litmus test of these announcements will be the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. 1.2 Focus and approach of the report  It is clear that global carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2020 will experience a sizeable drop compared with 2019 levels as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Yet, enhanced climate ambition and action remain as urgent as ever. Although 2020 GHG emissions will decline, GHG concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise (World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 2020) and the immediate reduction in emissions caused by COVID-19 lockdown measures is assessed to have a negligible longterm impact on climate change (Forster et al. 2020). How governments around the world respond to COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 recovery will be critical to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The unprecedented scale of COVID-19 economic recovery measures offers an opening for a low-carbon transition that creates the structural changes required for sustained emission reductions. Seizing this opening will be essential to bridging the emissions gap. The United Nations Secretary-General is calling on governments to use COVID-19 recovery as an opportunity  Each year, the Emissions Gap Report provides an updated assessment of the gap between estimated future global GHG emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges, and the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2∞C and pursuing 1.5∞C. This difference between where we will likely be and where we need to be is known as the `emissions gap'. The reports also look at opportunities for bridging the emissions gap. This year, the report focuses on three areas that are highly relevant for our ability to bridge the gap and that have become even more pertinent in the wake of COVID-19: i) the role of COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures in the global transition to decarbonization; ii) the role and opportunities for reducing emissions from the shipping and aviation sectors, where international emissions are not covered by the NDCs; and iii) the role of lifestyle change in decarbonization.   Emissions Gap Report 2020  Reflecting the unusual circumstances of 2020, this year's report deviates from its usual approach of exclusively considering consolidated data from previous years as the basis for assessment. To maximize its policy relevance, preliminary assessments of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures are included throughout the report. As in previous years, this Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team consisting of 51 leading scientists from 35 expert institutions across 18 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The assessment process has been overseen by a distinguished steering committee and has been transparent and participatory. All chapters have undergone an extensive external review process. In addition, the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report in order to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings. 1.3 Structure of the report The report is organized into six chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions and G20 member progress towards their Cancun  Pledges in 2020 and their NDCs in 2030. In addition, it considers the potential implications of COVID-19 on G20 emissions projections. Chapter 3 updates the assessment of the likely emissions gap in 2030. Furthermore, the chapter provides a preliminary assessment of how COVID-19 and associated rescue and recovery measures may impact global GHG emissions in 2030 under various scenarios. The chapter then looks at the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Chapter 4 assesses the size and extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date can be said to support low-carbon or high-carbon development. It also outlines emerging lessons for governments in the pursuit of a low-carbon economic recovery. The two final chapters of this year's report cover areas that have received limited attention in previous Emissions Gap Reports, but that receive much international attention and have been particularly affected by COVID-19. Chapter 5 looks at the trends and opportunities for decarbonizing the shipping and aviation sectors, with a particular focus on international transport. Finally, chapter 6 assesses the role and opportunities for reducing GHG emissions through lifestyle and behavioural change, paying particular attention to inequalities in per capita emissions within and across countries and the systemic changes necessary to support and induce lifestyle change.   2 Global emissions trends and G20 status and outlook   2.1 Introduction This chapter assesses the latest trends in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the progress of G20 members towards both the Cancun Pledges for 2020 and nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for 2025 and 2030. Throughout the chapter, the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on emissions in 2020 and by 2030 are considered. The chapter is organized as follows: section 2.2 takes stock of the current trends in total global GHG and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel use and industry-related sources. These trends are discussed in the context of global peaking of emissions and general economic trends. Sections 2.3 and 2.4 assess G20 members' progress, both collectively and individually, towards their Cancun Pledges and NDCs.1 The assessment covers all individual G20 members and regions, including the European Union and its three individual Member States (France, Germany and Italy), as well as the United Kingdom (hereafter EU27+UK) as one member.2 Section 2.5 provides an update of announced net-zero emissions goals and the implications for short- to medium-term action in the context of new and updated NDCs.  All GHG emission figures in this report are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),3 unless otherwise noted. With regard to historical emissions data, section 2.2 uses globally consistent and independent data sets rather than officially reported United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory reports, whereas sections 2.3 and 2.4 use UNFCCC inventory reports when comparing historical emissions to individual G20 members' NDC targets. Please see Annex I for more information about the definitions of scenarios, GWPs and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) accounting used in the chapter. The methodology and preliminary findings of this chapter were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.  1 Turkey has not ratified the Paris Agreement, so its 2030 target remains an intended nationally determined contribution (INDC). Hereinafter, both INDCs and NDCs are referred to as NDCs, except when specifically referring to Turkey's INDC. 2 The United Kingdom has left the European Union but is in a transition period until the end of 2020, during which the NDC submitted by the European Union still applies to it. 3 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions made at the twenty-fourth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 24) in Katowice, where Parties agreed to use GWPs from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) for reporting reasons. However, a full switch to using AR5 GWPs in this report is not yet possible as the literature is still not up to date on this decision.  Emissions Gap Report 2020  2.2 Current global emissions: status and trends 2.2.1 GHG emissions up to 2019 Global trends GHG emissions grew in 2019 for the third consecutive year, indicating that the slowdown in emissions growth during 2015 and 2016 was short-lived (figure 2.1). Since 2010, GHG emissions (excluding land-use change (LUC)) have grown 1.4 per cent per year on average, with preliminary data suggesting a 1.1 per cent increase in 2019. When including the more uncertain and variable emissions from LUC, global GHG emissions also grew 1.4 per cent per year since 2010 on average, but increased a more rapid 2.6 per cent in 2019  due to a significant increase in forest fires, particularly in Asia and the Amazon. GHG emissions4 reached a record high of 52.4 GtCO2e (range: ±5.2) in 2019 without LUC emissions and increased by 5.5 GtCO2 (range: ±2.6) when including the more uncertain LUC, which pushes the total to 59.1 GtCO2e (range: ±5.9) (figure 2.1). Land-use emission estimates used in this report are based on the average of two separate models (leading to higher overall emissions) (Friedlingstein et al. 2019) and included CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from LUC (Olivier and Peters 2020, in preparation). If the same data set was used as in previous years (Houghton and Nassikas 2017; blue dotted line in figure 2.1), global 2019 emissions would have been lower at 57.1 GtCO2e or 56.7 GtCO2e if excluding methane (CH4) and N2O emissions from LUC.  Each GHG contributes differently to total GHG emissions (figure 2.1 and table 2.1). Fossil CO2 emissions5 account for most GHG emissions, including LUC, as well as the growth in GHG emissions. Preliminary data suggest that  fossil CO2 emissions reached a record 38.0 GtCO2 (range: ±1.9) in 2019, with some differences among data sets due to uncertainty in Chinese coal use in 2019.6 Fossil CO2 has grown 1.3 per cent per year on average since 2010 and grew  4 Emissions data used in this report are based on analysis from EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2020), PBL (Olivier and Peters 2020, in preparation) and the Global Carbon Project (GCP) for LUC. These data sets are used in order to provide globally consistent and updated emissions estimates, which means that there may be minor differences to officially reported UNFCCC inventory reports. Fossil CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions are based on the methods used in previous Emissions Gap Reports (Olivier and Peters 2019), with updates based on the most recently available data. In this 2020 report, LUC emissions from the GCP are used, which takes the average of two bookkeeping data sets (Hansis, Davis and Pongratz 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017). Previous Emissions Gap Reports only used one bookkeeping model (Houghton and Nassikas 2017), which means that total GHG emissions are higher than in previous reports, with LUC emissions exhibiting no significant trend over time. For the first time, this year's report includes CH4 and N2O emissions from LUC (Olivier, Schure and Peters 2017), though these are small in comparison to LUC CO2 emissions. The report also includes uncertainties with one standard deviation of ±5 per cent for CO2, ±30 per cent for CH4, ±50 per cent for N2O and ±100 per cent for fluorinated gases (Olivier et al. 2017), and 2.6 GtCO2 for LUC (Friedlingstein et al. 2019). The presented uncertainty ranges are consistent with IPCC AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014). GWPs are from the IPCC AR4. All estimates for 2019 emissions should be considered preliminary. Uncertainties are added in quadrature and assumed independent. 5 Fossil CO2 emissions include CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and from carbonates. 6 In this report, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry grew 0.9 per cent in 2019 (Crippa et al. 2020). The updated Global Carbon Budget estimates that fossil fuel emissions grew 0.1 per cent in 2019 (Friedlingstein et al. in review). Most other estimates do not include process emissions from cement manufacturing. EDGAR estimates that process emissions from cement manufacturing grew 5.1 per cent in 2019, while the GCP estimates 3.3 per cent in 2019. For combustion-related emissions only, BP estimated a 0.5 per cent growth in emissions (BP 2020), with the IEA and GCP both estimating no change (IEA 2020b), which differs to the EDGAR estimate of 0.6 per cent. The differences in these estimates for 2019 (EDGAR and BP versus GCP and IEA) are primarily due to uncertainty in the growth of Chinese coal use in 2019.  Emissions Gap Report 2020  0.9 per cent in 2019. The growth in fossil CO2 emissions in 2019 was due to a modest increase in energy use (~1.3 per cent in 2019), offset by favourable weather patterns reducing heating and cooling needs (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2020a). CO2 emissions from LUC significantly change from year-to-year due to climatic conditions. Over the last decade, CO2 emissions from LUC have had a downward trend according to Houghton and Nassikas (2017) and upward trend according to Hansis, Davis and Pongratz (2015). The average of these two data sets for the last decade is 5.5 GtCO2 (range: ±2.6, one standard deviation) and shows little change in trend given the large uncertainties7 (Friedlingstein et al. 2019; Shukla et al.  2019). In this report, the average of these two data sets are used as there is currently no scientific justification to use one data set over the other. CH4 emissions, the next most significant GHG, have grown 1.2 per cent per year on average since 2010 and grew 1.3 per cent in 2019. N2O emissions have grown 1.1 per cent per year on average from 2010 to 2019, while fluorinated gases (sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorochemicals (PFCs)) have grown 4.7 per cent per year on average since 2010 and grew 3.8 per cent in 2019. All GHGs continue to increase in line with trends over the last decade, with only fossil CO2 emissions showing a significant change in trend since the 2000s (2000≠2009).   Regional trends excluding LUC While global emissions data provide important information on collective progress, they mask the dynamics at the country level (figure 2.2 ≠ left: absolute; right: per capita). This section focuses on trends excluding LUC emissions, which are discussed later. The top four emitters (China,  United States of America, EU27+UK and India) contributed to 55 per cent of total GHG emissions without LUC over the last decade. The top seven emitters (including the Russian Federation, Japan and international transport) account for 65 per cent, while G20 members account for 78 per cent.    China emits more than one-quarter of global GHG emissions and has per capita emissions that are around 40 per cent above the global average. Despite rapid growth during the 2000s, the increase in GHG emissions has slowed in China over the last decade. From 2014 to 2016 GHG emissions showed little to no growth due to a reduction in coal use, but started to grow again from 2016. In the last decade, GHG emissions have grown 2.4 per cent on average, growing 3.1 per cent in 2019 to reach a record high 14.0 GtCO2e. Chinese coal use may have peaked in 2013, but that peak may be crossed given its growth from 2016 onwards. The United States of America emits 13 per cent of global GHG emissions and has per capita emissions that are three times the global average. However, over the last decade, the country's GHG emissions have been in decline (0.4 per cent per year), decreasing by 1.7 per cent in 2019, which partially offsets the increase of 3.0 per cent in 2018 that was due to greater energy demand in response to an unusually warm summer and cold winter. Changes in the United States of America's emissions continue to be driven by the shift away from coal towards gas and renewables. The EU27+UK emits 8.6 per cent of global GHG emissions and has per capita emissions that are 25 per cent above the global average. Emissions have steadily declined by 1.5 per cent per year in the last decade, with a steeper decline of 3.0 per cent observed in 2019. Europe had a stronger decline in coal use  in 2019, following the European Union Emissions Trading System's (EU ETS) higher allowance prices. India emits 7.1 per cent of global emissions and has per capita emissions that are 60 per cent lower than the global average. Emissions grew just 1.4 per cent in 2019, which is much lower than the average of 3.3 per cent per year over the last decade. This slower-than-expected growth was primarily due to increased hydropower from a record monsoon and weaker economic growth, along with the country's continued growth in renewables. The Russian Federation (4.9 per cent) and Japan (2.7 per cent) are the next largest emitters, followed by international transport (aviation and shipping), which represents around 2.6 per cent of GHG emissions that are growing strongly at a rate of 2.3 per cent per year (figure 2.2). In today's globalized world there is a weakened connection between where goods and services are purchased (consumed) and where emissions occur. Consumption-based emissions are allocated to countries where goods and services are consumed, which differs to territorial-based emissions, as they exclude national emissions required to produce exported products, instead including emissions from other countries to import products (consumption ~ territorial ≠ exports + imports). Rich countries generally tend to have higher consumption-based emissions (figure 2.3),  as they have cleaner production, relatively more services and more imports of primary and secondary products. In the 2000s, the gap between consumption and production was growing in rich countries but stabilized following the 2007≠2008 global financial crisis (Pan et al. 2017). Despite rich countries having greater consumption-based emissions than territorial-based emissions, both have  declined at similar rates in the last decade (Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2019). Consumption-based emissions can also be used to allocate emissions to the products purchased (food, clothing, electronic products), and not the sectors emitting (agriculture, electricity, industry). Although consumption-based emissions are more uncertain, they provide additional information to help refine climate policies (see chapter 6).  Sector trends in GHG emissions The distribution of GHG emissions across sectors is an important consideration for policymaking (figure 2.4). Many studies primarily focus on fossil CO2 emissions (65 per cent of total global GHG emissions), which are primarily associated with energy use. The inclusion of CH4 and N2O emissions highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in emission trends. This section considers the sector distribution of all GHG emissions, including nonCO2 emissions. Energy transformation dominates GHG emissions, with electricity and heat generation accounting for 24 per cent of total GHG emissions in the last decade and other energy transformation and fugitive emissions adding another 10 per cent. Emissions from energy use in buildings and other sectors, such as agriculture and fishing, are around 7 per cent. The industry sector has significant emissions from energy use (11 per cent of total GHG emissions), in additional to industrial processes (9 per cent) from mineral  products (such as cement) and other chemical reactions. The transport sector has contributed to around 14 per cent of global GHG emissions on average over the last decade, with road transport ≠ a sector that continues to have strong growth ≠ primarily responsible. Shipping and aviation are relatively smaller than road transport, with emissions in international territory comprising 2.2 per cent of total GHG emissions. Agriculture and waste are 15 per cent of total GHG emissions, with most emissions from enteric fermentation (ruminant animals, such as cattle), nitrogen fertilizers on agricultural soils, and municipal waste. LUC, primarily associated with agricultural activities, is around 11 per cent of the total and has larger inter-annual variations. Emissions are growing in all sectors, though there are signs that growth is slowing for electricity and heat generation, due to a stronger growth in renewables and decline in coal.   Land-use change Waste Other Agriculture soils Enteric fermentation International Non-road Road Other industrial processes Mineral products Energy use Building and other Fugitive emissions Other energy transformation Electricity and heat generation  Regional LUC trends Emissions from LUC are around 11 per cent of the global total, but the bulk of these emissions are from relatively few countries. Unfortunately, there is no globally consistent and widely accepted country-level data set of LUC emissions. This is due to two main reasons: data availability and definitions. First, the two land-use models used in this report (Hansis, Davis and Pongratz 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017) have country-level estimates, but they are not sufficiently robust at the country level to conduct a reliable assessment (Friedlingstein et al. 2019). Similarly, data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) cover all countries, but do not fully capture carbon dynamics and only report five- or ten-year averages due to the relatively simple method used (Tubiello et al. in review). Furthermore, country-reported UNFCCC emission inventories only cover Annex I countries. Second, LUC is defined in several different manners. For example, the scientific community often only considers direct influences on land use, while FAO and UNFCCC emission inventories include a more expansive definition of `managed lands', which captures a much larger component of the carbon sink (Grassi et al. 2018). Estimates using these different definitions should not be compared as they report quite different emissions. Emissions from LUC predominantly originate from several key countries (Tubiello et al. in review). The largest emitters from land conversions (for example, forests converted to cropland or pastures) are Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The largest managed sinks (for example, forests remaining forests) are in China, the Russian Federation, the United States of America and Brazil. When combining the conversions (sources) and managed sinks (Grassi et al. 2018), the countries with the biggest net LUC emissions are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Brazil and Indonesia, while China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America have the largest net sinks. Reducing deforestation and enhancing  carbon sinks can lead to significant emissions reductions and benefits for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services in key countries, while also greatly contributing to global mitigation efforts. How close are peak GHG emissions? Growth in global GHG emissions has averaged 1.4 per cent per year since 2010, which is lower than the growth rate of 2.4 per cent per year from 2000 to 2009. In the past decade, two years (2015 and 2016) have had almost zero growth (after removing inter-annual variations from LUC), indicating to some extent that the growth in global GHG emissions is slowing. From 2010 to 2015, GHG emissions without the variable LUC data grew at a rate of 2.2 per cent per year, which slowed to 1.2 per cent per year from 2015 to 2019. Despite the indication that global GHG emissions growth is slowing, dynamics at the country level are significantly different, with GHG emissions declining in Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies and increasing in non-OECD economies. Many OECD economies have had a peak in GHG emissions, as efficiency improvements, structural change and growth in low-carbon energy sources have been enough to overcome the growth in economic activity. Despite improving energy efficiency and increasing low-carbon sources, emissions continue to rise in countries with strong growth in energy use to meet development needs (Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2019). Globally, emissions from coal may have peaked, with rapid declines observed in Europe and the United States of America, and slower growth in China, despite an increase in other regions. Oil and particularly gas are increasingly driving the growth in global emissions, with gas now the largest contributor to fossil CO2 emissions (Peters et al. 2020). Non-fossil energy sources continue to grow rapidly and now exceed that of fossil sources in electricity generation. However, whether these factors have been sufficient to cause global GHG  emissions to peak is unknown, due to the rapidly unfolding and tragic consequences of COVID-19. 2.2.2 How might COVID-19 affect GHG emissions in 2020? In response to the health crises created by COVID-19, most countries have implemented various measures to help avoid its spread. These measures have had unprecedented effects on many aspects of the global economy, and consequently emissions. This section provides a synthesis of the estimated effects of the COVID-19 crisis on emissions in 2020 based on available studies. Most studies have focused on changes in energy use and CO2 emissions, with less attention given to how non-CO2 emissions may have changed. CO2 emissions are generally estimated based on reported energy use, but these data are not available in real time. To estimate emissions during 2020, studies have used various proxy data, such as information on mobility from Google, Apple and TomTom, real-time data on electricity generation and other similar statistics that indicate activity levels. Some studies have estimated emissions for the year to date (Liu et  al. 2020), while others have additionally estimated emissions for the full year (Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2020). For the year to date, Liu et al. found that emissions have declined 7.1 per cent cumulatively to 1 November 2020, including both the effects of COVID-19 restrictions and underlying changes in the global energy system (figure 2.5). Le QuÈrÈ et al. (2020) focused only on changes due to the COVID-19 restrictions, finding that global daily emissions decreased a maximum of 17 per cent in April 2020, with emissions reductions for the full year estimated at 7 per cent (range: 2≠12 per cent, updated to mid-June) if some restrictions remain to the end of 2020, which is now the case. A key driver for the uncertainty is the extent of COVID-19 restrictions for the remainder of 2020. Recent full-year estimates for 2020 emissions compared with 2019 include a decrease of 7 per cent (IEA 2020b) and 8.5 per cent (Enerdata 2020) in CO2 emissions. Based on this, emissions reductions in 2020 are likely to fall within the range of 2≠12 per cent per cent as suggested by Le QuÈrÈ et al. (2020). All studies indicate that the biggest changes have occurred in transport, as COVID-19 restrictions were targeted to limit mobility, though small reductions have also occurred in other sectors (figure 2.5). Power Ground transport Industry Residential Aviation Shipping July August Sept. Oct.  Based on these studies, the expected reduction in CO2 emissions is 7 per cent in 2020 (range: 2≠12 per cent), with a smaller drop in GHG emissions as non-CO2 is likely to be less affected (Forster et al. 2020). The reduction is unprecedented and significantly larger than the reduction of 0.9 per cent in CO2 emissions during the 2007≠2008 global financial crisis (0.6 per cent for all GHGs). Most relevant for climate, is how countries respond in the years beyond 2020. Previous analysis has shown that emissions often rebound after crises (Peters et al. 2012), though the nature of the rebound depends on the crisis  (Hanna, Xu and Victor 2019). As the COVID-19 crisis eases emissions will rebound, but how far and how fast is highly uncertain (IEA 2020d) and depends primarily on the choices made by governments. If COVID-19 recovery packages focus on accelerating the ongoing renewable energy transition, then emissions may continue to decline depending on how large and long-term the recovery packages are (see chapter 4).   Emissions Gap Report 2020  2.3 Achievement of Cancun Pledges by G20 members, considering the potential impact of COVID-19 Collectively, G20 members are projected to overachieve their Cancun Pledges.8 Even without consideration of the potential impacts of COVID-19, Australia, Brazil, China, EU27+UK, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, and this year, also South Africa, are projected to meet their 2020 pledges with currently implemented policies. For South Africa, the change compared with the 2019 assessment reflects revised (lower) historical emissions data as well as lower projections from the new Integrated Resource Plan (Climate Action Tracker 2019; Keramidas et al. 2020). For Australia, the Government projected in December 2019 that they would miss its ""point in time"" 2020 target, but will overachieve its carbon budget target for the 2013≠2020 period (Commonwealth of Australia 2019). Several individual members (Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America) are still projected to miss their pledges or are not expected to achieve them with great certainty. Consideration of the potential impacts of COVID-19 is only likely to change this conclusion for the United States of America, where available assessments suggest that the country will achieve its Cancun Pledge (reducing GHG emissions to 17 per cent below 2005 levels) when accounting for the expected impact of COVID-19. The latest analysis by the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a 10 per cent decrease in energy-related CO2 emissions in 2020 compared with 2019 (U.S. Energy Information Administration [EIA] 2020), partly due to the effects of fuel switching. The Rhodium Group (Larsen et al. 2020) and Climate Action Tracker (2020b) estimate reductions of 10≠16 per cent and 10≠11 per cent (excluding LULUCF), respectively, for all GHGs. Few country-specific estimates are available for other countries. If it is assumed that the 2≠12 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020 (referred to earlier in this chapter; Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2020) applies to all GHG emissions of individual G20 members, Canada, Mexico and the Republic of Korea are still unlikely to achieve their pledges based on latest GHG inventory data (2017 for Mexico and the Republic of Korea, 2018 for Canada) and emission trends in recent years. For Indonesia, it remains uncertain whether 2020 emissions would meet their Cancun Pledge, due to the uncertainty on LULUCF emissions.  2.4 Assessment of G20 members' progress towards NDC targets This section assesses the progress of G20 members towards their NDC targets based on emissions projections published before the COVID-19 pandemic (section 4.2.1), and also provides some preliminary findings regarding the potential impact of COVID-19 and related policy responses on G20 emissions by 2030 (section 4.2.2). Projections of GHG emissions were compiled and reviewed to assess the emission levels expected for G20 members under existing policies (the `current policies scenario')9 and whether the members are likely to meet their respective emissions reduction targets for 2030. Projections of the current policies scenario assume that no additional mitigation policies and measures are taken beyond those adopted and/or implemented as of a certain cut-off date (den Elzen et al. 2019). The progress assessment is based on the first NDCs (INDC for Turkey).10 As at mid-November 2020, no G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC to reflect a revised NDC target (Japan resubmitted its original NDC target in March 2020) (United Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] undated a). This report follows the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) to enable a robust comparison of projections from different data sources, including both official sources published by G20 governments and sources published by independent research institutions. European Union Member States are not assessed individually, and all projections for the European Union include the United Kingdom. The most important caveat for the 2020 assessment is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current policies scenario projections. As most projections to date were published or prepared before the pandemic was declared, they do not account for its potentially significant impact not only for emission trends in 2020 and 2021, but also until 2030. As previously mentioned, the impact of the pandemic on 2030 emissions projections for some individual G20 members is discussed in section 2.4.2. Other important caveats are similar to those of previous Emissions Gap Reports (adapted from den Elzen et al. 2019). First, whether a country is projected to achieve or miss its Cancun Pledge or NDC targets with existing policies depends on both the strength and stringency of the existing climate policy packages and the ambition level of the targets given structural factors (such as demographic and  macroeconomic trends) that shape how easy or difficult a target is to achieve. Although targets have been assessed as diverging in ambition, this report does not assess the degree of each country's efforts to achieve a certain mitigation projection, and does not assess the ambition of the targets in the context of equity principles. Countries that are projected to achieve their NDCs with existing policies are therefore not necessarily undertaking more mitigation actions than countries that are projected to miss them, and vice versa. Second, current policies scenario projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as gross domestic product (GDP), population growth and technology developments, as well as the impact of policies. Some Cancun Pledges and NDCs are also subject to the uncertainty of future GDP growth and other underlying assumptions. These all add to the fundamental uncertainty resulting from COVID-19. Up-to-date emissions projections published since November 2019 were collected from official documents, namely  countries' recently published National Communications and fourth biennial reports of five G20 members (`with measures' scenarios).11 Estimates were also collected for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections from independent studies and several new national models and integrated assessment model studies for China, India, Japan, the Russian Federation and the United States of America through the Linking Climate and Development Policies ≠ Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing (CD-LINKS) project (Roelfsema et al. 2020), as well as independent global studies, such as the Climate Action Tracker (2019), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Keramidas et al. 2020) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Kuramochi et al. 2019; PBL 2020; Roelfsema et al. 2020). All data sources, including the updated studies, are presented in table 2.2. Policy cutoff dates ranged from 2017 to 2019 across studies. The emissions figures include LULUCF, unless otherwise stated.    2.4.1 Progress assessment based on pre-COVID-19 studies This section assesses progress of G20 members towards their NDC targets based on emissions projections published before the COVID-19 pandemic, as few updates considering the potential impact of COVID-19 and related policy responses were available as at October 2020. An assessment of the potential impact of the pandemic on emissions by 2030 based on a limited set of studies is provided in section 2.4.2. Although, the emissions projections reviewed here do not consider the implications of COVID-19 on future GHG emissions, they provide important information about the impact of recent policy developments in respective G20 member countries and regions. Collectively, G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDCs based on current policies. Nine of the 16 G20 members, counting the EU27+UK as one member, are likely to achieve their unconditional NDC targets (INDC for Turkey) under current policies (figure 2.6). These members are Argentina (new compared with the 2019 assessment),  China, EU27+UK,12 India, Japan (back in this group since the 2018 assessment), Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa (new) and Turkey (see table 2.3). Among them, four countries (Argentina, India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to reach emission levels that are 14≠34 per cent lower than their respective NDC emissions target levels (figure 2.6).  The assessment has changed compared with the 2019 assessment for the following three countries:    Argentina is now expected to achieve its  unconditional NDC target with current policies. The  median projection from independent analyses has  been revised downward, partially due to downward-  revised economic growth and LULUCF projections  (see table 2.4 for recent developments).    For Japan, current policies scenario projections  for 2030 have been close to the NDC target for the  past several years. The country's GHG emissions  12 All emissions projections for the European Union reviewed in this report include the United Kingdom.  have been decreasing continually since 2013 due to increased renewable electricity generation, reduced electricity consumption and reduced total end-use energy consumption.    For South Africa, the central estimate from  independent analyses (see table 2.2) has been  revised significantly downward. This is mainly due to  the consideration of the recently updated Integrated  Resource Plan (see table 2.4 for details) (Republic  of South Africa, Department of Energy 2019) and  the likelihood of its implementation, as well as the  most recent national GHG inventory report that noted  flattened emission trends between 2010 and 2015.  full implementation of adopted policies in climate, energy and transport, emissions for the EU27 could reduce around 45 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2020b). If the status of policy implementation is considered at the level of European Union Member States, studies indicate that additional collective effort is required both by Member States and the European Union to meet its energy efficiency target as part of the NDC (EEA 2019). Additional Member State measures are in preparation, as indicated by the national energy and climate plans submitted in 2020, which have been assessed by the European Commission as being consistent with a 41 per cent reduction (European Commission 2020a) .  Substantial changes in the current policies projections compared with the 2019 assessment are also observed for other G20 members projected to achieve their unconditional NDC targets:    The central estimate for the EU27+UK was  revised downward, meaning it is now projected  to overachieve its 40 per cent GHG reduction  target for 2030. The change in assessment mainly  reflects that the underlying studies now account  for the full implementation of directives, regulations  and legislation adopted in 2018 and 2019 that  comprise the Clean Planet for All policy package.  According to a baseline scenario that assumes    The central estimate for the Russian Federation's  2030 emissions projections decreased by about  300 MtCO2e due to the independent analyses'  consideration of the 2019 national GHG inventory  report, which made significant downward revisions on  the historical emissions data compared with previous  inventory reports.  For other G20 members that are projected to meet their NDC targets, India's 2030 emissions projections show a small decrease, partly due to a strong growth in renewable energy deployment, while the projections for China, Mexico and Turkey have not changed substantially compared with the 2019 assessment.  For five G20 members, GHG emissions by 2030 are projected to fall short of their unconditional NDC target and require further action of varying degree: Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America.    For Australia and the Republic of Korea, the central  estimates of independent analyses remain consistent  with those of the 2019 assessment.    For Brazil, the central estimates of independent  analyses have increased from the 2019 assessment  due to an upward revision of emissions projections in  the land-use sector.    For Canada, the emissions projections are revised   downward compared with their previous assessments  in both official (Environment and Climate Change  Canada 2020b) and independent analyses (in part due  to a large downward revision by the Joint Research  Centre (Keramidas et al. 2020)). However, overall, the  nation is still projected to miss its NDC target, unless  policies are strengthened. Canada has acknowledged  this and in September 2020 it committed to bring  forward enhanced measures that will allow the  country to meet and exceed its target.    For the United States of America, the government  has revised, rescinded and/or replaced regulations,  but the GHG emissions projections remain similar  to previous projections. The central estimate for 2025 under current policies scenario projections is still far from the NDC target level (central estimate: 5.8 GtCO2e compared with 4.7 GtCO2e). As the withdrawal of the United States of America from the Paris Agreement took effect on 4 November 2020, the country no longer has an official NDC. However, its former NDC for 2025 is still included as a reference. In November 2020, Joe Biden won the presidential election (NBC News 2020). President-elect Biden intends an immediate return to the Paris Agreement (Biden 2020). This can be achieved in 2021, without the intervention of Congress. For the Republic of Korea, it should be noted that the current policies scenario projections could be revised downward significantly, when the total amount of emissions allowances (caps) under Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) are set for years towards 2030 and reflected in the emissions projections. According to the third Master Plan for the K-ETS established in December 2019, the emissions caps for Phase III (2021≠2025) will be strictly set to be consistent with the annual target emissions from the 2030 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap, while the emission caps for Phase IV will be set to achieve the NDC target for 2030. The emissions cap for Phase III has recently been set (see table 2.4).  ata) ent studies)  Studies do not agree on whether Indonesia and Saudi Arabia are on track to meet their unconditional NDCs. For Indonesia, this mainly results from the uncertainty surrounding LULUCF emissions due to peat fires. The projection this year is considerably lower than the previous assessment due to updated GHG inventory data and the upward revision of renewable electricity generation  projections (Kuramochi et al. 2019). For Saudi Arabia, the limited information about its NDC target and policies to achieve this target prevented a detailed assessment of the country's progress. Collectively, G20 members are not on track to achieve their unconditional NDCs based on current policies. The aggregate   Emissions Gap Report 2020  emissions of G20 members by 2030 are projected to be 40.1 GtCO2e13 (range: 35.8≠42.6 GtCO2e), which is 0.9 GtCO2e lower than projected in the 2019 report and about 26 per cent above 2010 levels (range: 7≠48 per cent). These estimates do not consider the potential implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic responses, but instead reflect various factors, including the impact of policies adopted in recent years, as well as revisions in GHG inventory data, changes in emissions scenario methodologies and underlying assumptions on macroeconomic drivers. Current policies imply increased 2030 emissions compared with 2010 levels for several G20 members (Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa). Collectively, G20 members need to reduce their GHG emissions further by about 0.3 GtCO2e per year by 2030 to achieve unconditional NDC target emission levels and by about 2.4 GtCO2e per year to achieve conditional NDC target emission levels. If the 1.7 GtCO2e per year overachievement of unconditional NDCs by India, the Russian Federation and Turkey are excluded, and it is assumed that these countries will follow their current policies trajectory rather than that  implied by their unconditional NDCs (as done in many NDC scenario projections from global models presented in chapter 3), then the G20 members will be collectively short of achieving both unconditional and conditional NDCs by about 2.1 GtCO2e per year and 3.4 GtCO2e per year, respectively, by 2030. The estimated difference between the current policies scenario and NDC scenario projections for G20 members remains similar to 2019 Emissions Gap Report projections.14 A sizeable number of policies adopted by G20 members over the past year have the potential to positively and negatively affect progress towards NDC targets (table 2.4). Many of these policies were adopted after the publication of the scenario studies reviewed in this section and were therefore not taken into account. Although several policies are expected to have positive mitigation outcomes, there are many that have negative implications for emissions, such as fossil fuel extraction projects, coal-fired power plant construction plans, and rollbacks of environmental regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic, as table 2.4 illustrates (for COVID-19 implications, see section 2.4.2 and chapter 4).  13 Central estimate of three studies that cover all G20 members (Climate Action Tracker 2019a; Kuramochi et al. 2019; Keramidas et al. 2020). 14 The values presented here are smaller than those reported in the 2019 report, though this is largely due to the 2019 report using an extrapolated 2030 estimate for the NDC of the United States of America, which was for 2024, whereas this year's report uses the former NDC emission levels for 2025 as they are.  Key policy measures adopted in 2019 and 2020  Argentina  ∑ In November 2019, the National Climate Change Law on Adaptation and Mitigation was approved in Congress by consensus. ∑ The future of `Vaca Muerta' (large reserve of shale oil and gas) remains highly uncertain. Its economic viability and attractiveness are at stake due to a plunge in oil prices and reduced demand. The Government is renegotiating its foreign debt with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with the future of Vaca Muerta dependent on the results of these negotiations.  Australia  ∑ No new renewable energy targets for post-2020 have been put forward (the 2020 target was achieved a year early). ∑ The Government has announced plans to support investment in natural gas, in a gas-led recovery to the pandemic, including through government investment in gas infrastructure. ∑ The Technology Investment Roadmap Discussion Paper, published in May 2020, proposes changing the remit of two renewable energy government agencies and advocates for natural gas and carbon capture and storage (CCS). ∑ The First Low Emissions Technology Statement, published in September 2020, outlines the five technologies requiring investment for emissions reduction: clean hydrogen, energy storage, lowcarbon materials, CCS and soil carbon sequestration. A new AUD 1.9 billion investment package was also announced in September 2020 to support the above activities and energy productivity, excluding support for renewable energy technologies.  Brazil  ∑ The Government has recently approved the Forest+ project, which will fund environmental services linked with conservation efforts. However, rollbacks continue to hinder efforts to stop deforestation. ∑ Three-quarters of the latest energy auction (October 2019) went to renewable energy, with the remainder going to natural gas. Solar (18 per cent) had the lowest cost of all technologies. Despite this, investments in fossil fuel energy infrastructure still dominate the current 10-year energy plan. The spring 2020 auction was postponed due the pandemic.  Canada  ∑ The Minister of Environment and Climate Change reversed his 2019 decision not to subject a coal mine expansion project to a federal environmental impact assessment after claims that such action was inconsistent with Canada's founding member status of the Powering Past Coal Alliance. ∑ Canada has announced that it will establish a Clean Power Fund to help finance the development and linking of clean energy to transmission systems, including support for an Atlantic Loop that will help the country's most eastern provinces transition away from coal-fired electricity generation. ∑ Regulations regarding fugitive and venting CH4 emissions from upstream oil and gas production came into effect at the beginning of 2020. These regulations are part of Canada's commitment to reduce CH4 emissions in the sector by 40≠45 per cent below 2012 levels by 2025. ∑ Canada continues to invest in electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and has provided funding to support EV purchase incentives as part of its sales targets for EVs of 10 per cent by 2025, 30 per cent by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2040. Further support measures are anticipated as part of COVID-19 economic recovery measures.   Emissions Gap Report 2020  ∑ Mandatory carbon pricing has been in effect across Canada since 2019. Provinces and territories may implement their own pricing systems, provided that they meet certain criteria, or apply the federal system. The federal carbon pricing system consists of a charge on fossil fuels and a regulated emissions trading system for heavy industry. For direct pricing systems in Canada, the carbon price is CAD 30/tCO2e in 2020, which will rise to CAD 10/year to CAD 50/tCO2e in 2022. Some provinces have challenged the constitutionality of the carbon pricing legislation, with lower courts split on the issue. Canada's top court heard the case in September 2020 and reserved judgment.  China  ∑ The new coal-fired power monitor up to 2023 allows or restricts provinces to permit construction of new coal-fired power plants. Restrictions were rolled back compared with the 2019 monitor, with more provinces permitted to construct new plants. ∑ The target for the new energy vehicles (NEVs) market share in total car sales was raised from 20 per cent to 25 per cent by 2025, with the Government extending the NEV purchase tax exemption programme and subsidies programme until 2022. ∑ Partly in response to COVID-19, the Government will prioritize acceleration of its New Infrastructure Plan. In 2020, China added 200,000 EV charging facilities nationwide, which is an increase of about 16.5 per cent compared with 2019. As at October 2020, 21 ultra-high voltage (UHV) power transmission projects have been commissioned, six of which are under construction. Infrastructure to connect large-scale rural renewable projects to densely populated areas, along with new inter-city high-speed rail networks will also be promoted. ∑ China will scale up its NDC by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. China aims to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China 2020).  European Union  ∑ The European Union adopted the European Green Deal to become climate neutral by 2050 in December 2019. The European Green Deal includes the development of a climate law, which was proposed by the European Commission in March 2020 and is in discussion between the European Council and European Parliament. ∑ In July 2020, the European Council (European Union Heads of State and government) agreed on the main elements of a proposed recovery package known as NextGenerationEU. This package is additional to the European Union's 2021≠2027 budget and would total EUR 750 billion in grants and loans. Thirty per cent of NextGenerationEU funds and the European Union's long-term budget for 2021≠2027 have been earmarked for climate action. All funds will support the 2030 climate target and 2050 climate neutrality objective. ∑ In September 2020, the European Commission proposed that the European Union increase its domestic emissions target to at least 55 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (including LULUCF). In October 2020, the European Parliament voted for a reduction of 60 per cent. Considerations are ongoing in the European Council on how to revise the target.  India  ∑ No new coal-fired power plants were built in the first half of 2020 and the country's coal fleet shrank by 0.3 GW. However, there are still plans to expand coal-fired power generation in the future. Domestic coal production could reach record levels in 2020. ∑ India plans to expand solar investments in its agriculture sector to develop 25 GW of capacity by 2022 through the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthan (PM-KUSUM) scheme. (At the national level, India has a renewable energy capacity target of 175 GW by 2022). ∑ The second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME II) project, which came into effect in April 2019, provides support to EV purchases and charging infrastructure. ∑ Indian railways aims to completely electrify the network by 2023 and in July 2020 announced its plans to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.  Indonesia  ∑ In January 2020, the Government put a cap on domestic coal below market value to boost consumption. It also plans to subsidize fuel for industries and businesses using roughly 14 per cent of the budget reserved for its National Economic Recovery programme. ∑ Indonesia has postponed the 2020 geothermal auctions, with the demand for solar photovoltaic (PV) panels dropping 70 per cent during the pandemic, due to reduced household and government spending for rooftop installations.  Japan  ∑ The Government aims to establish a concrete plan to phase out the country's inefficient coal-fired power plants. ∑ According to Japan's new strategy on coal-fired power plant finance overseas, the Government will not, in principle, support the installation of projects in countries whose energy issues and decarbonization policies have not been deeply accounted for in a bilateral context (the strategy does not apply to ongoing projects). ∑ The new midterm deployment plan for offshore wind power will be proposed by the end of 2020 through the Public-Private Council on Enhancement of Industrial Competitiveness for Offshore Wind Power Generation.  Mexico  ∑ Mexico passed a bill on fiscal support to its state-owned petroleum company (Pemex), which would allow Pemex to continue its investments in oil exploration and extraction. ∑ The Government established a policy to strengthen energy security in the country, which effectively halts private renewable energy investment in Mexico and prioritizes state-owned fossil fuel-fired power plants supplied with coal, heavy oil and natural gas. However, as the judiciary processes against this policy are still ongoing, the renewable electricity dispatch continues and its use has not been affected. No significant renewable power capacity has been added in 2020, with the dispatch of renewables in the country's electricity matrix (excluding large hydropower) reaching just 13 per cent in September 2020.  Republic of Korea  ∑ The Ninth Electricity Plan is currently in development, but its draft already includes electricity generation targets that are lower for coal and nuclear and higher for renewables and natural gas, compared with the Eighth Electricity Plan. The new plan's targets for 2034 are 17 per cent for nuclear, 15 per cent for coal, 32.3 per cent for natural gas and 40 per cent for renewables. ∑ The Government's Green New Deal includes a plan to boost renewable energy deployment (with the focus on offshore wind farms and building installations) and low-carbon infrastructure, as well as support to build a smart grid for efficient energy management and put 1.13 million EVs and 200,000 hydrogen vehicles on the roads by 2025. ∑ In October 2020, the National Emission Allowance Allocation Plan for Phase III (2021≠2025) was established. The plan sets the total emission allowances (caps) for Phase III. According to the plan, the portion of allowances allocated through an auction is being increased to 10 per cent, with the number of industries that have a benchmark methodology applied for free allocation also set to increase compared with Phase II.  Russian Federation  ∑ The long-delayed 2035 Energy Strategy was adopted in June 2020, which focuses on expanding fossil fuel production, exports and domestic consumption. Plans for expanding renewable energy generation are absent. ∑ A draft energy efficiency plan, published in August 2020, sets a 2030 target of reducing total energy intensity of GDP by 20 per cent below 2017 levels.   Saudi Arabia  ∑ The Government launched the third round of its National Renewable Energy Program, tendering 1.2 GW of solar PV. Rounds 1 and 2 tendered around 2.2 GW of solar PV in total. ∑ As part of the economic recovery response to the pandemic, the Government has temporarily increased consumers' electricity subsidies in commercial, industrial and agriculture sectors. These subsidies provide additional support to the electricity system, powered almost exclusively by fossil fuels.  South Africa  ∑ South Africa has revised its 2011 Integrated Resource Plan. The 2019 Integrated Resource Plan aims to decommission over 35 GW (of 42 GW currently operating) of Eskom's coal generation capacity by 2050 (5.4 GW by 2022 and 10.5 GW by 2030). The plan also includes the construction of 7.2 GW of new coal capacity, 15.8 GW of wind capacity and 7.4 GW of solar capacity by 2030. ∑ In 2020, the chemicals and energy group Sasol announced the launch of a 2030 emissions road map for its South African operations. The road map details its path to at least a 10 per cent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 compared with a 2017 baseline, and was developed with a long-term view.  Turkey  ∑ Turkey continues to expand its coal-fired power generation with almost 32 GW of planned capacity in various stages of planning; 1.3 GW of this is currently under construction. ∑ Turkey announced that it would seek tenders for small-scale renewable projects of 1 GW in total in early 2021. Some renewable energy auctions have already taken place, such as the 1 GW solar PV auction in 2017 and two 1 GW onshore wind auctions in 2017 and 2019, respectively. ∑ Since 2019, Turkey has had the energy saving target of 15 per cent for public buildings, which it aims to achieve by 2023 as part of its National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2017≠2023.  United Kingdom  ∑ The United Kingdom will phase out coal-fired power generation earlier than originally planned after bringing forward the phase-out date by one year to 2024. In the first half of 2020, the country went 67 days without coal-fired power, the longest period since the Industrial Revolution began. ∑ GBP 70 million has been allocated to support hydrogen developments, including two production plants. However, a comprehensive strategy for the sector has not yet been developed. ∑ The United Kingdom was considering moving its ban on new petrol and diesel cars forward by five years from 2040 to 2035 and held public consultations at the beginning of 2020. In November 2020, the Government announced it was considering more ambitious plans to bring the ban forward by 10 years to 2030. A decarbonization plan for the entire transport sector is expected by the end of the year.  United States of America  ∑ The United States of America withdrew from the Paris Agreement on 4 November 2020. ∑ The Clean Power Plan, which aimed to reduce emissions from the power sector by 32 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, is being replaced with the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) plan. ACE limits the scope of the plan to efficiency measures or CCS technologies. It is currently under at least two legal challenges. ∑ The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule revised fuel efficiency standards set by the previous Administration to less stricter ones. The SAFE rule now requires automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of their light duty vehicles by 1.5 per cent annually (previously 5 per cent) and to reach 40 miles per gallon by 2025 (previously set at 54 miles per gallon). The rule also revokes California's waiver to set its own emission standards for cars and trucks that are stricter than the federal standards.

(2020)  To supplement these findings presented, figure 2.7 shows projected per capita GHG emissions for the 16 G20 members, counting the European Union, its three Member  States and the United Kingdom as one (EU27+UK), under the current policies and unconditional NDC scenarios based on independent studies and 2010 historical data  from national GHG inventories.15 G20 members are shown in decreasing order of NDC emissions projections. Overall, average G20 annual emissions per capita by 2030 are projected to decline compared with 2010 levels under the unconditional NDC scenario. The figure illustrates that there are large differences in per capita emission levels across G20 members. For example, the projected per capita emissions of India are about half of the G20 average, whereas Saudi Arabia's per capita emissions are projected to reach three times the G20 average by 2030. All but five G20 members (the European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey) are projected to still emit more than the 2010  G20 average (7 tCO2e per capita) by 2030 under current policies. For comparison, the G20 average per capita emissions consistent with 2∞C warming would roughly be around 5 tCO2e per capita by 2030 (authors' estimate based on den Elzen et al. 2019). Among OECD members,16 the EU27+UK performs well in terms of both absolute and per capita emission levels by 2030 and their change rates compared with 2010 levels, although it should be noted that their consumption-based emissions are considerably higher as shown in figure 2.3. Mexico also performs well in terms of the projected development of per capita emissions under both current policies and NDC scenarios.  Figure 2.7. Per capita GHG emissions (including LULUCF) of the G20 and its individual members by 2030 (2025 for the United States of America) under NDC and current policies scenarios (central estimates) 2.4.2 Estimated impact of COVID-19 and associated policy responses on 2030 emissions for individual G20 members This section summarizes preliminary findings on the potential impacts of COVID-19 and associated policy responses by G20 members on GHG emissions by 2030. By nature, these findings are highly uncertain. First, the  literature assessing these potential impacts is sparse and based on very limited information about how COVID-19 has affected the economy and subsequently GHG emissions across G20 members in 2020. Second, the literature adopts simplistic and speculative assumptions about the longer-term impacts of COVID-19 and associated responses. Third, a comparison of pre- and post-COVID-19 projections  15 Note that the 2010 estimates are not the same as those in the bottom panel of figure 2.2 due to the differences in data sources and the consideration of land-use sector emissions. 16 Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Turkey and the United States of America.  Emissions Gap Report 2020  requires distinguishing the impact of COVID-19 and associated responses from the impact of other factors, such as recently adopted policies unrelated to COVID-19, the use of updated national GHG inventory data for years 2019 and earlier, and methodological changes. A synthesis of the literature on COVID-19 stimulus measures implemented in key emitting economies is presented in chapter 4. Looking at individual G20 members, multiple CO2 and/or GHG emissions scenario studies are available for seven  G20 members (table 2.5). Note that the studies included in table 2.5 are not fully comparable due to differences in the coverage of GHGs and sectors, the scenarios examined and scenario definitions across studies. That said, studies on the United States of America seem to agree on the magnitude of the COVID-19 impact on 2030 emissions projections, noting a reduction of around 5≠10 per cent compared with preCOVID-19 projections. Two studies (Climate Action Tracker 2020c; IEA 2020e) also indicate that India may see larger reductions by 2030 compared with other major emitters.   2.5 The need to translate long-term netzero emissions goals into near-term ambition and action The message of this chapter is clear: all countries urgently need to strengthen their mitigation ambition and accelerate action to change current emission trends and get on track to achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris  Agreement. This is especially the case for G20 members, who account for about 78 per cent of global emissions. Most G20 major emitters have only made marginal progress in shifting their future emissions trajectories downward (Hˆhne et al. 2020), with several others not even on track to meet their NDCs. The most significant and encouraging development in 2020 is the growing number of countries that are committing to various net-zero emissions goals by 2050.   As at November 2020, 126 countries covering 51 per cent of global GHG emissions are covered by net-zero goals that are formally adopted, announced or under consideration (Climate Action Tracker 2020a, based on Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit 2020).17 If the United States of America were to also adopt a net-zero GHG target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan (Biden 2020), the share could increase up to 63 per cent. Of the G20 members, the following have net-zero emissions goals:  countries are invited or requested, respectively, to submit to the UNFCCC by 2020. As at mid-November 2020, nine G20 members (Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America)19 have submitted long-term low GHG development strategies to the UNFCCC, though no G20 member has officially submitted a new or updated NDC target (Japan resubmitted its original NDC target in March 2020) (UNFCCC undated a).    France legally enshrined its goal to achieve net-  zero GHG emissions by 2050 (Journal officiel de la  RÈpublique FranÁaise 2019).    The United Kingdom legally enshrined its 2050 net-  zero GHG emissions goal (United Kingdom 2019).    The European Union aims to be climate neutral  through achieving net-zero GHG emissions by 2050  (Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European  Union and the European Commission 2020).    At the United Nations General Assembly, China  announced its aim for a CO2 emissions peak before  2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060  (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic  of China 2020).    In October 2020, Japan announced a goal of net-zero  GHG emissions by 2050 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs  of Japan 2020), strengthening their previous goal of  achieving a decarbonized society as early as possible  in the second half of this century (Government of  Japan 2019b).    The President of the Republic of Korea committed to  carbon neutrality by 2050 in his speech to parliament  (Cheong Wa Dae 2020).    Canada has indicated its intention to legislate a goal  of net-zero emissions18 by 2050 (Governor General of  Canada 2020).    South Africa aspires to net-zero carbon emissions by  2050 (Republic of South Africa 2020).    Argentina and Mexico are part of the UNFCCC  Climate Ambition Alliance working towards net-zero  carbon emissions by 2050 (UNFCCC 2019).  Progress is significantly slower when considering the formal submissions of mid-century, long-term low GHG emission development strategies and new or updated NDCs that  Although the recent announcements of net-zero emissions goals are very encouraging, they highlight the vast discrepancy between the ambitiousness of these goals and the inadequate level of ambition in the NDCs for 2030. Furthermore, there is inconsistency between the emission levels implied by current policies and those projected under current NDCs by 2030 (of 2.1≠3.5 GtCO2e per year), and, more importantly, those necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. To make significant progress towards achieving the longterm temperature goals of the Paris Agreement by 2030, two next steps are urgently required. First, more countries need to develop long-term strategies that are consistent with the Paris Agreement, in particular, by setting time frames for net-zero emissions. Second, new and updated NDCs need to become consistent with the net-zero emission goals (Levin et al. 2020). It will therefore be particularly important to ensure coordination between the development of the next NDCs and the long-term strategies in order to enable a seamless transition to a decarbonization pathway that is consistent with the Paris Agreement (Levin and Fransen 2019), and to transform the announced net-zero emissions goals into detailed shorter-term implementation plans and mitigation targets that are reflected in the NDCs for 2030. Previous Emissions Gap Reports have highlighted the large menu of options and opportunities to strengthen mitigation ambition and action (Fransen and Hˆhne 2018; Hˆhne et al. 2019). Model-based, multidisciplinary assessments could also be a key aspect when informing policymakers and engaging stakeholders in the process of developing updated NDCs and long-term strategies (Weitzel et al. 2019). As the world deals with the COVID-19 pandemic, the implementation of sustainable recovery packages that boost economic growth and create jobs while building more resilient and cleaner energy systems is essential to ensuring that significant mitigation progress is made by 2030 (IEA 2020c).  3 The emissions gap   3.1 Introduction This chapter updates the assessment of the emissions gap for 2030. Consistent with previous Emissions Gap Reports, the emissions gap is defined as the difference between projected global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under full implementation of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and emissions under least-cost pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement long-term goal of limiting global average temperature increase to well below 2oC and pursing efforts to limiting it to 1.5oC compared with pre-industrial levels (section 3.2). This chapter assesses up-to-date emissions scenarios that underlie the quantification of the emissions gap (section 3.3).  emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to below 2∞C, 1.8∞C or 1.5∞C with varying levels of likelihood, and the estimated global GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of the NDCs. This section updates the gap based on estimated levels of GHG emissions in 2030 for the seven scenarios considered in this assessment and further described in section 3.3. Table 3.1 provides a full overview of 2030 emission levels for these scenarios, as well as the resulting emissions gap, while Figure 3.1 illustrates the emissions gap for 2030.  The emissions projections for the current policies and NDC scenarios published in the literature mainly predate the COVID-19 outbreak. Potential implications of COVID-19 on 2030 emissions are therefore explored based on expert knowledge and indicative calculations (section 3.4), which is consistent with the approach used in chapter 2. The implications of failing to bridge the emissions gap by 2030 and the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement are also discussed (section 3.5).  The key questions assessed in this chapter are: What is the likely emissions gap for 2030? What is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures on emissions by 2030? What are the temperature implications? What does the 2030 emissions gap imply in a longer-term, mid-century context?  3.2 The 2030 emissions gap In line with previous reports, the emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG   As figure 3.1 shows, the gap between the unconditional NDC scenario (56 GtCO2e in 2030) and least-cost pathways limiting warming to below 2∞C in 2100 with limited overshoot (41 GtCO2e in 2030) is 15 GtCO2e (range: 12≠19 GtCO2e), whereas the gap between the unconditional NDCs scenario  and least-cost pathways limiting warming to below 1.5∞C in 2100 with limited overshoot (25 GtCO2e in 2030) is 32 GtCO2e (range: 29≠36 GtCO2e). The full implementation of both unconditional and conditional NDCs would reduce each of these gaps by around 3 GtCO2e.  The emissions gap is unchanged compared with 2019, meaning that countries need to strengthen their NDC ambitions dramatically, specifically threefold to achieve a 2∞C goal and more than fivefold to achieve the 1.5∞C goal. There are two reasons why the gap has not changed. First, adjustments to the NDC scenarios have been very minor: as at November 2020, none of the major emitters had submitted new or updated NDCs with stronger NDC targets for 2030. Overall, any NDC target updates from 2019 are expected to reduce total 2030 emissions by less than 1 per cent (section 3.2.2). Second, no new 1.5∞C, 1.8∞C and 2.0∞C scenarios have been added to the assessment since 2019. Furthermore, the 2020 gap assessment is unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As noted in figure 3.1, this gap assessment is still based on scenarios that do not specifically consider the implications of COVID-19 and related rescue and recovery measures. COVID-19 will only affect the gap assessment if the NDC scenarios and/or the 1.5∞C, 1.8∞C and 2.0∞C long-term scenarios are affected. In turn, NDC estimates will only be affected by COVID-19 and related measures if NDCs are updated in response to the pandemic or if projections of NDC emissions from countries with intensity targets are revised. At present, there are no studies available that quantify this, but at the global scale it is expected to be only a second-order effect. Similarly, COVID-19 and associated rescue and recovery measures will only affect long-term pathways to keep global warming to 1.5∞C or well below 2∞C if they result in a structural shift of the economy. Although COVID-19 lockdown measures have resulted in a sharp temporary decline in global fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2020 (see chapter 2), there is currently no firm scientific evidence to confirm a structural shift of the economy towards higher or lower emissions in the long term. The gap assessment between NDCs and least-cost pathways thus remains unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic, although current policy projections could be impacted (section 3.3). 3.3 Scenarios considered for the 2030 gap assessment This section updates the scenarios considered for the 2030 emissions gap assessment. These scenarios comprise reference scenarios, NDC scenarios and least-cost mitigation scenarios starting in 2020 and consistent with specific temperature targets. 3.3.1 Reference scenarios and updates Reference scenarios are used as benchmarks to track progress in emission reductions. Two reference scenarios are considered: the 2010 policies scenario and the current policies scenario. The 2010 policies scenario projects global GHG emissions assuming no new climate policies have been put in place from 2010 onwards. Similar to the Emissions Gap Report  2019, the data for this scenario are based on the baseline projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2: middle of the road) scenarios from six modelling studies that also underpin the current policies scenario projections as of 2019 (the CD-LINKS Scenario Database, version 1.0) (McCollum et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020). This scenario database has not changed for SSP2 compared with 2019. The current policies scenario projects global GHG emissions assuming all currently adopted and implemented policies (defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or equivalent) are realized and that no additional measures are undertaken. The data for this scenario are updated and based on the current policies projections (cut-off year for policies: 2019) of the Climate Action Tracker (2019), International Energy Agency (IEA 2019) World Energy Outlook 2019, Joint Research Centre (Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model) (Keramidas et al. 2020), and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE)) (den Elzen et al. 2019; Kuramochi et al. 2019; PBL 2020). Four international modelling groups that were also included in the 2019 report provided updated projections in Roelfsema et al. (2020): the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, using the MESSAGE≠GLOBIOM model) (Fricko et al. 2017); the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES, using the AIM model) (Fujimori et al. 2017); the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK, using the REMIND≠MAgPIE model) (Luderer et al. 2015); Resources for the Future Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (RFF-CMCC) European Institute on Economics and the Environment (using the World Induced Technical Change Hybrid (WITCH) model) (Emmerling et al. 2016). One additional modelling group was also included from Roelfsema et al., the Computable Framework for Energy and the Environment (COFFEE) model of the Graduate School of Engineering (COPPE) of Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Rochedo et al. 2018). It should be noted that the latter five current policy projections from Roelfsema et al. (2020) originally use 31 December 2016 as their cut-off date for current policies. Post-2016 policies, rollback of policies since 2017, or planned policies to be implemented are not included. Policies are also assumed to be realized (Roelfsema et al. 2020). To ensure comparability, these latter five current policy projections have been adjusted to reflect changes to 2019. The influence of moving the policy cut-off date from 2016 to 2019 was analysed by comparing the results of the four modelling studies that provide estimates for both cut-off dates (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2017), which gave an estimated reduction of 1.5 GtCO2e (range: -0.4 to -3.0). The emissions projections of the last five modelling studies are adjusted accordingly to reflect the best estimate of the most recent current policies. Overall, this only has a small impact on the globally aggregated emissions projections for which the uncertainty ranges are large. The median estimate of global GHG emissions by 2030 for the current policies scenario is 59 GtCO2e (range: 56≠65 GtCO2e) (for comparison, 2019 emissions were 54 GtCO2e), which is   The historical estimates in chapter 2 are independent and should not be directly compared to the estimates in chapter 3. Under the current policies scenario used to assess the emissions gap, global 2019 GHG emissions are estimated to be about 53.6 GtCO2e, which is lower than the 2019 estimate of 59.1 GtCO2e reported in chapter 2. The estimate provided in chapter 2 is derived from land-use change (LUC) emissions of 6.8 GtCO2e, which differs to LUC emissions of 3.8 GtCO2e as calculated by most models used in chapter 3 (similar to Houghton and Nassikas 2017). The difference to be considered is therefore 56.7 GtCO2e against 53.6 GtCO2e, which is relatively small and well within the certainty range of the emissions estimates. Both estimates show a similar  increase of around 12 per cent compared with 2010 levels. There could be multiple reasons why the median emissions projections of the models (used in chapter 3) are lower than the independent historical emission estimates (used in chapter 2). For example, models may be calibrated to an earlier database (in contrast to the yearly updates of historical data), calibrations may be based on other emissions databases (such as IEA, PRIMAP or earlier versions of EDGAR), or models may not include all emission sources. The nine global models used for the current policies scenario cover a wide range of global GHG emissions for 2010 (47≠50 GtCO2e), whereas the historical emissions database has an estimate of 50 GtCO2e.  3.3.2 NDC scenarios and updates The NDC scenarios estimate the levels of GHG emissions projected as a result of the implementation of the mitigation actions pledged by countries in their NDCs. In line with previous Emissions Gap Reports, two NDC scenarios are considered: the unconditional and conditional NDC scenarios. The NDC scenarios of the 2020 report are based on the same data sources as the current policies scenario and are provided by the same 10 modelling groups as cited above, with updates for the Joint Research Centre, PBL and the Climate Action Tracker. PBL and the Climate Action Tracker have also analysed the impact of NDC target updates on global emissions by 2030 (last update 20 September 2020), which is estimated to be limited, resulting in reductions in total emissions by 2030 of less than 1 per cent compared with NDC scenarios without target updates reported since the Emissions Gap Report 2019. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on projected emissions under the NDC scenarios is limited so far, as NDC targets of major emitting countries, such as the G20 economies, have not changed at this point. For countries, whose reduction targets are defined per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), in particular China and India with intensity targets, the pandemic may likely affect the NDC emissions projections due to its impact on GDP growth, though information at this level is not yet available.  3.3.3 Mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement GHG emissions by 2030 that are consistent with a leastcost pathway towards limiting global warming below 2∞C, 1.8∞C and 1.5∞C are estimated in the same way as for the 2019 report and calculated from the scenarios underlying the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5∞C (SR1.5) (Huppmann et al. 2018a; Huppmann et al. 2018b; Rogelj et al. 2018). Maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onwards are used to classify scenario groups, which is consistent with the approach of the IPCC SR1.5, which groups scenarios based on their maximum temperature outcome (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018). This approach enables a close mapping of scenarios to the maximum temperature increase they would cause and thus informs various possible interpretations of the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2015; Schleussner et al. 2016). A comparison with the IPCC SR1.5 approach is provided in box 3.2. The three temperature scenario groups represent various degrees of ambition that range from limiting warming to around 2∞C, to interpretations of limiting warming to well below 2∞C, to pursuing to limit warming to 1.5∞C (see table 3.1). Each scenario considers a least-cost climate change mitigation pathway that starts long-term reductions from 2020.   Below 2.0°C scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero emissions are not reached before)1 to between 900 and 1,300 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018–2100 emissions to at most 1,200 GtCO2, when net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century are included. It is consistent with limiting warming below 2.0°C with about 66 per cent probability, both at the time of peak global warming and at the end of the century. The median estimate of 2030 GHG emissions for this scenario is 41 GtCO2e, which falls in the middle of the 36–45 GtCO2e range estimated for the lower 2°C scenario category of the IPCC SR1.5 (see table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018). ▶ Below 1.8°C scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero emissions are not reached before) to between 600 and 900 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018– 2100 emissions to at most 900 GtCO2. It is consistent with limiting warming over the course and at the end of the century to below 1.8°C with about 66 per cent or greater probability. The median estimate of 2030 emissions for this scenario is 35 GtCO2e. This scenario is included to provide more granular information on how emissions reduction requirements for 2030 change with gradually increasing stringency of global mitigation action. ▶ Below 1.5°C in 2100 scenario: This scenario limits maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the time net-zero CO2 emissions are reached (or until 2100 if net-zero emissions are not reached before) to 600 GtCO2, and cumulative 2018–2100 to at most 380 GtCO2, when net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century are included.2 It is consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5°C in 2100 with about 66 per cent probability, while limiting peak global warming during the twenty-first century to about 1.6–1.7°C with about 66 per cent or greater probability. This class of scenarios is consistent with the scenarios in IPCC SR1.5°C that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (explained in box 3.2; see also characteristics in table 3.1). The median estimate of 2030 emissions of 25 GtCO2e falls well within the range of 22–28 GtCO2e of the IPCC SR1.5 1.5°C scenarios with no or limited overshoot (see table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018).   The analysis included in this chapter is consistent with the latest assessment of the IPCC SR1.5 (2018). The range of Kyoto-GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with limiting warming to 1.5∞C used in this report (24 GtCO2e/ year with a range of 22≠30 GtCO2e/year) closely matches the 25≠30 GtCO2e/year range reported in IPCC SR1.5 (2018) for scenarios limiting global warming to 1.5∞C with no or limited overshoot. Differences are attributed to the exclusive use of scenarios that start emissions reductions from 2020 onwards in this report, compared with the wider set used in IPCC SR1.5. Overall, these minor changes do not affect the assessment of the adequacy of current NDCs for limiting warming to 1.5∞C or well below 2∞C. Cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onward never exceed 600 GtCO2 in the below 1.5∞C by 2100 scenario. This broadly corresponds to the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5∞C with 50 per cent probability (580 GtCO2 from 2018 until net-zero emissions are reached) of IPCC SR1.5, suggesting that temperature overshoot is limited to less than 0.1∞C  with 50 per cent probability, and to 1.6≠1.7∞C with 66 per cent probability. Cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 until the end of the century are at most 380 GtCO2 in the available scenarios, which is less than the IPCC SR1.5 remaining carbon budget of 420 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 1.5∞C with 66 per cent probability. Cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 onward never exceed 900 GtCO2 in the below 1.8∞C scenario. Using the IPCC SR1.5 assessment, this 900 GtCO2 equates to a 66 per cent probability of limiting warming to about 1.8∞C, and also corresponds to about a 50 per cent probability of limiting warming to 1.7∞C. For the below 2∞C scenario, maximum cumulative CO2 emissions from 2018 never exceed 1,300 GtCO2 and from 2018 to 2100 are 1,200 GtCO2 when accounting for net negative emissions in the second half of the century. Using the IPCC SR1.5 assessment, this 1,200 GtCO2 equates to limiting warming to below 2∞C with at least 66 per cent probability by 2100, though there is a slightly lower probability at peak warming during the century. This suggest that the probability of limiting warming to 1.9∞C is about 50 per cent.   3.4 Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures on GHG emissions by 2030 The COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures impact global GHG emissions. This section analyses how they impact current policy projections under different assumptions. Due to the high uncertainty surrounding how the pandemic will develop and impact CO2 emissions in particular, only explorative calculations are presented. As indicated in chapter 2, 2020 global CO2 emissions may drop 7 per cent (range: 2≠12 per cent) below 2019 levels depending on how national epidemics and lockdowns develop over time. Almost all the emissions reductions are due to a temporary drop in activity resulting from lockdown measures, which include, for example, the transport sector, with people requested to stay home and halt travelling, as well as economic activity. Since these emissions reductions are not the result of structural changes, they may quickly reverse once lockdown measures are lifted (Forster et al. 2020; Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2020). This means that a pronounced short-term dip in energy- and  industry-related CO2 emissions is anticipated, after which emissions may follow the pre-2020 growth trend. Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated rescue and recovery measures on 2030 emissions and global emissions pathways towards meeting the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement were assessed in a recent study (Dafnomilis et al. 2020), which presents `what if' scenarios based on explorative calculations and using sources available before June 2020. This methodology is used here, with some adjustments made to the GDP data. Using the short-term GDP projections of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) single-hit and second-hit scenarios for 2020 and 20213 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2020a; OECD 2020b), two post-COVID-19 economic growth scenarios are calculated. These economic projections are combined with two scenarios for future decarbonization rates (i.e. change in fossil CO2 emissions per unit of GDP): one based on the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario from the original model studies (labelled current trends), and one based on a post-COVID-19 scenario with lower decarbonization rates due to the rollback of current policies in countries (see chapter 2) and possible delays in climate  3 The projected GDP growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are -6 per cent and 5.2 per cent in the OECD single-hit scenario and -7.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent in the OECD second-hit scenario.  policy implementation (labelled rebound to fossil fuels). The rationale behind the second scenario is that several countries have announced emissions-intensive policies to stimulate economic recovery, therefore putting climate policies at risk of being rolled back (Climate Action Tracker 2020a; Miosio et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020). This impact is quantified by applying a decarbonization rate that is 50 per cent lower than the rate of the original model study for 2021≠2024 (Dafnomilis et al. 2020). The total energy and industry CO2 emissions for 2021≠2024 are calculated using a Kaya decomposition (Kaya 1990). For 2025≠2030, fossil CO2 emissions follow the same growth trend as suggested by the original model projections. The  non-CO2 GHG emissions and CO2 land-use-related emissions for 2020≠2030 are identical to the original pre-COVID-19 projections. However, preliminary data suggest that there may be an expansion of farming and livestock activities due to COVID-19-related consumption changes and market disruptions (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2020), which could lead to increased methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Deforestation rates in South American and Asian regions are also expected to increase due to a lack of regulatory measures, limited budgets and weak enforcement of adopted legislation to protect native ecosystems (AmadorJimenez et al. 2020; Azevedo 2020; LÛpez-Feldman et al. 2020; Rondeau et al. 2020).  Figure 3.2. Global total GHG emissions by 2030 under the original current policies scenario based on pre-COVID-19 studies and various `what if' scenarios using explorative calculations (post-COVID-19) (median and 10th to 90th percentile range)  Figure 3.2 shows projected GHG emissions by 2030 under each of these scenarios. The impact of the general slowdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated policy responses (figure 3.2 ≠ current trend) would lead to a reduction in global GHG emissions by 2030 of about 2≠4 GtCO2e (equivalent to 3≠7 per cent) compared with the pre-COVID-19 estimates for OECD's single-hit and second-hit scenarios. This assumes a pronounced short-  term dip in CO2 emissions, after which emissions follow pre-2020 growth trends. The Climate Action Tracker (2020a) finds a similar difference of about 2≠4 GtCO2e between the post- and pre-COVID-19 current policies projections by 2030. Comparing the IEA's World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA 2020b) post-COVID-19 global energy and industry CO2 emissions projections for their stated policies scenario4 (estimates published in 2019) suggests a similar difference  4 No directly comparable figures could be obtained for the IEA World Energy Outlook 2020 (2020c) because the 2020 edition does not provide current policies scenario projections. The following are used instead: i) the stated policies scenario, in which COVID-19 is gradually brought under control and the global economy return to pre-crisis levels the same year (this scenario reflects all current announced policy intentions and targets); ii) the delayed recovery scenario, which is designed with the same policy assumptions as the stated policies scenario, but shows lasting damage to economic prospects following a prolonged pandemic (IEA 2020c).   Emissions Gap Report 2020  of about 1.5≠4 GtCO2e between the post- and pre-COVID-19 stated policies projections by 2030. If the initial short-term dip in CO2 emissions is followed by growth trends with lower decarbonization rates due to countries' potential rollback of climate policies as part of COVID-19 responses, the decrease in global emissions by 2030 is projected to be significantly smaller at around 1.5 GtCO2e (instead of 4 GtCO2e) and may actually increase by around 1 GtCO2e (instead of -2 GtCO2e) (figure 3.2 ≠ rebound to fossil fuels second-hit and single-hit scenarios, respectively) compared with the pre-COVID-19 current policies scenario. Around the world, countries are launching economic rescue and recovery measures to cushion the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future global GHG emissions depend critically on the extent to which recovery measures are green (low carbon), which at present is difficult to evaluate comprehensively (see chapter 4). At the global level, the impact of `green recovery' responses can be estimated based on the IEA's (2020a) Sustainable Recovery Plan and its associated global energy and industry CO2 emissions projections under the IEA (2020b) sustainable recovery scenario. For the GHG emissions projections in figure 3.2, the IEA's energy and industry CO2 emissions were supplemented with land-use CO2 and non-CO2 emissions projections under current policies of the model studies underlying the original current policies scenario. The emissions projections in figure 3.2 also adopted the IEA's (2020b) assumption of a 0.8 GtCO2e emissions reduction following investments to tackle CH4 leakages from oil and gas operations by 2024, and kept this reduction constant to 2030. Figure 3.2 shows that 2030 emissions are only projected to be significantly reduced if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opportunity to pursue strong decarbonization. The sustainable recovery scenario results in global GHG emissions of 44 GtCO2e by 2030, which is a reduction of 15 GtCO2e ( just over 25 per cent) compared with the original current policies scenario used for the emissions gap assessment, and would bring 2030 emissions within the range consistent with least-cost pathways that limit global warming to below 2∞C (table 3.1). More dedicated attention would be required to reach levels consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.8∞C or 1.5∞C.  hit). It should be noted that the post-COVID-19 projections do not yet include information based on announcements of specific economic recovery measures (Miosio et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020). GHG emissions projections greatly depend on the starting point of calculations, in this case, the impact of COVID-19 on 2020 CO2 emissions, and are therefore likely to change in the coming months as the pandemic evolves and a vaccine becomes available worldwide. At present, it is unclear how temporary changes in international trade, consumption and mobility in urban areas will evolve in the medium term. Once countries lift lockdown measures, patterns are expected to return to preCOVID-19 levels. Similarly, it is uncertain how oil market prices will evolve and how oil exporters and producers will adapt to price changes of fossil resources. The projections reported in this chapter are therefore highly preliminary and primarily provide an indication of the magnitude of the direct effect of COVID-19 and related measures. 3.5 Implications of the emissions gap for the feasibility of achieving the longterm temperature goal of the Paris Agreement The previous sections clearly show that current NDCs remain insufficient to bridge the emissions gap by 2030 and that the size of the gap is as large as the 2019 assessment's estimate. They also indicate that emissions continue to rise under the (pre-COVID-19) current policies scenario and that COVID-19 is only likely to significantly reduce total GHG emissions by 2030 if used as an opening for economic recovery that fosters strong decarbonization. This section examines the implications of inadequate and delayed short-term action in achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. 3.5.1 Implications of postponing action in the context of long-term zero emissions goals Achieving the long-term temperature goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2∞C and pursue 1.5∞C depends strongly on implementing mitigation action by 2030. Taking a longer-term perspective illustrates how the low-carbon transition challenge until 2050 depends critically on this near-term action.  As noted in the beginning of this section, the emissions projections for the post-COVID-19 policy scenarios are highly indicative. They are based on simple calculations compared to the model-based pre-COVID projections and are driven by a wide range of GDP estimates for 2020 and 2021 from the OECD single-hit and second-hit scenarios published in June 2020 (OECD 2020a; OECD 2020b). The more recent GDP estimates of the IMF (2020) (June) and the OECD (2020c) Economic Outlook (September) are both within the projected GDP range of the OECD June estimates. Applying the more recent GDP estimates would result in GHG emissions projections for 2030 that are closer to those of the current trends scenario (figure 3.2 ≠ single-  The Paris Agreement aims to reach net-zero GHG emissions in the second half of this century, which means that any remaining CO2 and non-CO2 emissions are balanced with net CO2 removal or negative emissions. When calculated using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) typically applied by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to compare different GHGs, global warming will peak and then gradually decline thereafter. The timing of global net-zero CO2 and GHG emissions provides milestones for pathways that are consistent with the Paris Agreement and can be estimated from long-term emissions scenarios. According to the IPCC SR1.5, limiting warming to 1.5∞C with no or limited overshoot requires global CO2 and GHG emissions to reach net zero around 2050 (range: 2046≠2055) and 2067 (range: 2061≠2084), respectively. For temperature limits higher than 1.5∞C, the timing would be later (see table 2.4 in Rogelj et al. 2018). It should be noted that these net-zero target years are for the global pathways and therefore need to be achieved collectively. Setting netzero targets for individual countries involves considerations of equity and fairness, which means that national net-zero targets do not necessarily have to coincide with the net-zero years and global pathways. Previous Emissions Gap Reports have highlighted the key implications of postponing mitigation action and failing to bridge the 2030 emissions gap (Luderer et al. 2018), which are summarized in figure 3.3. Furthermore, the implications of postponed action are apparent when looking across the Emissions Gap Reports produced to date (UNEP  2019; Hˆhne et al. 2020). The global average emissions reductions required per year to meet 2030 emission levels that are consistent with the 2∞C and 1.5∞C scenarios are by now approximately quadruple and more than double, respectively, what they would have been had serious collective climate action started in 2010. This remarkable increase in annual emission reduction rates due to the lack of sufficient action add significantly to the challenge of meeting the Paris Agreement. The conclusion is clear: postponing ambitious climate action, thereby delaying the path towards reaching netzero emissions, will make it impossible to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goal of limiting global warming to 1.5∞C. Greater climate action is therefore needed by 2030 to make reducing global GHG emissions to levels consistent with 1.5∞C pathways feasible. To illustrate, the six 1.5∞C pathways available from the literature that limit the availability of biomass with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and that aim to maximize synergies with sustainable development all have GHG emission levels of at most 25 GtCO2e by 2030 (Bauer et al. 2018; Bertram et al. 2018; Grbler et al. 2018; Holz et al. 2018; Huppmann et al. 2018b; Kriegler et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). Similar insights can be drawn for limiting warming to well below 2∞C. In the absence of significant climate action by 2030, the daunting challenge that lies beyond 2030 suggests that limiting global warming to even slightly higher levels  than 1.5∞C would effectively be out of reach ≠ a conclusion that is also highlighted in the IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018). 3.5.2 Global warming implications Emissions until 2030 do not fully determine the levels of warming by the end of the century. However, the trend until 2030 can be used to estimate the projected warming based on the assumption that this trend will continue until 2100. The method used in previous Emissions Gap Reports has been followed to link 2030 GHG emissions and their continuation until 21005 to projected warming throughout the twenty-first century (Rogelj et al. 2016). This approach results in global warming estimates that are consistent  5 Since most scenarios that are used to inform the extension of emissions after 2030 assume exponentially increasing carbon prices throughout the century, the method applied here also implicitly assumes that climate action continues to be strengthened until 2100.  with temperature outcomes found in the wider integrated scenario literature (Jeffery et al. 2018). Since current policies and NDC scenarios have not changed since the 2019 report, the estimated temperature implications remain the same. The unconditional NDCs are consistent with limiting warming to no more than 3.2∞C (range: 3.0≠3.5∞C) by the end of the century (with 66 per cent probability). Full implementation of both conditional and unconditional NDCs would lower this estimate by about 0.2∞C. In contrast, the current policies scenario (preCOVID-19) results in greater emissions by 2030, which if continued until the end of the century would result in a global mean temperature rise of 3.5∞C by 2100 (range: 3.4≠ 3.9∞C, 66 per cent probability). In all cases, global warming would not be stabilized by 2100 and would continue to increase thereafter. These global warming ranges do not consider the growing number of announced net-zero emission goals, such as China's 2060 announced net-zero carbon goal, the European Union's 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal, the United Kingdom's legally enshrined 2050 net-zero GHG emissions goal, and South Africa's aspirational 2050 net-zero carbon emissions goal. Japan and the Republic of Korea have also announced similar goals. Although detailed studies of the temperature outcomes of these targets are not yet available, a preliminary estimate carried out for this report suggests that, collectively, these targets could further lower the temperature projections consistent with unconditional NDCs by about half a degree Celsius to around 2.7∞C. If the United States of America were to also adopt a net-zero GHG emissions target by 2050, as suggested in the Biden-Harris climate plan, the combined effect of all net-zero targets would be further strengthened. In that case, projections until the end of the century are estimated to be 2.5≠2.6∞C, which is 0.6≠0.7∞C lower than the global warming estimate for current unconditional NDCs. This is consistent with  other preliminary analyses (Climate Action Tracker 2020c). Once countries submit their announced net-zero targets as long-term low GHG emission development strategies to the UNFCCC, temperature projections can more formally reflect these intentions. The 2020 analysis makes it clear that neither NDCs nor current policies are adequate to limit warming below the temperature limits included in the Paris Agreement. This inadequacy is even further emphasized when considering the cumulative CO2 emissions by 2030 as implied by current NDCs. Starting from the 2018 level of global CO2 emissions of 41.6 GtCO2 (Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2018) and assuming a straight trajectory to 2030, the current unconditional NDC scenario implies cumulative emissions of about 510 GtCO2 (range: 495≠528 GtCO2) until 2030. Meanwhile, the IPCC SR1.5 estimated that the remaining carbon budget starting from 2018 and consistent with limiting warming to 1.5∞C (with 50≠ 66 per cent probability) amounts to around 320≠480 GtCO2, which rises to 700 GtCO2 and 1,070 GtCO2 for limiting warming to 1.75∞C and 2∞C (with 66 per cent probability), respectively.6 Current NDCs therefore fully deplete the carbon budget consistent with limiting warming to 1.5∞C and strongly reduce the remaining budgets for limiting warming to well below 2∞C, without making any progress towards bringing global CO2 emissions closer to net zero. Finally, COVID-19 containment measures have resulted in a marked but temporary reduction in global GHG emissions in 2020. However, unless economic recovery is used as an opportunity to foster a low-carbon transition, this temporary blip in global GHG emissions is estimated to result in no more than a 0.01∞C reduction of global warming by 2050, which by then is expected to have exceeded 1.5∞C (IPCC 2018; Forster et al. 2020). NDCs to date fail to reverse the long-term upward trend in emissions, which leaves no doubt that the current NDCs are completely inadequate to achieve the climate goals of the Paris Agreement.  4 Bridging the gap ≠ implications of current COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures  4.1 Introduction  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented health and socioeconomic challenges ≠ several of which will continue to have a profound effect on global society for many years to come. These new challenges compound many existing social and economic challenges, including widespread social inequality, rural/urban disparities and climate change. This confluence of challenges requires a considered response.  At the same time, COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures present an opening to stimulate the economy, while simultaneously accelerating a transition towards a lowcarbon economy consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Unless this opening is pursued, the Paris Agreement goals are likely to slip further out of reach (chapter 3).  Against this background, this chapter assesses two main questions:    What can we say about the size and extent to which  COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures to date  support low-carbon or high-carbon development?  (sections 4.2 and 4.3)    What are the emerging lessons for governments in  the pursuit of a low-carbon economic recovery?  (section 4.4)  Global fiscal actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are of an unprecedented scale. As section 4.2 shows, in September 2020, fiscal actions amounted to around US$12 trillion, or 12 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP). Particularly for countries with capacity to cheaply borrow funds (high `fiscal space'), governments have been willing to spend large sums of money, often drastically increasing public debt. For nations  without this fiscal space (often developing countries), public spending has been significantly lower to date. To date, most governments have rightly focused on funding economic rescue measures to protect lives and businesses in their immediate economic response to COVID-19. As competing objectives and varied COVID-19 impact and response timelines have emerged around the world, some governments have also started sharpening their fiscal focus to funding recovery measures to reinvigorate their economies. This chapter shows that so far, the opening to use rescue and recovery measures to support a low-carbon transition has largely been missed. Although there are examples of measures that support a transition towards a decarbonized world, most countries are currently adopting measures that support a high-carbon status quo of their economies ≠ or even foster new high-carbon investments. This is particularly the case for rescue measures. The jury is still out on whether COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures will lead to lower or higher global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the longer run (see also chapter 3). However, this chapter illustrates that certain rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support a rapid, employment-intensive and economically cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition. Such measures include i) support to low-carbon and renewable energy, low-carbon transport, zero-energy buildings and low-carbon industry; ii) support to research and development of zero-emissions technologies; iii) fiscal reforms of fossil fuel subsidies; and iv) nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation. A detailed evaluation of the appropriateness of given measures in various country contexts is required to assess the scope for rolling them out across countries, as impacts vary across different political, environmental,  economic, business, legal, regulatory and social contexts. Well-designed spending can also tackle other pressing problems such as air pollution, natural capital deficit, wealth and income inequality, inadequate quality of life and rural/urban disparities. The future can still be shaped in a way that helps bridge the emissions gap, through the decisions yet to be made on the composition and implementation of the announced recovery packages and on future recovery actions. 4.2 Unprecedented global fiscal spending on economic rescue and recovery measures Fiscal actions to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented in scale (see figure 4.1): around US$12 trillion, or 12 per cent of global GDP, had been spent by September 2020 (International Monetary Fund [IMF] 2020a, 2020b). For some G20 members, fiscal spending has been as high as 40 per cent of GDP. However,  spending profiles have not been homogeneous around the world. While the average G20 spend currently hovers at approximately 15 per cent of GDP, the average for the middle- and low-income country categories used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is less than 6 per cent (IMF 2020a). Fiscal responses to the COVID-19 crisis have included both new spending measures and changes to pre-existing revenue streams. Spending measures have included direct liquidity support for businesses and not-for-profits; direct provision of cash, resources and health services for citizens; new incentive measures (for instance to restart tourism); infrastructure investment and; investment in research and development (R&D). Revenue measures have included tax deferrals, tax cuts, and reductions in payments and rent for public services and resources. While the recorded size of fiscal action varies slightly by institution and tracker, overall spending trends are relatively consistent. The main difference is in the scope and timing of tracking fiscal measures, monetary measures, and deregulation initiatives.1 For instance, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) estimates the total fiscal stimulus of G20 countries, excluding fiscal actions at the European Union institutional level, at US$10.8 trillion as at August 2020 (Overseas Development Institute [ODI] 2020), compared with the US$10.3 trillion estimated by the IMF as at September 2020 (IMF 2020a) and the US$12.4 trillion estimated by the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project and the Green Fiscal Policy Network as at November 2020 (O'Callaghan et al. 2020). If monetary liquidity stimulus provided by countries' central banks is considered in addition to fiscal spending, the share of GDP spent on COVID-19 measures increases sharply: up to 70 per cent for some G20 members (ODI 2020). The range of fiscal and monetary interventions reflects the full policy space available to each country to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since many developing countries entered the pandemic with pre-existing vulnerabilities and limited fiscal space, and given the immediate threat to lives due to the health and income impacts of COVID-19, spending in these nations has primarily targeted short-term rescue measures. Key vulnerabilities include high levels of public indebtedness, slowing economic growth rates due to subdued global demand, and trade tensions. To date, this has left little room to fund recovery strategies with a longer-term perspective. In view of this, regional development banks and the international donor community have increased their commitment of support. At the regional level, for example, the African Development Bank initially responded by raising US$3 billion for a `Fight COVID-19' social bond in March 2020, the largest US-dollar-denominated social bond transaction in the capital markets to date (African Development Bank [AfDB] 2020a). This was followed by its creation of a US$10 billion response facility to assist governments and the private sector, its approval of loans and grants to individual member countries, and its support for regional efforts to combat the pandemic (AfDB 2020b; AfDB 2020c). Meanwhile for most European and Central Asian countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) plans to devote more than half of its total COVID-19 recovery investments to the green economy (Bennett 2020). The IMF doubled its COVID-19-related funding capacity from US$50 billion to US$100 billion in April 2020, had reached  US$280 billion lending commitment by October 2020, and stands ready to deploy US$1 trillion in lending capacity to help its member countries to weather the impact of the pandemic (IMF 2020c; IMF 2020d; IMF 2020e). Meanwhile, the World Bank Group also significantly increased its commitment for COVID-19 projects from US$14 billion in March 2020 to US$160 billion in April 2020 (World Bank 2020a; World Bank 2020b). The World Bank had allocated US$43 billion of this pool as at September 2020 (World Bank 2020c). Reflecting global spending patterns, in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, most World Bank projects supported emergency funding to address health priorities. More recently, the scope of funding has widened to include financial sector reform, education, governance, and market support.2 The international donor community is likely to play an important role in supporting and steering funding towards measures that support an inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economic recovery (UN Regional Commissions 2020), especially in the least developed countries. 4.3 Fiscal COVID-19 spending has so far primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic production This section provides a preliminary assessment of the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date support low- or high-carbon development, and whether they have a positive net effect on GHG emissions. As at October 2020, COVID-19 fiscal spending had primarily supported the global status quo of high-carbon economic production. While it is understandable that immediate rescue measures were directed to incumbent industry, later rescue and recovery measures could have supported low-carbon development, without forsaking opportunities for economic gain (Hepburn et al. 2020). Only a few countries have transformed green rhetoric into low-carbon recovery measures (that is, measures that lead to a reduction in GHG emissions). For most, recovery spending has mostly been high-carbon (that is, implying negative net effects GHG emissions) or neutral (that is, having no discernible effects on GHG emissions). Furthermore, in a number of cases, the effect on GHG emissions is still unclear. Focusing on G20 members, figure 4.2 provides an overview of climate negative, neutral and positive fiscal rescue and recovery measures  1 For example, the IMF (2020a) includes both additional spending and forgone revenue as `above the line measures' and equity injections, loans, asset purchase, debt assumptions and contingent liabilities as `liquidity support'. The ODI (2020) includes both `fiscal stimulus' including aid, grants and guarantees and `monetary (liquidity) stimulus' including central banks' explicit monetary liquidity injection and expected impact from lowering policy interest rates. Vivid Economics includes deregulation measures in its Green Stimulus Index (Vivid Economics 2020a). The highest granularity pure-form fiscal spending tracker, from the Oxford University Economic Recovery Project, combines inputs from these sources with its own tracking to report and classify policies covering all fiscal stimulus measures announced by the largest 50 economies since March 2020 (O'Callaghan et al. 2020). 2 See the World Bank Group's Operational Response to COVID-19 (coronavirus) ≠ Projects List (accessed on 11 September 2020) for a list of beneficiary countries: https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/what-we-do/brief/world-bank-group-operational-response-covid-19-coronavirusprojects-list.   All G20 members have implemented several  immediate rescue measures in response to the  COVID-19 pandemic (Climate Action Tracker 2020;  Energy Policy Tracker 2020; O'Callaghan et al. 2020;  Vivid Economics 2020a). These are mostly considered  neutral in terms of GHG emissions impact (for  example, health-care-related spending) or supporting  high-carbon industries without conditions for a low-  carbon transition attached.    Around a quarter of G20 members have dedicated  shares of their packages (accounting for up to per cent of GDP) explicitly to low-carbon measures as  at October/November 2020 (Climate Action Tracker  2020; Energy Policy Tracker 2020; O'Callaghan et al.  2020; Vivid Economics 2020a). Several countries are  spreading the announced sums across the years  up to 2025.    Most G20 members have brought forward measures  and packages supporting a high-carbon status quo  of their economies or are even fostering new high-  carbon investments (O'Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid  Economics 2020a). For some G20 members, no  explicit low-carbon measures could be identified  (O'Callaghan et al. 2020; Tiftik et al. 2020; Vivid  Economics 2020a).    Assessments of the effects on GHG emissions are  preliminary (see chapter 3), but will become more  robust as the composition and implementation details  of rescue and recovery packages become clearer.  Methodologies for identifying and quantifying the climate impacts of rescue and recovery measures and times of analysis vary slightly across institutions, bringing corresponding variance in results (figure 4.2, Annex II). However, for all trackers and across geographies, lowcarbon measures are significantly outweighed by neutral and high-carbon measures.  Preliminary analysis3 indicates that low-carbon policies have been slightly more prevalent in recovery measures than in rescue measures (O'Callaghan et al. 2020). This  is noteworthy, as the next stages of COVID-19 fiscal interventions are likely to shift a greater proportion of capital towards recovery measures, indicating prospects for increasing low-carbon measures in upcoming new recovery plans or in revisions to announced recovery plans. 4.4 Emerging lessons and examples for governments in the pursuit of lowcarbon economic recovery The previous sections show that the economic rescue and recovery measures announced by governments worldwide are unprecedented in scale. Although section 4.3 clearly shows that measures supporting a low-carbon transition have been limited to date, there is scope to adjust announced recovery measures to become more lowcarbon and to design future packages in a manner that supports an inclusive, resilient and low-carbon economic recovery (UN Regional Commissions 2020). As chapter 3 illustrates, global GHG emissions are projected to be significantly reduced by 2030 only if COVID-19 economic recovery is used as an opening to pursue decarbonization. Therefore, bridging the 2030 emissions gap critically depends on the extent to which this opening is used and integrated into substantially more ambitious new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report have highlighted the major long-term sectoral transformations that are needed to bridge the gap and reach net-zero GHG emissions globally and these are also relevant to consider in the context of recovery measures (box 4.1). Governments evaluate fiscal rescue and recovery spending, taxation and regulatory options against a variety of criteria. In most instances, the ability to stabilize or stimulate the economy through a specific measure is likely the first criteria considered by policymakers. However, measures that have similar short-term economic characteristics may differ considerably in terms of their social, environmental and long-term economic impacts. Considering medium- to long-term economic, environmental and social indicators can therefore help governments maximize the long-term prosperity benefits of their recovery measures. Various studies discuss, in a global context, the benefits of aligning policy with different indicators. These are summarized in table 4.1 (Flyvbjerg 2020; Hepburn et al. 2020; International Energy Agency [IEA] 2020; Jotzo et al. 2020; O'Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020b; World Bank 2020d). For country-specific cases, detailed evaluation is required to assess the appropriateness of each measure, as impacts vary across different political, environmental, economic, business, legal, regulatory and social domains. To design   optimal policy, it is important that results for each dimension  are assessed and weighed against each other.  support to research and development of zero-emissions technologies  Some fiscal rescue and recovery measures are likely to  perpetuate high-carbon and environmentally damaging development (see table 4.2 to table 4.7 for detailed COVID-19  examples). These include:  fossil fuel subsidies through fiscal reform nature-based solutions, including large-scale landscape restoration and reforestation.    fossil fuel-based infrastructure investments or fiscal  incentives for high-carbon technologies and projects    waivers or rollbacks of environmental regulations    bailouts of fossil fuel-intensive companies without  conditions for low-carbon transition or environmental  sustainability: relevant industries include airlines,  internal combustion automotive companies, industrial  industries and fossil energy companies.  Conversely, many fiscal rescue and recovery measures can simultaneously support rapid, employment-intensive and cost-effective economic recovery and a low-carbon transition (see table 4.2 to table 4.7 for detailed examples). Broad categories include:    support for zero-emissions technologies and  infrastructure, for example, low-carbon and renewable  energy, low-carbon transport, zero-energy buildings  and low-carbon industry  Experience from early COVID-19 rescue and recovery measures can provide valuable insights for policymakers designing economic rescue and recovery measures for the immediate future. Based on an assessment of recently published literature and information from available rescue and recovery trackers, table 4.2 to table 4.7 provide case examples of low-carbon and high-carbon recovery measures organized by main sectors. All tables have been constructed based on information available in October 2020. Each table includes a set of examples that reduce GHG emissions and a set of examples that tend to increase GHG emissions or foster lock-in of high carbon emissions. The case examples presented have all been cited by multiple sources and many incorporate relevant additional socioeconomic considerations, such as employment or social benefits (CarbonBrief 2020; Energy Policy Tracker 2020; O'Callaghan et al. 2020; Vivid Economics 2020a). Further research is required to assess the replicability of specific recovery examples in different country contexts given their different environmental, social and economic dimensions.   One aspect not directly considered in this chapter is the extent to which the implications of COVID-19 and associated rescue and recovery measures may influence underlying drivers of high-carbon production and consumption. Box 4.2  provides an example of how COVID-19 could compound economic and environmental incentives for a transition out of coal, using India as an illustrative example.  Box 4.2. A potential opening for accelerated retirement of coal plants in India  Coal-based power is an important part of India's immediate energy future to enable reliable and modern electricity access in a historically energy-poor nation. However, beneficial economics of an accelerated phaseout of old coal-fired power plants, and expressions of political support for doing so, offer the possibility of postCOVID recovery and both climate and air pollution gains. India has one of the largest and youngest coal power fleets in the world, with an installed capacity of 205 GW and average plant age of around 12 years (Malik et al. 2020). India's fleet continues to grow, with 6.7 GW added in FY2019-20 and another 59.8 GW in the pipeline, of which 23.7 GW are on hold for various reasons (Central Electrical Authority [CEA] 2020a). In contrast, 10 GW have been retired since April 2014 (India, Ministry of Power 2020a). However, rapid capacity addition in recent years (nearly 60 per cent of India's coal capacity was commissioned between 2010 and 2020), lower-than-forecasted growth in demand, and competition from renewable energy have created a power surplus. The entire coal fleet is facing low utilization rates (55≠60 per cent) and competition for limited coal supply. Forty GW of coal-fired projects were financially stressed in 2018 (India, Ministry of Power 2018). In addition, new pollution control norms will add costs to coal-based electricity production. Reflecting these developments, in her budget speech for 2020, the Finance Minister suggested that old thermal plants with high carbon emissions should be closed, and the Power Minister later announced that 5.1 GW had been earmarked for shutdown due to noncompliance with pollution standards. Two major states, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, have announced that they will no longer construct new coal plants (Carbon Copy Editorial Team 2019).  In the medium term, COVID-19 is expected to cause a sustained decline in electricity demand compared with pre-COVID-19 trends (Spencer 2020). This could reinforce a move away from coal. Analysts have identified accelerated retirements of coal plants as a catalyst for reviving the power sector, while reducing air pollution and GHG emissions. Studies estimate that there is a strong economic and environmental case for decommissioning 27≠36 GW of old, expensive or polluting plants in the short term (Fernandes and Sharma 2020; Srikanth and Krishnan 2020). This would release debt-ridden utilities from contractual fixed cost obligations and improve the utilization of younger, more efficient and cleaner plants, while also releasing lowcost coal linkages. At the same time, it would result in considerable savings in terms of system-level costs and GHG emissions (Dang, Nuwal and Acharya 2020; Ghosh and Ruha 2020). It would also generate upstream benefits on the balance sheets of public sector banks at a critical moment. Increasing the usage of cleaner plants would avoid the cost of retrofitting old, dirty plants with air pollution control equipment. Furthermore, utilities would be free to lower their power purchase costs by replacing the lost generation with cheaper renewable energy or power exchange. Implementing an accelerated retirement programme for old coal plants will face technical and political constraints, particularly if the promoter has not fully recovered their equity. Proposals to overcome such challenges have recently emerged, such as bundling the decommissioning costs into renewable energy auctions (Dang, Nuwal and Acharya 2020) or raising government bonds funded by ratepayer surcharges to buy out brownfield assets (known as `securitization') (Shrimali 2020).  5 Bridging the gap ≠ the role of international shipping and aviation   5.1 Introduction and framing Emissions from the shipping and aviation sectors have increased in the past decades (though they reduced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic) and accounted for approximately 2 GtCO2 in 2019 (International Maritime Organization [IMO] 2020; Lee et al. in press). About twothirds of these emissions are international, meaning they are not included in national totals reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and are instead added as memo items. Although international emissions are not covered under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of most signatories to the Paris Agreement, article 4 commits its signatories to reducing all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. No sector is exempt from this commitment. At present, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are the specialized United Nations agencies tasked with addressing international GHG emissions. Shipping and aviation both largely depend on liquid fossil fuels and have inherently long technology development and fleet turnover times, which make it difficult for the sectors to decarbonize. In addition to GHG emissions, both sectors emit other emissions that contribute to climate change, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), water vapour, back carbon (soot) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) (Eyring et al. 2010; Eide et al. 2013; Lee et al. in press). This chapter presents current and projected emissions to assess how much the international transport sectors are contributing to the emissions gap (section 5.2). Section 5.3 analyses the technical, operational and fuel options available to decarbonize shipping and aviation. Section 5.4 contrasts the projected emissions with global emissions pathways required to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goals in order to assess when, and to what extent, the decarbonization options should be implemented, while also  evaluating the current policy goals in the context of the Paris Agreement. Section 5.5 concludes the findings. 5.2 Current emissions, projections and drivers Increased globalization and diversified economies have led to a rapid growth in human mobility and the transport of goods. In turn, increasingly connected and affordable transport systems have further enabled globalization and associated economic development, bringing socioeconomic benefits to parts of the population. In addition to rising global average incomes, this has caused an increase in consumer demand for travel and traded goods, reaching record levels in 2019 with 1.4 billion international tourists (World Tourism Organization [WTO] 2019), 4.5 billion passengers, 61.3 million tons of air freight (International Air Transport Association [IATA] 2020a) and 11 billion tons of world seaborne trade recorded (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] 2019). 5.2.1 Shipping GHG emissions from shipping, principally carbon dioxide (CO2), totalled approximately 1 GtCO2 in 2018, the latest year for which detailed data are available (IMO 2020), with small additional emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). CH4 emissions have risen in recent years (albeit from a low base), due to the increased number of liquified natural gas (LNG)-fuelled ships. Shipping also emitted around 100,000 tons of black carbon (soot) in 2018, which is a short-lived climate pollutant that contributes to warming (Comer et al. 2017; IMO 2020). Other non-CO2 emissions (such as NOx and SO2) cause net cooling effects, largely through the formation of low-level clouds from SO2 emissions (Fuglestvedt et al. 2009; Peters et al. 2012), although in January 2020, new air quality protection regulations for shipping entered into force, with the aim of reducing these emissions (Sofiev et al. 2018).  In 2018, international voyages (those between ports in different countries) were responsible for 71 per cent of the sector's CO2 emissions (IMO 2020).1 Many of the ships that undertake international voyages also undertake domestic voyages. For example, a ship may load cargo in a port in one country, sail to a second port in that same country to load more cargo, and then sail to a port in another country to discharge cargo. CO2 shipping emissions in 2018 were lower than in 2008, which was the historic peak. As shown in figure 5.1, seaborne  trade and emissions were closely correlated between 1990 and 2008. At the end of 2007, an oversupply of ships led ships to reduce their speed in order to ensure optimal utilization of their cargo capacity, which consequently reduced emissions. This became even more prominent in 2008 due to the decline in transport demand caused by the global financial crisis. After 2008, ships permanently reduced their speed by about 10≠20 per cent compared with their pre-2008 speed, and the average size of bulkers and container ships increased, resulting in further efficiency improvements. In future decades, CO2 emissions from shipping are projected to increase by 4≠50 per cent from 2018 levels according to a range of plausible business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios that assume no further policy intervention on shipping emissions. This is due to the projected 40≠100 per cent increase in transport demand, despite projected fuel efficiency improvements in some scenarios (Faber et al. 2016; IMO 2020). The main driver of the increase in transport demand is the projected growth in wealth, as there is a strong positive correlation between gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and maritime transport demand. DNV GL (2020) estimates that COVID-19 will cause the total demand for seaborne transportation to decline by  approximately 8 per cent in 2020, which will vary between cargo segments. By May 2020, some segments had seen an increase in activity compared with the same period in 2019, though container shipping capacity reduced by 6 per cent. Manufacturing is typically more affected in an economic downturn, which in turn reduces the demand for seaborne trade of manufactured products and base materials. IMO (2020) did not foresee COVID-19 as impacting emissions projections for 2030 and beyond. 5.2.2 Aviation In 2018, global CO2 aviation emissions were approximately 1 Gt (Lee et al. in press), of which about 65 per cent were international and 35 per cent domestic (Fleming and de  1 According to another definition of international shipping emissions, which refers to ship types rather than to voyages, 87 per cent of emissions are international (IMO 2020).  Emissions Gap Report 2020  LÈpinay 2019).2 Emissions have increased by around 27 per cent over the last five years (an average annual increase of 4.6 per cent based on International Energy Agency (IEA) data), while passenger numbers have grown by 38 per cent (based on International Air Transport Association (IATA) data). Despite increased access to mobility, aviation remains the preserve of high-income earners. Over 60 per cent of demand for aviation comes from inhabitants of high-income countries (Becken and Pant 2019). According to Gˆssling and Humpe (2020), approximately 1 per cent of the world's population account for more than half of the total emissions from passenger air travel, thus revealing a strong equity dimension to aviation as a consumer sector. Chapter 6 discusses some of the demand-side issues related to aviation emissions and how these can be managed and reimagined in a post-pandemic future. CO2 emissions from international aviation, along with related non-CO2 emissions from water vapour, NOx and soot/  aerosol particles have a net warming impact on climate, with the total impact of both types of emission estimated at 3.5 per cent of all drivers of climate change from human activities (Lee et al. in press). Historical CO2 emissions from global aviation result in approximately 34 per cent of present-day aviation-related effective radiative forcing (ERF), with non-CO2 impacts accounting for approximately 66 per cent of ERF from (global) aviation (Lee et al. in press). The aviation industry expects emissions to increase in the coming decades, despite the current COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently estimated to impact traffic until at least 2024 (IATA 2020b). The latest emissions projections from the eleventh meeting of the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP/11) (figure 5.2, prepared prior to the pandemic) suggest that emissions of international aviation will increase from about 0.5 GtCO2 of emissions (2015) to 1.2≠1.9 GtCO2 by 2050 (Fleming and de LÈpinay 2019). Revenue ton-kilometres (a metric for transport work in the aviation sector) are also expected to increase fourfold in the same period.   Figure 5.2 shows projections of CO2 emissions for international aviation to 2050, and incorporates projected improvements in technology, operations and infrastructure use. These trends assume that growth is unconstrained by airport infrastructure or airspace operational constraints. A wide range of factors, such as fluctuations in fuel prices and global economic conditions, can affect such trends.  The current COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected demand for aviation transport, with 2020 passenger numbers expected to be 55 per cent lower than 2019 levels, and air cargo 12≠15 per cent lower (IATA 2020b; IATA 2020c), though it is too early to tell what this will mean in terms of emissions. Current IATA forecasts suggest that short-haul traffic will recover more quickly than long-haul   traffic. Market analysts suggest that some of the reductions in corporate travel could be permanent, which is supported by the Global Business Travel Association's ongoing polling (Global Business Travel Association [GBTA] 2020). Overall, emissions are likely to increase as traffic recovers, but there is significant uncertainty over the rate of recovery and impact on long-term projections.  emissions reach net zero by 2050 (interquartile range: 2045≠2055), with active permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere thereafter. To limit global warming to below 2∞C, CO2 emissions need to reach net zero by 2070 (66 per cent probability). Based on these pathways, it is clear that international shipping and aviation must be completely decarbonized by around 2050 for 1.5∞C and by 2070 for 2∞C.  5.2.3 International shipping and aviation emissions and the goals of the Paris Agreement Unless States choose to include international shipping and aviation GHG emissions in their initial NDCs, these emissions are not addressed by national policies. The emissions trajectories from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5∞C (SR1.5) (2018) indicate that global temperature increase can only be limited to no more than 1.5∞C if CO2  This is illustrated in figure 5.3, which shows combined CO2 emissions from international shipping and aviation as percentages of the available CO2 budget, relative to IPCC illustrative 1.5∞C scenarios. Without further mitigation action, combined international emissions will consume around 60≠220 per cent of the available global CO2 budget by 2050. This remains the case even when the benefits of technology are included to arrive at the `low' estimates for fuel usage.   assuming the increased capacity is utilized), alternative sea routes that have shorter distances, and reduced speed (DNV GL 2019).  Improving supply chains and logistics There is significant potential to improve efficiencies throughout transport networks, aligning transport demand with size, operations and functionality of ships as well as land-based infrastructure and logistics systems. Improving fleet efficiency can be achieved through increased utilization (for example, reducing ballast leg using larger vessels,  Reducing ships' speed has large emissions reduction potential. The required propulsion power of a ship increases approximately to the third power of its speed. Since 2008, the shipping fleet has reduced its average speed and significantly reduced its emissions, though further reductions are possible (IMO 2020). Reducing the speed of large tankers from 12 knots to 11 knots for example,  reduced emissions per ton-mile by around 8 per cent. Below 7 knots, the emissions begin to increase again (Lindstad and Eskeland 2015).   Improving ship design and operation The newest generation of ships (built after 2015) are typically about 10≠15 per cent more efficient than older ships, mainly due to optimized hull design and propeller efficiency and reduced auxiliary loads. This was at least partly driven by regulation on the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), an IMO efficiency standard that applies to new ships contracted from 2013 (Faber and 't Hoen 2016). Ships built in the next five years may improve by another 15≠25 per cent through improved machinery and electricity systems, which could include measures such as hybridization (peak load shaving in conjunction with batteries) and waste heat recovery. Later generations could include a full-scale application of sails and kites, air lubrication and more advanced waste heat recovery, with another 5≠10 per cent improvement on average (DNV GL 2017). Operational measures could reduce emissions by a further 5≠10 per cent (DNV GL 2017; IMO 2020). The total potential of improving the energy efficiency of shipping up to 2050, including logistics and supply chain improvements, speed reduction and ship design and operation, ranges from 35 to 55 per cent compared with 2018 (DNV GL 2019; Balcombe et al. 2020; IMO 2020). Most measures are expected to be cost-efficient with current fuel prices, though wind power, solar panels, air lubrication and waste heat recovery, which require significant investment, need a higher fuel price to be cost-efficient (IMO 2020). 5.3.2 Aviation Technological improvements ≠ engine and airframe A recent review (ICAO 2019a) requested by ICAO using independent experts examined the two types of aircraft that burn the overwhelming majority of fuel, the single-aisle (such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320) and the twin-aisle (such as the Boeing 777 and 787, and Airbus A330 and A350), and estimated their performance in 10 and 20 years (2027 and 2037). According to the review, radical alteration in aircraft shape is unlikely by 2037, with improvements limited to `tube and wing' type aircraft. The following targets were deemed challenging but possible by 2037: reductions in fuel burn for single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft of 21.6 per cent and 21.0 per cent, respectively, which are annual improvements of 1.22 and 1.28 per cent. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in October 2018, IATA forecasted compound annual growth in air travel of 3.5 per cent, which equates to a doubling over 20 years and is considerably greater than the reductions likely to follow from technological improvements. In the ICAO/CAEP report, independent experts accepted the constraints on design that are currently imposed. In line with current practice, aeroplanes are designed for longer ranges than required, as this gives flexibility in terms of operations and makes resale easier, though at the expense of potential fuel-burn reductions. In a 2010 ICAO review (ICAO 2010), the following additional, but relatively small, savings were identified from changing design constraints:     reducing the cruise Mach number from M=0.84 to  0.78 would give potential savings of around 4 per cent  for twin-aisle aircraft    increasing wingspan for some designs would reduce  fuel burn, though this would require wider gates at  airports or folding wings (as on the Boeing 777X)    injecting water into engines to mitigate the high-  temperature problems experienced at take-off would  improve engine performance during cruise as less  turbine cooling air would be required    restricting top-of-climb performance (to make the  clime rate smaller) would allow for better optimization  of engines.  The independent experts also looked at advanced alternative aircraft types, such as the blended wing body (a design that merges fuselage with a large delta wing), and configurations with wider bodies, smaller wings and engines at the rear of the aeroplane. For the blended wing body, the fuel-burn reduction was 10≠12 per cent compared with advanced conventional aircraft. Another alternative design, the Aurora D8, which was studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with support from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), has wings and a separate fuselage, and offers roughly a 13 per cent improvement. Chen et al. (2019) estimate that blended wing bodies will be 31.5 per cent more efficient in terms of fuel burn than current aircraft. In general, there are likely to be improvements in aircraft airframes and engines in the next 20 or so years, which will improve the burn-fuel metric by around 1.2 per cent per year. However, the crucial conclusion is that the sum of the potential improvements does not come near to matching the projected growth in aviation, let alone to reducing emissions from the current level. Operational improvements In practice, the operation of aircraft is generally less than optimal as they often fly below full capacity and cannot take the best flight route due to diversions and holding patterns. Improved operations could be achieved from, for example, single-engine taxi procedures and ground holds in the terminal area, reduced or de-rated thrust on departure, more direct routing and weather-optimized routing en route, and continuous descent approach (CDA) during arrival. A recent ICAO study calculated that routing inefficiencies currently total 2≠6 per cent (Brain and Voorbach 2019). Clearly, the scope for operational improvements to reduce CO2 emissions is limited. 5.3.3 Alternative fuels For both the aviation and shipping sectors, decarbonization cannot occur without a transition away from the fossil fuels   that they currently burn to alternative fuels. Such fuels could include synthetic hydrocarbon fuels3 produced from biomass, waste products or CO2 direct air capture (DAC) from the atmosphere (The Royal Society 2019), zero-carbon fuels and energy carriers, such as hydrogen and ammonia (as long as they are produced without generating additional GHG emissions). This section discusses non-fossil alternative fuels for shipping and aviation that have low, zero or negative GHG emissions throughout their life cycle. Biofuels Various biofuels are currently used in shipping and aviation, albeit on a small scale, with estimates suggesting that these will comprise less than 1 per cent of total aviation fuel by 2024 (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2019). While biofuels can have lower life cycle emissions, assessing their merits is complex, as gains towards `carbon neutrality' depend heavily on their feedstocks and processes, as well as on their direct and indirect emissions, particularly those resulting from land-use change (LUC) from biofuel production. Assuming that biofuel combustion is carbon neutral is therefore a fundamental accounting error that rests on implicit spatiotemporal boundaries and assumptions (Searchinger et al. 2009), as for many biofuels, the energy return on investment is comparatively low or possibly negative (Hall, Lambert and Balogh 2014; Chiriboga et al. 2020). The availability of land and water is also a key and potentially ethical constraint on the availability of biofuel (Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2011). For shipping, biofuels are currently three to five times as expensive as conventional fuels (CE Delft and Ecorys forthcoming) and are of similar magnitudes for aviation (IEA 2018). E-fuels from renewable energy Other pathways have been discussed for the production of synthetic hydrocarbon fuels, such as power-to-liquid `electro-fuels' (e-fuels) (Schmidt et al. 2018), or more broadly `power-to-x pathways' (Kober et al. 2019) (for example, by incinerating municipal waste). The generation of such fuels critically requires the availability of renewable electricity, CO2 and water to synthesize hydrocarbon fuels. To create carbon-neutral fuels, hydrogen needs to be produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, while CO2 needs to be taken directly from the atmosphere by DAC and used in Fischer-Tropsch, methanation or methanol synthesis processes. DAC still represents a significant challenge, although some CO2 may be captured from residual emissions, which includes processes such as fermentation and cement manufacturing. In terms of environmental performance, e-fuels have much smaller land requirements than biofuel and do not depend on arable land (Schmidt et al. 2018), though they  do require significant renewable electricity (Fuhrman et al. 2020). Notwithstanding the significant barriers of sufficient available renewable energy and CO2 from DAC, creating synthetic fuel is technologically feasible, though at much greater costs than direct fossil fuel extraction and refining. In the case of aviation, the use of renewably-generated synthetic fuels (or biofuels) would also benefit the climate through reducing contrail-related warming, due to their absence of soot particles (which are formed from fossil kerosene aromatics and cause the formation of contrails) (Bier et al. 2017; Bier and Burkhardt 2019). Hydrogen and ammonia Hydrogen can be used as a zero-carbon fuel, either in combustion engines or fuels cells. To ensure that hydrogen is carbon neutral, it must be generated from renewable energy sources or reformation of fossil fuels during carbon capture and storage (CCS). Although liquid hydrogen (LH2) has an energy density per unit mass approximately three times greater than aviation kerosene, it has a much lower energy density per unit volume. Thick layers of insulation are also required, which further increases the effective volume. Its use in aviation would therefore require radical aircraft design changes (McKinsey and Company 2020). Similarly, for ships, hydrogen requires about seven times the space of diesel tanks (DNV GL 2019) and would result in a loss of revenue and range. There are also many infrastructural barriers to LH2-powered aircraft or ships, such as generation and distribution, meaning its development is only likely under a larger-scale hydrogen-oriented energy economy. The energy content of hydrogen may be obtained without the problems of cryogenic or high-pressure storage by using a hydrogen-containing compound as a carrier. This is done with hydrocarbons but can also be done with nitrogen to form ammonia. Burning ammonia releases the energy of hydrogen on combustion without producing CO2. Ammonia requires a volume of around 3.5 times the space of traditional fuel tanks (DNV GL 2019). Internal combustion engines can be modified to run on ammonia, though research and development are needed, including on ways to limit emissions of NO, a potent GHG (Valera-Medina et al. 2018). Full-electric propulsion Full-electric propulsion can be carbon neutral if the electricity is generated without emitting CO2 (Epstein and O'Flarity 2019). However, a major barrier in both aviation and shipping is that the energy stored in batteries per unit mass is around 250 W-hr/kg, whereas hydrocarbon fuel has a calorific value of around 12,000 W-hr/kg. In addition, electrical machinery and control units are heavy and large.  For aircraft, the heaviness of batteries means that battery-propelled aircraft will be limited to shorter ranges. A recent paper by Langford and Hall (2020) states that electric propulsion makes economic sense for ranges between 50 and 200 miles, meaning it will only slightly contribute to reductions in aviation sector emissions. Similarly, batteries can be used as propulsion energy for ships undertaking short voyages, most obviously ferries, but not long voyages unless radical improvements are made. Implications and key challenges: a focus on price signals and economic incentives There are several options that the shipping sector can take to transition away from fossil fuels. Techno-economic analyses from the last two years (Ash and Scarbrough, 2019; Lloyd's Register [LR] and University Maritime Advisory Services [UMAS] 2019; DNV GL 2020; IEA 2020) all indicate that sustainable ammonia is the cheapest decarbonization option for shipping in many scenarios, and would only require a small evolution in current on-board machinery. However, the technology is just in development and full-scale pilots are unlikely for another three years, thus prolonging the period of uncertainty in least-cost fuels. Non-hydrocarbon fuel options for aviation require radical airframe/engine and infrastructural changes. In contrast, `drop-in' fuel options, which include alternative hydrocarbon fuels such as biofuels and e-fuels, require little or no changes to aircraft, though they still emit CO2 when combusted in engines. Despite this, drop-in fuels achieve greater climate benefits compared with the life cycle of conventional jet fuel. The use of alternative low- or zero-carbon fuels will involve massive investment, most of which (90 per cent) will finance the production and distribution infrastructure required, with far less required for on-board engines and fuel storage (Carlo et al. 2020). For operators, this will be reflected in the cost of fuel, which is significant for both shipping and aviation. Future carbon-neutral and zero-carbon fuel prices are estimated to cost in the range of US$20≠100/GJ, which is significantly higher than current aviation fuel costs of around US$7.5/GJ. IEA estimated that the mean production costs of aviation biofuels in 2018 were approximately two to three times that of fossil jet kerosene (IEA 2018). The major uncertainty lies in the cost and availability of the primary energy sources, such as sustainable biomass and renewable electricity (DNV GL 2020; IMO 2020; LR and UMAS 2020). Shipping fuels traded at around US$8≠9/GJ in summer 2020 (Ship & Bunker undated), although recent prices have reached over US$16/GJ. A shift to fuels that emit low GHG emissions and are renewable provides a very strong economic signal that will further affect the fundamental inputs to fleet growth scenarios. If higher fuel costs translate into airfares, demand will reduce according to price elasticities, assuming all other factors remain equal. Elasticities for passenger air travel vary considerably (Smyth and Pearce 2008) but could average in the order of -1.1 across travel classes  (Becken and Carmignani 2020). In the case of shipping, supply chains that adapt to these new economic conditions may enable fleets using renewable fuels to modify their services and modernize their technologies in such a way that allows GHG targets to be met with minimal impacts on the growth in demand for shipping services (Halim, Smith and Englert 2019). Ultimately, the price gap between incumbent fossil fuels and post-fossil fuels represents a key challenge that prevents investment both in the sectors and infrastructure on land. Without sufficiently stringent regulation in place to force or enable a business case for zero-carbon fuel use, these investments are unlikely to flow at the required scale until there is either a customer preference or a price premium for zero-carbon shipping services.  5.4 Pathways to lower emissions  Section 5.2 shows that projected emissions from shipping and aviation are incompatible with emissions pathways that are consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals, given projected increases and the lack of permanent CO2 removals. This means that the decarbonization options presented in section 5.3 need to be implemented despite their high costs. This section discusses the agreed policy goals for both sectors, concludes that they are not sufficient to achieve full decarbonization by 2050 or well before 2070 and discusses how policies could be intensified. 5.4.1 Current shipping policies In 2011, the IMO adopted mandatory technical and operational energy efficiency measures that were expected to significantly reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from international shipping. These mandatory measures (EEDI/ Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan ≠ SEEMP) entered into force on 1 January 2013. In 2016, additional amendments were adopted to mandate the collection and reporting of ships' fuel oil consumption data. The IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) adopted the Initial IMO Strategy on reduction of GHG emissions from ships in 2018, which sets out levels of ambition for shipping emissions. These are stated in the strategy as:    phase out GHG emissions from international shipping  as soon as possible through strengthened energy  efficiency design requirements for ships    improve the carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit  of transport work) of international shipping by at least  40 per cent in 2030 and 70 per cent by 2050, both  relative to 2008    set GHG emissions from international shipping on  a declining pathway as soon as possible, reducing  the total annual GHG emissions of international  shipping by at least 50 per cent by 2050 compared  with 2008 as a point on a pathway of emissions  reductions consistent with the Paris Agreement temperature goals.  The IMO is due to agree on a Revised GHG Strategy in 2023, which will be a key opportunity to update the quantitative targets in line with the latest science, and to remove current ambiguities on their alignment to the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Currently, CO2 emissions from domestic shipping are generally not addressed in NDCs. Role of non-State actors and national strategies The system change required for shipping to decarbonize is considerable and demands industry regulation in order to overcome a range of market barriers and failures. The IMO's most common regulatory target is ships and therefore shipowners, though significant evidence shows that there are many additional energy efficiency barriers and failures (Faber et al. 2012; Rehmatulla and Smith 2015).  Private standards and initiatives to reduce GHG emissions from shipping include the following:    Getting to Zero Coalition: a collaboration of  approximately 140 corporations focused on achieving  the goal of establishing scalable zero-carbon energy  solutions for international shipping from 2030 (Global  Maritime Forum 2020).    Poseidon Principles: a commitment to transparent  annual reporting of portfolio operational carbon  intensity relative to an interpretation of the Initial  IMO Strategy by financial institutions representing  approximately 30 per cent of the capital invested in  international shipping (Poseidon Principles undated).    Sea Cargo Charter: a commitment to transparent  annual reporting of supply chain operational carbon  intensity relative to an interpretation of the Initial IMO  Strategy by charterers and cargo owners (Sea Cargo  Charter undated).  Altogether, these create a growing set of decarbonization-aligned initiatives that will move capital and purchasing decisions and hold organizations accountable to the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Their connection to the Initial IMO Strategy and Paris Agreement temperature goals indicates that a clarification of the IMO's ambitions within its Revised Strategy could be easily translated into further private sector action.  aspirational climate change goals for international aviation, which are to improve fuel efficiency by 2 per cent per year until 2050, and to achieve carbon-neutral growth from 2020 onward. ICAO Member States have identified four main elements in a `basket of measures' to achieve these goals: aircraft technologies, operational improvements, sustainable alternative fuels and a market-based mechanism. Member States are also exploring the feasibility of a long-term aspirational goal for international aviation (ICAO 2016; ICAO 2019b). The means of in-sector reductions include aircraft technology improvements through the Aeroplane CO2 Standard (ICAO undated a), along with guidance on operational improvement measures to minimize fuel burn (ICAO undated b) and sustainability criteria for aviation fuels. The Aeroplane CO2 Standard is expected to deliver incremental reductions in line with historic improvements in efficiency. Recent reports suggest that about 1.2≠1.4 per cent in fleet efficiency gain is possible per year (ICAO 2019; Fleming and de LÈpinay 2019), which falls short of the ICAO target of 2 per cent per year and is significantly less than the projected annual growth in aviation. The route taken by ICAO to achieve carbon-neutral growth is being predominantly pursued via out-of-sector measures, in particular through the offsetting element of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which sets a target of not increasing net CO2 emissions from international aviation over average 2019≠ 2020 levels for the 2021≠2035 period (ICAO 2020).4 CORSIA will require airlines to purchase eligible units to offset emissions above the baseline. Airlines can reduce their offsetting requirement by claiming emission reductions from CORSIA eligible fuels, thus incentivizing the use of fuels with a lower carbon footprint. It is crucial that the UNFCCC and Member States provide clarity on mechanisms to avoid double counting of units. The nature of offsetting means that there will be no absolute reductions in the aviation sector itself through the use of such credits, and could in fact result in a potential increase in CO2 emissions. Instead, aviation relies on other sectors' avoidance or removal of carbon. By not only continuing to emit but potentially increasing emissions, the net effect will be that no overall reductions can be achieved. This outcome is in stark contrast with the reduction pathway necessary for limiting warming to within 1.5∞C (Becken and Mackey 2017). Furthermore, the ambiguity of international aviation's CO2 emissions in the Paris Agreement is a constraint to multilateral regulation.  5.4.2 Current aviation policies ICAO, as a specialized United Nations organization, has the lead role in steering the aviation industry's response to climate change goals. It has developed two global  Regardless of concerns around the net benefit of offsetting, Scheelhaase et al. (2018) estimate that CORSIA will result in the offset of only 12 per cent of total international and domestic aviation emissions by 2030.5 Currently, offsets  are almost exclusively provided by emissions avoidance. At a hypothetical maximum, if additionality is assumed, only 50 per cent of the emissions will be `offset' (Becken and Mackey 2017) as the `baseline' is an intention to emit two units of CO2; if the avoidance is achieved, aviation still emits one unit. However, additionality is controversial as it inherently cannot be proven (Warnecke et al. 2019). More speculatively, it is possible that in the future, offsets ≠ particularly sequestration offsets such as afforestation/ reforestation ≠ may become scarce as States use them in their NDC accounting (which also presents a potential double-counting issue). CORSIA sits alongside several other policies, most notably the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) that currently includes intra-European flights. How European flights will be treated in terms of compliance with both the EU ETS and CORSIA remains a point of uncertainty (Erling 2018; Scheelhaase et al. 2018; Maertens et al. 2019). 5.4.3 Intensifying policy measures to achieve decarbonization The previous section shows that decarbonization of shipping and aviation in line with the Paris Agreement is very challenging but necessary and feasible. It requires policies that specify energy consumption reduction targets for existing fleets, along with policies that aim to achieve a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to alternative fuels with a lower carbon footprint. Policy instruments related to the introduction of new fuels should incentivize an early adoption phase this decade and take a full life cycle approach to emissions accountancy (DNV GL 2020). Policies should aim to rapidly scale the deployment of new fuels as soon as possible (given the long lifetimes of assets), encourage investment in production processes and ramp up the required generation of renewable electricity. Suitable regulation to bridge the fuel pricing gap could start at the domestic or regional levels. Satellite observations of shipping activity reveal that an estimated 30 per cent of total shipping emissions fall directly within the responsibility of national governments, which is twice the magnitude previously estimated (UCL 2020). Governments could therefore take action on this policy area as part of their NDCs. Domestic or regional actions towards regulating shipping emissions could also prompt ambitious action at the international level (known as `autonomous interaction' in international law) and serve as a signal to the industry (Martinez Romera 2016). Given that supply and demand are interlinked, and because investors need to have confidence that fuels will find a market or that ships or aircraft will be able to purchase the type of fuel they require, it takes time to make a transition. Due to these various lag effects, it is important to start the transition early and gradually, taking into account all United Nations Sustainable Development Goals  6 Bridging the gap ≠ the role of equitable low-carbon lifestyles  6.1 The consumption problem and why lifestyles are critical to tackling climate change Minimizing the impacts of climate change requires rapid transitions in people's lifestyles and how we organize our societies, institutions and infrastructure. This is underscored by the fact that household consumption accounts for around two-thirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Ivanova et al. (2016) estimate lifestyle and consumption emissions at 65 per cent of the global total, while Hertwich and Peters (2009) suggest the proportion to be around 72 per cent of total emissions.1 On an aggregate level, compliance with the 1.5∞C goal of the Paris Agreement will require reducing consumption emissions to a per capita lifestyle carbon footprint of around 2 to 2.5 tons of CO2e by 2030, and an even smaller 0.7 tons by 2050 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Institute for Global Environment Strategies [IGES] et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020). Most climate mitigation pathways that seek to keep temperature rise to within 1.5∞C envisage a major role for lifestyle change (IPCC 2018). The International Energy Agency (IEA 2020) has likewise concluded that behaviour change is an integral part of emissions reduction strategies that accomplish net-zero emissions by 2050, emphasizing in particular the need for changes to domestic energy use, as well as reductions in car use and passenger aviation (see chapter 5). Understanding the distribution of lifestyle emissions among populations and by activities is important for equitable  targeting of mitigation measures, in order to encourage reductions from households with high consumption emissions and to avoid regressive impacts associated with imposing burdens on the poor (Rao et al. 2017; Roberts et al. 2020; Wiedman et al. 2020). Average consumption emissions vary substantially between countries. For example, current per capita consumption emissions in the United States of America are approximately 17.6 tons CO2e per capita, around 10 times that of India at 1.7 tons per capita. By contrast, the European Union and the United Kingdom together have an average footprint of approximately 7.9 tons per capita (see chapter 2). A range of estimates point to a strong correlation between income and emissions, with a highly unequal global distribution of consumption emissions. Such studies estimate that the emissions share of the top 10 per cent of income earners is around 36≠49 per cent of the global total, whereas the lowest 50 per cent of income earners account for around 7≠15 per cent of all emissions (Chakravarty et al. 2009; Chancel and Piketty 2015; Oxfam 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017; Dorband et al. 2019; Oxfam and Stockholm Environment Institute [SEI] 2020). This disparity is particularly stark where studies have estimated footprints among the very highest-income, highest emitters: the combined emissions share of the top 1 per cent of income earners has been found to very likely be larger than ≠ and perhaps double ≠ that of the bottom 50 per cent (Chancel and Piketty 2015; Oxfam and SEI 2020). Around half the consumption emissions of the global top 10 per cent and 1 per cent are associated with citizens of high-income countries, and most   of the other half with citizens in middle-income countries (Chancel and Piketty 2015; Oxfam and SEI 2020). One study estimates that the `super-rich' top 0.1 per cent of earners have per capita emissions of around 217 tCO2 ≠ several hundred times greater than the average of the poorest half of the global population (Oxfam and SEI 2020). Estimates of the per capita CO2 consumption emissions of different global income groups are shown in figure 6.1, based on Oxfam and SEI (2020). This analysis estimates per capita CO2 emissions rather than CO2-equivalent, and allocates all consumption emissions to individuals rather than just  those associated with household consumption. To indicate the relative scale of lifestyle emission changes required, a target for global average per capita consumption emissions of 2.1 tCO2 per capita in 2030 is also shown, as implied by 1.5∞C-consistent pathways estimated by Oxfam (2020). Estimates in figure 6.1 show that per capita consumption emissions of those in the global top 10 per cent of income earners would need to be reduced to about one-tenth of their current level by 2030 and those of the top 1 per cent by at least a factor of 30, while those of the poorest 50 per cent could increase by around three times their current level. Other estimates also affirm wide disparities in emissions by income bracket. Oswald et al. (2020) estimate that households of the global top 10 per cent of income earners use around 45 per cent of all energy for land transport and around 75 per cent of all energy for aviation, compared with 10 per cent and 5 per cent respectively for the poorest 50 per cent of households. Similarly, Ivanova and Wood (2020) find that a large share of the emissions of the top-emitting European Union households are transport-related.  To design equitable low-carbon lifestyle approaches, it is important to consider these consumption inequities and identify populations with very high and very low carbon footprints. Central to addressing consumption inequities is reframing the meaning of `progress' and `affluence' away from the accumulation of income or energy-intensive resources to the achievement of well-being and quality of life. Studies show that a comprehensive idea of well-being that includes basic needs for all people can be attained with a much-reduced level of energy consumption (Rao et al. 2019; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). 6.2 Achieving lifestyle emissions reduction by sector To help understand the options available to reduce lifestyle emissions, the Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) framework (Creutzig et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019) provides a useful conceptual categorization. This framework does not articulate how lifestyle change occurs, but provides distinctions around the types of possible emissions reduction. In this chapter, we emphasize emissions reduction from mobility, residential energy use and food, as these constitute key sectors through which lifestyle change can enable climate mitigation, comprising approximately 17 per cent, 19 per cent and 20 per cent of lifestyle emissions respectively (Hertwich and Peters 2009). The Avoid category refers to the reduction in energy or carbon demand by foregoing some aspect of consumption  (for example, reduced travel, fewer appliances). The Shift category includes shifts in behaviour to less carbon-intensive modes of consumption (for example, opting for walking, cycling or public transport instead of private vehicles; plant-based diets). The Improve category refers to reducing GHG emissions through improving efficiency or replacing technologies with lower-carbon ones, without changing the underlying consumption activity; this category includes increased vehicle efficiency and switching to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), efficient domestic appliances, household renewable energy and consumption of organically grown food. Figure 6.2 shows boxplots for options of varying carbon mitigation potential, aggregated by different sectors and ASI categories, based on a meta-review of 53 lifecycle assessment studies by Ivanova et al. (2020).2 These studies included the supply chain impacts that may occur elsewhere than the country of consumption. Also shown in figure 6.2 are illustrative examples of impactful changes across sectors, based on median emissions reduction potential across studies.  Building on the types of changes identified in figure 6.2, tables 6.1 to 6.3 offer examples from different countries on approaches to encourage low-carbon lifestyles for mobility, residential energy use and food, covering both hypothetical and implemented cases, as well as a range of mechanisms (for example, city-based projects, national policies and citizen-led initiatives). We discuss in more detail the range of mechanisms by which lifestyle change can be accomplished in section 6.3. In terms of mobility (table 6.1), there is substantial mitigation potential to reduce emissions by avoiding and curtailing travel. Reducing long-haul flights has strong potential to reduce emissions in an equitable manner: air travel accounts for around 41 per cent of the carbon footprint of the highest-emitting 1 per cent of households in the European Union, but less than 1 per cent of the emissions of the poorest 50 per cent of households. Although this mitigation option is available only to primarily wealthier people who fly, it has the potential for substantial emissions reduction, at around  1.9 tCO2e per avoided long-haul return flight (see chapter 5 for a more detailed discussion of technology-centric options to reduce aviation-sector emissions). Emissions from mobility can also be reduced through more active travel such as cycling and walking, and greater use of public transport. Further options to improve mobility emissions include greater vehicle efficiency or the adoption of BEVs. Overall, consumption options in the mobility sector show high mitigation potential and high income-elasticity of demand (i.e. there is a strong link between income and mobility emissions; Ivanova and Wood 2020; Oswald et al. 2020). This suggests that emissions reduction measures across this sector can be relatively impactful and equitable, as they concern limiting luxury consumption by higher-income households.   For the residential sector (table 6.2), there is substantial mitigation potential to reduce emissions through measures such as low-carbon heating and renewable energy use by households, as well as energy-efficient construction and renovations. Further options include reducing emissions through smaller living spaces and adjustments to room  temperature. Overall, residential consumption options show relatively high mitigation potential, although much lower income-elasticity of demand (involving basic or essential consumption), with these highly context-dependent by socioeconomic group and region (Oswald 2020).    Danish Organic Action Plan led to increased provision of organic food in state-linked outlets (S¯rensen et al. 2016) Urban household vegetable gardens have potential to reduce GHG emissions (Cleveland et al. 2017) Food-growing households in Czech Republic reduce household emissions (V·vra et al. 2018) Legal exceptions granted for agricultural zones in Quezon City, Philippines, to ensure more self-reliant food production (C40 Cities Network 2020)  Note: Emissions reduction calculations for all tables based on a meta-review by Ivanova et al. (2020). See the meta-review for emission reduction ranges and more details. The absolute minimum and maximum emissions mitigation ranges are included in parentheses.  While the estimates considered here are drawn from a range of geographical regions, evidence of mitigation from lifestyle change from developing countries are typically lacking in the literature relative to European and North American studies. Approaches to promote low-carbon lifestyle measures in developing countries are critical, however, with structural transitions offering opportunities to align development and climate objectives (McCauley and Heffron 2018). Many developing countries' economies are growing quickly, and infrastructure and policy decisions taken now have the potential to lock in high- or low-carbon lifestyles (the latter with multiple benefits) for the long-term. For instance, an estimated 3 billion people worldwide currently rely on highly polluting and unhealthy traditional solid fuels for household cooking and heating (Yadama 2013). Shifting these energy sources to electricity and clean fuels could heavily influence residential emissions reductions and provide multiple development outcomes (Creutzig et al. 2016; Mulugetta et al. 2019).  6.3 Realizing lifestyle change: which mechanisms encourage low-carbon lifestyles? The evidence presented so far shows that rising emissions are underpinned by contemporary lifestyles. Major reductions in emissions require substantial changes to these patterns of consumption and behaviours ≠ especially among the global rich (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Liobikien and Dagilit 2016; Oswald et al. 2020; Oxfam and SEI 2020). A person's choices operate within broader contexts that enable or constrain action (Akenji and Bengtsson 2014; Walker 2014) ≠ including physical environments, cultural conventions, social norms and financial and policy frameworks ≠ and are inseparable from income levels and access to resources. Even so, individuals can exercise environmental citizenship to bring about societal change through the various roles they occupy: including as   consumers, members of organizations and communities, citizens participating in social movements and deliberative processes, or as owners of assets and investments (Stern 2000). These types of personal action can influence not only the underlying social conditions that shape lifestyles, but also the actions of governments and businesses  (Otto et al. 2020a; Nielsen et al. 2020; Amel et al. 2017). The interaction between structural conditions and how people live is dynamic: personal choices have consequences for the contexts within which they are made, which in turn reinforce or challenge the contribution of lifestyles to climate change (see figure 6.3).  6.3.1 Incentives, information and choice provision Approaches that encourage voluntary behaviour change (for example, information provision, economic incentives) have been a dominant means by which policy has attempted to influence lifestyles (Pykett et al. 2011). Economic policies such as renewable energy incentives have stimulated uptake of solar voltaic panels (Briguglio and Formosa 2017; Mundaca and Samahita 2020) and changed the competitiveness of renewable energy compared with fossil fuels. Market-oriented policies can also increase the behavioural plasticity (i.e. how responsive behaviours are to changes in external conditions) of actions for carbon emissions reduction (Dietz et al. 2009), which can be crucial in increasing access to low-carbon lifestyle options.  products and services as the default option (Kaiser et al. 2020). While information and incentives can be useful, there are limits to approaches that seek to `nudge' behavioural change, as they rely on individual responsibility to bring about change. Such approaches risk `scapegoating' citizens (Akenji 2012) and may not be enough to overcome inertia (Kaiser et al. 2020). Historically, sustainable transitions have not been strongly driven by voluntary consumer choices (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2003), but by factors such as social norms and by changing the options available to consumers (Sustainable Consumption Roundtable 2006).  Targeted information (energy efficiency information, carbon labelling) can also shift consumer decision-making towards more efficient and low-carbon products (Langley et al. 2012; Kunreuther and Weber 2014; Khosla et al. 2019; Whittle et al. 2019) and often has broad public support (Carbon Trust 2020). Adjustments to the contexts under which decisions are made can also be influential, by offering low-carbon  While there have been calls for integrated policy that combines more assertive and restrictive policies with voluntary ones (Moberg et al. 2018), public acceptability is key for both approaches, with the risk that policies that unfairly burden households will receive backlash (Sovacool et al. 2017; Moberg et al. 2018).   Emissions Gap Report 2020  6.3.2 Infrastructure and conventions of everyday life Patterns of everyday life ≠ the way we eat, travel and occupy our homes ≠ are shaped and directed by the built environment, how services are provided, and expectations of normal conduct (Breadsell et al. 2019). In many developed nations, the dominance of the car has been enabled through urban infrastructure that is car-dependent, spatial planning that has led people to live far from workplaces and essential services, and a `car culture' that favours this mode of transport (Mattioli et al. 2020). Likewise, high-carbon diets have become established through supply chains and market liberalization that has promoted convenience foods, bulk-buying and meat-based meals (Hoolohan et al. 2016; Xiong et al. 2020). Attempts to reduce lifestyles emissions are more likely to be effective if they address the infrastructures on which highcarbon lifestyles depend and enable knock-on effects to other carbon-intensive practices. For example, high-speed rail networks may lower demand for domestic aviation (Clewlow et al. 2014). Conversely, infrastructural changes that do not anticipate how decisions might influence wider patterns of daily life may result in failure or unintended increases in emissions. 6.3.3 Social influence Where lifestyle change is accomplished ≠ by one person, household or community ≠ this can act as a catalyst to promote wider change, spreading behaviours through peer influence and reconfiguring what is typical or expected (Shwom and Lorenzen 2012; Guilbeault et al. 2018; Wolske et al. 2020). Social influence has contributed to wider uptake of rooftop solar panels (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012; Richter 2013; Graziano and Gillingham 2015), transport modal shift (Feygin and Pozdnoukhov 2018), transitioning to plantbased diets (Cherry 2006) and purchase of energy-efficient products (Wolske et al. 2020). At the interpersonal level, people follow the example of others who are similar to themselves (Welsch and K¸hling 2009; Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Amel et al. 2017). At a larger scale, the actions of a committed minority of people can comprise a `critical mass' that is able to prompt broader change in patterns of behaviour, leading to a tipping point whereby social conventions change rapidly towards a new normal (Centola et al. 2018; Otto et al. 2020a). Actions taken by key individuals can lead to greater uptake of similar choices by others. The social influence of high-emitting groups, especially those in prestigious or influential positions, may be particularly important in shaping what is desirable and affect people's willingness to cooperate on shared problems (Anderson 2011; Henrich et al. 2015). Additionally, climate communicators, advocates and researchers are seen as more convincing ≠ and their advice more likely to be acted upon ≠ if they themselves pursue  low-carbon lifestyles (Attari et al. 2016; Attari et al. 2019; Sparkman and Attari 2020). 6.3.4 Citizen participation Social movements can give individually disempowered people a strong voice if they act collectively (Kashwan 2016; Otto et al. 2020b). The example of the Fridays for Future youth climate protests has demonstrated collective agency among individuals ≠ many of whom do not even have voting rights ≠ with the movement becoming widely established across Europe, Africa, South America and Asia (Marquardt 2020). The involvement of people in bringing about change is enshrined in article 6 of the UNFCCC Doha Convention and article 12 of the Paris Agreement. Citizen participation can range from formal processes to shape policy, to participation in social movements. Where processes exist that enable individuals to directly shape policy ≠ including citizens' juries and assemblies ≠ they have led to the proposal of measures that have confronted the structural determinants of high-carbon lifestyles (Kythreotis et al. 2019; Devaney et al. 2020). For example, Ireland's citizens' assembly advocated higher taxes across carbon-intensive activities (Torney and O'Gorman 2019; Muradova et al. 2020) whereas in France, participants proposed a change to the country's Constitution and a new law of `ecocide' as ways to hold policymakers and other actors to account (Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat 2020). The 2015 World Wide Views deliberation across 76 countries likewise found that most citizens supported strong action on climate change (Dryzek and Niemeyer 2019). Advocacy of inclusive solutions has often been driven by poorer communities able to demonstrate best practice in climate mitigation (Roy 2015). For example, Project 90 in South Africa advocates for a 90 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 through youth leadership programmes and community engagement (Kyle 2020), while Bold Nebraska brought together farmers, Native Americans and other concerned citizens to build community action that successfully opposed the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline (Ordner 2017). 6.3.5 Disrupting habits Much of our behaviour is habitual ≠ unconscious routines triggered by contextual cues (such as time of day), rather than a conscious intention to act (Kurz et al. 2015). Habits are a substantial barrier to lifestyle change, as they lock in individual behaviour and maintain its automatic repetition over time (MarÈchal and Lazaric 2011). However, since habits develop in, and are cued by, stable contexts (Wood et al. 2005), changes in context can in turn provide opportunities to disrupt well-established routines (Verplanken et al. 2008; Kurz et al. 2015). `Moments of change' ≠ defined as occasions when an individual's circumstances change considerably within   a short time frame (Thompson et al. 2011) ≠ have been identified as an important lever for lifestyle change (Capstick et al. 2014). Research shows that disruptions ≠ whether concerning a person's life-course (such as moving house) or structural changes (such as economic growth or downturn) ≠ can provide opportunities to recraft lifestyles in new directions (Birkmann et al. 2010; Verplanken et al. 2018), such as shifting from commuting by car to home-working (Marsden et al. 2020) or investing in energy-efficient housing and the use of LEDs in the home (Khosla et al. 2019; Kamat et al. 2020). 6.3.6 Lessons from COVID-19: opportunity to lock in positive changes COVID-19 has impacted everyday life around the world, disrupting many established patterns of behaviour. As noted in chapter 2 of this report, an unintended side effect of lockdown policies was a sharp, unprecedented drop in carbon emissions (Le QuÈrÈ et al. 2020), representing the largest relative reduction globally since WWII. However, policies to contain COVID-19 differ from those needed to curb carbon emissions in important ways, and there are risks in drawing simplistic parallels between these very different issues. Lockdown policies were enacted quickly and designed to be temporary disruptions to the status quo. By contrast, lifestyle changes to address climate change entail carefully managed and long-term transitions away from the status quo towards more sustainable and equitable practices (Howarth et al. 2020). Nonetheless, COVID-19 has shown that rapid, extensive and profound changes in lifestyles are possible with the coordination of governments and civil society. The lessons for climate mitigation from COVID-19 are less about the magnitude or longevity of the drop in emissions observed, and more about the insights gained into how rapid lifestyle changes can happen. First, governments must lead the way and create conditions under which lifestyle changes are possible (for example, economic measures that enable workers to remain at home). Second, positive social norms and a sense of collective agency are important for behavioural change. Finally, infrastructure to lock in behaviour changes is critical ≠ for example in the case of cities that, in response to COVID-19, took action to promote walking and cycling and encourage local food production (C40 Cities Network 2020). New habits take around two to three months to form (Lally et al. 2010), meaning the lockdown period in many countries may be long enough to establish new, enduring routines, if these are supported by longer-term measures. In planning the recovery from COVID-19, governments have an opportunity to catalyse low-carbon lifestyle changes by disrupting entrenched practices, rethinking infrastructure and protecting environmental standards (B¸chs et al. 2020, see also chapter 4).  6.4 Integrated policies in each sector Drawing on the mechanisms described above, the following sections outline integrated approaches to lifestyle change across the mobility, residential and food sectors, providing practical examples of measures that have been implemented, as well as potentially effective approaches. 6.4.1 Towards low-carbon mobility Approaches to enable lifestyle change for the mobility sector include assertive policies that prioritize active travel, incentivize shifts to low-carbon modes of transport and discourage non-essential travel, particularly among high^consuming groups. Around the world, changes to mobility options and practices have been made as a direct response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The C40 group of around 100 large cities has called for a green and just recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19 (C40 Cities Network 2020), including a worldwide initiative to pursue urban planning that enables most residents to access everyday needs within a 15-minute journey by walking or cycling. Social influence is important when shaping mobility lifestyle decisions. For example, near-exponential growth in electric vehicle ownership in Norway that has strongly aligned with climate policy conferring price advantages has been consolidated by peer-to-peer communication (Figenbaum 2017), as well as neighbourhood effects (for example, visibility in residential areas) and perceptions of what is expected and desirable (Pettifor et al. 2017). Similarly, there is a role for social influence in shaping norms around the desirability of flying (`flight shaming'; Gˆssling et al. 2020), potentially in conjunction with policies such as frequent flyer levies (Fouquet and O'Garra 2020). Citizen participation can also mobilize support for low-carbon mobility policy. For example, in Leeds, United Kingdom, the city's citizens' jury recommended halting local airport expansion (Place-based Climate Action Network [PCAN] 2019); the French Convention Citoyenne proposed the prohibition of both new airports and the extension of existing airports, as well as ceasing most domestic flights by 2025 (Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat 2020) and the Switch ON organization in India has mobilized concerned citizens to push back against planned restrictions on bicycles and non-motorized transport (Roy 2015). Assertive policies around the world have challenged the social status of the car. For instance, in Bogot· the reallocation of street space, construction of off-street bike paths and car-free days has encouraged a shift towards cycling and walking (Rosas-Satiz·bala and RodriguezValencia 2019). Such measures can be achieved equitably: in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, cycling is distributed evenly across income, gender and age groups (Pucher and Buehler 2008). In China, BEV uptake has been encouraged using a combination of mandatory restrictions  on petrol cars (limiting their purchase and use) and market-oriented policies (government subsidies, tax exemptions, and dedicated licence plates that afford parking benefits, as well as having symbolic value; Li et al. 2019). Health practitioners have also argued for warning labels at point of sale for fossil fuels (for example, at petrol stations) and in the context of high-carbon services (for example, on airline tickets; Gill et al. 2020). In developing nations, there are opportunities to leapfrog the car-dependent, carbon-intensive infrastructure that dominates many developed nations. High-density, mixed-use urban forms that emphasize access by modes of transport other than cars are beneficial from an emissions perspective, and also enable more equitable participation in employment, cultural and entertainment activities (Kenworthy 2006). Such modal shifts also reduce local air pollution, thereby emphasizing the multiple benefits of more active, less carbon-intensive mobility options. 6.4.2 Towards a low-carbon residential sector Policies that enable residential lifestyle change ≠ particularly low-carbon technologies operating at the individual or household level (for example, energy-efficient building envelopes, heat pumps, electric vehicle charging points, household solar) ≠ have been shown to lead to more rapid diffusion of technology and more widespread social returns (such as job creation) than in the case of larger-scale energy investments (Wilson et al. 2020). Incentives, information and changes to how choices are presented (behavioural `nudges') have met with some success, especially in terms of enabling equitable access to low-carbon options. Green defaults (whereby new customers are automatically assigned green energy tariffs) have been shown to dramatically increase their uptake (Ebeling and Lotz 2015; Kaiser et al. 2020). In 2017, around 5 million customers in California, United States of America, were able to access greater renewable energy at lower cost through the green default provided by the state-enabled Community Choice Aggregation programmes (O'Shaughnessy et al. 2019). More broadly, successful residential lifestyle changes require anticipating how policies will impact daily life. Financial incentives to encourage uptake of efficient and improved cookstoves in developing countries show that policies also need to account for ongoing costs of use and maintenance (Pattanayak et al. 2019), the role of female empowerment, as well as attachment to traditional cooking techniques (Lewis and Pattanayak 2012). The residential sector offers significant mitigation opportunities and risks as it is one of the longest-lived components of the economy. In many developing countries, rapid urbanization and population growth are outpacing the provision of adequate, affordable housing (United Nations 2017). Studies estimate that ongoing upgrade and construction of infrastructure to connect communities  and enable urban development could result in additional emissions of 226 GtCO2 by 2050 (M¸ller et al. 2013; Bai et al. 2018). Analogously, the predicted growth in ownership of air-conditioning technologies (equivalent to 10 new air conditioners being purchased every second for the next 30 years), especially in China, India and Indonesia, affirms the need for low-energy and low-carbon cooling options (IEA 2019). Infrastructural changes can moderate this growth: for instance, in Viet Nam and India, successful examples of vernacular architecture (buildings designed using local knowledge and materials for local needs) require much lower energy inputs (Creutzig et al. 2016). In the past, recovery measures during economic downturn have been used to incentivize sustainable changes to households (for example, enabling retrofitting, solar panels and insulation; Climate Action Tracker 2020). Such policies bring multiple benefits by hastening the energy transition, enabling low-income households greater access to lowcarbon living, stimulating the economy and reducing income burdens from high energy costs. 6.4.3 Towards low-carbon diets In comparison to current average diets, full or partial vegetarianism has the potential to reduce emissions from food consumption by around 31 per cent, with a pescatarian diet leading to an approximately 27 per cent reduction (Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016). However, attempts to encourage more sustainable diets have tended to be limited to information and awareness campaigns, which typically have marginal effects (Traill et al. 2014; Schanes et al. 2016; Bianchi et al. 2018). Recent modelling shows that for the best outcome for emissions, global well-being, land-use and other factors, food policies should provide food to the undernourished while simultaneously reducing overconsumption and food waste in high-consumption regions (Hasegawa et al. 2019). Placing costs on emissions-intensive foods such as beef and lamb, in conjunction with financial support to encourage healthy fruit and vegetable consumption, can shift demand and reduce food-related emissions by nearly 10 per cent globally (Springmann et al. 2017). Low-carbon diets also tend to be those that are healthier, thus providing opportunities for health and climate policy to be aligned (Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Willett et al. 2019). In Latin America, North America, Europe and many parts of Asia, consumption of red meat is at much higher levels than is recommended for a healthy, low-carbon diet (Willett et al. 2019). While it is not easy to shift notions of normal and culturally acceptable ways of eating (Bailey et al. 2014; Mozaffarian et al. 2018), recent history shows that this can occur rapidly and that diets in many parts of the world are in flux (Vermeulen et al. 2019). Comparable measures have been effective in influencing purchasing choices, such as taxes on unhealthy foods (Colchero et al. 2016) and subsidies for fruit and vegetables (for example, through food assistance programmes in the United States of America; Olsho et al. 2016). Complementary  measures such as restricting advertising of high-carbon foods (Hyseni et al. 2017), while improving access to lowcarbon foods, such as by increasing vegetarian meals in cafeterias and other food outlets, has the potential to enable dietary change (Garnett et al. 2019). Globally, close to one-third of global food sales are from just 10 supermarket chains (IPES-Food 2017): major retailers have the ability to influence consumer practices, for example by encouraging alternatives to meat protein through ensuring their availability and prominence in stores (Gravely and Fraser 2018). Policies against food waste offer benefits such as saving consumers money without reducing the quantity consumed (Hasegawa et al. 2019). Food waste bans and other policies can also allow providers of fresh fruit and vegetables to better address the needs of underserved or deprived communities (Pearson and Wilson 2013). Where authorities have direct control over food provision, including in the public sector, its carbon footprint can be cut: for example, the city of Leeds in the United Kingdom introduced meat-free and vegan catering into 182 primary schools for climate mitigation (Leeds City Council 2020). In Quezon City, Philippines, legislation is being developed for urban agricultural zones, with a scheme termed Fresh Market on Wheels delivering fresh produce from local farms to vulnerable communities around the city (C40 Cities Network 2020). However, as large segments of the global population still lack sufficient food (Willett et al. 2019), acknowledging divisions in terms of income and access are important if food sector emissions are to be reduced while meeting basic human needs. 6.5 Looking forward 6.5.1 Communicating lifestyle change Popular debate has often pitted `behaviour change' and `system change' against each other, presented as a trade-off between two choices. As this chapter illustrates, however, system change and behaviour change are two sides of the same coin. When communicating about lifestyle change, it is important to recognize the constant interplay between the lifestyles of individuals and the social, cultural, political and economic systems in which they live and which they help shape. There is a central role for communication and public engagement to change the way sustainable lifestyles are discussed in public forums and to emphasize the dynamic and complex relationship between systems and behaviour. Recognizing the role of interpersonal influence can also help emphasize the social and collective nature of lifestyle change, and is potentially more empowering than a view of personal actions that occur in isolation or that are negligible compared to the need for large-scale climate mitigation (Maniates 2001; Capstick 2013; Kubit 2020). Communicating where actions would be most impactful, and that changes to lifestyles are a necessary component to meeting global emissions reduction targets, is a powerful tool that can be wielded by a diverse range of actors.  6.5.2 Overcoming barriers and accomplishing long-lasting change In seeking to shift focus from economic growth towards equity and well-being within ecological limits, a move towards sustainable lifestyles is likely to challenge powerful vested interests. For example, the focus of the global economy on paid employment ≠ and the devaluation of unpaid care work that sustains it ≠ is an overlooked barrier to low-carbon lifestyles. Higher income tends to be correlated with higher emissions; by contrast, an alternative economic system that places caring responsibilities and well-being at the centre of community and economic life (for example, through a shorter working week and fairer distribution of care work) has the potential to reduce emissions. With enabling policies in place, such an approach could reduce emissions and gender and income inequality, while improving standards of living (Coote et al. 2010; Biesecker et al. 2014; Gottschlich and Bellina 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018; Fremstad and Underwood 2019). On the other hand, an approach of this kind is poorly aligned with the current economic and political system in many parts of the world, in which large corporations are increasingly determining how private and social needs are met and shaping the conditions of everyday life (Dauvergne and Lister 2013). Changes to underlying social and cultural norms are more difficult to accomplish than transitory behavioural changes, but once established they are likely to be more durable and to support a wider range of low-carbon lifestyles (De Young 2011). By contrast, the process of changing laws and written codes of behaviour and conduct can occur in only a few years (Williamson 1998), and large infrastructural projects can enable and disable choices of citizens for decades or longer (Seto et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2020b). One example that seeks to redress the balance of power towards long-term sustainable societies is an ombudsman for future generations (Beckman 2016) who intervenes in public policy design and investments that present structural barriers to a low-carbon transition. Such an approach has already been implemented in Wales, United Kingdom (Davidson 2020) and in Hungary (Vincent 2012). From a cross-European study of demand-side options in line with 1.5∞C pathways, Moberg et al. (2018) conclude that while current policies are insufficient to achieve emissions reduction in line with this, households are keen to see stronger government intervention, with high public acceptability of `command-and-control' measures across mitigation options. Ultimately, the accomplishment of low-carbon lifestyles will require deep-rooted changes to socioeconomic systems and cultural conventions. The participation of actors and groups across civil society, as well as government, is needed to ensure this happens in a way that preserves people's well-being while achieving substantial and rapid cuts in GHG emissions.

Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On

This glossary is compiled according to the Lead Authors of the Report drawing on glossaries and other resources available on the websites of the following organizations, networks and projects: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and World Resources Institute.
Anthropogenic methane: Methane emissions derived from human activities. Anthropogenic emission sources include coal mining, agricultural practices, wastewater treatment, certain industrial processes and oil and gas systems, among others.

on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise.
Carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e): A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of CO2 that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as CO2e assuming a 100-year global warming potential.

Baseline/reference: The state against which change is measured. In the context of climate change transformation pathways, the term `baseline scenarios' refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term `baseline scenario' is used interchangeably with `reference scenario' and `no policy scenario' In much of the literature, the term is also synonymous with the term `business as usual (BAU) scenario', although the term `BAU' has fallen out of favour because the idea of `business as usual' in centurylong socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom.
Carbon border adjustment mechanisms: Mechanisms that act to equalize the price of carbon between domestic products and imports to eliminate financial incentives in order to relocate production outside of regions with strong climate controls.
Carbon dioxide emission budget (or carbon budget): For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5°C or 2°C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted for temperatures to stay below that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a carbon dioxide (CO2) emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits

Carbon markets: A term for a carbon trading system through which countries may buy or sell units of greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to meet their national limits on emissions, either under the Kyoto Protocol or other agreements, such as that among member states of the European Union. The term comes from the fact that CO2 is the predominant greenhouse gas, and other gases are measured in units called carbon dioxide equivalent.
Carbon neutrality: This is achieved when an actor's net contribution to global CO2 emissions is zero. Any CO2 emissions attributable to an actor's activities are fully compensated by CO2 reductions or removals exclusively claimed by the actor, irrespective of the time period or the relative magnitude of emissions and removals involved.
Carbon offset: See Offset.
Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2e emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies.
Clean development mechanism (CDM): A mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol, the purpose of which, in accordance with article 12 of the Protocol, is to assist non-Annex I parties in achieving sustainable development and in contributing to the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and to assist Annex I parties in achieving compliance with their quantified emissions

Protocol.

and/or a precursor from the atmosphere by a sink.

Conditional nationally determined contribution (NDC): An NDC proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors.
Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention's progress.
Double counting: Double counting involves two countries taking credit for the same emissions reductions, thereby giving the impression that the world has reduced emissions more than it actually has. For example, emissions reduction credits from one country might be sold to another country, but the reductions may still be counted towards the achievement of the NDC of the country where the credits originated.
Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual greenhouse gas emissions over time.
Emissions trading: One of the three Kyoto mechanisms, by which an Annex I party may transfer Kyoto Protocol units to, or acquire units from, another Annex I party. An Annex I party must meet specific eligibility requirements to participate in emissions trading.

Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socioeconomic and biophysical processes.
Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC): INDCs are submissions from countries describing the national actions that they intend to take to reach the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C. Once a country has ratified the Paris Agreement, its INDC is automatically converted to its NDC, unless it chooses to further update it.
Katowice Climate Package: The Katowice Climate Package, also known as `the Katowice outcome ', is a complex package containing operational guidance on information provision, communication and rules for the functioning of the climate transparency framework, the global stocktaking of overall progress and the evaluation of progress, and the provision of prior information on financial assistance. The package sets out the essential procedures and mechanisms that operationalized the Paris Agreement. The guidelines of the package aim to build greater trust and strengthen international cooperation.

EU Emissions Trading System (ETS): The EU ETS is a trading system for carbon emissions and the first international emissions trading system in the world. The EU ETS covers the following sectors and gases: electricity and heat generation, energy-intensive industry sectors (including oil refineries, steel works and production of iron, aluminium, metals, cement, lime, glass, ceramics, pulp, paper, cardboard, acids and bulk organic chemicals, commercial aviation within the European Economic Area), nitrous oxide from production of nitric, adipic and glyoxylic acids and glyoxal, and perfluorocarbons from production of aluminium.

Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by industrialized countries.
Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A greenhouse gas inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of greenhouse gases resulting from direct humaninduced land use, land-use change and forestry activities.

Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation.
Greenhouse gases: The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

Leakage: A phenomenon whereby the reduction in emissions (relative to a baseline) in a jurisdiction/sector associated with the implementation of mitigation policy is offset to some degree by an increase outside the jurisdiction/sector through induced changes in consumption, production, prices, land use and/or trade across the jurisdictions/sectors. Leakage can occur at a number of levels: project, state, province, nation or world region.

XII


Least-cost pathway: Such scenarios identify the least expensive combination of mitigation options to fulfil a specific climate target. A least-cost scenario is based on the premise that, if an overarching climate objective is set, society wants to achieve this at the lowest possible costs over time. It also assumes that global actions start at the base year of model simulations (usually close to the current year) and are implemented following a cost-optimal (cost-efficient) sharing of the mitigation burden between current and future generations depending on the social discount rate.

Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas or aerosol into the atmosphere.

Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent chance. Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits.

Mitigation: In the context of climate change, mitigation relates to a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other `sinks' to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Nationally determined contribution (NDC): Submissions by countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement which presents their national efforts to reach the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C. New or updated NDCs were expected to be submitted in 2020 and should be submitted every five years thereafter. NDCs thus represent a country's current ambition/target for reducing emissions nationally.

Offset (in climate policy): A unit of CO2e emissions that is reduced, avoided or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere.

Recovery-type measure: Fiscal, monetary or regulatory intervention by a government to reinvigorate economic activity in response to a crisis.

Rescue-type measure: Immediate fiscal, monetary or regulatory intervention by a government to protect citizens' lives and socioeconomic well-being and/or to provide emergency support to businesses and the economy in response to a crisis.

Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on `if-then' propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socioeconomic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables.

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP): Scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes up to 2100. They are used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios associated with different climate policies scenarios.

Foreword

Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On

Climate change is no longer a future problem. It is a 'now' problem. As we saw this year, devastating impacts are spreading across the globe and growing ever stronger. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us a few months ago that we have a 50 per cent chance of exceeding a 1.5°C temperature threshold within the next few decades.

Then they must zero in on net zero, ensuring these longterm commitments are linked to the NDCs, and that action is brought forward. It is time to get the policies in place to back the raised ambitions and, again, start implementing them. This cannot happen in five years. Or in three years. This needs to start happening now.

Climate action so far has been characterized by weak promises, not yet delivered. As the Emissions Gap Report 2021 shows, the updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement fall into the same trap. These pledges only take 7.5 per cent off predicted 2030 emissions, compared to the previous round of commitments. This is far from adequate. Reductions of 30 per cent are needed to stay on the least-cost pathway for 2°C and 55 per cent for 1.5°C.
If nations only implement unconditional NDCs as they stand, we are likely to hit global warming of about 2.7°C by the end of the century. Current net-zero pledges could cut another 0.5°C off global warming ­ but these pledges are still ambiguous, delayed in many cases and not folded into NDCs. At the same time, this year's Emissions Gap Report shows that the opportunity to use pandemic recovery spending to reduce emissions has been largely missed.
To get on track to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world needs to take an additional 28 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) off annual emissions by 2030, over and above what is promised in updated unconditional NDCs. For the 2°C Paris Agreement target, the additional need is lower: a drop in annual emissions of 13 GtCO2e by 2030. To be clear: we have eight years to make the plans, put in place the policies, implement them and ultimately deliver the cuts. The clock is ticking loudly.

We can still do it. As this year's Emissions Gap Report shows, there is huge potential for large cuts in methane emissions from the oil and gas, waste and agriculture sectors. Carbon markets could help to accelerate action by decreasing mitigation costs. COVID-19 recovery funding can still be greened. And as previous UNEP Emissions Gap Reports show, there is potential in nature-based solutions, renewables, energy efficiency and so much more.
We should not despair. We have already shown that climate action can make a difference. In 11 years, from 2010 to 2021, we have put in place policies that will lower annual emissions by 11 GtCO2e in 2030 compared to what would have happened without these policies. But we need to make the difference, not a difference. We cannot keep doing the same things and expect a better result.
The world has to wake up to the imminent peril we face as a species. We need to go firm. We need to go fast. And we need to start doing it now.

Executive summary

Introduction
This twelfth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report comes during a year of constant reminders that climate change is not in the distant future. Extreme weather events around the world ­ including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves ­ have continuously hit the news headlines. Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions. Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the ""Physical Science Basis"" in August 2021. Dubbed a ""code red for humanity"" by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. There is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the next two decades, and unless there are immediate, rapid and largescale reductions in GHG emissions, limiting warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C by the end of the century will be beyond reach.
Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twentysixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation. This year, the spotlight is on the new and updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that countries were requested to submit in advance of COP26. As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.
This Emissions Gap Report confirms the findings of the UNFCCC report. It expands the assessment to consider announced mitigation pledges for 2030 in addition to the new and updated NDCs. The report shows that new or

updated NDCs and announced pledges for 2030 have only limited impact on global emissions and the emissions gap in 2030, reducing projected 2030 emissions by only 7.5 per cent, compared with previous unconditional NDCs, whereas 30 per cent is needed to limit warming to 2°C and 55 per cent is needed for 1.5°C. If continued throughout this century, they would result in warming of 2.7°C. The achievement of the net-zero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to would improve the situation, limiting warming to about 2.2°C by the end of the century. However, the 2030 commitments do not yet set G20 members (accounting for close to 80 per cent of GHG emissions) on a clear path towards net zero.
Moreover, G20 members as a group do not have policies in place to achieve even the NDCs, much less net zero. Turning to some of the opportunities for bridging the emissions gap and getting on track to net zero, the report assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition. It examines the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second-most-important GHG in terms of current anthropogenic climate forcing, to bridge the gap and get on track to net zero. Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms. A large number of countries have included the use of market mechanisms in their NDC implementation plans and are waiting for the modalities to be agreed. At the same time, the use of markets and offsets in meeting net-zero emission goals is often unclear.
As in previous years, the 2021 Emissions Gap Report has been guided by an experienced steering committee and prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC reports, as well as in other recent scientific literature. The assessment process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned in the report to give them an opportunity to comment on the findings.

1. Following an unprecedented drop of 5.4 per cent in 2020, global carbon dioxide emissions are bouncing back to pre-COVID levels, and concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere continue to rise.





The COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented

5.4 per cent drop in global fossil carbon dioxide

(CO2) emissions in 2020 (figure ES.1). Data are not

yet available for all GHG emissions in 2020, but the

drop in total global GHG emissions is anticipated

to be smaller than the drop in fossil CO2 emissions.



A strong rebound in emissions is expected in

2021. Preliminary estimates suggest fossil energy

CO2 emissions could grow by 4.8 per cent in 2021 (excluding cement), and global emissions in 2021 are expected to be only slightly lower than the record level of 2019.
Despite the large decline in CO2 emissions in 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by around 2.3 parts per million, in line with recent trends. It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate, as the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.4 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in a single year. Solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.

Figure ES.1. Global greenhouse gas emissions from all sources, 1970­2020 Global greenhouse gas emissions (GtCO2e)


As at 30 September 2021, 120 countries (121 parties,

including the European Union and its 27 member

states) representing just over half of global GHG

emissions, have communicated new or updated

NDCs. This year's assessment considers the new

or updated NDCs communicated to the UNFCCC as

well as announcements of new mitigation pledges

for 2030 by China, Japan and the Republic of Korea

not submitted as NDCs by 30 September.

Just under half (49 per cent) of the new or updated NDCs submitted (from countries accounting for 32 per cent of global emissions) result in lower 2030 emissions than the previous NDC. Around 18 per cent of the NDCs (from countries accounting for 13 per cent of global emissions) will not reduce 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDC. The remaining 33 per cent of NDCs (from countries accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions) contain insufficient detail to assess their impact on emissions relative to the previous NDC (figure ES.2). Typically, this is due to a lack of information in the previous NDC, rather than the current one; the current NDCs are more transparent.


Of the countries that have submitted new or updated NDCs, more (89 per cent) have GHG targets than before (75 per cent). However, these targets are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage. The share of new or updated NDCs that are completely unconditional has increased from 24 per cent to 26 per cent, while the share of NDCs that are completely conditional has dropped from 31 per cent to 18 per cent.
The aggregate impact of the new or updated NDCs formally submitted is limited: new or updated unconditional NDCs are estimated to lead to a total reduction in 2030 global GHG emissions of about 2.9 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e), compared with the previous NDCs (figure ES.3). This estimate includes reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e resulting from other factors, including lower projections of international aviation and shipping emissions,  and adjustments of countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets. If the announced pledges of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are also included, this aggregate reduction increases to just over 4 GtCO2e. The impact of conditional targets is of similar magnitude.
Taking a closer look at the G20 members, the combined impact of submitted NDCs and announced GHG reduction targets for 2030 is an annual reduction of about 3 GtCO2e compared with the previous NDCs. Six G20 members have formally

submitted updated NDCs with enhanced GHG mitigation pledges: Argentina, Canada, the EU27 (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states France, Germany and Italy as one), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America ­ all of which entail reduced emissions in 2030 of about 2.1 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs. Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.3 GtCO2e, bringing the net reduction in global GHG emissions of new or updated NDCs submitted by G20 members to 1.8 GtCO2e annually by 2030. In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.2 GtCO2e, but have not yet formally communicated them to the UNFCCC.
The largest reductions come from the United States of America, the EU27, the United Kingdom, Argentina and Canada (submitted) and China and Japan (announced). Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs. One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC.




3. As a group, G20 members are not on track to achieve either their original or new 2030 pledges. Ten G20 members are on track to achieve their previous NDCs, while seven are off track.



When considering the impact of new pledges, it

should be noted that collectively the G20 members

are not yet on track to achieve their previous NDCs.

If current policy projections are used for those

countries where policy projections are lower than

what NDCs would deliver, the G20 members as a

group are projected to fall short of achieving their unconditional NDCs by 1.1 GtCO2e annually.
Only 10 G20 members (Argentina, China, EU27, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom) are likely to achieve their original unconditional NDC targets under current policies. Among them, three members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to reduce their emissions to levels at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional NDC emissions target levels under current policies, indicating that these countries have significant room for raising their NDC ambition. As at 30 September 2021, India and Turkey have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC, while the Russian Federation has submitted a new NDC that reduces emissions, but still results in higher emissions than implied by current policies.
XIX


Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America are all assessed to require stronger policies to achieve prior NDCs, while there is insufficient information to assess the progress of Indonesia.



G20 members have adopted a range of policies

in recent years. While there are many positive

developments, there are also negative examples,

such as fossil fuel extraction projects and coal-

fired power plant construction plans moving

forward as well as rollback of environmental

regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based

on the central estimates of independent studies,

a large number of G20 members (Argentina,

Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Russian

Federation and Saudi Arabia) are expected to emit

more in 2030 under implemented policies than they

did in 2010.



Collectively, the G20 members are projected to

fall short of their new or updated unconditional

NDCs and other announced mitigation pledges

for 2030. This is to be expected and it would

indicate a lack of enhanced ambition if the new

2030 pledges were projected to be achieved with

currently implemented policies. It is worth noting

that Canada and the United States of America

have submitted strengthened NDC targets, while

independent studies suggest that they are not

on track to meet their previous NDC targets

with currently implemented policies. These two

countries therefore need to make significant

additional efforts to meet their new NDC targets.

4. A promising development is the announcement of long-term net-zero emissions pledges by 50 parties, covering more than half of global emissions. However, these pledges show large ambiguities.



Net-zero emissions is a state where the sum of all

anthropogenic emissions and removals is zero.

Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a

variety of ways ­ the most important aspect from a

global geophysical perspective being whether they

cover all GHGs or CO2 only. Global net-zero CO2 emissions stabilize global warming, whereas net-

zero GHG emissions result in a peak then a decline

in global warming. To align with a 1.5°C limit, global

CO2 emissions must reach net zero around 2050,

with global GHG emissions reaching net zero

15­20 years later. A delay of 15­20 years in either

net-zero CO2 or net-zero GHGs implies limiting

warming to 2°C rather than 1.5°C.



Globally, 49 countries and one party (the EUin addition to the net-zero pledges made by its

individual member states) have pledged a net-

zero emissions target that is stated in national

legislation, in a policy document or in a public

announcement by the government or a high-

level government official. These pledges cover

more than half of current global domestic GHG

emissions, over half of gross domestic product

(GDP) and one third of the global population. Eleven

targets covering 12 per cent of global emissions

are enshrined in law.



By number, the majority of these targets (38) are for

2050, coincident with the mid-century timescale

for global CO2 emissions indicated by the IPCC

as necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C. Eight

targets are aimed at earlier years (2030­2045) and

four at later years. In terms of emissions, however,

the targets are split almost entirely and equally

between 2050 (due to the European Union and

United States of America pledges) and 2060 (due

to China's pledge).



Existing targets show variations in scope and large

ambiguities with respect to the inclusion of sectors

and GHGs. The majority are furthermore unclear

or undecided on the inclusion of emissions from

international aviation and shipping and the use of

international offsets.

5. Few of the G20 members' NDC targets put emissions on a clear path towards net-zero pledges. There is an urgent need to back these pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved and the remaining carbon budget kept.



Twelve G20 members covering just over half of

global domestic GHG emissions have currently

pledged a net-zero target, of which six are in

law, two are in policy documents and four are

government announcements. All are for the year

2050, with the exception of China's 2060 target and

Germany's target for 2045. The remaining eight

G20 members have so far not set net-zero targets,

but three of them have communicated long-term

low GHG emission development strategies to the

UNFCCC (Indonesia, Mexico and South Africa).



G20 pledges also show ambiguity. Most targets are

unclear or undecided on the inclusion of offsets and

of international aviation and shipping emissions.

Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of

their net-zero target. Of the nine G20 members for which an emissions path can be estimated based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets. Five of these nine members, accounting for about one fifth of global domestic GHG emissions, have NDC targets that put the country's domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets. In the other four cases, the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply. Recognizing that  countries face very different circumstances, these countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their netzero targets to remain achievable.



There is an urgent need for (i) more G20 members

­ and indeed all countries ­ to pledge net-

zero emissions, (ii) all countries to increase the

robustness of their net-zero pledges, and (iii) all net-

zero targets to be backed up by near-term actions

that give confidence that the net-zero targets can

ultimately be achieved.



6. The emissions gap remains large: compared to previous unconditional NDCs, the new

pledges for 2030 reduce projected emissions by only 7.5 per cent, whereas 

per cent is needed for 2°C and 55 per cent is

needed for 1.5°C.



As in previous reports, the emissions gap for

2030 is defined as the difference between total

global GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios

that keep global warming to 2°C, 1.8°C or 1.5°C

with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated

total global GHG emissions resulting from the full

implementation of the NDCs.



This year, the NDC scenario has been expanded to

include all the most recent NDCs (new or updated

NDCs if submitted, and previous NDCs otherwise)

as well as all officially announced climate change

mitigation pledges for 2030 with a cut-off date of

30 August 2021. The three least-cost scenarios

consistent with the Paris Agreement have been

updated and their temperature outcomes re-

assessed based on the Contribution of Working

Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

As a result, global emissions in 2030 consistent

with keeping global warming below 2.0°C with

a 66 per cent chance are now estimated at 39 GtCO2e, which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in earlier reports. Similarly, the estimate for 1.8°C is about 2 GtCO2e lower than the 1.8°C estimate of previous reports. There are no changes to the 1.5°C estimate (table ES.1). This implies that while the aggregate effect on global emissions in 2030 of new or updated NDCs and announced pledges is estimated at 4 GtCO2e (see point two of this summary), the gap with respect to 2°C is only reduced by 2 GtCO2e compared with last year.
The updated current policies scenario is estimated to reduce global GHG emissions in 2030 to about 55 GtCO2e (range: 52­58 GtCO2e) in 2030, which is 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the 2020 Emissions Gap Report and 9 GtCO2e lower than the 2010-policies scenario (table ES.1). Around half of the decrease between the 2020 and 2021 Reports reflects climate policy progress in the countries, while the other half is because of the general slowdown of economies due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Collectively, countries are falling short of meeting their new or updated NDCs and announced pledges with current policies. This implementation gap in 2030 is 3 GtCO2e for unconditional NDCs and 5 GtCO2e for conditional NDCs.
Compared to last year, the emissions gap is only slightly narrowed by the new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges. By 2030, annual emissions need to be 13 GtCO2e (range: 10­16 GtCO2e) lower than current unconditional NDCs imply for the 2°C goal, and 28 GtCO2e (range: 25­30 GtCO2e) lower for the 1.5°C goal. Both estimates are for a 66 per cent chance of staying below the stated temperature limit. If conditional NDCs are also considered, these gaps are reduced by around 2 GtCO2e and 3 GtCO2e respectively (figure ES.6, table ES.1).


7. Global warming at the end of the century is estimated at 2.7°C if all unconditional 2030 pledges are fully implemented and 2.6°C if all conditional pledges are also implemented. If the net-zero emissions pledges are additionally fully implemented, this estimate is lowered to around 2.2°C.



To estimate the global warming implications

at the end of this century, estimated emissions

for the year 2030 are projected out to 2100, and

their climate outcomes assessed using a climate

model. This approach assumes a continuation

of climate action beyond 2030, without further

strengthening. Extrapolations until the end of the century are inherently uncertain and subject to scenario assumptions, such as the level at which climate action continues or technology costs. This uncertainty is currently of the order of ±0.5°C around the best-estimate 2.7°C projection, but is reduced to ±0.3°C when taking into account countries' net-zero targets. Furthermore, it should be noted that this year's estimates are based on improved methods and the latest climate assessment of Working Group I in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). These methodological updates alone lower temperature projections for unconditional NDCs by about 0.2°C compared to last year's estimates.




Acknowledging these caveats, a continuation of

the new or updated unconditional NDCs and pledge

announcements is estimated to limit warming to

2.7°C (range: 2.2­3.2°C) by the end of the century

with a 66 per cent chance. If conditional pledges

are also fully implemented, these estimates are

lowered to 2.6°C (range: 2.1­3.1°C). By contrast,

a continuation of current policies, which are

insufficient to meet the 2030 pledges, is estimated

to limit warming to 2.8°C (range 2.3­3.3°C).



The full implementation of the net-zero pledges, in

addition to new or updated unconditional NDCs and

announced pledges, further lower these temperature estimates markedly to 2.2°C (range 2.0­2.5°C) with 66 per cent chance. Even under this scenario, there is still more than 15 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 2.5°C by the end of the century, and just short of 5 per cent chance that it will exceed 3°C. Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should be caveated by the fact that only a few current NDCs set countries' emissions on a linear path towards reaching longer-term net-zero targets.

8. The opportunity to use COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery spending to stimulate the economy while fostering a low-carbon transformation has been missed in most countries so far. Poor and vulnerable countries are being left behind.



The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an

enormous increase in public expenditure, in

the form of: (i) short-term rescue spending, to 

keep businesses and people alive; (ii) longer-

term recovery investment, to reinvigorate the

economy; and (iii) reinforcement spending, to

embed new economic trajectories into long-term

development plans. Low-carbon rescue spending

has incentivized decarbonization through green

conditionalities attached to short-term business support. Low-carbon recovery investment has set out to accelerate the low-carbon transition directly by supporting green projects and indirectly by incorporating green incentives into traditional investment. Green reinforcement initiatives deliver long-term support to the projects and sectors targeted by green recovery investment.
Approximately US$16.7 trillion was spent to May 2021 on COVID-19-related rescue and recovery packages (excluding unallocated European Union funds). However, most resources have been for immediate rescue spending, mostly on unemployment and worker support programmes, pandemic management, and health-care services. US$2.25 trillion is considered recovery

1 Introduction

Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On

Authors: Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership), John Christensen (CONCITO [Denmark's climate think tank])

1.1 Context of the Emissions Gap Report 2021
This twelfth edition of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Emissions Gap Report comes during a year of constant reminders that climate change is not in the distant future. Extreme weather events around the world ­ including flooding, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heatwaves ­ have continuously hit the news headlines. Thousands of people have been killed or displaced and economic losses are measured in the trillions. Bearing witness to the increasingly clear signs of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the first report in its Sixth Assessment cycle addressing the ""Physical Science Basis"" in August 2021. Dubbed a ""code red for humanity"" by the United Nations Secretary-General, the IPCC report documents in far greater detail and with higher certainty than previous assessments how climate change and extreme events can be attributed to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. There is a fifty-fifty chance that global warming will exceed 1.5°C in the next two decades, and unless there are immediate, rapid and largescale reductions in GHG emissions, limiting warming to 1.5°C or even 2°C by the end of the century will be beyond reach.
Building on the new evidence from the IPCC, the twentysixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) is charged with the growing urgency of accelerating global ambition and action on both mitigation and adaptation. This coincides with an important milestone in the five-year ambition-raising cycle of the Paris Agreement, whereby countries were requested to submit new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) that represent a progression compared with previous NDCs before COP26. There is therefore a special focus both in the international discussions and in this year's Emissions Gap Report on the ambition level in the new and updated NDCs.
As the September 2021 version of the NDC Synthesis Report published by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) illustrates, the new and updated NDCs are insufficient to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (United Nations Framework Convention

on Climate Change 2021). This Emissions Gap Report confirms the findings of the UNFCCC report. It expands the analysis to consider new or updated NDCs and mitigation pledges that have been announced for 2030 and assesses the impacts of these on global emissions, the emissions gap and projected global warming at the end of the century. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth assessment of the net-zero pledges that an increasing number of countries are committing to, including whether 2030 plans set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges.
1.2 Focus, approach and structure of the report
Each year, the Emissions Gap Report provides an updated assessment of the gap between i) estimated future global GHG emissions if countries implement their climate mitigation pledges and ii) the global emission levels from least-cost pathways that are aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing 1.5°C. This difference between where we will likely be and where we need to be is now well known as the `emissions gap'. This year, the new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030, with a cut-off date of 30 September 2021, are included in the assessment.
One of the United Kingdom's key goals for its COP26 presidency is to secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5°C within reach (United Nations and United Kingdom undated). To date, 49 countries (50 parties, including the European Union) have firmly pledged net-zero emission goals by around mid-century, and a large number of nonstate actors have joined the High-Level Climate Champions in the Race To Zero campaign that aims to elevate ambition and mobilize credible climate action among cities, regions, businesses and investors. Given the increasing importance of and attention to net-zero emission pledges, the report includes a special chapter on net zero which assesses the trends in and robustness of these goals, including whether 2030 commitments set countries on a clear path towards their longer-term net-zero pledges.


The report also includes three chapters on opportunities to bridge the emissions gap that are pertinent to the current global situation and the COP negotiations. First, an updated assessment is provided on the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal recovery measures are used to accelerate a green transition. Second, the scope for reducing emissions from methane, the second largest GHG, to bridge the gap and get on track towards net zero is examined. Finally, the report looks into a key negotiation issue for COP26: reaching agreement on how to move forward with article 6 of the Paris Agreement dealing with cooperative approaches and market mechanisms. A large number of countries have included the use of market mechanisms in their NDC implementation plans and are waiting for the modalities to be agreed.
As in previous years, this 2021 Emissions Gap Report has been prepared by an international team consisting of 78 leading scientists from 44 expert institutions across 24 countries, assessing all available information, including that published in the context of the IPCC reports, as well as in other recent scientific studies. The transparent and participatory assessment process has been overseen by an experienced steering committee. All chapters have undergone external review and the assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned

in the report in order to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.
The report is organized into seven chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 assesses the trends in global GHG emissions and how they are affected by COVID-19, and provides a global and G20-member-specific overview of new, updated and announced NDCs. Chapter 3 provides an assessment of net-zero emission pledges. Chapter 4 updates the assessment of the likely emissions gap in 2030, based on new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030. The chapter then looks at the implications of the emissions gap on the feasibility of achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Chapter 5 assesses the extent to which COVID-19 fiscal rescue and recovery measures to date can support low-carbon or high-carbon development. It also looks at the disparities between high-income and developing countries. Chapter 6 assesses the role of methane in the NDCs and in bridging the emissions gap, and considers options for cost-effective reductions of the otherwise growing emissions of methane. Finally, chapter 7 looks at the potential role of market mechanisms in implementing NDCs and enhancing future ambitions, and discusses what is required to make the use of markets environmentally effective, transparent and credible.

2 Trends in global emissions, new pledges for 2030 and G20 status and outlook

2.1 Introduction
This chapter reviews the current status of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as the outlook for 2030 emissions under new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and announced mitigation pledges. It also reviews progress towards implementing 2030 pledges, with a special focus on G20 members.1
Section 2.2 provides an overview of current trends in total global GHG emissions and global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel use and industry-related sources, considering the impact of COVID-19 on 2020 and 2021 emissions. Section 2.3 presents new or updated NDCs communicated under the Paris Agreement, as well as additional pledges for 2030 that are yet to be formally submitted as NDCs. It discusses the characteristics of these pledges (in aggregate) and assesses their impact

on global and G20 2030 emissions. Section 2.4 presents G20 members' pledges, assessing whether and how they have been updated, along with progress towards their implementation. The assessment covers all individual G20 members and regions, except European Union member states.2 The cut-off date for the assessments of new or updated NDCs was set as 30 September 2021.
For this Emissions Gap Report, progress towards achieving the Cancun Pledges has not been assessed, due to the large uncertainty around 2020 emissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. A more comprehensive assessment on the achievement of the Cancun Pledges is expected in the Emissions Gap Report 2022.
All GHG emission figures in this report are expressed using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

1 The members of the G20 are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Union.

Fourth Assessment Report,3 unless otherwise noted. In terms of historical emissions data, section 2.2 uses globally consistent and independent data sets rather than officially reported United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) inventory reports, whereas sections 2.3 and 2.4 use UNFCCC inventory reports when comparing historical emissions to individual G20 members' NDC targets.
The methodology and preliminary findings of this chapter were made available to the governments of the countries specifically mentioned to provide them with the opportunity to comment on the findings.
2.2 Current global emissions: status and trends

Different GHGs play different roles in the changes in total GHG emissions (figure 2.1). Fossil CO2 emissions dominate total GHG emissions including LUC (66 per cent since 2010), as well as the growth in GHG emissions. Fossil CO2 emissions reached a record 37.9 GtCO2 in 2019, but dropped to 36.0 GtCO2 in 2020. CO2 emissions from LUC have constituted 10 per cent of cumulative GHG emissions since 2010, and can change significantly from year to year due to climate conditions (Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Canadell et al. 2021). Estimates in this chapter only consider the direct effects of LUC and represent the average of three bookkeeping models (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Furthermore, the estimates assume that 2020 emissions are similar to the 2010­2019 average, based on preliminary estimates of fire data. No preliminary estimates are available for the growth of non-CO2 emissions in 2020.

At present, there are no estimates available of total global GHG emissions for 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented 5.4 per cent drop in CO2 emissions in 2020 (figure 2.1), with a smaller drop in total GHG emissions expected for the year. From 2010 to 2019, GHG emissions grew by 1.3 per cent per year on average, both with and without land-use change (LUC). GHG emissions reached a record high of 51.5 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e) in 2019 without LUC emissions and 58.1 GtCO2e when including LUC4 (figure 2.1). These 2019 estimates of global GHG emissions have been downward adjusted compared with the Emissions Gap Report 2020, as more complete data have become available.

3 This change was made to be more in line with the decisions of the twenty-fourth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP24) held in Katowice, where parties agreed to use GWPs from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for reporting reasons. However, a full switch to using Fifth Assessment Report GWPs in this report is not yet possible as the literature is still not up to date on this decision.
4 The GHG emissions data in this report are based on the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR; Crippa et al. 2021), PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Olivier and Peters 2021) and LUC from the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). EDGAR data are available until 2020 for CO2, but only until 2018 for non-CO2 emissions. Non-CO2 emissions were extrapolated to 2019 based on the Emissions Gap Report 2020. GWPs were used from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. All estimates for 2019 and 2020 should be considered preliminary.

As mentioned previously, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented decline in fossil CO2 emissions in 2020, both in relative and absolute terms. Global fossil CO2 emissions fell 5.4 per cent according to this report's data set, with other estimates suggesting declines of 5.8 per cent (Global Carbon Project, updated based on Friedlingstein et al. 2020), 5.8 per cent (excluding cement) (International Energy Agency [IEA] 2021) and 6.3 per cent (BP 2021, excluding cement). The change in fossil CO2 emissions varied across countries. Despite the pandemic, Chinese fossil CO2 emissions grew 1.3 per cent in 2020, though most other major emitters saw a decline in emissions, including the United States of America (10 per cent), the EU27 (10 per cent), India (6.2 per cent), with international transportation (shipping and aviation) dropping by 20 per cent.

A strong rebound in emissions is expected in 2021 (figure 2.2). In April 2021, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated a 4.8 per cent increase in emissions in 2021, after the 5.8 per cent decline in 2020 (IEA 2021). Carbon Monitor (Liu et al. 2020) estimates near real-time estimates of daily CO2 emissions, and based on data from January to July 2021, global fossil CO2 emissions are only slightly lower (1 per cent) than the same period in 2019. Of the major emitters, only Brazil, China and the Russian Federation show an increase in emissions from January to July 2021 relative to 2019. Based on the IEA and Carbon Monitor data, fossil CO2 emissions are expected to have a near full recovery in 2021, with emission levels only slightly lower than the record high in 2019.


Despite the large decline in CO2 emissions in 2020, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere grew by around 2.3 parts per million, in line with recent trends. It is unlikely that the reductions in emissions in 2020 will be detectible in the atmospheric growth rate for three reasons. First, although emission levels declined, they were still high and around the same levels as those seen in the early 2010s, meaning the amount of CO2 remaining in the atmosphere is expected to be only marginally less than if emissions grew. Second, CO2 is a cumulative pollutant with a long lifetime, so sustained emission reductions are needed to see a change in the atmospheric signal. Finally, the natural variability of around one part per million is far greater than the effect of a 5.4 per cent reduction in emissions. Similar factors mean that methane and nitrous oxide concentrations also continued to grow in line with trends, with the increase in these concentrations in 2020 the highest ever recorded. The lack of change in atmospheric concentrations despite a record drop in emissions highlights that solving the climate problem requires rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.

2.3 Trends and implications of the new or updated NDCs and other announced mitigation pledges for 2030
2.3.1 Global summary of trends in the new or updated NDCs
The decision text that accompanied the Paris Agreement (1/CP.21) requested that parties whose intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) contained a time frame up to 2025 communicate a new NDC, and that parties whose INDC contained a time frame up to 2030 communicate or update that contribution by 2020. As at 30 September 2021,5 121 parties (including the European Union and its 27 member states, which submit a single NDC), representing around 52 per cent of 2018 global domestic GHG emissions (Climate Watch 2021), had submitted 94 new or updated NDCs. The NDCs communicated thus far reflect emerging trends related to the ambition, form, coverage and


conditionality of GHG mitigation pledges, as well as the expected use of market mechanisms in their achievement.
Effect on 2030 emissions: Of the 94 new or updated NDCs, just under half (46 NDCs from countries representing 32 per cent of global GHG emissions) would result in lower 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDCs (figure 2.3). Eighteen per cent (17 NDCs from countries representing

13 per cent of global GHG emissions) had communicated a new or updated NDC that would not reduce 2030 emissions relative to the previous NDCs. Thirty-four per cent (32 NDCs from countries representing 7 per cent of global emissions) could not be compared with the previous NDCs in terms of 2030 emissions, typically due to insufficient information in the previous NDCs, as transparency has improved in the current NDCs.


Pledge form: Of the new or updated NDCs, more (89 per cent) have GHG targets than before (75 per cent).6 These comprise several types of GHG targets, including base-year targets (commitments to reduce or control the increase in emissions by a specified amount relative to a base year) and baseline scenario targets (commitments to reduce emissions by a specified amount relative to a projected emissions baseline scenario), among other formulations. Base-year targets typically (though not always) result in emissions decreasing over time relative to historical levels, whereas baseline scenario targets are typically (though not always) formulated to allow absolute emissions to continue to grow. The form of GHG targets in new or updated NDCs evolved relative to the previous round, with a slightly larger share of NDCs now setting base-year targets (from 19 per

cent to 28 per cent of NDCs). Most countries adopting a GHG target for the first time in their new or updated NDC adopted a baseline scenario target.
Sector and gas coverage: GHG targets can be formulated to cover a country's entire economy or only a subset of it. Targets with full coverage include the energy, industrial process and product use, waste and land sectors, as well as CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorochemicals (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride. The GHG targets in the current round of NDCs are only marginally more comprehensive in terms of sector and gas coverage than in the previous round. Of the new or updated NDCs, 19 per cent had full sector and gas coverage, up from 14 per cent in those countries' first NDCs. While seven countries improved their NDCs from partial coverage to full or nearly full coverage, three countries downgraded their NDCs from nearly full coverage to partial coverage.
Conditionality: Some parties have submitted NDCs that are entirely or partially conditional on factors such as international support (e.g. finance or technology transfer), while others have submitted NDCs that are not conditional. This round of NDCs includes more unconditional elements than the last round, with 26 per cent completely unconditional, up from 24 per cent in countries' first contributions. This was largely due to countries making any mixed conditional and unconditional elements completely unconditional in their new or updated NDCs. Likewise, the share of completely conditional NDCs fell from 31 per cent to 18 per cent.
Finally, parties are increasingly recognizing gender integration as a means to enhance the ambition and effectiveness of their climate action in their new or updated NDCs (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021).
2.3.2 Impacts on GHG emissions by 2030 at the global and G20 levels, considering new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges
This section quantifies the impacts of the new or updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges on global 2030 emissions, relative to the previous NDCs. The analysis is based on the difference in projected GHG emissions by 2030 under the full implementation of the new or updated NDC submissions and announced pledges compared with the previous NDCs. The data are from five model groups and two open-source tools.7,8
Aggregate impact on global GHG emissions in 2030 The analysis shows that the aggregate impact of the new or updated unconditional NDCs is estimated to lead to a reduction in 2030 global GHG emissions of about 2.9 GtCO2e, compared with the previous NDCs (figure 2.4). This estimate includes reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e resulting from other factors, including lower projections of international aviation and shipping emissions, and adjustments of countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets. If the announced pledges of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea are included, this reduction increases to 4.1 GtCO2e. For the conditional targets, these reductions are 2.8 GtCO2e and 4.0 GtCO2e, respectively.
7 Climate Action Tracker (2021a; 2021b); Joint Research Centre with the Prospective Outlook on Long-term Energy Systems (POLES) model (Joint Research Centre 2021); PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency with the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) model (den Elzen et al. 2021, in preparation; Nascimento et al. 2021). The two open-source tools that provide NDC emissions projections for many countries are: Climate Resource (Meinshausen et al. 2021) and the World Resources Institute's Climate Watch (2021). All GHG emissions projections of the Climate Action Tracker and Climate Resource exclude LULUCF.
8 The following data sources have been used to assess announced pledges that have not yet been formally submitted: Climate Action Tracker, PBL and the Joint Research Centre. Climate Action Tracker accounts for the impact of the announcements of China and Japan, Joint Research Centre for China and Japan, and PBL for the impact of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
Figure 2.4. Impact of 2030 pledges (nationally determined contributions and other announced pledges as at 30 September 2021) on 2030 global emissions compared with previous nationally determined contribution submissions


G20 members Taking a closer look at the G20 members, the combined impact of submitted NDCs and announced GHG reduction targets for 2030 is an annual reduction of about 3 GtCO2e compared with the previous NDCs. Six G20 members have formally submitted updated NDCs with enhanced GHG mitigation pledges: Argentina, Canada, the EU27 (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states France, Germany and Italy as one), South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States of America ­ all of which entail reduced emissions in 2030 of about 2.1 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs. Two G20 members (Brazil and Mexico) have submitted targets that lead to an increase in emissions of 0.3 GtCO2e, bringing the net reduction in global GHG emissions of new or updated NDCs submitted by G20 members to 1.8 GtCO2e annually by 2030. In addition, China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have announced enhanced pledges that result in annual reductions of about 1.2 GtCO2e, but have not yet formally communicated them to the UNFCCC. The largest reductions come from the United States of America, the EU27, the United Kingdom, Argentina and Canada (submitted), and China and Japan (announced). Two G20 members (Australia and Indonesia) have submitted NDC targets, which are assessed not to lead to an additional reduction relative to the previous NDCs. One G20 member (the Russian Federation) has submitted an NDC that improves upon its previous NDC, but still does

not go beyond its current policies and another three G20 members (India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey) have not yet submitted a new or updated NDC (table 2.1).
Non-G20 members In comparison, the aggregate impact of the new or updated NDC submissions for the non-G20 members is an annual reduction of about 0.8 GtCO2e by 2030.
Other factors Finally, additional reductions of around 0.3 GtCO2e come from the decreased international aviation and shipping emissions projections, and from countries that are projected to overachieve their NDC targets. As explained previously, for some countries, NDC emission levels are expected to be above the estimated current policies scenario, with the projections of the current policies scenario assumed for the global emissions estimate. Due to the impact on COVID-19 on GHG emissions projections under the current policies scenario, the emissions projections of many countries have lowered. This means that a larger number of countries are expected to overachieve their NDC targets, in particular India, the Russian Federation and Turkey, which lowers global GHG emissions. In addition, the methodology of the underlying models may have also been updated, which could lead to changes in global emissions estimates between scenarios.


9 The updated NDC leads to an absolute increase in emissions. Both NDCs present the same reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 below 2005 emission levels. Brazil's NDC emissions (and therefore the absolute emissions in the NDC scenario) vary a great deal due to revisions of the 2005 base year. The country's second and third inventory reports and Fourth National Communication (its latest) give different values. The first NDC refers to the second inventory report, while the updated NDC cites the 2005 base year emissions of the third inventory report (Fifth Assessment Review metrics), but also specifies that ""information on emissions in 2005 and reference values may be updated and recalculated due to methodological improvements applicable to the inventories"" (Brazil 2020).



10 For comparison with the updated NDC, modelling studies interpolate the previous 2025 and 2050 targets (80 per cent from 2005 levels).
11 Climate Action Tracker (2021a) also reports the calculated impact relative to the current policies scenario. As the withdrawal of the United States of America from the Paris Agreement took effect on 4 November 2020, the country no longer had an official NDC in 2020. The calculated impact of the updated NDC relative to the current policies scenario would therefore be a reduction of about 2.0 GtCO2e.


2.4 Assessment of G20 members' progress towards NDCs and mitigation pledges for 2030
This section assesses the progress of G20 members towards their previous NDC targets and indicates progress towards new, updated or announced 2030 targets based on emissions projections. GHG emissions projections were compiled and reviewed to assess the emission levels expected for G20 members under existing policies, i.e. the current policies scenario,12 and whether members are likely to meet their respective emission reduction targets for 2030. Projections of the current policies scenario assume that no additional mitigation policies and measures are taken beyond those adopted and/or implemented as of a certain cut-off date (den Elzen et al. 2019). This report's assessment is based on `point-in-time' emissions projections in the NDC target year.
2.4.1 Methods and limitations
Current policies scenario projections were compared against the original unconditional NDCs at the time of publication of the Emissions Gap Report 2020 (November 2020), as presented in table 2.1. This assessment follows the methodology of den Elzen et al. (2019) to enable a robust comparison of projections published by independent research institutions. European Union member states are assessed as the EU27 (and not individually), with the United Kingdom now assessed separately. Official assessments published by national governments were compared with independent assessments. All data sources are presented in appendix A (available online). Policy cut-off dates ranged from 2017 to 2021 across studies. The progress assessment was based on emissions figures including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF; see appendix A on how the emissions projections excluding LULUCF were adjusted).
Recently published emissions projections for the current policies scenario and NDC scenario were collected from independent studies and considered. As at October 2021, only a few of the institutions regularly publishing national-level CO2 and GHG emissions projections for the current policies scenario had released updates that considered the potential impact of COVID-19. Annually published global studies, such as Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Joint Research Centre 2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (Nascimento et al. 2021; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency 2021), as well as national studies, such as the Rhodium Group study for the United States of America (Pitt et al. 2021), all include the impact of COVID-19 and recent policies. For these studies, the progress assessment

used NDC target emission estimates from their previous updates (used in the Emissions Gap Report 2020).
Other recent studies included several new national model scenarios from Fragkos et al. (2021) and the COMMIT13 scenario database (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis [IIASA] 2021; van Soest et al. 2021) for Australia, China (two national studies), the EU27 and the United States of America. These studies updated some 2020 national model scenario projections from the European Horizon 2020 Linking Climate and Development Policies ­ Leveraging International Networks and Knowledge Sharing (CD-LINKS) project (Roelfsema et al. 2020). However, it should be noted that these scenarios did not include the impact of COVID-19. After examining the projections from the studies collected, a number of pre-2020 studies were excluded whose 2020 emission estimates were more than 10 per cent higher than the highest estimates of the three studies published in 2021 that considered the impact of COVID-19 and recent policies (Climate Action Tracker 2021b; Joint Research Centre 2021; Nascimento et al. 2021).
Up-to-date official emissions projections published since November 2020 were collected from various sources, including countries' recently published national communications and biennial update reports, and other national government reports (see appendix A). Such information included annually updated projections made by the Australian and Canadian governments (Australia, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources 2020; Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada 2021).
The most important limitation for the 2021 assessment is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the current policies scenario projections. As at September 2021, several recent projections had either been published or prepared prior to the pandemic, and therefore did not account for its potentially significant impact on emission trends in 2020 and 2021, and in the period until 2030. Other important limitations are similar to those of previous Emissions Gap Reports (see appendix A).
2.4.2 G20 progress towards previous NDC targets and indications of progress towards new, updated or announced targets for 2030
Collectively, the G20 members are projected to fall short of their new or updated unconditional NDCs and other announced mitigation pledges for 2030. Similarly, G20 members are projected to collectively fall short of their previous unconditional NDCs (as at November 2020) by 1.1 GtCO2e per year, if the unconditional NDCs of the three G20 members that are projected to significantly overachieve

12 Current policy scenario projections assume that no additional mitigation action is taken beyond current policies, even if it results in NDC targets not being achieved or being overachieved (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2015; den Elzen et al. 2019). Current policies scenario projections reflect all adopted and implemented policies, which for the purpose of this report are defined as legislative decisions, executive orders or their equivalent. This implies that officially announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify.

their targets (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey; see table 2.2) are substituted with current policies scenario projections. However, the G20 members are collectively expected to slightly overachieve their previous unconditional NDCs by about 0.3 GtCO2e per year by 2030, based on scenario projections by independent studies.
Table 2.2 shows the progress of G20 members towards their previous NDC targets as of November 2020, organized by the status and assessment of their new or updated NDC targets and other announced 2030 targets submitted or announced thereafter. Ten of 1714 G20 members are likely to achieve their unconditional NDC targets based on previous or first NDC submissions under current policies (i.e. Argentina, China, the EU27, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, Saudi

Arabia, South Africa, Turkey and the United Kingdom ­ as a former European Union member state; see table 2.2). Three G20 members (India, the Russian Federation and Turkey) are projected to be at least 15 per cent lower than their previous unconditional emission target levels and therefore have significant room to increase the ambition of their NDCs (figure 2.5). Central estimates of emissions projections for 2030 under current policies were lower than those of the Emissions Gap Report 2020 for all previously mentioned G20 members, with the exception of Argentina, whose estimate remained largely unchanged. For example, for the EU27 and South Africa, current projections are roughly 10 per cent and 20 per cent lower than the projections of last year's assessment, respectively, due to enhanced policies and the impact of COVID-19.

14 An assessment of individual European Union member states was not conducted.



Notes: See appendix A for the list of studies reviewed. The number of independent studies that project a country to meet its previous or first NDC target were compared with the total number of studies and are indicated in square brackets. `Within reach' indicates that only the lower bound estimate of the current policies scenario is within the NDC target range. 1. Current policies scenario projections were also examined from official publications. The number of official publications that projected
countries would achieve their point-in-time NDC target were: Australia: 0 of 1, Canada: 0 of 1, EU27: 0 of 1, Russian Federation: 0 of 1 and the United Kingdom: 0 of 1.
2. The EU Reference Scenario was used for the EU27, which assumes full implementation of the national energy and climate plans by European Union member states and sees European Union emissions reduce by around 43 per cent below 1990 levels by 2030 (European Commission 2021). Including net removals from LULUCF increases the reduction to 45 per cent. This baseline scenario indicates that additional effort would be required to meet the European Union's current 2030 energy-efficiency target, though its current 2030 renewable energy target would be met. Additional measures for member states are being prepared to fully implement national energy and climate plans submitted in 2020 (European Commission 2020).
3. The Republic of Korea's Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) is an instrument used to fully achieve the country's NDC target and covers about 70 per cent of its GHG emissions. Among the three independent studies, only one (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) explicitly quantified the impact of the K-ETS up to 2025 based on the Master Plans for K-ETS Phase III (2021­2025) and Phase IV (2026­2030) and the Phase III National Allowances Allocation Plan. This partially explains why the studies project that the Republic of Korea will miss its NDC target under current policies.

For China, four out of six independent studies projected that the country would achieve its original NDC target. However, since five of the six studies reviewed only provided a single NDC target value for 2030 ­ despite China's NDC containing multiple targets, which are partly dependent on GDP growth rates ­ it was not possible to analyse in detail which targets would likely be met or overachieved. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on GHG emissions were also highly uncertain, especially given the fact that China's fossil CO2 emissions rebounded strongly in the second half of 2020 and in 2021 (section 2.2).

This stronger-than-expected rebound was not considered in China's latest emissions projections that estimated the impact of COVID-19 (Climate Action Tracker (2021b), Joint Research Centre (2021) and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (2021)).
Six G20 members' GHG emissions were projected to fall short and therefore require further action of varying degree to meet their previous (or original) unconditional NDC targets. These G20 members are Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America.

Notes: For current policies scenario projections, estimates based on independent studies are presented. For NDCs, official values (adjusted to Fourth Assessment Report GWPs) are presented where available. For reporting reasons, the emissions projections for China, the EU27, India and the United States of America are shown in figure 2.5a, and the other countries shown in figure 2.5b, using two different vertical axes. See appendix A for details. For the United States of America's previous NDC, the average of 2030 estimates from two studies are shown (Joint Research Centre 2021; Climate Action Tracker 2021b). For China and South Africa, the estimated emissions under the new 2030 announced targets are based on Climate Action Tracker and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency studies (Nascimento et al. 2021; Climate Action Tracker 2021b). Estimates for China, Japan and the Republic of Korea use announced targets.

To supplement the findings presented above, figure 2.6 presents per capita GHG emissions under the current policies scenario, NDC targets and other announced 2030 pledges as at 30 September 2021, as well as the 2010 historical estimates for the 17 G20 members (counting the EU27 and its three individual G20 member states as one). In 2030, the average per capita emissions of G20 members under latest

NDCs and other announced 2030 pledges are projected to be slightly lower (7 tCO2e) than under the current policies scenario (7.4 tCO2e) and the previous NDCs (7.2 tCO2e). However, compared with 2010 levels, average emissions are not expected to be lower and as the figure illustrates they are still far off the median estimates consistent with 2°C and 1.5°C scenarios by 2050, which are 1.9 tCO2e (tenth


and ninetieth percentile range: 1.2­2.3 tCO2e) and 0.6 tCO2e (0.3­1.1 tCO2e), respectively.16 Per capita emissions vary significantly across G20 members, with India's emissions about half the G20 average for example, and Saudi Arabia's three times greater. The EU27 and the United Kingdom perform well in both absolute and per capita emission levels by 2030 and their reduction rates compared with 2010 levels. Australia and South Africa are also projected

to reduce their per capita emissions by more than one third between 2010 and 2030 under current policies. Mexico also performs well in terms of its projected development of per capita emissions under both current policies and NDC scenarios. Per capita emissions under current unconditional NDC targets are projected to increase between 2010 and 2030 for seven G20 members.

3.1 Introduction
Achieving global net zero in line with the Paris Agreement requires rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the scaling-up of removals. Emissions reductions are essential to keep the challenge of halting global warming as manageable as possible. Removals are used to balance out emissions from activities for which we have not reduced emissions to zero ­ hence the concept of `net zero' ­ as well as to deliver net-negative global emissions that can gradually reverse the warming already caused.
One promising development is the announcement of longterm net-zero emissions pledges by an increasing number of countries that currently account for more than half of global emissions. However, these pledges have large ambiguities and few of the latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs) put countries on a clear path towards their net-zero pledges. There is an urgent need to back net-zero pledges up with near-term targets and actions that give confidence that net-zero emissions can ultimately be achieved.
This chapter looks at how net-zero emissions targets have emerged from the scientific understanding of the climate system and the goals of the Paris Agreement (section 3.2). It sets out the considerations when translating net zero from a global scientific concept to national policy targets (section 3.3), and assesses current targets in terms of their ambition, scope, transparency and consistency with near-term plans and actions (sections 3.4 and 3.5).
3.2 The science of net-zero emissions targets
Net-zero emissions is a state where the sum of all anthropogenic emissions and removals is zero.

Net-zero emissions targets are being defined in a variety of ways ­ the most important aspect from a global geophysical perspective being whether they cover all GHGs or carbon dioxide (CO2) only (Rogelj et al. 2015). Net-zero GHG emissions are achieved when total aggregate GHG emissions over a given period are equal to an equivalent amount of aggregate GHG removal (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021b). Net-zero CO2 emissions are defined similarly but for CO2 only.
Other terms such as `carbon neutrality' and `climate neutrality' are often used interchangeably for net-zero CO2 and net-zero GHG emissions, respectively. However, as their meaning can differ depending on context and language, further specification is needed to avoid ambiguity (see glossary for various definitions of net-zero terms).
3.2.1. Net-zero CO2 emissions stabilize global warming, whereas net-zero GHG emissions result in a peak and decline in global warming
As a concept, net-zero emissions were introduced well over a decade ago as a way of thinking about minimizing society's impact on the climate and the environment (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2008; Worth 2005). The concept gained traction after several scientific studies in the 2000s established a near-linear relationship between global warming and the total amount of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions ever emitted.
Reaching net-zero CO2 emissions results in CO2 concentrations gradually declining over time towards a long-term equilibrium as part of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is redistributed by the uptake in the biosphere on land and in the ocean. As a result, CO2-induced temperature stabilizes (Allen et al. 2009; Collins et al. 2013; Joos et al. 2013; Knutti and Rogelj 2015; Lee et al. 2021; MacDougall et al. 2020; Matthews et al. 2009; Matthews and Caldeira 2008; Meinshausen et al. 2009; Solomon et al. 2010; Zickfeld et al. 2009).


These insights were consolidated in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) where they were used to establish the geophysical requirements for halting global warming and to estimate carbon budgets consistent with preventing warming from exceeding specified levels (Collins et al. 2013; IPCC 2014, 2013; Stocker et al. 2013) (see box 3.1). The most recent IPCC assessment report (the Sixth Assessment Report, AR6) confirms that warming is expected to stabilize once global CO2 emissions reach net-zero levels (IPCC 2021a; Lee et al. 2021).
For non-CO2 emissions, the global temperature impact of achieving net-zero emissions depends on how long the GHG persists in the atmosphere (Pierrehumbert 2014; Solomon et al. 2010). Methane, currently the second-largest contributor to warming, has a much shorter lifetime than CO2. Therefore, if methane emissions reduce to zero, concentrations fall faster, and their contribution to global temperature will decline. Achieving net-zero GHG emissions expressed with the default GWP-100 metric through a combination of low

residual non-CO2 emissions and CO2 removal results in a peak then a decline in global warming (figure 3.1) (Forster et al. 2021; Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; IPCC 2021b; Rogelj et al. 2021). The magnitude of this decline depends on the minimum level to which non-CO2 GHGs can be reduced, but could potentially be around 0.02­0.05°C/decade (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018).
At present, none of the available mitigation scenarios fully eliminate all CO2 or other GHG emissions (Clarke et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2014). To reach net-zero emissions, residual emissions are thus balanced by removals from the atmosphere: hence the inclusion of `net' in net-zero targets. The most scalable forms of GHG removal are CO2 removal measures (Fuss et al. 2018; Nemet et al. 2018). This means that net-zero CO2 emissions are achieved before net-zero GHG emissions. Reaching net-zero GHG emissions targets therefore involves at least two, and in most cases three, interlinked strategies: deep reductions in CO2 emissions, the upscaling of CO2 removal, and deep reductions in other GHG emissions (figure 3.1).

Box 3.1. Carbon budgets

Global warming is close to linearly proportional to the total net amount of CO2 that has ever been emitted into the atmosphere as a result of human activities. Therefore, limiting global warming to a specified level requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions ever emitted be kept within a finite carbon budget. Recently, AR6 published new estimates of the remaining carbon budget for limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels (Canadell et al. 2021; IPCC 2021b). According to these, human activities resulted in about 2,390 GtCO2 between 1850 and 2019, contributing around three quarters of the 1.07°C of human-induced warming from 1850-1900 to 2010 -2019.
To limit warming to 1.5°C with a 66 per cent or 50 per cent chance, the remaining carbon budget is estimated at 400 and 500 GtCO2, respectively. For 2°C, these estimates are 1,150 and 1,350 GtCO2, respectively. Current annual global CO2 emissions are above 40 GtCO2/year, meaning that urgent and deep emissions reductions over the next decade are required to stay within the remaining budgets. AR6 clarifies that methodological improvements cause the estimates in the latest report to be markedly larger than in AR5 (Stocker et al. 2013), but very similar to those reported in the IPCC Special Report on global warming of

1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2018) (see box 5.2 in Canadell et al. (2021) for more information).
Carbon budgets are not the only determinant of global warming. The warming that accompanies non-CO2 emissions also plays a role. AR6 carbon budgets assume that non-CO2 emissions are reduced following the median reductions from deep mitigation scenarios (Canadell et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2018). For methane, this implies at least a 30 per cent reduction in 2030 compared with 2010, and about a 50 per cent reduction in 2050. Remaining carbon budgets may vary by an estimated 220 GtCO2 or more, depending on how deeply future non-carbon-dioxide emissions are reduced (Canadell et al. 2021). Chapter 6 assesses the role of methane in meeting these emissions reductions and bridging the emissions gap.
Total GHG emissions are aggregated in units of CO2 equivalence. Although several different metrics for defining this equivalence exist (Myhre et al. 2013), under the Paris Agreement GHG emissions must be aggregated using the global warming potential over a 100-year timehorizon (GWP-100) metric1 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2018).

1 Parties to the Paris Agreement are mandated to report aggregated greenhouse gas emissions by using the GWP-100 metric, while additional information that uses other aggregations can also be provided. Note that in addition, emissions of the various GHGs also have to be reported individually.
Figure 3.1. Illustration of how net-zero carbon dioxide or net-zero greenhouse gas emissions are reached at a global level (top) and the typical global warming implications of reaching these respective targets (bottom)


Note: GWP-100 stands for global warming potential over a 100-year time-horizon, and is the metric that is mandated to be used under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to report aggregated anthropogenic emissions and removals of GHGs. Reaching net-zero CO2 emissions results in global warming stabilizing, provided that non-CO2 forcing is also stabilized (Allen et al. 2018; IPCC 2018), while reaching net-zero GHG emissions defined with GWP-100 results in global warming peaking and subsequently gradually declining (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018). Figure adapted from Rogelj et al. (2021). Pathway taken from Huppmann et al. (2018a, 2018b) and climate outcome assessed using the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) (Meinshausen et al. 2011). Note that this figure shows one illustrative scenario in which the net-zero timings of CO2 and total GHG emissions are not necessarily equal to the median estimates of the IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C (IPCC 2018).


3.2.2. The Paris Agreement and the timing of netzero emissions
In the lead-up to the Paris Agreement, these geophysical concepts of carbon budgets and net-zero emissions were proposed as key elements for a legal architecture (Haites, Yamin and Höhne 2013), and studies proposed net-zero dates for global CO2 and total GHG emissions in line with specific temperature limits (Rogelj et al. 2015). The Paris Agreement marked the incorporation of the net-zero concept into international policy, aiming to ""achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty"" (UNFCCC 2015). Subsequently, the IPCC Special Report on

global warming of 1.5°C highlighted that to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels with no or limited overshoot, global CO2 emissions should reach net zero around midcentury (IPCC 2018). The latter spurred a wave of net-zero target declarations.
Table 3.1 provides global net-zero timings from model pathways aligned with 1.5°C and 2°C limits. For 1.5°C, CO2 emissions must reach net zero around 2050, with GHG emissions reaching net zero 15­20 years later. A delay of 15­20 years in either net-zero CO2 or net-zero GHGs implies limiting warming to 2°C rather than 1.5°C.

Note: SR1.5 stands for IPCC Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C. IPCC estimates as reported in table 2.4 of SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018). Values show the median and interquartile range across scenarios available in the SR1.5 scenario database (Huppmann et al. 2018a). In the pathway categories as used in chapter 4 of this report, pathways with emissions reductions before 2020 are excluded. The temperature outcomes of these pathways have also been reassessed based on the physical climate assessment of the IPCC AR6 ­ see cross-chapter box 7.1 in Forster et al. (2021).

3.2.3. The pathway to net-zero counts
Carbon budgets come with climate implications for netzero targets: the path followed from today until net-zero CO2 emissions are reached determines the total amount of emitted CO2 and thereby the total carbon budget. Whether we follow a linear, an accelerated, or a delayed path impacts the climate outcome (figure 3.2). Following a delayed path compared to an accelerated path to net-zero GHG emissions

by 2065 could lead to about 0.1°C more warming. At worst, a delay could result in a complete failure to achieve the net-zero target, resulting in higher warming. Near-term emissions reductions that sketch a linear or accelerated path towards a longer-term net-zero target therefore provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can ultimately be achieved.

Global net-zero emissions targets in isolation set only a weak limit on the maximum level of global warming (Rogelj et al. 2015), as the maximum level of warming is largely defined by the cumulative amount of CO2 emissions emitted until net zero (IPCC 2018).
3.3. Net-zero at the national level
Setting net-zero emissions targets at the national level involves several steps in addition to the aforementioned global considerations. These steps represent both technical choices and normative decisions related to equity and fairness. Although this chapter focuses on countries, there are similar steps to translate global net-zero targets to sectors, companies, investment portfolios and other entities (see box 3.2).
First, at a technical level, the scope of emissions covered by a net-zero target needs defining (Levin et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2021). This includes defining the GHGs and activity sectors that are covered. For countries, the UNFCCC's

requirement that parties report emissions and removals of a basket of GHGs on a territorial basis informs the scope of national targets. Countries could however exclude some gases or activities, include others such as international aviation and shipping, or take a different approach such as consumption-based accounting (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Munksgaard and Pedersen 2001; Wyckoff and Roop 1994).
A further choice in scope is the inclusion and use of carbon offsets, which are credits generated by projects carrying out emissions reduction or removal outside a country's (or other entity's) boundary. These credits are transferred to be accounted for within the boundary, often ­ but not always ­ by financial purchase through a market. Markets can allow entities to meet targets in a more economically efficient way (Grubb et al. 2011).
However, experience shows that international carbon markets can have pitfalls. Large numbers of credit-generating projects in the Clean Development Mechanism ­ the market operated under the Kyoto Protocol ­ were found not to fully represent additional carbon benefits


(Cames et al. 2016). The Paris Agreement anticipates a new international regime for carbon markets under article 6, the operation of which is still under negotiation. This will require clearly defined rules and robust accounting mechanisms to track progress, deliver real emissions reductions and drive ambition. Chapter 7 further discusses challenges and opportunities in using markets in achieving Paris Agreement targets in both the near-term and net-zero context.
Second, normative choices are required when translating global net-zero targets to the country level, involving questions of equity and fairness. A deadline for global netzero emissions does not require all countries to achieve net zero at the same time (Robiou du Pont et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2021). Factors such as responsibility, capacity and level of development imply that some nations should achieve (and go beyond) net-zero emissions more quickly than others (Dubash et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021). Furthermore, the costs of and potential for achieving emissions reductions and removals are geographically unevenly distributed. Reaching global net-zero emissions is therefore likely to involve a combination of positive and negative emissions contributions across countries and sectors, keeping in mind that the global potential for negative CO2 emissions is limited because of technical, social and sustainability reasons (IPCC 2019, 2018). This variation between countries is illustrated by the different times at which regions (Rogelj 2018) or major emitting countries (van Soest et al. 2021) reach net-zero CO2 or GHG emissions as part of a global least-cost transition, irrespective of additional equity or fairness considerations.

Aside from questions of equity and scope, debates have emerged over whether net-zero targets promote or hinder actions consistent with the Paris Agreement. Net-zero is seen as more actor-centred and effective than a temperature limit (Geden 2016). It also represents greater ambition than the current long-term pledges of most countries.2
Nevertheless, the concept of net-zero has faced criticism on the grounds that it may slow mitigation, either through over-reliance on carbon removal (McLaren et al. 2019) or on carbon credits (Stabinsky, Bhatnagar and Shaw 2021), or because an emphasis on long-term targets can distract from a lack of near-term actions. Other critics highlight that a narrow focus on net-zero targets can lose sight of differences in national climate politics, or the credibility of pledges, as well as equity (Dubash et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021). Net-zero targets are not to be viewed in isolation as the sole policy mechanism for effecting change; they should be accompanied by near-term actions as well as detailed and transparent plans for delivery (Rogelj et al. 2021; Smith 2021). The Paris Agreement encourages these through the submission of NDCs and long-term strategies to the UNFCCC.
In response to these issues and criticisms, several recent studies have focused on identifying a set of criteria against which the robustness of net-zero pledges can be assessed (Black et al. 2021; Climate Action Tracker 2021; Levin et al. 2020; Rogelj et al. 2021). They share several common features, summarized in table 3.2.

3.4. Tracking national net-zero targets globally
The number of national net-zero targets has grown rapidly over the last four years. By the broadest definition, as many as 136 countries covering more than half of global GHG emissions either have some form of commitment to such

a target or are considering it (Climate Action Tracker 2021; Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit [ECIU] 2021; UNEP 2020; World Resources Institute 2020). This includes countries whose governments are merely discussing net-zero targets, and signatories to the Climate Ambition Alliance which cites working towards net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050 among its aims (Climate Ambition Alliance 2019).


Here we define a net-zero target as a statement in national legislation, in a policy document (i.e. an NDC or long-term strategy communicated to the UNFCCC, or a similar document published by a national government), or a public announcement by the government or a highlevel government official (e.g. Head of State). We include references to net-zero emissions, net-zero carbon, carbon neutral(ity), GHG neutral(ity), climate neutral(ity) and a decarbonized economy or society. Our analysis reflects developments up to 13 September 2021.

Using this classification, 50 parties (49 countries plus the European Union) have pledged a net-zero target. These cover around 57 per cent of current global domestic GHG emissions, 60 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and 34 per cent of the global population (Climate Watch 2021; World Resources Institute 2021). Eleven targets are enshrined in law, covering 12 per cent of global emissions (table 3.3).


Sources: Total coverage of current net-zero pledges by percentage of global domestic emissions in 2018 (World Resources Institute 2021), GDP (World Bank 2019, in purchasing power parity (PPP) constant international $ terms) and population (UN World Population Prospects 2019)

By number, the majority of these targets (38) are for 2050, coincident with the mid-century timescale for global CO2 emissions indicated by the IPCC as necessary for limiting warming to 1.5°C. Eight targets are aimed at earlier years (2030­2045) and four at later years. In terms of emissions, however, the targets are split almost entirely and equally between 2050 (due to the pledges by the European Union and United States of America) and 2060 (due to China's pledge).
It is important to note that approaches to counting carbon sources and sinks can differ between global studies and national reporting. Some care is therefore needed when assigning net-zero status to countries, or interpreting claims by countries that `carbon neutrality' has been achieved. In particular, national GHG inventories label all carbon uptake on managed land (including naturally occurring uptake) as anthropogenic, resulting in greater removal numbers than in the scientific modelling studies that form the basis for the global emissions pathways assessed in chapter 4 of this report (Grassi et al. 2021, 2018). However, one available study indicates that differences between the two approaches at the global level lead to a negligible difference in terms of timing of net-zero emissions (Grassi et al. 2021). Further indepth studies are required to confirm this.
Existing net-zero targets show variations in scope, as well as large ambiguities (World Resources Institute 2020). Thirtyfour are clear in including all sectors of domestic activity, while the remaining 16 are unclear or undecided. Regarding

inclusion of GHGs, 17 targets are unclear or undecided, however those that are clear all include at least some nonCO2 gases as well as CO2. The majority (39) are unclear or undecided on inclusion of emissions from international aviation and shipping. However, three explicitly include them. Similarly, on use of offsets, five include them explicitly, eight rule them out and 37 are unclear or undecided.
As already explained, achieving net-zero emissions is key to halting or even gradually reversing global warming. With an increasing share of global emissions covered by net-zero targets, their impact on temperature projections is also increasingly important. Chapter 4 ­ which provides an overview of global warming implications of current policies, NDCs and net-zero targets ­ estimates that if fully achieved, net-zero targets could reduce global warming projections by about 0.5°C relative to projections that only take into account unconditional NDCs.
3.5. A closer look at net-zero targets in the G20
Twelve of the G20 members, covering 54 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions, currently have pledged a net-zero target, of which six are in law, two are in policy documents and four are government announcements. All are for the year 2050, with the exception of China's 2060 target and Germany's target for 2045.


Figure 3.3 provides an assessment of these targets against most of the criteria provided in table 3.3. Where information relevant to the criteria is available from countries, figure 3.3 highlights its existence rather than assessing its sufficiency. For instance, a plan may be published and it may refer to the fairness of its contribution to global efforts, however additional assessment is required to establish whether the plan is detailed enough and the fairness appropriate.
Similar to the global assessment of national net-zero targets, a notable feature of current net-zero targets of G20 members is their ambiguity. Regarding scope, most targets are unclear or undecided on inclusion of offsets and of international aviation and shipping emissions. Lack of clarity is also notable on coverage of sectors and gases, but those that are clear show a tendency for comprehensive coverage. Most show a lack of transparency regarding the approach taken to fairness, the plans for achievement (including on use of removals), and on reporting and reviewing progress. Only Canada, the European Union, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea have published their plans so far, and only these countries plus the United Kingdom have accountable processes for reviewing their targets.

To summarize, eight G20 members have so far not set net-zero targets, whereas 12 (covering 54 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have. Of the nine G20 members for which we can estimate an emissions path based on their net-zero target and their NDC, none have NDC targets that put them on an accelerated path towards their net-zero emissions targets. Five of these nine members (covering 21 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions) have NDC targets that put the country's domestic emissions onto a linear path towards achieving their net-zero targets. For four G20 members (covering 28 per cent of global domestic GHG emissions), the NDCs lead to emissions in 2030 that are about 25 per cent to 95 per cent higher than a linear path towards their net-zero targets would imply. These countries urgently need strengthened and more ambitious near-term climate plans for their net-zero targets to remain achievable.
There is an urgent need for (i) more G20 members ­ and indeed all countries ­ to pledge net-zero emissions, (ii) all countries to increase the robustness of their net-zero pledges, and (iii) all net-zero targets to be backed up by near-term actions that give confidence that the net-zero targets can ultimately be achieved.

As an indication of the consistency between nearer-term actions and net-zero targets, figure 3.3 also plots the emissions paths for G20 members implied by their most recent NDCs or announced mitigation pledge for 2030 and their net-zero target. As highlighted in section 3.2 and figure 3.2, near-term targets need to be aligned on a clear path towards achieving net-zero targets and limiting cumulative emissions. Indeed, the Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020) argued that the litmus test of net-zero pledges is the extent to which they are reflected in near-term policy action and in significantly more ambitious NDCs for the period to 2030. Near-term emissions reductions that follow a linear or accelerated path towards a net-zero target provide higher confidence that the net-zero target can be achieved.



Box 3.2. Non-state action on net zero

Businesses, cities, regions, investors, civil society groups, and other non-state and subnational actors (NSAs) play an increasingly important role in raising ambition and accelerating implementation. The Paris Agreement institutionalized the engagement of NSAs in achieving long-term climate goals and created an ongoing process to catalyse climate commitments made by NSAs, including net-zero targets (Chan, Ellinger and Widerberg 2018; Hale 2016; Hsu et al. 2018).
Efforts by NSAs towards global net-zero emissions are strengthening and broadening, which helps mobilize stakeholders to achieve net zero (Data-Driven EnviroLab and NewClimate Institute 2020; Hsu et al. 2020). The United Nations Race To Zero campaign rallies NSAs globally to take rigorous actions to reduce emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, vetting members via an independent expert group. More than 3,000 businesses, 730 cities, 170 investors, 30 regions and 600 universities have joined Race To Zero, together covering around 25 per cent of global CO2 emissions and 50 per cent of GDP (Black et al. 2021; NewClimate Institute and Data-Driven EnviroLab 2020; Smit and Kuramochi 2020; UNFCCC 2021).
Actions taken by NSAs can also contribute to achieving net-zero targets set by governments, while at the same time creating more favourable conditions for governments to increase their ambition going forward. A recent study of major non-state actor initiatives found they had the potential to reduce 2030 emissions by 5­15 GtCO2e (Black et al. 2021; Hale et al. 2021; Hsu et al. 2019; NewClimate Institute and Data-Driven EnviroLab 2020; NewClimate Institute et al. 2021).

At the national level, NSAs are supporting implementation and enhancement of climate goals. For instance, America Is All In, a coalition of over 1,800 institutions representing 65 per cent of the United States of America's population and 70 per cent of its GDP, is an initiative to enhance nonstate actions to cut the United States of America's GHG emissions by 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and put the country on a trajectory consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (Hultman et al. 2021). Meanwhile, the European Commission launched the European Climate Pact to mobilize NSAs and communities to participate in climate actions. The Japan Climate Initiative, made up of businesses and municipalities, has played a key role in supporting the government's new NDC.
However, the increase in NSA net-zero pledges needs to be treated with caution, because as they have proliferated, they have varied in robustness. The scope and coverage of net-zero targets; the existence of implementation plans, transparency and reporting to track progress; the alignment between near-term actions and long-term netzero targets; and the robustness of carbon offsets are critical to credible net-zero targets (Black et al. 2021; Hale et al. 2021; Hsu et al. 2019; NewClimate Institute and DataDriven EnviroLab 2020; NewClimate Institute et al. 2021). NSAs have started to take actions to address these issues. For example, the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, a private-sector-led initiative, aims to develop a threshold standard to ensure high integrity offset credits and create robust and transparent markets.


4.1 Introduction
The emissions gap is estimated as the difference between projected global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions assuming full implementation of the mitigation pledges that countries have made for 2030, and emissions under least-cost pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement's long-term goal of limiting global average temperature increase to ""well-below 2°C"" and pursing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C, compared with pre-industrial levels. This year, the update of the emissions gap is particularly interesting as it is the first time countries have submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement's five-year ambition-raising cycle. Thus, the update of the emissions gap provides an indication of the extent to which the NDC process under the Paris Agreement is working and the progress made.

4.2 Scenarios considered for the 2030 gap assessment
This section updates the eight scenarios considered for the 2030 emissions gap assessment. These scenarios comprise reference scenarios (4.2.1), NDC scenarios (4.2.2), and leastcost mitigation scenarios starting in 2020 consistent with specific temperature targets (4.2.3). Table 4.1 lists and describes all scenarios included in the assessment

To estimate the emissions gap, updated scenarios that underlie its quantification are assessed (section 4.2). This year, the mitigation pledge scenarios include the latest available NDCs as well as announced mitigation pledges for 2030 with a cut-off date of 30 August 2021. Further, scenarios consider the repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible economic recovery paths. The emissions gap assessment for 2030 is presented in section 4.3, while the implications of failing to bridge the emissions gap for global temperature rise are discussed in section 4.4. In this context, the key questions assessed in this chapter are: What is our current best estimate of the emissions gap for 2030 taking into account the new or updated NDCs, announced pledges and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery measures? What are the global warming implications over the course of the century?


Starting from Description
This scenario includes only climate polices implemented up to 2010 (no additional measures from 2010 onward).
Current policies updated to reflect climate mitigation policies adopted and implemented as of 2020/21. Scenario also adjusted to reflect short- and midterm socioeconomic impacts from COVID-19.1
This scenario reflects new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030 that have been indicated to be implemented without any explicit external support. (Cut-off date: 30 August 2021)
In addition to the unconditional pledges, this scenario considers new or updated NDCs as well as officially announced mitigation pledges for 2030 to be implemented conditional upon receiving international support (finance, technology transfer and/or capacity-building). (Cut-off date: 30 August 2021)
Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 2°C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66 per cent chance.
Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 1.8°C throughout the twenty-first century with at least 66 per cent chance.
Long-term least-cost pathway consistent with holding global warming below 1.5°C throughout the twenty-first century with limited or no overshooting. Global warming in 2100 is projected to be below 1.5°C with at least 66 per cent chance, while throughout the twenty-first century it is kept below 1.5°C with at least 33 per cent chance.

1 The updated current policy scenario adjusts original modelling studies to account for different policy cut-off dates, which range from 2017 to 2020, and varying consideration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on socioeconomic drivers.

4.2.1 Reference scenarios and updates Two reference scenarios are considered: the `year 2010 policies' scenario and the `updated current policies' scenario. Only the latter has changed compared to last year.
The year 2010 policies scenario assumes that no additional climate mitigation policies are implemented after 2010. As in previous gap reports, global GHG emissions in this scenario are based on the baseline projections of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios from six modelling studies assuming middle-of-the-road socioeconomic assumptions (SSP2) (Fricko et al. 2017) that also underpin the current policies scenario projections as of 2019 (McCollum et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020).2
The updated current policies scenario projects global GHG emissions assuming all currently adopted and implemented policies (defined as legislative decisions, executive orders, or equivalent) are realized and that no additional measures are undertaken. It also considers the impact of COVID-19. The data for this scenario are based on updates by four modelling studies3 that include the impacts of COVID-19 and have a cut-off date of November 2020 and four international modelling groups.4 The international modelling groups have 31 December 2016 as their cut-off date for current policies (Roelfsema et al. 2020) and do not include COVID-19 effects. They are included to ensure consistency of the data set and methodology across the Emissions Gap Reports. Their results were adjusted to reflect updates of policies until November 2020 by comparing them to the results of the four modelling studies that provide estimates for both cutoff dates (den Elzen, Höhne and Jiang 2017).
Following this approach, the median estimate of the impact of recent policies is a reduction in global GHG emissions of 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) (range: 3.0­0.4). To capture the impact of COVID-19, the four international modelling groups' estimates were adjusted based on three of the four modelling studies (Climate Action Tracker, International Energy Agency [IEA] and PBL) that provide global GHG emissions projections based on consistent current policies scenarios, including as well as excluding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this approach, the impact of COVID-19 is an estimated reduction in global GHG emissions of about 2.5 GtCO2e (range: 3.2­1.4) by 2030. Considering both of these impacts, the median estimate of global GHG emissions in

2030 for the updated current policies scenario becomes 55 GtCO2e (range of 52­58 GtCO2e; see table 4.2) in 2030, which is 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the 2020 UNEP Emissions Gap Report.
It remains critically important to understand the potential structural changes of the COVID-19 pandemic and the post-COVID rescue and recovery packages on emission levels out to 2030 (see chapter 5). This is particularly important given the use of 2030 as a target year in many countries' NDC submissions and as a benchmark to gauge global climate action. Research is ongoing in this area, but not yet published in the peer-reviewed literature.
While understanding of energy-related GHG emissions trends during the COVID-19 pandemic is improving (Forster et al. 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2021, 2020; Liu et al. 2020), there is more uncertainty around trends in agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU)-based GHG emissions. However, these emissions seem to continue to increase. In 2020, agricultural activities had limited losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and some commodities even increased their production (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021). Further global deforestation rates increased significantly, resulting in a loss of tree cover by 25.2 Mha, 12 per cent more than in 2019 (Hansen et al. 2013; World Resources Institute [WRI] 2021).
Although near-term impacts on land-use dynamics are yet to be better known, as in the 2000s and 2010s, production of agricultural commodities (mainly beef, soy, and palm oil), illegal logging, mining extraction and wild fires were major drivers of deforestation (Curtis et al. 2018; FAO 2021c). The rising trend of prices for most food and metal commodities (FAO 2021a, 2021b; World Bank 2021), along with governmental stimulus into agribusiness activities, extractive industries, and development of road infrastructure in protected land regions drove deforestation and forest degradation, mainly in the tropics (Brancalion et al. 2020; Ferrante and Fearnside 2020). During the COVID-19 crisis and due to limited financing resources, some governments have also relaxed environmental laws and decreased their national budgets of regulatory mechanisms, which has reduced the enforcement of environmental protection laws (Amador-Jiménez et al. 2020; Vale et al. 2021). Furthermore, national lockdowns and disruption of non-forest economic activities have limited the income of forest-dependent communities,thereby increasing pressure on forest products (Golar et al. 2020; Rahman et al. 2021).
Another issue related to land-use emissions is that about half of the global scenarios analyses and national GHG inventories use different definitions for anthropogenic removals in the land-use sector, resulting in different amounts of net land-use carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions being reported, with a historic difference of up to 4 GtCO2e/year between national GHG inventories and global emission pathway studies (Grassi et al. 2018). The solutions that have been published to account and correct for this discrepancy are integrated in these studies by applying a constant adjustment term over the 2010­ 2030 period.5
4.2.2 NDC and announced pledge scenarios and updates
The NDC and announced pledge scenarios include all the most recent NDCs (new or updated NDCs and previous NDCs for countries where no updates are available) as well as announced climate change mitigation pledges for 2030 that could be linked to updated NDCs and that focus on indicators or targets also included in their NDCs. The estimated impact of revised reduction targets in the new or updated unconditional NDC submissions and announcements lowers the emissions projection of the unconditional NDC scenario by about 4 GtCO2e (about 15 per cent) compared with the previous NDCs. For the conditional NDC scenario including announced pledges, a similar impact is found. This results in a median estimate of global GHG emissions of 52 GtCO2e and 50 GtCO2e, if the unconditional and conditional NDCs are fully implemented. This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than last year's projections (based on previous NDCs, see figure 4.1).
The NDC and announced pledge scenario estimate is based on four model studies (Climate Action Tracker, PBL, JRC and Climate Resource) (Meinshausen et al. 2021),6 all of which include the NDC updates (as at end of August 2021), while only the first three studies consider the impact of the announcements.7,8 In addition, it is based on projections of four model groups (IIASA, the National Institute for Environmental Studies [NIES], the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research [PIK] and Resources for the Future and Euro Mediterranean Center on Climate Change [RFF­CMCC]) that have been adjusted to reflect the impact of the new or updated NDCs and announced pledges.

4.2.3 Mitigation scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement and updates
Emission projections of the latest NDCs and announced pledges scenarios, and updated current policies scenarios are compared to least-cost mitigation scenarios that meet specific temperature targets relative to pre-industrial levels. Here, we categorize emissions pathways from the literature based on their projected peak warming outcomes over the course of this century (Huppmann et al. 2018b, 2018a; Rogelj et al. 2018. See also chapter 3). We define three scenarios that differ in their estimated maximum warming over the course of this century (see table 4.1).
This year, the scenarios have been updated by re-assessing their temperature outcomes based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 6 Working Group I assessment. The temperature outcome of the scenarios is assessed with the reduced-complexity carbon-cycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2011) in a set up that captures the uncertainties in radiative forcing as well as climate and carbon-cycle response (Nicholls et al. 2021) as assessed in cross-chapter box 7.1 of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (Forster et al. 2021).
As a result of the updates, global emissions in 2030 consistent with keeping global warming below 2.0°C with a 66 per cent chance are estimated at 39 GtCO2e, which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in earlier reports. Similarly, the estimate for 1.8°C is about 2 GtCO2e lower than the 1.8°C estimate of previous reports. There are no changes to the 1.5°C estimate (table 4.2). As pathways often assume netnegative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century, the estimated global warming in the year 2100 is typically lower than the maximum warming over the course of the twenty-first century.
4.3 The emissions gap
The emissions gap for 2030 is defined as the difference between global total GHG emissions from least-cost scenarios that keep global warming to 2°C, 1.8°C or 1.5°C with varying levels of likelihood and the estimated global GHG emissions resulting from a full implementation of NDCs and announced reduction pledges. This section updates the gap based on the scenarios described in section 4.2.

Note: Numbers in bubbles are rounded to nearest GtCO2e.

The current policies scenario is estimated to reduce global GHG emissions in 2030 to about 55 GtCO2e (52­58), which is 9 GtCO2e lower than in the year 2010 policies scenario. It is also 4 GtCO2e lower than the median estimate of the current policies scenario of the 2020 UNEP Emissions Gap Report. The implementation gap, which is the difference between emissions expected under the current policies scenario and those needed to achieve the NDCs and announced reduction pledges, is estimated to be 3 GtCO2e and 5 GtCO2e for the unconditional and conditional NDCs and pledge scenarios respectively.
Figure 4.2 illustrates the emissions gap in 2030, highlighting that while the new and updated NDCs together with announced mitigation pledges narrow the gap slightly compared to previous NDCs, they are highly insufficient to bridge the gap. They take only 7.5 per cent off projected 2030 emissions, compared to earlier unconditional NDCs, whereas 30 per cent is needed for 2°C and 55 per cent is

needed for 1.5°C. Figure 4.2 shows that full implementation of unconditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges is estimated to result in a gap to a 1.5°C pathway of 28 GtCO2e (range: 25­30). This is about 4 GtCO2e lower than the gap assessed in the 2020 report (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020), due to the updated NDCs and announced reduction pledges. If the conditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges are also fully implemented, the emissions gap is further reduced by about 3 GtCO2e. The emissions gap between unconditional NDCs and announced reduction pledges and below 2°C pathways is about 13 GtCO2e (range: 10­16 GtCO2e), which is about 2 GtCO2e lower than last year. While NDC and announced mitigation pledges reduce global emissions by about 4 GtCO2e compared with previous NDCs, the updated 2°C scenario estimate for 2030 is about 2 GtCO2e lower than in previous Emissions Gap Reports (section 4.2.3), which means that the gap is only reduced by about 2 GtCO2e.

Estimated global warming over 21st century
Current policies scenario: 2.8°C (66% chance) Unconditional NDC and pledge scenario: 2.7°C (66% chance)
Unconditional NDC and pledge scenario with net-zero targets: 2.2°C (66% chance)

0.0 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 
4.4 Temperature implications of the emissions gap
Neither current policies nor the latest NDCs and announced pledges are consistent with limiting warming to the goal of the Paris Agreement. To understand how far off the mark current policies and NDCs are, estimated emissions for the year 2030 for each of these scenarios are projected out to 2100, and their climate outcomes assessed with a climate model (see box 4.1). This approach assumes a continuation of climate action beyond 2030 without additional strengthening. Extrapolations until the end of the century are inherently uncertain and subject to scenario assumptions such as the level at which climate action continues or technology costs.
This year, the method to extend emissions to 2100 and the climate model set up used was updated based on improved methods and the latest climate assessment of IPCC AR6 Working Group I. These updates alone result in temperature projections that are about 0.2°C lower than in previous Emissions Gap Reports, which should be factored in when comparing the results below with previous estimates. A continuation of the effort implied by the latest unconditional NDCs and announced pledges is at present estimated to result in warming of about 2.7°C (range: 2.2­3.2°C) with a 66 per cent chance.9 This implies a 50 per cent chance that

warming is kept to 2.5°C (range: 2.0­2.9°C) by the end of the century and a 90 per cent chance that it is kept to 3.3°C (range: 2.7­3.9°C). A continuation of conditional NDCs and announced pledges lowers these estimates by about 0.1°C to 2.6°C (2.1­3.1°C), 2.4°C (1.9­2.8°C) and 3.2°C (2.6­3.8°C), respectively. By contrast, a continuation of current policies, which are insufficient to meet the 2030 pledges, increase the estimates by about 0.1°C to 2.8°C (range 2.3­3.3°C), 2.6°C (range 2.1­3.0°C) and 3.4°C (range 2.8­3.9°C), respectively.
Net-zero pledges, which have been announced by many countries (chapter 3), further lower these temperature estimates markedly by about 0.5°C, if fully implemented. Sixty-six per cent, 50 per cent and 90 per cent percentile global warming projections of pathways assuming unconditional NDCs and net-zero targets would then become 2.2°C (2.0­2.5°C), 2.0°C (1.8­2.3°C), and 2.7°C (2.3­3.1°C), respectively. Even with the implementation of current NDCs and all net-zero targets, there is still more than a 15 per cent chance that global warming will exceed 2.5°C by the end of the century, and a just short of 5 per cent chance that it will exceed 3°C (figure 4.3). Finally, these estimated improvements from net-zero targets should also be caveated by the fact that in many cases, current NDCs do not yet set countries' emissions on a direct path towards reaching longer-term net-zero targets (see chapter 3).


Box 4.1. Estimating global warming implications of NDCs

A variety of methods exist to extend near-term emissions until the end of the century (Gütschow et al. 2018). We first estimate the global carbon price implied by the NDC emissions reductions in 2030 from a no-policies baseline. Here, we use the marker quantification of the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, called SSP2, which assumes a continuation of historical socioeconomic dynamics (Fricko et al. 2017; Riahi et al. 2017), to estimate the relationship between emission reductions and implied carbon prices in 2030. Subsequently, the carbon price implied by the global NDC reductions (e.g. globally about US$202010 in 2030 for unconditional NDCs) is extended out until the end of the century by applying the same annual growth rate as for projected global gross domestic product (GDP) under SSP2.
Based on the relationship between implied carbon prices and global GHG emissions levels over the course of the century, an emissions trajectory is estimated and divided into its constituting gases (Lamboll et al. 2020).

Subsequently, the global warming outcome of each pathway is assessed with the reduced-complexity carboncycle and climate model MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2011) in a set up that captures the uncertainties in radiative forcing as well as climate and carbon-cycle response (Nicholls et al. 2021) as assessed in cross-chapter box 7.1 of the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al. 2021). Countries' net-zero targets, described and assessed in chapter 3, further bring down emissions projections over the course of this century (Höhne et al. 2021). The impact of this strengthening of climate action after 2030 is also estimated.
This approach is an update compared to previous reports, both in terms of the method used to extend emissions to 2100 and the climate model set up used. If the NDC estimates of this report are assessed using last year's methods, the temperature projections for unconditional NDCs would be about 0.2°C higher than this year's estimates.

5.1 Introduction
In response to COVID-19, government fiscal investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation can bolster longterm prosperity by creating jobs and accelerating economic growth while also meeting environmental, gender and social objectives. Academic evidence and political narratives support this approach (Barbier 2020; O'Callaghan and Murdock 2021). Countries that fail to capitalize on this opportunity for low-carbon and climate-resilient economic transformation risk their economic prosperity, environmental sustainability and long-term social cohesion.
Despite this, most governments have so far failed to prioritize a transformative low-carbon recovery, with the relatively insignificant low-carbon investment announced to date likely to maintain current unsustainable situations.1 As at May 2021, only 2.5­12.1 per cent of US$16.7 trillion in total COVID-19 spending (excluding unallocated European Union spending) has been low-carbon or had mitigation co-benefits, while of a total US$2.25 trillion in announced COVID-19 `recovery' spending,2 only 17­19 per cent has gone towards low-carbon spending, representing an insufficient commitment to align fiscal policies with the Paris Agreement (Andrijevic et al. 2020; O'Callaghan et al. 2021; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2021; Vivid Economics 2021). A small number of wealthy economies account for the overwhelming majority of low-carbon spending,3 with emerging market

and developing economies in danger of being left behind. Although low-carbon recovery funds have supported a range of initiatives, they have so far been skewed towards clean energy and natural capital investments.
This chapter explores three questions:
1. How could COVID-19-related public spending bridge the emissions gap?
Section 5.2 summarizes key principles for low-carbon public spending in response to the pandemic. The section considers: (i) short-term rescue spending, to keep businesses and people alive; (ii) longer-term recovery investment, to reinvigorate the economy; and (iii) reinforcement processes, to embed new economic trajectories from recovery investment into long-term development plans. Targeted low-carbon rescue spending incentivizes the decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors4 by including low-carbon conditionalities or commitments in liquidity and other short-term business support and/or by sustaining the industries likely to foster low-carbon economic growth (Barbier 2020). Low-carbon recovery investment accelerates the low-carbon transition both directly and indirectly by incorporating low-carbon incentives into traditional investment. Low-carbon reinforcement initiatives build long-term support for the projects and sectors targeted by low-carbon recovery investment, aligning long-term development pathways with a low-carbon and climate-resilient transformation of the economy. At every stage, low-carbon spending and regulatory reforms should be

1 Low-carbon investment is defined in this chapter as spending that is likely to reduce net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 2 Fiscal `recovery' initiatives are defined in this chapter as taxation or expenditure measures that aim to reinvigorate economic growth. Recovery
initiatives are distinct from `rescue' initiatives, which act over the short term and aim to keep businesses and people alive in the face of immediate crisis. 3 China, France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom together account for 77.4 per cent of total low-carbon spending (O'Callaghan, Bird and Murdock 2021a). 4 Hard-to-abate sectors are those in which low-carbon means of production are significantly more expensive or lacking in scalability than traditional means of production. Many of these sectors will require significant technological innovation to enable economically competitive GHG abatement without productivity loss.

considered in tandem, as successful implementation of the latter can amplify the impact of the former.
2. What are the characteristics of fiscal rescue and recovery spending to date and how may they impact the emissions gap?
Section 5.3 shows that low-carbon recovery measures have received only 17­19 per cent of fiscal investment and policy focus to date. Status quo policymaking risks a lock-in and possible expansion of high levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions towards and beyond 2030. While examples of low-carbon investment are numerous and wide-ranging, they largely come from a small set of advanced economies. Long-term human capital development, including skills development, remains underprioritized. Without a substantial pivot towards higher low-carbon investment, countries risk lower economic and social returns, as well as a significant rebound in GHG emissions (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020).
3. Do lower-income nations face greater barriers for lowcarbon recovery spending? If so, what can be done?
Section 5.4 indicates that although emerging market and developing economies have suffered disproportionately under the pandemic and are more exposed to climate risk,

their recovery spending has been low, inhibited by restricted access to affordable finance. A global green recovery will require concessional finance, including direct grants, to vulnerable countries that are significantly above current proposals.5
5.2 How could COVID-19-related public spending bridge the emissions gap?
This section discusses trends in fiscal response towards recovery investment before asking why a low-carbon recovery should be pursued and what it should incorporate.
In the early stages of the pandemic, fiscal packages focused overwhelmingly on `rescue' through the immediate protection of lives, livelihoods and business continuity. As death rates have gradually been controlled in many advanced economies, packages have slowly shifted to incorporate funds for reinvigorating the economy through `recovery spending' (figure 5.1). However, recovery efforts continue to be inhibited by persistent COVID-19 outbreaks in many countries, particularly emerging market and developing economies (International Monetary Fund [IMF] 2020).

5 Concessional finance refers to loans and other financial instruments that are extended on terms substantially more generous than market financial instruments.

Opportunities for rescue spending: Low-carbon rescue spending can ease industrial decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors, through including green incentives in business liquidity support and other short-term support mechanisms (e.g. reduced taxation) and/or by directing support to industries likely to foster green growth (International Renewable Energy Agency [IRENA] 2020).6 These programmes should empower businesses to make cost-efficient choices to transition to carbon neutrality without compromising jobs and livelihoods.
Opportunities for recovery spending: Growing evidence suggests that low-carbon investment can deliver stronger economic returns than conventional stimulus, while strengthening climate mitigation, adaptation, air pollution reduction, natural capital protection,7 health outcomes, inequality reduction, human mobility and broad social progress and prosperity.8 Carbon-intensive recovery packages that grow fossil fuel industries without conditions for a sustainable transition endanger economic returns as fossil fuel assets become devalued with reduced demand for their outputs (Mercure et al. 2018; Ansari and Holz 2020; van der Ploeg and Rezai 2020). An expert survey in Hepburn et al. (2020) identified traditional transport and energy infrastructure investment as the most harmful recovery policies for long-term GHG emissions, although this analysis did not consider armed forces infrastructure spending, which is also harmful compared with others (O'Callaghan, Murdock and Yau 2021).
Some of the most attractive recovery measures for reducing emissions ­ those which balance the potential to spur economic growth in a contractionary environment and the potential to mitigate emissions ­ include electric vehicle incentives and public transport modernization, clean energy infrastructure investments, energy efficiency upgrades, natural capital investments and clean research and development programmes (Barbier 2020; GarrettPeltier 2017; United Kingdom, Climate Change Committee

2020; Hepburn et al. 2020). Continental unions and regional economic commissions of the United Nations have highlighted similar priorities (see appendix B.1). Although the accessibility of these options depends on the development of technological infrastructure and the availability of natural and human resources, input-output modelling indicates that low-carbon investment could generate significantly more jobs and greater economic value than traditional `dirty' and `neutral' alternatives.9 This is true for both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies.
Opportunities for reinforcement spending: The role of low-carbon reinforcement measures following recovery remains largely undiscussed in academic and professional literature. However, as COVID-19 spending becomes integrated intro regulatory budgetary processes, it becomes increasingly less distinguishable from normal `peacetime' spending. Going forward, sustainability-proofing the entire budgetary process and increasing policy coherence across sectors and levels will be crucial to maximize the impact of a low-carbon recovery. This could be achieved through implementing green budget tagging processes (Eltokhy et al. forthcoming) or applying more advanced green public financial management frameworks.
Non-governmental and academic advisers collectively propose at least seven key principles for designing a lowcarbon fiscal response to the pandemic, as summarized in figure 5.2. Consensus opinion suggests that policy design should be consultative, evidence-based and gender-sensitive, while ensuring prompt implementation that is considerate of pandemic realities. Importantly, fiscal action represents only one of several mechanisms available to advance climate action and stimulate economic growth following COVID-19. Regulatory and market interventions, among others, can play a key role.10 Fiscal measures are also likely to prove most effective when combined with appropriate regulatory and market interventions (OECD 2020b).

To support accountability and transparency, low-carbon recovery investment of all kinds should include appropriate management structures for monitoring, reporting and verifying the effective implementation and use of recovery funds (Agrawala et al. 2020), as well as designated funds and standards for ex-post impact assessment. Such measures may also improve understanding of the relative strengths of low-carbon fiscal investment over alternatives.11 Oversight tools, such as the `do no significant harm' principle included in the European Union's Recovery and Resilience Facility regulation, can counter measures that endanger environmental objectives (European Commission 2021).
5.3. What are the characteristics of fiscal rescue and recovery spending to date and how may they impact the emissions gap?
This section provides a high-level assessment of the characteristics of global COVID-19 rescue and recovery spending so far with respect to mitigation.

Across countries and data sources, several primary themes have emerged:
1) Only 2.5 per cent of US$16.7 trillion in total COVID-19 fiscal spending (excluding unallocated European Union spending) has been low-carbon, with only 17­19 per cent of a total US$2.25 trillion in announced COVID-19 recovery spending likely to reduce GHG emissions (O'Callaghan et al. 2021). Seven countries account for almost 90 per cent of this spending: China, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom (figure 5.3). The percentage of recovery spending that is low carbon has slowly increased since Emissions Gap Report 2020 (UNEP 2020), perhaps driven in part by a better understanding of the potential for low-carbon investments to deliver strong economic, environmental and social returns. High-carbon, neutral and unclear spending (87.9­97.5 per cent of total spending) either worsens or maintains the unsustainable status quo of the current global emissions trajectory (O'Callaghan et al. 2021; OECD 2021; Vivid Economics 2021).


2) Low-carbon fiscal investment has covered a wide 3) range of policy types. Over 500 low-carbon rescue and recovery measures have been introduced worldwide, covering most emerging and established low-carbon industries (figure 5.4). The range of spending has been notably wider in advanced economies, with emerging market and developing economies focusing their low-carbon recovery funds on clean energy generation and natural capital investments. Spending on worker retraining initiatives remains low across countries, indicating an insufficient focus on long-term human capital development. A minor portion of investment in what have traditionally been considered `neutral sectors' include accompanying low-carbon incentives
Figur(eap5p.4endix B.2 lists a few examples of this type of
investment).

International disparities are significant in both total spending and low-carbon spending. Some countries are already well into their economic recovery while others have been unable to act at all, constrained by low access to capital and continuing COVID-19 mobility restrictions. Of those who have spent significantly, some have integrated green priorities to a considerable degree, with others having failed to consider environmental concerns in any way. The Global Recovery Observatory has found that Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany and Norway can be considered as `leaders' in low-carbon recovery, with their low-carbon spending as a share of recovery spending ranging between 39 and 75 per cent. Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom also rank highly according to Vivid Economics' Greenness of Stimulus Index.Figure 5.4. Global recovery spending as of May 2021 across sectors by region (US$ billions) Africa Asia Europe Latin America & the Caribbean Northern America

As chapter 2 shows, global emissions dropped in 2020, but are expected to bounce back in 2021. Studies on the impact of announced fiscal investment on global emissions suggest that decisions made so far will maintain the unsustainable trajectory of pre-pandemic economies (Forster et al. 2020; Malliet et al. 2020; Meles et al. 2020; Pollitt et al. 2020; IEA 2021; Shan et al. 2021). In line with the 2020 Emissions Gap Report, the studies suggest that a more carbon-intensive recovery would increase emissions substantially in the medium to long term, while a low-carbon recovery would significantly reduce emissions (see also appendix B.3).

5.4. Do lower-income nations face greater barriers for low-carbon recovery spending? If so, what can be done?
This section describes the disproportionately negative impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable nations. It then discusses the need for significantly increased international aid to simultaneously support economic recovery, long-term economic development and climate priorities.

13 Leaders' are classified as having spent above 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) on fiscal recovery and above 30 per cent of this on lowcarbon measures (O'Callaghan and Murdock 2020). The Greenness of Stimulus Index score is calculated by combining the flow of stimulus into five key sectors with an indicator of each sector's environmental impact (Vivid Economics 2021).

5.4.1. Vulnerable nations are being left behind
The COVID-19 crisis has had an especially negative impact on vulnerable nations: global extreme poverty rose in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years, with an estimated 120 million additional people estimated to be living in poverty due to the pandemic (World Bank 2021a). Foreign direct investment fell by 8 per cent in developing countries in 2020 compared with

2019, driven by a 15.6 per cent decline in Africa and a 45.4 per cent decline in Latin America and the Caribbean (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development [UNCTAD] 2021).14 Despite these trends, COVID-19 spending has been far lower in low-income economies (~US$60 per person) than advanced economies (~US$11,800 per person; see figure 5.5).

Unequal access to finance is a key driver of disparities in COVID-19 spending between high- and low-income nations (O'Callaghan and Murdock 2021).15
In 2020, development partners committed US$89.5 billion to support African nations in response to COVID-19, of which US$59.5 billion has been disbursed (figure 5.6). This represents just 0.4 per cent of total global COVID-19 spending. Without a substantial increase in foreign aid, the difference

in spending between advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies will exacerbate gaps in development, while also restricting progress against climate change. Emerging market and developing economies are also likely to become the world's top GHG emitters if climate finance does not significantly increase (World Resources Institute undated), all while disproportionately suffering the burden of climate change, which has historically been caused by high-income economies (see IMF 2021a).

14 Foreign direct investment refers to cross-border investment where an investor establishes lasting financial interest in and influence over an enterprise domiciled in another economy.
15 Although many advanced countries have announced dramatic increases in expenditure at near- or below-zero financing costs (Blanchard 2019), the same is not true of most emerging market and developing economies. Severe pandemic-induced economic contractions in most emerging market and developing economies have caused a dramatic rise in debt-to-GDP ratios (IMF 2021b), temporarily increased credit default insurance premiums as measured by credit default swap spreads (Council on Foreign Relations [CFR] 2021) and reduced current account balances (World Bank 2021b), leaving emerging market and developing economies in the Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions with historically low credit risk ratings (S&P 2021a; S&P 2021b). Across both advanced economies and emerging market and developing economies, climate change is likely to expose some forms of debt to even more risk, particularly debt to finance climate-exposed investments such as agriculture (Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021; European Central Bank 2021).
5.4.2. How to support vulnerable nations
As in advanced economies, low-carbon investment in emerging market and developing economies has the potential to shorten the duration of COVID-19 impacts, address climate concerns and set strong long-term development pathways. Natural resource endowments in many low-income nations make investments in renewable energy generation facilities and natural capital solutions particularly attractive (Kim 2020). By prioritizing local supply chains, long-term partnerships between emerging market and developing economies and high-income economies can enable sustainable growth and build future-proof infrastructure.

considered for vulnerable countries. Debt relief programmes, including debt-for-climate swaps, could help support lowcarbon recovery and a transition to low-carbon growth.16 A haircut of 10 per cent in debt repayments could result in savings of US$100 billion for reinvestment in low-carbon recoveries (Jensen 2021). Debt restructuring, including private debt, through new bond issuances aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement could help avert a `lost decade' and provide fiscal resources for investment in a low-carbon recovery (Volz et al. 2021).
 Direct grants and concessional finance

Wealthier economies could support vulnerable nations in several ways:
 Debt forgiveness
Based on IMF and World Bank debt sustainability analysis, debt treatments, including debt write-offs, must be

New low-carbon and climate-resilient recovery investments can improve inclusion while advancing progress on the SDGs. Advanced economies can accelerate this by providing resources commensurate with the scale of the required transformation, i.e. significantly more than the commitments agreed at the sixteenth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP16) of US$100 billion per year


 Considerations for carbon border adjustment mechanisms Concessional finance for green and blue bonds
The proceeds of green and blue bond issuances respectively finance environmentally-friendly projects and ocean conservation projects, often unlocking new finance to advance climate goals (Banga 2018; World Bank 2008). Green and blue debt markets are growing in emerging market and developing economies, yet several challenges remain, including only a small pricing benefit of green and blue bonds over regular bonds (Doran and Tanner 2019; Otek Ntsama et al. 2021).17 Foreign monetary authorities and governments could commit to purchasing green and blue bonds at lower interest rates in emerging market and developing economies (Liaw 2020). Robust, standardized and stringent certification and monitoring systems could provide greater credibility for such issuances.
 Guaranteeing private sector debt
The impact of public investment in climate resilience and mitigation can be significantly improved by `crowding-in' additional private sector resources. Blended finance and partial guarantees have a key role in supporting this for emerging market and developing economies, particularly following the pandemic-induced crash in international project finance and other forms of foreign direct investment (UNCTAD 2021).
 Redistributing multilateral finance to vulnerable nations

Carbon border adjustment mechanisms, such as those proposed by the European Union, could provide highly effective trade-based regulations to drive down emissions and reward sustainable supply chains. However, although such mechanisms are primarily intended as protective environmental measures, their unequal trade implications and potentially high burden on vulnerable nations must be acknowledged. If carbon border adjustment mechanisms are implemented, standards and controls must be developed that both support global environmental needs and development priorities of vulnerable nations. These mechanisms (and their standards and controls) must be implemented with significant financial and technical resources to support capacity-building in vulnerable nations (see Gore 2021).
To ensure a successful sustainable and inclusive transition, emerging market and developing countries require significant technology transfer and capacity-building in addition to financial support, needs that should be reflected in updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Support for low-carbon recovery in emerging market and developing economies often relies directly on the nation's demonstrated interest to pursue public policy reforms that are consistent with the Paris Agreement goals, such as, for example, consideration of and action on carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidies reform, green budgeting systems and regulations for financial sector greening.The proposed IMF issuance of US$650 billion in new special drawing rights could strongly support a low-carbon recovery if funds are directed to future-oriented low-carbon and climate-resilient investments. On-lending a substantial amount of such funds to the world's most vulnerable countries could significantly enhance the issuance. Without such an action, only 3.2 per cent of the issuance will be directed to low-income countries (The Economist 2021). While the current IMF call for US$100 billion to be on-lent is positive, it remains insufficient given the extreme disparity in fiscal space between advanced and vulnerable economies. Appendix B5 compares alternative approaches that could be implemented.


6.1 Introduction
Methane emissions are the second largest contributor to global warming to date after carbon dioxide (CO2), accounting for about one third of the warming impact of all well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 45 per cent of the net warming impact of all anthropogenic activities in 2019 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021). Along with black carbon, tropospheric ozone and some hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), methane is a short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP), a class that has much greater warming impacts per ton than CO2, but a much shorter atmospheric residence time. Methane accounts for more than half of the warming of all SLCPs.
Atmospheric observations show that emission growth rates have accelerated over the past 15 years, with methane atmospheric concentrations reaching 1,879 parts per billion in 2020 on annual average, which was 6 per cent higher than in 2000 (Dlugokencky undated) and 260 per cent higher than during pre-industrial times (World Meteorological Organization [WMO] 2020). Anthropogenic emissions account for roughly 60 per cent of total methane fluxes to the atmosphere, amounting to around 365±30 megatons of methane (MtCH4)/year. Approximately 35 per cent come from fossil fuels (two thirds from oil and gas and one third from coal), 40 per cent from agriculture (three quarters from enteric fermentation and manure management and one quarter from rice) and 20 per cent from waste (mostly landfills and solid waste), with the remaining ~5 per cent emitted through biofuel and biomass burning (Saunois et al. 2020).
The remaining roughly 40 per cent of total methane emissions are generated by several natural sources: inland freshwaters

(including wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and rivers), geological releases, wild animals, termites and permafrost. Sectoral partitioning of methane emissions varies greatly among countries/regions and large uncertainties remain in both anthropogenic and natural emissions (figure 6.1). Over the last two decades, the main cause of increasing atmospheric methane is likely increasing anthropogenic emissions, with hotspot contributions from agriculture and waste in South and South-East Asia, South America and Africa, and from fossil fuels in China, the Russian Federation and the United States of America (Jackson et al. 2020). Emissions from natural sources may also be increasing, as wetlands warm, tropical rainfall increases and permafrost thaws.
The size of methane sinks (mainly oxidation in the atmosphere), and how this varies over time, remain difficult to predict and study. Unlike CO2, little attention has been given to capturing methane from the air, and further assessment of the feasibility of methane removal is therefore required (Jackson et al. 2019).
Although methane emission reductions are a necessary part of long-term mitigation strategies alongside CO2 reductions (Rogelj et al. 2018), mitigating methane emissions would especially contribute to reducing climate change-related damages in the near term, while reducing the level of eventual temperature stabilization and decreasing peak warming during this century.
As a result, there has been increased focus in recent years on the immediate need and opportunity to reduce methane emissions. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) released a Global Methane Assessment in May 2021, which analysed the benefits of reducing methane emissions, the


policies and costs of mitigation actions and the reductions needed to meet Paris Agreement goals (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] and Climate and Clean Air Coalition [CCAC] 2021). Several groups have recently analysed abatement potentials for methane, while others have both examined mitigation and described the impacts

of such mitigation on the ability to meet climate targets (Nisbet et al. 2020; Ocko et al. 2021; UNEP and CCAC 2021). The main findings of these studies are assessed below, with some elements highlighted and implications for nationally determined contributions (NDCs) explored.

6.2 Optimizing methane emission reductions
The level of methane emissions (and other short-lived substances) at the time of reaching net zero for long-lived GHGs will play an important role in determining the level at which temperatures stabilize. Methane stabilization at a level greater than the pre-industrial level will mean a longterm commitment to warming relative to the pre-industrial level, whereas changes in methane emissions will contribute further to future temperature changes. As a GHG that does not accumulate semi-permanently in the atmosphere, achieving net-zero methane emissions is not required for

climate stabilization, nor is it expected, in marked contrast to the sum of CO2 and nitrous oxide (N2O), for which net-zero emissions are required for stabilization (Rogelj et al. 2018; see also chapter 3).
Methane abatement would affect warming rates in the near term, resulting in benefits for ecosystems and the ability of humans to adapt. As a precursor of tropospheric ozone,1 which can be toxic to both humans and plants, methane emissions affect public health and crop yields via air pollution. Defining the optimal path for methane emission reductions is therefore arguably more suited to a multiple-benefits analysis than other GHGs, rather than an analysis only defined by a climate metric (though other GHGs may also have co-benefits that affect air pollution and health). Captured methane has a clear use and market value as natural gas. As a result, many methane reduction measures have low or even negative costs, with many models examining least-cost pathways to meet low warming targets reducing methane sharply in the current decade (Harmsen et al. 2019a; UNEP and CCAC 2021), though such reductions are not yet occurring.
Depending on progress in mitigating emissions of long-lived GHGs, rapid reductions of methane are also likely to play a role in limiting peak warming (chapter 3). That role depends heavily on how quickly emissions of CO2 are reduced, how much CO2 removal is deployed, and on the emissions trajectories of other short-lived climate forcers.
6.3 Short- and long-term mitigation potentials
The UNEP and CCAC Global Methane Assessment assessed the methane mitigation potential and cost estimates produced by several teams. This assessment included sector-specific assumptions about technology turnover times, estimates for improvements in technology over time and the achievable pace of regulations. Costs include estimates for the future value of recovered gas as well as the discounting of future returns with rates of 4­10 per cent.
Implementation of readily available methane-targeted abatement measures alongside broader structural and behavioural measures could reduce methane emissions by approximately 180 Mt/year by 2030, which is equal to nearly 50 per cent of current methane emissions. Implementation of readily available methane-targeted measures alone (i.e. excluding structural and behavioural measures) could reduce 2030 methane emissions by around 30 per cent.
The fossil fuel sector shows the largest all-cost (i.e. not restricting the analysis to low or negative net emission control costs) absolute 2030 abatement potential in analyses by three teams (Harmsen et al. 2019b; United States Environmental Protection Agency [U.S. EPA] 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020). Methane emissions from this sector could be reduced by approximately 75 Mt/year (~2.2 gigatons of CO2 equivalent (GtCO2e)/year using global warming potential over 100 years ­ GWP100) in the shortterm (2030) using methane-specific emission abatement measures relative to ~130 Mt/year in projected 2030 business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Within the sector, oil and gas has a substantially larger reduction potential than coal in two of the analyses and roughly equal potential in the third analysis. Based on the Global Methane Assessment, all-cost oil and gas emission mitigation potential is 25­58 Mt/year by 2030 and 35­95 Mt/year by 2050 (relative to projected BAU 2050 emissions of ~155 Mt/year). Averaged over all measures, abatement costs are quite similar for the coal subsector, but vary substantially for the oil

and gas subsector. Restricting the analysis to low cost (< US$600/tCH4; < ~US$20/tCO2e using GWP100) measures only, ~17­32 Mt/year can be abated by 2030 in the oil and gas subsector, compared with ~8­24 Mt/year in the coal subsector. The largest and most cost-effective abatement potentials within the fossil fuel sector for 2030 are to prevent all venting of associated gas during oil and gas extraction (including from inefficient flaring), to install leak detection and repair programmes for natural gas infrastructure and to utilize ventilation air methane oxidation technology in coal mines (table 6.1).
Reducing methane emissions from waste and agriculture will be more challenging but is crucial to achieving low warming targets. For waste, the three analyses assessed in the Global Methane Assessment have very similar 2030 all-cost abatement potentials relative to projected 2030 BAU emissions (~28­32 Mt/year; ~30­35 per cent; ~0.9 GtCO2e/ year using GWP100), but with widely varying cost estimates (+US$3 to -US$200/tCO2e using GWP100). The largest and most cost-effective abatement in the waste sector comes from municipal solid waste, typically either by diverting organic waste from the waste stream or capturing and utilizing landfill gas. More simply, covering landfills with soil is a very effective and low-cost measure, and reduces fires, odours and air pollution. This could be an attractive option for many tropical and subtropical megacities, which typically have extremely large and ill-managed landfills. Crop waste fires are widespread in the tropics, leading to significant air pollution and methane emissions from partial combustion. Such crop waste could instead be burned under controlled conditions to generate electricity or returned to the soil to provide nutrients.
All-cost abatement estimates for rice cultivation have similar abatement potentials (~7­10 Mt/year) but vary markedly in costs (roughly US$3­100/tCO2e using GWP100), whereas low-cost abatement potentials and costs are quite similar across analyses. Abatement within rice cultivation is possible through changes in agricultural production techniques, such as alternate wetting and drying of paddy fields, though the benefits can be undermined by increased N2O emissions (table 6.1). In contrast, all-cost abatement potential estimates for the livestock sector have similar costs (~US$13­30/tCO2e using GWP100) but significantly varied abatement potentials (4 to > 40 Mt/year). These differences are largely attributable to assumptions about the feasibility of some countries being able to switch to higher-yielding livestock breeds. The average abatement potential is therefore smallest in the agriculture sector at ~20­25 per cent. Several less well-established abatement options are also under study for the livestock sector, including feed substitutes and methane inhibitors (UNEP and CCAC 2020; Ocko et al. 2021). At the same time, substantial mitigation of livestock-related methane could be achieved through widespread changes in human dietary choices, possibly reaching 30 Mt/year (~0.9 GtCO2e/year using GWP100) by 2050, with additional CO2 and N2O reductions (Willett et al. 2019; UNEP and CCAC 2021).


For 2050, abatement potentials tend to increase moderately compared with 2030, with the exception of waste and oil and gas in one analysis that shows very large abatement increases. The average abatement potential for waste across the three estimates roughly doubles between 2030 and 2050. Similarly, the average all-cost abatement potential in oil and gas increases to ~80 per cent of the 2050 value, with roughly half of these emission controls available at low net cost. Targeted abatement estimates (without behavioural changes) increase only modestly in agriculture, which is expected to become the main anthropogenic source of emissions in low warming scenarios (e.g. Rogelj et al. 2018). Abatement costs also change, with some of the most noticeable shifts being that oil and gas abatement will become more expensive on average. Changes in livestock abatement costs vary significantly among analyses.
There are additional opportunities to reduce methane beyond methane-targeted abatement measures. These include

fuel switching from natural gas to renewables in electricity generation and in buildings, and behavioural changes such as reduced consumption of cattle-based foods and reduced food waste and loss. Integrated assessment models show large ranges in potential methane mitigation due to these processes. On average, these models indicate that such actions could reduce methane emissions by another 15 per cent beyond the targeted measures, for a total 2030 reduction under 1.5°C scenarios of 45 per cent relative to BAU (UNEP and CCAC 2021). Both the Global Methane Assessment and Ocko et al. (2021) emphasize that fast methane action, as opposed to slower or delayed action, can contribute greatly to reducing midterm (2050) temperatures, i.e. peak warming if long-lived GHG emissions are also controlled. Fast action to reduce methane to a trajectory consistent with 1.5°C scenarios was found to be able to reduce both 2050 and 2100 global mean temperatures, by 0.2­0.4°C and 0.4­ 0.8°C, respectively, compared with a broad set of potential baseline scenarios (UNEP and CCAC 2021).

6.4 Link between methane mitigation and paths to net-zero CO2
There are important links between methane emissions and the path to net-zero CO2. Scenarios with strong climate change mitigation policies include decarbonizing the economy, which would reduce methane leakage from fossil fuel systems due to reduced demand. However, decarbonization will lead to more abandoned oil and gas wells and coal mines, which would need targeted actions to reduce methane emissions that are distinct from direct decarbonization policies (e.g. Kholod et al. 2020). By 2050, methane abatement associated with decarbonization alone is only about 30 per cent of the methane abatement seen under a broad multi-pollutant, multi-policy 2°C scenario, emphasizing the large role played by methane-specific policies.
On a more fundamental physical level, the less methane is reduced, the smaller the available carbon budget will be that is consistent with a given target (e.g. Rogelj et al. 2018). Quantitatively, every ~100 Mt of methane emissions reduced and kept reduced increases the cumulative twentyfirst century carbon budget by around 450 GtCO2.
There are also many linkages between methane reduction actions and opportunities for decarbonization. For example, within land use, the abatement of livestock-related methane typically involves reduced demand for cattle, which then frees up pasture and feed lands for potential production of biofuels or afforestation. Methane-formed surface ozone is known to reduce the growth rate of many plants, affecting both crops (and therefore land use, as a greater area would be required to produce the same yield) and decreasing CO2 uptake by forests (e.g. Sitch et al. 2007). Finally, using organic material from landfills as plastic substitutes could reduce the need for petroleum-based plastics, which could play a role in the transition away from fossil fuels (though likely a modest role), while reducing landfill-related methane emissions. As shown, several methane mitigation pathways also have the potential to contribute to CO2 mitigation.

informed by policy-specific input from national experts, the project developed a range of plausible implementation pathways to achieve the NDCs (Roelfsema et al. 2020). The project also examined a least-cost 2°C scenario (accounting for mitigation costs only, and excluding environmental costs), with reductions starting in 2020 and a 66 per cent chance of staying below 2°C.
According to those estimates, some countries have made pledges that would lead to substantial decreases in their methane emissions by 2030 (table 6.2). Extrapolating countries' NDCs reveals that most are projected to achieve substantially greater reductions by 2050 than 2030. Japan is the exception, showing a smaller reduction in 2050. A group of major emitting countries, including the United States of America, European Union nations, Japan and Canada, have NDCs that will likely result in reductions of ~80­88 per cent of those seen in 2°C least-cost pathways by 2030 compared with 2015, and ~69­77 per cent by 2050. However, most of the world is not yet as close to 2°C pathways, so at the global scale, NDCs are expected to deliver only about a third of 2030 methane reductions expected under 2°C scenarios. Among the major emitting countries analysed, China, the Russian Federation, India and Australia show the greatest emission gaps for methane, with their NDC reductions relative to their 2°C reductions less than the global mean for both 2030 and 2050. Methane reductions in 1.5°C least-cost pathways are 44 per cent at the global level by 2030 compared with 2015, rather than 34 per cent for 2°C. The NDCs are therefore projected to deliver only about one quarter of 2030 reductions in 1.5°C pathways. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) has also carried out analyses of the impact of NDCs on methane for the European Union, which show decreases of 21 per cent by 2030 and 34 per cent by 2050 (relative to 2015), results that are very similar to those shown in table 6.2.

6.5 Methane mitigation in the first NDCs
Many countries present their mitigation pledges for GHG emission reductions in various ways in their NDCs.2 Some emissions targets are not quantitative, while most that are quantitative tend to be provided as aggregated GHGs, which makes it difficult to discern projections for individual gases (at present, individual gases are only reported in national communication submissions by Annex I countries for trajectories based on current policies). The emissions implications of many major emitters' first NDC commitments have been analysed as part of a large international research project. Using a suite of global and national models and

Although there are signs that transformation is taking place in some parts of the world, more ambitious efforts are clearly needed if the world is to aim for 2°C or 1.5°C pathways. In countries or regions with large projected decreases in methane emissions, specific policies have been put into place to achieve such reductions. Examples include the 2016 North American Leaders' Summit agreement to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 40­45 per cent by 2025 (relative to 2012) in Canada, Mexico and the United States of America, the European Union's 2020 strategy to reduce methane emissions (COM/2020/663 final) and the goals of Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire to reduce oil and gas methane emissions by 60­75 per cent by 2030 as part of the UNEP and CCAC Global Methane Alliance. In September 2021, the United States of America and the European Union announced a Global Methane Pledge to reduce anthropogenic methane

emissions by at least 30 per cent globally relative to 2020 levels by 2030. On 11 October 2021, they reported that more than 30 additional countries had committed to joining the Pledge, with coverage now including nine of the top 20 methane emitters globally, and urged others to sign on before the official launch at the twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). There is a clear need for increased ambition almost everywhere, with possible actions that policymakers could consider including increased efforts to build on growing momentum to monitor and address environmental impacts within the private investment community. More transparent data on sector-specific `best practice' methane emissions would help support a market for both monitoring and mitigation services by facilitating the identification of the best-performing companies.


NDCs typically include more information about the energy sector than the agriculture or waste sectors. Every country emits GHGs from municipal waste, which is largely generated by the human population (Eggelston et al. 2006). In NDCs representing 174 countries, 137 included general waste sector mitigation commitments, with 67 citing specific mitigation actions (Powell et al. 2018). The most common mitigation action was improved landfilling, followed by converting waste into energy (e.g. incineration and conversion of landfill gas into energy). Improvements in waste management systems could provide public health co-benefits, such as reducing hazards associated with wastewater mismanagement, improving air quality and diminishing land and water contamination (Mittal et al. 2017; Cohen et al. 2021).
Agricultural methane emissions primarily derive from animal stocks and rice cultivation, as well as deliberate biomass burning, factors that vary widely from country to country (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021). In their first NDCs, 32 countries referred to `climate-smart agriculture', with aims to optimize agricultural systems to increase productivity and incomes, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emissions (Strohmaier et al. 2016). However, countries rarely included quantitative targets for reducing agricultural methane emissions (Hönle et al. 2019). In fact, of the top 46 countries that contribute to 90 per cent of global agricultural emissions, only a quarter included broadly-stated measures targeting emissions from ruminant livestock. This may be due to relatively high abatement costs and the impact such measures may have on economically important sectors such as beef and dairy. Mitigation measures such as sustainable intensification of rice cultivation were more likely to be included, in part because they present clear co-benefits for modernization or productivity (Hönle et al. 2019). The magnitude of agricultural methane emissions suggests that agriculture should receive more attention than it currently does in methane mitigation strategies, and that strategies that include changes in consumption through a food systems approach will need to be considered (Tubiello et al. 2021). Setting quantitative goals for cropland and livestock management, which could come in the form of targets for best practices, would help countries raise their ambition in this sector.
6.6 Measurement-based verification of uncertain emission reporting
In many cases, methane mitigation efforts are hampered by uncertainties relating to actual emission numbers, making it important to urgently improve approaches for measuring and reporting emissions. Improved monitoring at the facility level could serve to motivate action to reduce emissions and to verify the effectiveness of such action. This would open up opportunities for regulators to use flexible policy instruments that directly target measurable

emission reductions compared with more prescriptive best available technology standards. Effectively prioritizing methane sources, reducing methane emissions and tracking mitigation progress necessitates a broad suite of measurement-based technologies that draw on the unique advantages of each.
Traditional bottom-up approaches, based on source-specific emission factors combined with statistical activity data (for example, livestock numbers, amount of oil and gas extracted), have inherent uncertainties that can be large at the national/sectoral scale (figure 6.1), especially for nonAnnex 1 countries with limited institutional capacity and data availability (Solazzo et al. 2021). Even in countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom, which have well-established emission reporting systems, methane inventories have been revised by up to 60 per cent between subsequent submissions (Bergamaschi et al. 2010).
New top-down approaches have been developed that use atmospheric observations (at the surface, airborne or from satellites), which when combined with atmospheric transport models, can be applied to determine emissions for a specific facility, sector, region or other aggregation. These top-down approaches have proven effective in correcting emission factors and in revising sectoral methane emissions in multiple geographies (e.g. Alvarez et al. 2018; Zavala-Araiza et al. 2021), and in this way have provided opportunities for identifying specific sources and mitigation opportunities (Lyon et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2017).
Top-down approaches can also support the transparency of reporting processes, with the updated IPCC reporting guidelines recommending the application of such approaches as additional quality control (Bartram et al. 2019). However, at present, only Switzerland and the United Kingdom include top-down methane estimates in an annex to their national inventory reports (Manning et al. 2011; Henne et al. 2016).
New observational capabilities are revealing emission hotspots and facility- or city-scale emissions through measurements from cars, drones and aircraft, and satellite remote sensing, especially in remote world regions, which in at least a few cases has led to industry action to eliminate major emission point sources (Nisbet et al. 2020). However, at a larger scale, top-down methods depend highly on the density of observations and are challenged by the difficulty in disentangling different sources and separating natural emissions from anthropogenic emissions, which is crucial for many countries with large natural emissions. Compared with high-frequency in situ surface measurements, satellite observations have a broader coverage but less sensitivity to methane sources, and are limited by cloud coverage. Further deployment of mobile measurements and fixed stations should therefore be supported to better monitor methane concentrations, especially over tropical and boreal regions.

Emissions Gap Report 2021: The Heat Is On In the near future, wider use of top-down approaches will be facilitated by a new International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) hosted by UNEP. The International Energy Agency (IEA) Methane Tracker (2020) already includes data on leaked methane of super emitters, which is detected by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), with a new generation of satellites, such as GHGSat (Varon et al. 2020), being specifically designed to map and quantify point sources.
7.1. Introduction: The role of carbon markets and current status
In the Paris Agreement, cooperation among countries is considered a way to both implement nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and promote greater ambition, while also fostering sustainable development and encouraging broad participation from the private and public sectors. Market mechanisms are therefore seen as an important component in collective action to achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement. In principle, the role of markets within the context of the agreement is to enable all parties engaged in mitigation actions to implement these in a cost-effective manner, while simultaneously providing an opportunity to enhance their ambition.
Under article 6, the Paris Agreement provides for an international framework for market mechanisms to enable greater ambition in both mitigation and adaptation actions (Bodansky et al. 2016). It also allows countries to voluntarily cooperate to achieve their NDCs, ""promote sustainable development and ensure environmental integrity and transparency"" (article 6.2), so long as parties avoid double counting mitigation outcomes. The fact that 87 per cent of new and updated NDCs specify countries' intentions to possibly use voluntary cooperation under article 6 (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021) confirms a significantly increased interest in this approach, compared with previous NDCs.

Although article 6 established these principles, the rules that facilitate their implementation in practice are still the subject of negotiations, including guidance for cooperative approaches (article 6.2), which covers all forms of international mitigation markets, the rules for a mechanism (article 6.4), and a framework and work programme to promote non-market cooperation (articles 6.8 and 6.9). These rules, modalities and procedures are an anticipated key outcome of the of twenty-sixth United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26).
There is already considerable experience in designing and implementing market mechanisms to control pollutants, including different forms of carbon markets (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017; Michaelowa et al. 2019a; World Bank 2021a). The current state of carbon markets is very diverse. Such markets include both voluntary and compliancedriven programmes, which are used both domestically and internationally to reduce emissions, and involve different types of allowances and credits and both public and private sector entities as buyers and sellers (box 1, figure 7.1).


Box 7.1. Current state of carbon markets

Compliance carbon markets are marketplaces in which participants act in response to an obligation established by a regulatory body. The most prominent examples of such markets are national or regional emissions trading systems. In national emissions trading systems, governments set a cap on the aggregate level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that regulated entities can emit over a period of time. These entities are required to submit an emission permit (or allowance) for each ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) they emit. Emissions trading systems can be restricted to domestic borders or may have international elements through links with other emissions trading systems (e.g. the European Union, the European Union-Swiss link and the California-Quebec link) and/or the acceptance of international offsets (e.g. the Republic of Korea's Emissions Trading Scheme ­ K-ETS).
In voluntary carbon markets, participants are under no formal obligation to achieve a specific target. Instead, companies, private entities and national governments seek to voluntarily offset their emissions, for example, as part of a social responsibility strategy. Voluntary buyers can procure domestic or international carbon credits

from various different crediting programmes, as well as allowances from compliance markets (Doda et al. 2021).
Compliance carbon markets have historically generated more mitigation action and stronger incentives for decarbonization than voluntary carbon markets, though they may face more political opposition and entail higher regulatory burdens. Voluntary carbon markets can be an important tool to mobilize the private sector and expand the reach of carbon markets beyond sectors and regions subject to explicit climate regulation.
In terms of structure, domestic carbon markets have the advantage of normally allowing better oversight and control through full regulatory control by a relevant authority, with little risk of spillover effects from other systems or jurisdictions, and all mitigation benefits accrued domestically. Adding international elements to markets will increase their complexity, but also presents a significant advantage of potentially reducing compliance costs by making use of cheaper mitigation opportunities in other jurisdictions.

Experiences from these various markets and approaches provide important learnings for the design of new cooperative approaches. This chapter initially provides an assessment of the potential role of market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement in both the near term and in achieving long-term climate goals (section 7.2), then examines technical issues that have implications for the effective implementation of article 6 (section 7.3), and finally discusses actions that can be taken to unlock market potentials and enhance ambition (section 7.4).
7.2. The potential role of international carbon markets under the Paris Agreement: near-term versus netzero implications
7.2.1. Near-term implications NDCs define the mitigation contribution of each party to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. Countries have prepared their NDCs using different target types and metrics ranging from reductions in all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to a fixed emissions level (e.g. a 50 per cent reduction in all GHGs in 2030 relative to 2005), to specific actions such as planting a specific number of trees by a specific date, to conditional contributions that apply only if an additional condition is met (Hood and Soo 2017). The heterogenous nature of the current NDCs in this way creates challenges for both negotiating and establishing

effective real-world markets, as well as the risks of double counting, emission leakages and unattainable targets.
There is growing interest from countries in using markets and voluntary cooperation to implement their NDCs. As of 30 July 2021, the share of parties that indicated an intention or possibility of using voluntary cooperation has nearly doubled, from 44 to 87 per cent in the new or updated NDCs, compared with previous NDCs. Moreover, the share of parties that have set qualitative limits on voluntary cooperation, such as using certain standards and guidelines to ensure additionality and avoid double counting, has increased from 19 to 39 per cent (UNFCCC 2021).
The existing quantitative literature that estimates the maximum potential gains from cooperation generally assumes that the heterogeneous NDCs could be translated into a common comprehensive, transferable emissions mitigation metric. This is evidently not something that is going to happen quickly, if at all, and the results must therefore be interpreted as estimates of potential gains from cooperation compared with independent implementation of the same targets. These studies do not include ancillary domestic benefits that may have motivated countries' choice of NDC target methods.
A relatively limited number of studies have so far provided quantification of the gains from cooperative implementation of NDC pledges (e.g. Fujimori et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017; Edmonds et al. 2019; Böhringer et al. 2021; Edmonds et al.


2021). With the aim of achieving the current NDC ambition through global cooperation, most models estimate a global carbon price of US$9­38/tCO2 between 2025 and 2030.1 In contrast, the studies find that due to the varying stringency in NDCs, the shadow price of carbon for a country to independently and cost-effectively achieve its unconditional NDC pledge by 2030 ranges from US$0/tCO2 to over US$250/tCO2 across models and studies (with each study analysing then-current NDC pledges), highlighting the potential gains through international emissions trading. As a result, the estimated mitigation costs by 2030 in an ideal situation could be reduced by 40­60 per cent through the full use of market mechanisms (Aldy et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017; Edmonds et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021). Although there are uncertainties associated with economic modelling, results in all studies suggest significant potential cost reductions and economic gains from using market mechanisms. These results provide a strong incentive for countries to negotiate a credible agreement on article 6 and to move towards more compatible NDCs over time.
The modelling studies estimate that around 4­5 GtCO2e could be traded per year by 2030 with a market volume of US$60­100 billion per year if NDCs are transformed into tradable emission mitigation actions (Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021). Net market transactions constitute balance-of-trade changes and therefore changes to participants' gross domestic product (GDP) and/or exchange rate position. For selling regions, this would represent a potentially significant new net export (Piris-Cabezas et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021; Kachi et al. 2020). The extent to which this will actually occur is very uncertain, with many parties emphasizing domestic implementation and mentioning flexible mechanisms as an additionality in their NDCs.
Carbon markets shift both emission mitigation actions and emission mitigation investments from buyers to sellers. Provided that sellers are primarily developing countries, carbon markets have the potential to transfer emission mitigation-related capital towards developing economies, help prevent lock-ins to carbon-intensive infrastructure and contribute to capacity-building to further reduce emissions. Redistributing capital investments potentially carries implications for other sustainability metrics, such as local air quality, forest conservation, rural livelihoods, food prices, water quality and energy access, as well as for the regional distribution of incentives for technology development and innovation.
While increasing emission mitigation innovations in selling regions, carbon markets could reduce incentives in buying regions. In buying regions with greater capacity to

develop capital-intensive emission mitigation technologies, the overall pace of technological change that favours emissions mitigation could be reduced if ambitions are not increased at the same time. However, under different policy designs, near-term flexibility facilitated by low-cost mitigation options, such as reducing tropical devastation, can free resources to boost investments into research and development and yield improved technologies in the longer term (Szolgayová, Golub and Fuss 2014; Koch et al. 2017).
Studies of potential emissions mitigation with international markets indicate that land-use emission mitigation opportunities are undertaken earlier than under independent NDC implementation (Edmonds et al. 2021). By valuing land-use change emissions, international carbon markets can also provide incentives to prevent deforestation and increase afforestation and reforestation (Lubowski and Rose 2013; Fujimori et al. 2016; Edmonds et al. 2019; PirisCabezas et al. 2019; Edmonds et al. 2021; Fuss, Lubowski and Gulub 2021).
The need for an interlinked implementation of climate goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is being increasingly recognized at the political level to enhance synergies and maximize co-benefits. However, tools and approaches to assess and report on sustainable development impacts of article 6 cooperative approaches are lacking and remain an unresolved topic in negotiations (Olsen, Arens and Mersmann 2018; Kachi and Mooldijk 2020). Similarly, there are unresolved issues about how the use of cooperative approaches can be designed to contribute to financing adaptation in vulnerable countries with limited potential for direct participation.
7.2.2. Net-zero implications For climate change to stabilize, global anthropogenic net emissions must decline to zero (chapter 3). As of 13 September 2021, 50 parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have announced net-zero targets, of which five parties have explicitly indicated their intent to use international trading to achieve their net-zero pledges. In addition, a growing number of non-State and subnational actors have made net-zero pledges with trading considered.
When global net carbon emissions start to approach zero, carbon market conditions will be very different to how they are currently. Reducing global carbon emissions to net zero involves reducing carbon emissions to near zero in all sectors in all regions, with emissions that remain positive being offset by so-called negative emissions or carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (see chapter 3). This suggests that the overall scope for transactions in physical (i.e. tons of CO2 ­ tCO2) will shift towards negative emissions over time.

1 The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) 2.0 ADVANCED analysis from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C database estimates a substantially higher value of carbon price (US$73/tCO2) by 2030.


The marginal cost of removing the final tons of CO2 from some hard-to-abate sectors and regions could become high, implying that transactions that occur could be very valuable.
As discussed in chapter 3, net-zero pledges across countries and organizations have different timings, sectoral coverage, gas coverage and legal statuses. In addition to the challenges discussed in section 5.3, ambiguity of net-zero targets creates additional barriers to using market mechanisms to achieve net-zero targets. Further complexity arises from uncertainty in how to treat the various forms of CO2 removal (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019) in carbon markets. Some carbon markets (Australia, Colombia, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea, and California, Alberta and China's regional systems) already recognize the role of nature-based removal credits and the long-term importance of bringing emission sources and sinks into a common market framework aimed at achieving net-zero emissions (La Hoz Theuer et al. 2021).
To reach global net-zero emissions, countries with emissions greater than zero may need to be balanced by countries with negative emissions. Almost all global net-zero scenarios assessed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on global warming of 1.5°C and Fifth

Assessment Report databases have similar marginal costs across world regions, which implicitly assume international cooperation to achieve global net-zero scenarios. Van Soest et al. (2021) examined cost-optimal emission phase-out years, without fairness considerations, for both 1.5°C and 2°C targets across six integrated assessment models. Their findings revealed significant variations in the timing in which countries reached net-zero emissions, which indicates that there is potential for using market mechanisms to achieve a global net-zero goal.
The magnitude, value and patterns of emissions trading to reach a global net-zero target are dynamic and depend on several factors, such as the use of CO2 removal technologies and the timing of reaching net zero in each region (Yu et al. 2021). Market size, for example, reaches US$300­400 billion in 2030 and around US$1 trillion in 2050 in scenarios with different net-zero timings. Studies have found that land resources also play an important role (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2018; Yu et al. 2021). Removal credits by technology-based CO2 removal approaches could play an increasingly important role to achieve net-zero emissions but will be limited by the global removal capacity of these technologies (Allen et al. 2020; La Hoz Theuer et al. 2021).

Box 7.2. Enhancing ambition through carbon markets

The main goal of article 6 of the Paris Agreement is to enable parties to increase their ambition towards achieving the agreement's long-term goals. Many researchers have documented that the initial nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to be aligned with trajectories to reach the long-term Paris Agreement goals (Fawcett et al. 2015; United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020). However, recent studies by Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019) and Edmonds et al. (2021) have shown that if the savings from more cost-effective global implementation of NDCs were redeployed towards increased ambition, global emission reductions could be roughly doubled over the next decade at no added cost to parties compared with parties acting alone to implement their commitments (figure 7.2). A major part of the potential ambition increases derives from natural climate solutions, notably forests. Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019) estimate that this doubling of climate ambition provides about two thirds of the reductions necessary to get on a 2°C pathway through 2035, closing about half of the current gap without any added cost compared with parties acting independently. Although these calculations are evidently speculative, they highlight both the potential power of carbon markets and how far NDCs need to be enhanced to capture that potential.

Carbon markets do not create ambition for parties. Rather, they create conditions that make enhanced ambitions more attractive through the implicit incentive that emissions mitigation is cost-effective, thereby lowering political and stakeholder resistance to tightening targets and facilitating emission reductions and strengthened targets over time. Experience from the world's current major emissions trading systems supports this approach (Parker 2019). Emissions within trading systems have always fallen faster and at a lower cost than initially expected (Haites 2018). Periods of low prices have been followed by a period of policy reassessment and more ambitious targets, as seen under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and California's cap-and-trade programme.
Various explicit mechanisms have been proposed to increase ambition. These include, for example, taxing or `cancelling' a portion of emission mitigation trades. Under a fixed emissions budget, such schemes could increase overall emissions abatement in the near term. However, according to Piris-Cabezas et al. (2019), such an approach applied on a per transaction basis functions as a type of tariff on mitigation exports and hinders the ability of markets to deliver cost-effective mitigation. In the long term, this prevents markets from lowering costs and thereby from facilitating increases in ambition.


7.3 Using market mechanisms under article 6
Although there is potential for international carbon markets to reduce costs to achieve NDC goals and increase ambition, such potential will remain unknown until important details are determined under article 6. These include establishing robust rules to ensure environmental integrity, including the avoidance of double counting, capacity-building and the management of potential carbon leakages.
7.3.1. Getting the accounting right To avoid double counting the same emission reductions/ removals, the Paris Agreement requires parties participating in article 6.2 cooperative approaches to apply `corresponding adjustments', i.e. adjusting the balance of their emissions or removals covered by their NDCs to reflect internationally transferred mitigation outcomes.
To ensure environmental integrity under article 6.4, parties are negotiating the application of corresponding adjustments, though their implementation is being complicated by the diverse scope and formulation of the parties' NDC pledges (Greiner et al. 2019; Asian Development Bank 2020). Parties have different views on how to define the scope of NDCs, for example, whether to define them in terms of sectors, gases and/or policies and measures. There is also disagreement over whether corresponding adjustments should be required for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of selling countries' NDCs.

Many NDCs only include single-year targets, such as 2025 or 2030, which raises the question of how to treat noncompliance years when accounting for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes. Several accounting methods have been put forward to address this challenge (Greiner et al. 2019; Lo Re and Vaidyula 2019; Asian Development Bank 2020).
7.3.2. Trade when the basic policy environment lacks a fixed emissions limit
Target setting in the NDCs is still very heterogeneous. Some NDC emission mitigation targets (Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Vaidyula and Hood 2018; Schneider et al. 2019) are expressed in non-GHG terms, such as energy efficiency and forestry, while others are framed as intensity targets and/or targets relative to projected business-asusual (BAU) emissions. Uncertainties in BAU emission projections may weaken the actual ambition of mitigation targets (Hood, Briner and Rocha 2014; Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Hood and Soo 2017; Vaidyula and Hood 2018; and Rocha and Ellis 2020). The scope of NDCs also differ in terms of sectors and GHGs: some cover all sectors and all GHGs, some have more limited coverage and others are unclear and only include indicators, such as policies and measures.
The lack of a fixed emissions limit in many NDCs makes accounting complex. Some researchers have recommended the use of economy-wide absolute emission targets for all NDCs to facilitate robust accounting and reduce complexity


(Graichen, Cames and Schneider 2016; Schneider et al. 2019). Although this is not likely to happen anytime soon, parties could be requested to provide clearer and more transparent NDC targets as a potential short-term step. For this purpose, the Katowice Climate Package includes detailed provisions on how countries should describe or clarify the scope of their NCDs. However, some provisions of this package are only mandatory for second and subsequent NDCs or require countries to provide relevant information by 2024 (Schneider et al. 2020).
The treatment of mitigation outcomes generated outside the scope of NDCs is an important issue in negotiations. The main advantages of allowing emission reductions outside the scope of NDCs include the full utilization of mitigation potential, reduced mitigation costs, improved data quality of uncovered sectors and the facilitation of their inclusion into future NDCs (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Schneider et al. 2020). Disadvantages include disincentives to enhancing the scope of NDCs, a lack of fairness, scrutiny and quality assurance, and double-counting risks (Spalding-Fecher 2017; Howard 2018; Warnecke et al. 2018; Hood 2019; Michaelowa et al. 2019b; Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019; Schneider et al. 2020).
Many options have been raised to address the above cited concerns, such as applying corresponding adjustments regardless of NDC scope, bringing relevant sectors and GHGs into the scope of next NDCs, imposing international oversight on the quality of NDCs and restrictions on the number of and deadline for achieving internationally transferred mitigation outcomes, quantifying NDC targets in terms of GHG emissions and specifying the scope of NDCs (Marcu et al. 2017; Mizuno 2017; Spalding-Fecher 2017; Howard 2018; Greiner et al. 2019; Warnecke et al. 2018; Schneider and La Hoz Theuer 2019; Schneider et al. 2020). Care needs to be taken in framing such offset programmes so that macroscale outcomes deliver the intended aggregate emissions mitigation. Calvin et al. (2015) showed that well-intentioned offset programmes have the potential to inadvertently lower overall ambition.

7.4 The way forward
One possible outcome of COP26 is that initial article 6 rules will be agreed upon, with the intention that they be improved gradually over time and strengthened through other market arrangements. This has been the case for other parts of the Paris Agreement. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be a useful reference in this regard, as despite receiving many criticisms, it has played a crucial role in facilitating or enhancing many countries' mitigation efforts. In many developing countries, the capacities developed through participation in the CDM (e.g. to measure and verify emissions) have helped them prepare their initial NDCs. In some countries, such as China and the Republic of Korea, participation in the CDM provided valuable lessons and capacities for establishing domestic carbon markets.
Success of the Paris Agreement market arrangements will require the establishment of solid managerial, technical and institutional capacity. Parties participating in article 6.2 will need to jointly agree on a cooperative framework for emission reductions, decide how to establish domestic modalities and procedures to complete the authorization, quantification, monitoring, verification and reporting of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes and make corresponding adjustments after the transfer of these outcomes (World Bank 2021b). Participation in the article 6.4 mechanism will be more demanding for host parties than the CDM, as it will involve documenting transparent reductions, as well as showing additionality to their NDCs and supporting sustainable development.

Although some of the proposed options are ideal in theory, they may lack political feasibility. Many parties have been concerned by potential limitations on article 6 participation and threats to the bottom-up nature of NDCs.

Key Messages

1 2 3 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for emission reductions are clear. In order to keep temperature rise close to the Paris Agreement goal of 1.5°C we must achieve net zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The scenarios show that this will require, in addition to a massive and rapid decarbonization, a significant contribution from landbased options. Nature-based solutions provide the best way of delivering these land-based options, through protection, restoration and sustainable management of natural carbon sinks and reservoirs. Moreover, there is additional mitigation potential from nature-based solutions in coastal and marine ecosystems.
A cautious interpretation of the existing evidence, taking account of associated uncertainties and the time needed to deploy safeguards, indicates that by 2030,nature-based solutions implemented across all ecosystems can deliver emission reductions and removals of at least 5 GtCO2e per year, of a maximum estimate of 11.7 GtCO2e per year. By 2050, this rises to at least 10 GtCO2e per year, of a maximum estimate of 18 GtCO2e per year. This is a significant proportion of the total mitigation needed.
Approximately 62 per cent of this contribution is estimated to come from nature-based solutions related to forests, about 24 per cent from solutions in grasslands and croplands, and 10 per cent from additional solutions in peatlands. The remaining 4 per cent will come from solutions implemented in coastal and marine ecosystems. The balance of actions to `Protect, Manage and Restore' different ecosystems will vary.
This contribution by nature-based solutions will require adherence to strict social and environmental safeguards to avoid harm. Much careful work has already been undertaken on the formulation of such safeguards. This is reflected in tools such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions, and in more ecosystem-specific instruments such as the Cancun safeguards for REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks). The implementation of these safeguards should be undertaken with equal care and determination.

5 6 7 Countries frequently reference nature-based solutions for mitigation in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to combating climate change and its effects. The 100 NDCs reviewed for this report showed a greater focus on actions in forest than in other ecosystems, and there were slightly more commitments to Manage and Restore than to Protect carbon stocks in ecosystems.
Nature-based solutions, when done well, can deliver many different benefits, including for climate change adaptation and biodiversity conservation. They should therefore be planned, designed and implemented so as to deliver those benefits.
The contribution from nature-based solutions needs additional finance. This will require action by and close coordination between public and private actors. It is essential that where the private sector purchases nature-based solutions offsets as part of its pathways to achieve net zero, these offsets are in accordance with social and environmental safeguards and, moreover, are a small part of a wider mitigation strategy focused primarily on deep decarbonization. The development of rules and guidance in this area is now underway.
The value and importance of nature needs to be better reflected in economic and political decision-making and in a stronger integration between the biodiversity, climate change and development agendas. Failure to achieve this will exacerbate climate change and other important societal challenges, and the Sustainable Development Goals will not be achieved.

1 Introduction

The need to mitigate climate change, and the role that nature can play in doing so, are recognized under multilateral agreements, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). However, we are collectively on a path towards failing to meet the UNFCCC's Paris Agreement commitment to limit warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C, as well as CBD targets on biodiversity. So far, human activities have been responsible for a global mean temperature rise of nearly 1.1°C relative to 1850­ 1900 levels. If we continue on the current course, it is increasingly likely that the 1.5°C limit will be exceeded in the next 20 years (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] 2021).
Immediate, far-reaching action to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions and remove CO2 from the atmosphere is necessary if the worst consequences of climate change are to be avoided. Transformative changes of a type never before attempted are required (Pörtner et al. 2021). The 2020 Emissions Gap Report showed that countries need to collectively increase their mitigation ambitions ""threefold to get on track to a 2°C goal and more than fivefold to get on track to the 1.5°C goal"" (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP] 2020, p.21). A key action needed to achieve these goals is decarbonizing our economy ­ radically reducing and eliminating emissions from fossil fuels in energy generation, industry and transport.

While nature-based solutions are a necessary complement to decarbonization, they can only be relied upon when combined with rapid, wide-ranging emissions reductions from energy, industry and transport. Without this dual approach, the total mitigation achieved will be insufficient to avoid climate-related risks (such as changes in temperature and rainfall) that reduce the ability of nature-based solutions to contribute to climate change mitigation (Pörtner et al. 2021).
Despite growing political support for the use of nature-based solutions in climate change mitigation, a number of concerns have been raised. These include: uncertainties about the scale of the contribution, especially given challenges with implementation and financing; doubts about whether the necessary safeguards will be put in place; and worries about the use of offsets by the private sector. This report will assess the current state of knowledge on the size of the contribution thatnature-based solutions can make and the types of action they will involve. It will discuss the importance of social and environmental safeguards, hownature-based solutions can be financed and the role of offsets. Most importantly, it will consider the potential of nature-based solutions for mitigation to also contribute to climate adaptation and other pressing challenges.

All IPCC mitigation pathways consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C involve, in addition to decarbonization, very significant changes in current land-use trajectories to tackle and reverse these emissions. Although the IPCC does not call them `nature-based solutions', these pathways do include actions of this type, including a halt to deforestation. Achieving the Paris Agreement target of 1.5°C will therefore require a significant contribution from nature-based solutions, as well as the rapid decarbonization of our economies.

2 What are nature-based solutions?

This report uses the definition of nature-based solutions adopted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) at its 2016 World Conservation Congress. According to this definition, nature-based solutions are ""actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits""1 (IUCN 2016). The definition does not include `nature-derived' solutions, such as the use of wind, wave and solar energy, or `nature-inspired' solutions, such as design of materials modelled on biological processes (IUCN 2020a). Further, the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions includes eight specific criteria2 and 28 indicators, intended to enable the coherent design, execution and evaluation of nature-based solutions (IUCN 2020b), while complementary guidelines3 (Seddon et al. 2021) have been adopted by the `Together With Nature' campaign4. Well-designed and -implementednature-based solutions deliver multiple benefits, enabling synergies and minimizing trade-offs in achieving different global development objectives as set out in the Sustainable Development Goals. Nature-based solutions can simultaneously address societal challenges, including climate change mitigation and adaptation, natural disasters, human health, food and water security, and biodiversity loss. This potential has encouraged widespread adoption of the concept, including in resolutions by the G7, the G20, the United Nations General Assembly, and in international dialogues and private sector guidance (World Business Council for Sustainable Development [WBCSD] 2020; UNEP 2021a).
While some nature-based solutions are primarily intended to contribute to climate mitigation, others may provide mitigation as an additional benefit to their main goal. Given the ability of nature-based

solutions to contribute to more than one goal, in practice the distinction between these different types of solutions is not always clear. Nevertheless, in the context of climate action, the specific concept of nature-based solutions for mitigation is useful, as it highlights the differences between this solution and other approaches to mitigation. In line with the overall IUCN definition, nature-based solutions for mitigation include actions to protect natural ecosystems from loss and degradation, restore ecosystems that have been degraded, and more sustainably manage working lands such as fields and managed forests. These three categories encompass many specific types of action ­ or `response options', as they are commonly known ­ ranging from Avoided Forest Conversion to Improved Rice Cultivation. Together, they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions arising from the loss, degradation and mismanagement of ecosystems, and increase natural CO² sequestration.
A related concept is that of `natural climate solutions' (Griscom et al. 2017), described as a subset of nature-based solutions focused on climate change mitigation (Girardin et al. 2021), though there is one difference in the way that these two concepts are often understood. The IUCN Global Standard expects all nature-based solutions to have a net positive impact on biodiversity, and to include and empower all affected stakeholders with mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status. In contrast, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) suggests that, as a minimum, natural climate solutions need only result in zero net loss for biodiversity, although it does encourage ""high-quality"" natural climate solutions that are ""netpositive for nature and biodiversity, and also support people and local communities"" (WBCSD 2020, p.4).
A consequence of the IUCN definition of nature-based solutions used here is that a number of land uses,

1This definition is closely aligned with European Commission (EC) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definitions, which also reference economic dimensions (OECD 2020; EC 2021), with the EC adding a focus on building resilience. 2 Criteria: (1) effectively address societal challenges; (2) design is informed by scale; (3) result in a net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; (4) economically viable; (5) based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes; (6) equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits; (7) managed adaptively, based on evidence; (8) sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context. 3 The Nature-based Solutions to Climate Change guidelines were originally developed in February 2020 as a letter to the President of CoP26, Alok Sharma, to encourage other Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to adopt these solutions. Available at:  and in Seddon et al. (2021). 4 The `Together With Nature' campaign, a call to corporate leaders to commit to four principles for investing in nature-based solutions, adopted the Nature-based Solutions to Climate Change guidelines in May 2020.

including some that feature in the aforementioned IPCC mitigation pathways, do not qualify asnature-based solutions. One such land use involves the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology `bioenergy with carbon capture and storage' (BECCS), which, to date, exists only in pilot projects. This technology uses bioenergy instead of fossil fuels for power generation, and stores the emissions in underground geological formations. BECCS features in the IPCC pathways at a very large scale, and it is therefore essential that land-demanding measures of this type deliver positive overall outcomes, including for food security, poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. However planting bioenergy crops (trees, perennial grasses or annual crops) for BECCS over a large share of land is harmful to natural ecosystems and their services, and competes with food production for both land and water (Harper et al. 2018; Fajardy et al. 2019; Pörtner et al. 2021; Stenzel et al. 2021).
Nature-based solutions that absorb carbon from the atmosphere are sometimes considered alongside more industrial carbon dioxide removal options including BECCS, direct air capture and storage of CO², and enhanced weathering of crushed silicate rocks (Field and Mach 2017). For any of these latter options to make a significant contribution to mitigation they would need to be scaled up dramatically from current trials. Not only do we have much more practical experience with nature-based solutions, but their capacity to deliver multiple benefits far outweighs that of these industrial options.
How much can nature-based solutions contribute to mitigation?

3.1 The climate change mitigation challenge

Halting climate change will require radical and transformative change. There is an urgent need to: (1) enhance the NDCs that countries have committed to, but which collectively fall far short of meeting the Paris Agreement goals (Fekete et al. 2021); (2) deliver on these NDC commitments; (3) develop and implement ambitious Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies, (4) promote behavioural change and new social norms5; and (5) invest in low-carbon post-COVID-19 recovery measures across sectors (UNEP 2020; UNEP 2021b).

from fossil fuels and the remainder included methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and fluorinated gases as well as CO2 from land-use change (UNEP 2020) (Figure 1). Agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) activities were responsible for around 23 per cent of the net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions between 2007 and 2016 (12.0 ±2.9 GtCO2eq yr-1) (IPCC 2019)6. This proportion is gradually decreasing as a result of an overall increase in emissions, rather than a decrease in emissions from AFOLU including land-use change (Figure 1).

For an 83 per cent chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, the IPCC estimates that, from 2020, total emissions must be no more than 300 GtCO2 (the `global carbon budget') (IPCC 2021). The same calculations for 2°C yield a 900 GtCO2 budget. However, the added half-degree of warming brings with it much greater risk, including from wildfire, permafrost degradation and food insecurity (IPCC 2019; IPCC 2021). To stay within the 1.5°C limit, we need to reach global net zero targets for CO2 emissions by 2050 and strongly reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases (IPCC 2018).
Between 1990 and 2019, greenhouse gas emissions from all sources increased. In 2019, 59.1 (±5.9) GtCO2e were emitted, of which 65 per cent was CO2,

The Earth's marine and terrestrial ecosystems take up around 56 per cent of anthropogenic CO2 (IPCC 2021). In recent decades, while the annual global sink has increased, there has been a trend of increasing absorption in the northern hemisphere and a decrease in the southern hemisphere (Ciais et al. 2019), the causes of which include land cover changes (including patterns of loss and recovery of natural ecosystems) and a slow saturation of the Amazon forest carbon sink (Hubau et al. 2020). Nature-based solutions involve human interactions with the natural world, to protect, restore or better manage this natural capacity to absorb and store atmospheric carbon. These include AFOLU activities and the management of marine, coastal and freshwater ecosystems.
3.2 Studies of the mitigation potential of nature-based solutions

Several recent syntheses have provided estimates of the mitigation potential of nature-based solutions; here we provide an overview and comparison (Table 1). At the global scale, it is possible to jointly estimate the mitigation potential of many individual nature-based solutions, or response options (IPCC 2019). The studies compared in this report aimed to avoid any double-counting of this potential that could result from overlaps in land requirements between the options they included. Estimating the potential and avoiding overlaps often involved spatial analysis of areas suitable for different options. To enable comparison across studies, here we adopt the typology of options from Griscom et al. (2017). In modelling the land area available for each option, these analyses often approximate some of the IUCN Global Standard's criteria, for example by ruling out conversion of natural ecosystems. But it is only when planning, implementing and monitoring anature-based solution in a particular geographical context that it is possible to ensure that these criteria or other relevant safeguards are met in practice.
Most of the nature-based solutions included, and most of the mitigation estimated, are terrestrial. All syntheses included conservation and restoration of some coastal ecosystems, but there is substantially more terrestrial than marine research on the potential scale of nature-based solutions, their benefits and risks, and related uncertainties. Some studies included land management response options that are not nature-based solutions and are unproven, such as BECCS. The studies also varied in the range of response options they considered. In the analysis below, we have extracted the information on the mitigation potential of nature-based solutions alone, while noting where the studies have also included options such as BECCS in calculating their results.
The effectiveness of nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation is dependent on the resilience of the ecosystems to the impacts of climate change itself. Their ability to act as a sink for CO2 emissions is directly and indirectly affected by their climate change exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (Seddon et al. 2020). Climate change can increase the exposure of ecosystems to pressures such as fire, drought, biotic agents, and other disturbances, and also to indirect impacts from human migration. These permanence risks are projected to increase in the twenty-first century (Anderegg et al. 2020). By enhancing the resilience of carbon stocks to the impacts of climate change, well-designed nature-based solutions can also reduce

climate change feedbacks that release further CO2 (Pörtner et al. 2021). But this resilience can only go so far: nature-based solutions will only function reliably in a world that takes decisive action to decarbonize the economy. Neither climate impacts nor the effects of management on resilience are directly addressed in the analyses of the potential of nature-based solutions reviewed here.
In a foundational study, Griscom et al. (2017) brought together estimates for the mitigation potential of 20 nature-based solutions response options (`pathways'). All the later syntheses reviewed here draw on at least some elements of this first study (hereafter, `Griscom'). First, Griscom calculated a maximum potential across all options and compatible with certain biodiversity and food security safeguards (23 GtCO2e per year). When parameters were further restricted to solutions that cost up to US$ 100/tCO2, 11.3 GtCO2e per year was found to be possible, or 4.1 GtCO2e per year if only budgeting for US$ 10/tCO2. In a widely cited conclusion, this study estimated that these solutions could contribute 37 per cent of the greenhouse gas mitigation needed at 20307 for a >66 per cent chance of remaining below a 2°C global mean temperature increase, at a cost of no more than US$ 100/tCO2. The projected carbon benefits from nature-based solutions increased linearly from 2016 to 2025, were maintained until 2060, and were then assumed to decline as the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2 saturated. Given the 2016 start year, this degree of scaling up by 2030 now looks optimistic.
Roe et al. (2019) built on this analysis to identify potential land sector contributions to a mitigation objective of limiting global mean temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C. This study (hereafter `Roe') integrated some additional agricultural studies, as well as demand-side response options such as dietary shift and reduction in food waste, and a BECCS response option. In our focus on nature-based solutions, we exclude BECCS and the demand-side options from our summary. Roe selected a set of response options, taking into account feasibility, risks and multiple benefits, to contribute `wedges' of emissions reductions at 2050. The total 2050 mitigation potential for nature-based solutions was slightly higher than in Griscom, at 12.1 GtCO2e per year. The biggest difference for 2050 was in the scope of the Protect actions included, which in Griscom were constrained to a cost of US$ 100/tCO2, and in Roe were not. However, in Roe the solutions, especially for Manage and Restore, are scaled up more slowly than in Griscom. As a result, Roe

7 The overall emissions reduction trajectory used here follows Meinshausen et al. (2009)
estimates a much smaller 2030 mitigation potential than any of the other studies (at least 5 GtCO2e per year, see Table 1).
Also in 2019, an IPCC special report on climate change and land included a detailed review of different land sector response options, including their benefits for climate change mitigation, adaptation and avoiding desertification and land degradation (IPCC 2019). The report reviews technical potential for the different options, and the scale of the multiple benefits they may deliver. However, it does not include an overall estimate of land-based mitigation potential.
Girardin et al. (2021) focused on evaluating the impact of nature-based solutions on global temperature rather than emissions, using scenarios that limit temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C and 2°C. In addition, this study (hereafter `Girardin') updated the Griscom mitigation potential estimates at US$ 100/tCO2. However, it did not integrate four Griscom response options that feature non-CO2 emissions reductions. Hence, the study reported a 2030 mitigation potential of 10.1 GtCO2 per year (Table 1), while the same updates made to the original synthesis would have yielded a potential 11.1 GtCO2e per year. Notably, Girardin allocates a much greater potential to agroforestry (1.86 versus 0.44 GtCO2 per year) and a smaller potential to reforestation (1.48 versus 3.04 GtCO2 per year) and to coastal wetland restoration (0.08 versus 0.20 GtCO2 per year) than Griscom (Figure 2). The study updated both tropical and temperate reforestation estimates. No boreal reforestation and no afforestation of natural ecosystems or of croplands was included in either Griscom or Girardin.
The <1.5°C scenario developed in Girardin assumed a far greater implementation both of nature-based solutions and of BECCS than the <2°C scenario. In the 1.5°C scenario, nature-based solutions were allowed to reach 10 GtCO2 per year by 2025, and 20 GtCO2 per year by 2055. By interpolation, this yields an estimate of 11.7 GtCO2 per year by 2030, and 18.3 GtCO2 per year by 2050 (Table 1). A higher value (US$/tCO2e ) was assigned to emissions reductions and removals in this scenario. From 2055, the CO2 removal technology known as `direct air capture' was assumed to mature and deliver more of the required mitigation. There may be conflict between the land expected for BECCS under this scenario and that for nature-based solutions implementation.

of mitigation potential and integrated assessment model estimates, both allocated across 200 countries and smaller territories (Roe et al. 2021). As well as options that could be seen as nature-based solutions, these include dietary shifts, food waste reduction and, in the integrated assessment models, a small contribution from BECCS. The new study finds a potential of 8 to 13.8 GtCO2e per year between 2020 and 2050, at a cost of up to US$ 100/tCO2e, across all these response options. While it has not been possible to analyse these results in detail in the current report, the range is broadly consistent with earlier studies of nature-based solutions potential.
In addition to the traditional peer reviewed literature, two further syntheses have been developed, with contrasting results. Both draw on Griscom for some response options. First, for the non-profit Project Drawdown, a large set of response options were considered, encompassing climate change mitigation across sectors (Wilkinson 2020). These are quantified to develop two emissions scenarios, roughly consistent with limiting global mean temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C or 2°C. The analysis is an outlier, with, notably, a much greater nature-based solutions mitigation potential by 2050 in the <1.5°C scenario compared to the other syntheses. While direct comparison of potential GtCO2e per year at 2030 and 2050 is difficult, it is noticeable that this study considered more agricultural land management options and identified a much greater proportion of potential from Manage actions and a smaller proportion from Protect actions than the other studies did.
Second, in an analysis for the World Economic Forum (WEF), only eight response options are contemplated, roughly matching up with nine of the Griscom options (McKinsey & Company 2021). Partly as a consequence of this smaller number, this analysis has a lower estimate of mitigation potential by 2030, at 6.7 GtCO2/year. It also takes a different approach to estimating `practical' mitigation potential, usually focused on `land rent': the agricultural return value per hectare. Practical areas for implementation were those with land rents up to US$ 45 per hectare. The analysis investigates only two of the Manage options from Griscom: agroforestry and conservation agriculture. Unsurprisingly, it finds much less potential in ecosystem management actions than the other synthesis studies. Its overall estimates for Protect and Restore options are close to those of Girardin.

We have seen that one reason for the wide range of mitigation potential identified in these studies (Table 1) are the different assumptions made about the global willingness to fund climate change mitigation in general and nature-based solutions in particular. Whether covered by public or private means, this can be represented by a US$ value (cost or price) per tonne of emissions reductions and removals. A cost of no more than US$ 100/tCO2e has frequently been used as a basis for estimating `feasible' mitigation potential, within biophysical, social and environmental constraints. In half of all tropical countries, over 50 per cent of national emissions could be mitigated through nature-based solutions at a cost of less than US$ 100/tCO2e (Griscom et al. 2020). However, Girardin envisaged that achieving a 1.5°C scenario would require doubling the acceptable cost of mitigation to US$ 200/tCO2e. This approximately doubled the global mitigation from nature-based solutions available by 2050.

US$ 200/tCO2e is very high in comparison to available payments for nature-based solutions in the present day, such as the US$ 10/tCO2e minimum price available for forest emissions reductions via the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition (LEAF Coalition 2021). While an increased willingness to pay for mitigation could incentivize greater use of nature-based solutions, it would also incentivize a suite of other climate change mitigation actions. The financing of nature-based solutions may depend, in part, on their cost-effectiveness compared with these other options. Although nature-based solutions can deliver a range of benefits in addition to climate change mitigation, many of these are not captured by traditional cost-benefit analysis, even though they can make a tangible difference to peoples' lives.

3.3 How can different nature-based solutions contribute to climate change mitigation?

The response options included in the studies reviewed here can be compared through different lenses: (i) options to Protect, Manage and Restore ecosystems; and (ii) the way that these are divided among different ecosystems. These comparisons will help to clarify the potential carbon benefits from, and the scope for strengthening effort towards, different types of nature-based solutions.
Here we summarize some of the nature-based solutions with the greatest mitigation potential, highlight some enabling conditions for each major group of solutions and suggest some research priorities.
Solutions that Protect Ecosystems
In general, reducing emissions by preventing the loss or degradation of natural ecosystems is more cost-effective and immediate than restoring carbon to damaged ecosystems. This is consistent with a mitigation hierarchy approach to impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, which indicates that impacts should first be avoided; when that is not possible, they should be minimized; and when they do occur, restoration should take place (Ekstrom, Bennun and Mitchell 2015; Tallis et al. 2015). If impacts remain, they should be offset by equivalent action elsewhere. All else being equal, it follows that the first priority is to Protect ecosystems from conversion, the second step is to tackle the drivers of ecosystem degradation, and the third is to Restore ecosystems.
Tropical forests, peatlands, and mangroves have the highest carbon stocks per hectare of all natural terrestrial/coastal ecosystems (Epple et al. 2016). In the latter two ecosystems, much of the carbon is held in soil organic carbon: 1375 tonnes/hectare on average for peatlands worldwide (Joosten and Couwenberg 2008) and 361 tonnes/hectare for mangroves (Sanderman et al. 2018). When peatlands and coastal wetlands are drained or otherwise degraded, they lose their soil organic carbon stores to the atmosphere through oxidation and sometimes burning. However, given the different areas of the ecosystems under pressure (Epple et al. 2016), the response option of Avoided Forest Conversion has a potential four to five times that of Avoided Peatland Impacts, and 10 to 12 times that of Avoided Coastal Wetland impact, including mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds (Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019; Girardin et al. 2021). Most estimates for avoided forest conversion are focused on a range of actions to reduce tropical deforestation, although Project Drawdown considers all forests but only in the context of declaring protected areas and establishing

indigenous peoples' tenure.
Nature-based solutions that require ecosystem loss to be avoided are only possible on a global scale if action is taken to tackle demand for agricultural land, the largest driver of land use change (the same will often be true for Restore actions). On the supply side, this can involve sustainable intensification, which seeks to improve crop yields without increasing carbon emissions. Unsustainable production and consumption patterns need to be addressed at the same time. Land demand and emissions can be reduced, for example, by (i) action on food waste and (ii) a shift towards plant-based diets, which results in a net decrease in land demand as grazing and feed production reduce (Bajzelj et al. 2014; IPCC 2019). If half of all people adopted a plant-rich diet and food waste was halved, this could produce an emissions reduction of 1.8 GtCO2e per year (Roe et al. 2019), as well as freeing land to deliver nature-based solutions. One radical scenario suggests that a transition away from animal agriculture could happen naturally, as animal protein sources are replaced with cheaper synthetic protein (Arbib, Dorr and Seba 2021).
Solutions that Manage Ecosystems
The potential contribution of different sustainable management options varies among the studies. Options with the largest potential include Natural Forest Management, which envisages reduced impact logging and longer timber harvest cycles in natural forests that are under extractive management; and agricultural options, such as agroforestry (Trees in Agricultural Lands) and Cropland Nutrient Management to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions, as well as actions that increase carbon stocks in soils, such as Conservation Agriculture and Biochar. Girardin et al. (2021) are unusual in seeing a much greater potential for agroforestry than for reforestation; this is consistent with remotely sensed analysis of the potential for trees to be added to agricultural lands (Chapman et al. 2020). Agroforestry is indeed a popular option among tropical treeplanting organizations (Martin et al. 2021).
Nature-based solutions that better manage agricultural land will often increase productivity at the same time as yielding climate benefits, further contributing to reduced land conversion pressure. However, given that a key feature of nature-based solutions is a net gain to biodiversity and human well-being, not every instance of improved land management will count as a nature-based solution. For example, biochar involves adding charcoal to the soil, to improve soil quality and fertility and also enhance carbon storage. Biochar can be considered a nature-based solution only when the overall impact of producing, harvesting and using the biomass feedstock is beneficial to biodiversity. It is critical to avoid degrading natural ecosystems to source feedstock for charcoal. In the synthesis studies, this risk is minimized by restricting biochar to using crop residues.
Governments can support nature-based solutions in agriculture in several ways: by repurposing agricultural subsidies to encourage sustainable management practices, by supporting extension programmes to provide training, and by ensuring that farmers have secure tenure. Land holders can be resistant to or incapable of embracing nature-based solutions due to various constraints. Although vulnerable to climate change impacts, farmers may: lack the human, technical or financial resources to adopt innovations; be unable to perceive the advantages in the long-term; have farming structures that are not conducive to new practices; exist in a policy framework that does not incentivize the change (Pagliacci et al. 2020); and/or be understandably reluctant to risk changing practices underpinning their livelihoods without persuasive proof of concept. Furthermore, while women and men are jointly responsible for the management of agricultural ecosystems and food production, formal and informal land rights in developing countries can be skewed in favour of men. Legislation and customary practices that prohibit women from owning land or limit their freedom to claim and protect their assets need to be addressed to give women the security to plan for the long term (United Nations 2013; Doss et al. 2018).

hydrology is to halt the ongoing emissions from oxidation of their organic soils and reduce the risk of fire, rather than to increase carbon sequestration. Any accumulation of additional carbon stocks by rewetted peat soils is very gradual and not typically factored into mitigation potential calculations.
Reforestation encompasses a range of practices. In general, natural regeneration is a more cost-effective approach than planting (Crouzeilles et al. 2020), delivering more resilient, biodiverse forests (Chazdon and Uriarte 2016). Planting results in more rapid absorption of CO2 over the first twenty years (Bernal, Murray and Pearson 2018). Under IPCC definitions, `reforestation' is carried out on lands which have been forested at some point in the previous 50 years, while `afforestation' involves creating a forest on other non-forested lands (Penman et al. 2003). If these lands were forested more than 50 years ago, afforestation may function as a nature-based solution, but the term is often used to describe afforestation of natural grasslands, wetlands or savannas, often with monocultures. While this practice can contribute to climate change mitigation, it is often harmful to biodiversity (Pörtner et al. 2021) and is therefore not seen as a nature-based solution.
Across most studies, Coastal Wetland Restoration and Peatland Restoration have a smaller role to play in mitigation than Reforestation. Drained peatlands emit some 1.91 (0.31­3.38) GtCO2e per year (Leifeld and Menichetti 2018). For peatland restoration, the most optimistic of the synthesis studies combined agricultural land values with this emissions estimate to calculate a mitigation potential of around 1 GtCO2e per year (McKinsey & Company 2021).

Solutions that Restore Ecosystems
As net CO2 removals (`negative emissions') are envisaged in all IPCC scenarios that limit global warming to +1.5°C, ecosystem restoration is an essential complement to protecting intact ecosystems. Some guiding principles have been established under the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, drawing on a wide range of existing guidance, and emphasizing that restoration with a mitigation objective will only be successful in the context of a wider transition towards a nature-positive, net zero economy (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] 2021). Options that Restore ecosystems can take many years to reach their full potential, as carbon stocks accumulate and contribute to mitigation over decades to centuries. Drained peatlands are a special case, as the principal aim in restoring their

As with options to Protect and Manage ecosystems, ecosystem restoration requires the right enabling conditions to be realised at scale. The business case for restoration can be difficult for land holders, with returns usually accumulating only over the long term. This makes it harder to cover the up-front costs, which may include the opportunity costs of lost agricultural revenue if land is being restored from productive use to a more natural land cover, and the costs of the restoration intervention itself. Governments can help by putting policies in place to incentivize ecosystem restoration, offering rewards for the public goods delivered; for the Manage options, governments can improve the security of land tenure to facilitate long-term planning (Sewell, Bouma, and Esch 2016).
3.4 Further nature-based solutions could be possible in marine ecosystems

In addition to the nature-based solutions included in the synthesis studies, there are other possible options that so far lack sufficient information to allow the global potential to be quantified. Several of these are found in coastal and marine ecosystems. On the sea floor, protection of marine sediment from industrial trawling and dredging could prevent 0.58 to 1.47 GtCO2 from being released into the water column each year (Sala et al. 2021). However, we would need to know how much of this CO2 reaches the atmosphere to quantify the mitigation potential of reducing the area trawled each year (currently 4.9 million km²). As a precautionary measure, prevention of trawling in areas of high-carbon sediment along the continental shelf8 would safeguard these carbon stocks from disturbance (Atwood et al. 2020). Deepsea mining may represent a further future threat to carbon stocks in benthic sediment and should therefore also be avoided.
None of the synthesis studies include an estimate for protection of seaweeds, although they form the most widespread of coastal ecosystems, covering perhaps 3.5 million km² and do sequester carbon through sediments drifting to the seafloor. As there is no estimate of the rate of loss of seaweed habitats, it is not yet possible to estimate the impacts on their biomass and sequestration functions (HoeghGuldberg et al. 2019).
Seaweed aquaculture or `ocean afforestation' has been proposed as a means to sequester carbon by contributing to ocean sinks, while also providing a resource for other response options as it can be used as a source of biomass for energy production, as an alternative fertiliser, or a livestock feed supplement to reduce enteric methane emissions (N'Yeurt et al. 2012; Duarte et al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). Potential multiple benefits of seaweed farming include improving water quality in polluted and low-oxygen areas, at a minimum cost of US$ 71/tCO2 (Froehlich et al. 2019). However, analysis of an algal bloom in the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt concluded that after accounting for knock-on effects elsewhere in the ecosystem, seaweed farming could represent either a sink or source of CO2 (Bach et al. 2021). Albedo effects were very uncertain, but could boost the mitigation impact. Careful investigation of the overall impacts of seaweed aquaculture is still needed before this can be proposed as a large-scale mitigation activity.

Protection and restoration of marine fauna (fish and mammals) could be another response option for climate change mitigation. By reducing the population size and changing the demographic structure of a wide range of species, fishing also contributes directly to changes in marine carbon stocks and sequestration. The net outcome for carbon is not well understood due to the intricate ecological interactions involved. Carbon is stored in the living biomass of fished species, and fish also contribute to the downward flux of carbon through faecal pellets, estimated at 1.5 ± 1.2 GtC per year (Saba et al. 2021). Fished species can have a range of roles in maintaining carbon sink potential (e.g. predation of grazers, reducing algal blooms and maintaining water quality) and their removal can have trophic cascade effects that differ in carbon impact depending on species and ecosystems (Martin et al. 2021). Phytoplankton and krill may have declined in response to the missing nutrient mixing function of hunted-out whales (Roman et al. 2014). However, while stocks of marine biomass have been depleted by whaling and fishing, some may have been replaced in the form of other species, responding to reduced predator pressure or decreased competition for resources. It is therefore difficult to properly assess the net carbon storage potential of restoring marine vertebrate populations. We do know that when carcasses of whales and large fish sink to the ocean bed, there are long-term deposits of carbon. A conservative estimate of the annual mitigation potential of these deposits from fully restored populations of baleen whales is only 0.0006 GtCO2 per year, and of course it would take some time for populations to return to their original levels (Pershing et al. 2010). Similarly, sequestration by the sinking carcasses of large marine fish (tuna, mackerel, billfish and shark) is estimated at 0.08 GtCO2 from 1950 to 2014 (Mariani et al. 2020). However, this data offers only a very narrow window on the role of marine species in the carbon cycle, and there is a need for further research and modelling in this area.

3.5 How much mitigation can we expect from nature-based solutions?

Across the syntheses, the total mitigation potential of options to Protect natural ecosystems from conversion is fairly consistent, with a range from 3.4 GtCO2e at 2030 to 4.6 GtCO2e at 2050 (Figure 3).
There is a strong consensus that Avoided Forest Conversion holds the greatest mitigation potential, because of the extent of forest that continues to be lost and the immediate benefits of retaining existing forest compared to waiting for new forest to grow. Preventing deforestation avoids a pulse of carbon emissions, which would take years to recover if the same site were then reforested. As the synthesis studies have been refined through time, estimates of the overall potential from options to Restore ecosystems have decreased, especially for reforestation, while still remaining substantial. Estimates for the potential mitigation benefits from options that Manage ecosystems are very variable, being influenced by the number of response options included and assumptions about how fast they can be scaled up.
When comparing across different ecosystems, forests predominate, typically representing 62 per cent (58-65 per cent) at 2050 of the annual mitigation potential across studies (Figure 2). Response options based in croplands and grasslands, including agroforestry, provide the second highest contribution in the majority of the synthesis studies, around 24 per cent at 2050 (22-28 per cent). In addition, although the Fire Management option includes fire control practices both for forest and savanna, these studies focus entirely on forest. Given the relatively small global area of degraded and threatened peatlands, their potential contribution to mitigation is very high, 10 per cent of the total at 2050 (9-11per cent). Although peatlands overlap with forest, grassland and cropland, by focusing on their organic soil carbon the synthesis studies minimize any overlap in the calculation of potential. Finally, coastal wetlands (conservation and restoration of mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses) represent around 4 per cent at 2050 (3-4 per cent) of the total mitigation potential. In the future, nature-based solutions in marine ecosystems may further add to this potential.
The synthesis studies reviewed here identify a striking range of total mitigation potential, from around 5-11.7 GtCO2e at 2030 to 10-18 GtCO2e at 2050. The studies vary in their assumptions about how quickly different types of nature-based solutions can be implemented and financed on a large scale, and the relative potential of different solutions (Figure 2).
Some studies concentrate on CO2 alone, while others factor in the potential for reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases. As will be discussed below, robust safeguards are needed to ensure that nature-based solutions live up to their bold promise to deliver multiple societal benefits. All forms of mitigation need to be implemented at their maximum capacity if we are to limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5°C. The time required to ensure that new nature-based solutions are properly planned and implemented with inclusive governance means that by 2030 the lower end of this range (5 GtCO2e) may be the most realistic estimate of that capacity, scaling up to at least 10 (maximum 18) GtCO2e by 2050.

Nature-based solutions offer multiple benefits

A major attraction of nature-based solutions as a strategy for climate change mitigation is that they can deliver multiple benefits. These benefits include retained and restored ecosystem services from forests, croplands, grazing lands, wetlands and other coastal ecosystems that support human health and well-being (Anderson et al. 2019), as well as biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihood development. Well-designed nature-based solutions can also improve human resilience, helping people to face the challenging impacts of climate change. Nature-based solutions can increase our capacity to adapt to those impacts of climate change that will still be present in a net zero world, reduce exposure to climate-related risks such as flooding and lower the sensitivity of human communities to climate change and shocks, for example by diversifying income (Seddon et al. 2020).
Similarly, nature-based solutions developed with a focus on other objectives, such as Ecosystem-based Adaptation, can deliver climate change mitigation benefits (Chausson et al. 2020). Nature-based solutions focused on food security in farmlands can, likewise, provide a climate dividend (for disaster risk reduction, adaptation and mitigation) while conserving water and biodiversity (Miralles-Wilhelm 2021). Nature-based solutions for water security can similarly yield additional social, economic and environmental benefits, including for climate change mitigation and adaptation (United Nations World Water Assessment Programme/UN-Water 2018). If planned well, with considerations for those left furthest behind, these benefits will improve the lives of women, indigenous peoples, poor farmers and local communities whose livelihoods and well-being are closely tied to natural resources (UNEP 2021b).
It has already been noted that Avoided Forest Conversion and Reforestation make up a substantial part of the global potential for mitigation from nature-based solutions. Natural and planted forests cover 31 per cent of the terrestrial area worldwide (FAO and UNEP 2020). Protecting and restoring large tracts of forest can be especially beneficial. Forests interact with carbon, water and energy cycles in different ways, generating large parts of the Earth's rainfall through evapotranspiration, which can be transported over long distances in `flying rivers' (Schwarzer 2021). But the value of forests goes well

beyond their well-known roles in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Globally, an estimated 880 million people collect fuelwood or produce charcoal from forests and over 90 per cent of the extreme poor rely on forests for at least part of their livelihoods (FAO and UNEP 2020). Cookstoves with improved combustion efficiencies compared to traditional stoves or fires use less fuelwood and charcoal (Urmee and Gyamfi 2014). This saves time and labour gathering fuel, a burden which often falls upon women and children, as well as benefiting women's health through reducing indoor air pollution. Adopting improved cookstoves is the means of implementation for the Avoided Woodfuel Harvest response option of Griscom et al. (2017), and features in several developing countries' NDCs.
The UNFCCC encourages forest-based nature-based solutions through its REDD+ framework, which covers ""reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries"" (UNFCCC 2021). REDD+ can yield non-carbon benefits including biodiversity conservation, enhancement of forest ecosystem services, and socio-economic developments including poverty reduction, gender equality and women's empowerment, and promotion of an economy supported by sustainable forest management. In applying the safeguards required by the UNFCCC, REDD+ should deliver these environmental and social benefits, ensure the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities and avoid or mitigate relevant social and environmental risks. For example, agroforestry is often included in the scope of REDD+ and can deliver a range of environmental and social benefits. Developing agroforestry within existing perennial crop plantations over seven West African countries could absorb 0.14 GtCO2 per year over twenty years, as well as connecting forest remnants, providing fuelwood, improving soils, protecting crops against climate extremes and enhancing local food and energy security (Tschora and Cherubini 2020). In an urban context, forests and parks can contribute to cooling cities, mitigating flood risks, and enhancing health through better air quality and provision of leisure spaces (European Environment Agency 2021).

Table 2 describes the multiple benefits delivered by selected nature-based solutions. It brings together three existing reviews of these benefits (MirallesWilhelm 2021; Seymour and Langer 2021; World Economic Forum [WEF] 2021) and complementary studies. The ecosystem service benefits shown will often ultimately improve the resilience of people and ecosystems to climate change, and thus also represent adaptation benefits. The delivery of the different benefits is classified qualitatively into low, medium and high levels. For a given nature-based solutions, the benefits may vary depending on how and where the nature-based solution is delivered, e.g. different levels of management intensity in the Natural Forest Management response option. Table 2 can be used to shortlist valuablenature-based solutions approaches for different circumstances. It can be seen, for example, that just as avoided loss of natural habitats is the most rapid route (per hectare) to climate change mitigation impact, retaining the threatened biodiversity and ecosystem services in these places is a faster route to social and environmental benefits than waiting for habitat restoration to take effect.

5 Social and environmental safeguards

To ensure that nature-based solutions live up to their promise to deliver on multiple local and global agendas over the long-term, robust safeguards are needed to guide their design and implementation. Safeguards can help to manage social and environmental risks as well as to achieve multiple benefits that strengthen the case for scaling up. REDD+ already has this type of safeguards framework, agreed under the UNFCCC, but there is not yet an equivalent for non-forest ecosystems (Seddon et al. 2020). Some countries are already choosing to apply REDD+ safeguards beyond forests, for example, Honduras, which is working on a single framework for all climate change projects and programmes. Safeguards for nature-based solutions for mitigation can also build on those detailed in the guidelines for ecosystem-based approaches for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction adopted under the CBD (CBD 2018; Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2019). Meanwhile, IUCN has consulted widely on its Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions (IUCN 2020a; IUCN 2020b) and is working with partners to integrate this into existing certification schemes that could then be used to demonstrate that a given intervention meets the standard (IUCN 2021).
Nature-based solutions provide benefits for biodiversity and human well-being while addressing other societal challenges. However, discussions under the CBD have highlighted specific concerns. Some indigenous peoples and civil society groups have argued against any form of carbon trading, being concerned not only that market-oriented nature-based solutions may involve privatization of natural resources held in common, with some stakeholders benefiting at the expense of others, but that offsets would be used to delay action to reduce emissions (Tugendhat 2021). There is a concern that the need to engage indigenous peoples and local communities in decision-making will be not be taken seriously, but reduced to a box-ticking exercise (Seddon et al. 2021). Many of these concerns are addressed under the IUCN Global Standard, which expands on the IUCN definition of nature-

based solutions in a way that reflects existing CBD Decisions. For example, the principles of the CBD's Ecosystem Approach ­ that ecosystem management should be done ""in a fair and equitable way"", pursuing objectives which ""are a matter of societal choices"" and ""involve all relevant sectors of society"" (CBD 2007) ­ are addressed in the Standard, which inter alia calls for involving stakeholders at all stages, upholding the right of indigenous peoples to `free, prior and informed consent', prioritizing the most pressing societal challenges according to rightsholders and potential beneficiaries, identifying the benefits and costs of each solution and ensuring these are equitably shared amongst stakeholders.
Safeguards are also needed to ensure the climate change mitigation benefits of nature-based solutions. UNFCCC discussions are focused on its primary objective to stabilize ""greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"" (UNFCCC 1992, p.9). Safeguards are needed to address `leakage', `additionality', permanence and double-counting . Whennature-based solutions are applied over small scales and in a context of continuing land demand, `leakage' (displacement of the original land-uses) can undo some of the carbon savings made. To ensure `additionality', the solutions must deliver carbon benefits compared to the business-as-usual situation, without the intervention. If the achievements of nature-based solutions are reversed through human action or even as a result of climate change itself, permanence questions are raised around whether there have indeed been net emissions reductions. If carbon credits from nature-based solutions are traded and used for offsets, without reliable accounting systems, there is a risk of the mitigation benefit being over-stated, lessening pressure to reduce emissions elsewhere. While safeguards for leakage and permanence are in place for REDD+, the rules intended to avoid double-counting and ensure additionality within international emissions trading under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement are still under negotiation (Asian Development Bank [ADB] 2020).

These various issues must be tackled in safeguards and in carbon accounting, both for nature-based solutions and other response options.
As well as helping to ensure that nature-based solutions for mitigation are genuinely beneficial for people and nature, adopting appropriate safeguards makes it clear that, as noted earlier, not all land-based response options for climate change mitigation should be counted as nature-based solutions. Options that enhance carbon sinks without regard to biodiversity conservation needs, plant trees in peatlands or natural grasslands whose carbon stocks are vulnerable to disturbance, or plant large areas of monocultures for biomass energy, are unlikely to qualify as nature-based solutions. To secure societal benefits and avoid risks may require an analysis of social and cultural factors that result in exclusion and discrimination based on gender or other factors. Top-down land-use planning that blocks the participation of vulnerable groups such

as women, youth, indigenous peoples and local communities is not likely to yield a set of proposed solutions that meets their needs. Moreover, such planning could well present risks to land rights, food security and ecosystem services that communities depend upon. If governments are able to apply or adapt the safeguard approaches developed for initiatives such as REDD+ to accommodate other nature-based solutions, this could go a long way towards reducing these social and environmental risks.


6.1 Nature-based solutions in national mitigation commitments

The Paris Agreement offers a concrete opportunity to scale up nature-based solutions for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, in that it requires all countries (Parties) to submit their NDCs in support of the goals of the Agreement. The Agreement's Article 6 also allows for Parties to finance mitigation in other nations, both through market and nonmarket approaches. In the NDCs, Parties set out their mitigation commitments as well as (in most cases), their adaptation priorities and targets.
As well as expecting that NDCs are updated at least every five years with progressively more ambitious pledges, the Paris Agreement invited countries to set out ""long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies"" (2015, p.4). These strategies may include a long-term vision to guide the definition of successive NDCs, including goals for both mitigation and adaptation, such as the target date for achieving net zero ambitions across sectors.
The role of nature-based solutions in NDCs has increased through time. In 2017, only 38 of 160 NDCs assessed specified land-sector mitigation contributions (Griscom et al. 2017). By 2019, the majority of NDCs included actions that could be interpreted as nature-based solutions, but these largely lacked quantifiable targets and were more common in developing than developed countries (Seddon et al. 2019). More than two thirds of NDCs appeared to refer to mitigation in forests, although they may not all involve nature-based solutions. Only 20 per cent included quantifiable targets for forests, and only 8 per cent expressed these targets in tCO2e. Ecosystems other than forests were less well represented. In the NDCs of developing countries, targets are often presented as conditional on international finance. By 1 May 2021, 55 Parties had submitted updated or revised NDCs. Of these, 44 referred to nature-based solutions for mitigation, with an increasing number including quantifiable targets (Bakhtary, Haupt and Elbrecht 2021). The number of NDCs that referenced wetlands or coastal ecosystems also increased.

Elbrecht 2021) as well as selected others. In selecting additional NDCs for review, we focused on those covering a large geographical area and including land-use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) or agriculture in their sectoral scope, according to the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) database (IGES 2021). We assessed whether each NDC included actions to Protect, Manage or Restore each of four broad ecosystem types, noting that many used broad language that made it difficult to specify a category (Figure 4). Some NDCs continue to make commitments on tackling emissions from the LULUCF sector without being explicit that this involves nature-based solutions or specifying targets for particular ecosystems. The European Union notably includes a stringent provision on LULUCF becoming net zero, making individual member states responsible for determining how this will be implemented ­ commitments of this nature do not feature in our summary. Due to huge variation in the way that actions are described within NDCs, we did not attempt to summarize the intended impact of the actions. Overall, there were slightly more commitments to Manage and Restore than to Protect ecosystems. Forest-based options were overwhelmingly the most common, followed by grassland and agriculture, coastal ecosystems and finally wetlands.


6.2 Private sector commitments on climate change mitigation
Achieving the mitigation promises made in NDCs will require countries to adjust regulation, taxes and incentives to encourage private sector action. Nature not only has a place in NDCs, but also in private sector climate change mitigation strategies. The United Nations `Race to Zero' campaign has brought together net zero initiatives that represent at least 3,067 businesses and 173 large investors, alongside cities, regions and universities. All have committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, with some making more ambitious commitments to absolute zero emissions, or to becoming `climate positive', absorbing more greenhouse gases than they emit. Interim targets for the coming decade are required of members9 (United Nations [UN] 2021). Nature-based solutions can be used in corporate net zero strategies in different ways (Pineda, Chang and Faria 2020): by reducing land-based emissions that companies are responsible for (e.g. from deforestation in their supply chains); as a means of `compensating' for ongoing emissions as the company moves towards net zero; and to `neutralize' any emissions that remain when the net zero deadline is reached (see section 8).

7 Financing needs

Nature-based solutions receive a small proportion of existing public and private climate-mitigation financing. Finance for climate change mitigation flows from public funds, development finance institutions, state-owned enterprises and financial institutions, private corporations and even private individuals investing in low carbon technologies such as electric cars (Climate Policy Initiative [CPI] 2020). Overall, only 3 per cent of all climate finance (for mitigation or adaptation) in 2017­2018 was directed towards AFOLU and natural resource management, categories which include some (unknown) proportion of nature-based solutions. Of the US$ 532 billion per year invested in mitigation, most was for renewable energy and low-carbon transport. Only 2 per cent was invested in AFOLU and natural resource management (CPI 2020). In contrast, the proportion for the much smaller pot of adaptation funding was around 16 per cent. According to global models, around US$ 2.4 trillion per year between 2016 and 2035 is needed for supply-side energy system investments alone, for limiting global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC 2018). This indicates that the finance currently available for nature-based solutions is far below the level needed, consistent with the broader findings of the State of Finance for Nature report (UNEP 2021a).
Finance for nature and nature-based solutions has been identified as one of eleven public finance priorities by the COP26 Presidency, which called for an increase from both public and private sources (COP26 Presidency 2021). The need is especially great for tropical countries, where the median cost

of implementing nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation is US$ 100/tonne, equivalent to nearly 6 per cent of national GDP, with outliers up to 46 per cent of GDP (Griscom et al. 2020). International transfers, whether public or private, will be needed to support nature-based solutions in these countries.
Governments can also influence the financing needed for nature-based solutions by reducing their costs: transforming subsidies and incentive systems to encourage nature-positive land and sea-use. In 2020, 91 states committed to do just this, in the Leaders' Pledge for Nature, also signed by the President of the European Commission. The Pledge further commits countries to enhance resource mobilization, scaling up public and private sector support for biodiversity, including nature-based solutions.
Even with this additional effort from governments, if nature-based solutions are to deliver on their climate change mitigation promise, all sources of finance will be needed, from public to private, domestic to international (Girardin et al. 2021). A substantial increase in private sector investment is needed to complement public funding (Carney 2020; Seddon et al. 2021) including actions within companies' own value chains and as a means of compensating for and neutralizing residual emissions en route to net zero.

8 How can offsets play a role?

A debate is underway about the role of emissions reductions and removals from nature-based solutions in offsetting emissions from other parts of the economy. While proponents believe that this approach can quicken our progress to net zero, reducing the risk of dangerous climate change, critics are concerned that offsetting will instead reduce ambitions for emissions reduction, thus ""letting polluters off the hook"". In addition, it is argued that excessive confidence in the future potential for carbon dioxide removals, whether through natural solutions or nascent technological approaches, can diminish the perceived urgency of action on emissions (Dyke, Watson and Knorr 2021).
An IUCN survey held between June and September 2021 canvassed views on the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting, and received 569 responses from a wide range of actors10.
The survey first solicited general views on the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting. It then unpacked the conditions under which respondents felt that this could be acceptable. Over 80 per cent of respondents expressed support for the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting purposes, whether by state or non-state actors. However, 75 per cent expressed concern that such use could reduce overall mitigation ambition or have other harmful consequences. To address this concern, 93 per cent of respondents supported allowing the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting only if certain conditions were fulfilled, while 7 per cent opposed all use of nature-based solutions for these purposes.
Respondents were then invited to review 10 possible conditions, in the form of solution statements. These aimed to address four thematic categories of risks: (1) of delay to broader decarbonization of the economy; (2) of harm to natural ecosystems and biodiversity; (3) of harm to local communities and indigenous peoples and (4) of lack of long-term commitment and quality and integrity assurance. Overall, there was broad support for the possible

conditions. On average, 69 per cent expressed their clear agreement with the statements, and 93 per cent either agreed or partially agreed.
The highest support (>80 per cent) was expressed for conditions establishing that the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting (i) must support and enhance biodiversity, and should not contribute to the conversion or loss of existing natural ecosystems; and (ii) must ensure full protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, cause no harm to them, and assure equitable benefit sharing of any revenues generated through such measures. These conditions are consistent with the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions.
A high level of support (>70 per cent) was also expressed for conditions establishing that the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting (i) not act as a substitute for cutting greenhouse gas emissions or delay wider decarbonization; (ii) be certified by programmes with robust systems that can assure high quality, high integrity carbon credits for nature-based solutions11; (iii) if transacted under voluntary schemes, be linked eventually to carbon accounting systems under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to avoid double-counting; and (iv) adhere to the IUCN Global Standard to provide overall quality assurance.
Over 3000 comments on the 10 possible conditions were received. For instance, it was highlighted that although the use of nature-based solutions for carbon offsetting focuses on climate mitigation per se, these activities need to also include adaptation and resilience objectives in order to fully contribute to the goals of the Paris Agreement. Likewise, it was noted that nature-based solutions interventions must be appropriate for their areas of implementation, and that beyond the generation of carbon offsets, companies and governments should also have strict overall policies for stopping deforestation and habitat conversion. It was commented that specifying and calculating a price premium for nature-based solutions carbon offsets would likely require a mix of measures, including regulation, incentives, consumer influence, and adequate measurement and monitoring systems for the various benefits of nature-based solutions. It was noted by some that the IUCN Global Nature-based Solutions Standard should be used to complement existing carbon measurement and verification standards and platforms, to help improve and assure the ecosystem and social integrity of offsetting activities claimed. Some respondents questioned the need for nature-based solutions carbon offsets generated through voluntary schemes to be strictly linked to compliance and carbon accounting systems being set up under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. While further analysis will be conducted by IUCN, the survey findings are indicative of the views that currently exist within IUCN's constituencies on the main conditions that are needed to ensure high-quality, environmentally and socially responsible use of nature-based carbon offsetting. Moreover, the findings highlight areas of consensus and of possible debate.

Figure 5 (continued): IUCN survey responses to possible conditions (solution statements) under which the use of nature-based solutions (NbS) for carbon offsetting may be allowed
As standards and norms surrounding the use of nature-based solutions, whether as offsets or within value chains, continue to develop, companies can signal demand for high-quality nature-based solutions and advocate robust rules for offsetting (Seymour and Langer 2021).
The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)12 is working on criteria for companies that wish to set net zero targets. The initiative aims to reduce confusion among consumers and stakeholders and to bring more clarity to corporate commitments (Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative [VCMII] 2021a). The lack of a single clear definition of net zero for corporate action means that differences can be found in the way that companies include emission sources and gases in their target boundaries, scope and ambition (Pineda, Chang and Faria 2020). Besides net zero commitments to achieve emissions reductions in the future, corporate voluntary climate commitments may include emissions reductions for current activities, such as carbon neutrality at the company level, for specific products or services and also `beyond carbon neutrality', which implies reducing emissions in excess of current emissions, for example covering historical years (VCMII 2021b). There is an emerging consensus that, first and foremost, companies must make all efforts to reduce emissions within their value chain, including those that they are directly responsible for (Scope 1 emissions), those from energy that they purchase (Scope 2 emissions) and those from other parts of their value chains (Scope 3 emissions).
SBTi is currently undertaking a public consultation process and aims to release a corporate net zero standard in November 2021 (VCMII 2021b). Its working definition for a net zero company requires deep decarbonization of value chain emissions in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C, and the neutralization of any residual emissions with permanent carbon removal (VCMII 2021b). It is recognized that this is a process of transition, and that carbon offsets can be used to compensate for remaining emissions as companies put measures in place to eliminate them. SBTi encourages companies to directly finance innovative projects and programmes as well as purchasing high-quality carbon credits during their net zero transition, to help deliver positive outcomes beyond a company's value chain. Companies need to be explicit about the role of offsets as they move towards net zero (Carney 2020; Seddon et al. 2021), showing that they are not a means to avoid emissions reduction, but a means to reduce emissions more rapidly and finally to `neutralize' unavoidable emissions.
There are differences of view over whether avoided emissions from natural habitat loss are appropriate for use as offsets or should be separately funded as an essential part of achieving net zero emissions. SBTi's current draft guidance limits companies to using removals, not reduced emissions, when offsetting their own emissions to achieve net zero targets. That is, their accounting approach considers that only `neutralization' efforts that remove carbon from the atmosphere can be used to counteract any residual emissions that cannot be tackled (VCMII 2021a; VCMII 2021b). As presently formulated, this approach limits `neutralization' to nature-based solutions that Restore or sometimes Manage ecosystems, thus potentially limiting the scope for the private sector to scale up nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation. This position contrasts with the approach of the ART-TREES standard, which requires a jurisdiction to show that emissions from deforestation and forest degradation are being tackled before credits can be issued for removals from reforestation. This latter approach is consistent with the mitigation hierarchy.
There is a need to develop an infrastructure for scaling up high-quality and functioning carbon markets, and a set of rules and guidance that allow funding to be directed towards well-plannednature-based solutions that do not delay the urgently needed decarbonization (Carney 2020; Seddon et al. 2021), as well as ensuring demand-side integrity, as seen in the SBTi corporate net zero standard. The private sector-led Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets is consulting on a blueprint for a voluntary market infrastructure of this type, and a roadmap to implementation (Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets 2021). Again, the precise implementation may be influenced by final decisions on the rulebook for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

9 Conclusion

Nature-based solutions have a vital role to play in mitigating climate change, while simultaneously providing adaptation and other benefits. We conclude that at least 5 GtCO2e per year by 2030 and 10 GtCO2e per year by 2050 is feasible, taking a conservative outlook across the several published studies. The underlying estimates have a wide range, which reflects the uncertainties regarding the types of intervention considered, the speed at which they can be scaled up, the global willingness to pay for nature-based solutions, represented by assumptions about the value assigned to climate change mitigation (US$/tCO2e) and the impact that strict adherence to safeguards will have. In the light of these uncertainties, we can have more confidence in the estimates at the lower end of the ranges provided.
However, while nature-based solutions have a necessary role to play, achieving the Paris Agreement goal will require, above all, a rapid, ambitious and sustained abatement of fossil fuels and other industrial emissions, as called for by the latest science (Pörtner et al. 2021; Seymour and Langer 2021). Without this ambitious action to decarbonize national economies taken by governments and corporates and supported by civil society, it will be impossible to limit global temperature rise to below 1.5°C in the coming years. This would undermine the capacity of the biosphere/ecosystems to draw down and store carbon, and likely turn the biosphere into a net source of greenhouse gases.
Nature-based solutions can be implemented across terrestrial and marine ecosystems, although we understand far more about the terrestrial response options. Across ecosystems, the overall mitigation potential is highest in forests, and then in grasslands and agriculture, with peatlands and coastal wetlands representing a very high potential per hectare, but a

lower overall potential due to their smaller area. This understanding is broadly reflected in NDCs, which more frequently put forward solutions for mitigation centred on forests, grasslands and agriculture than for other ecosystems. If nature-based solutions are to deliver on this contribution to mitigation, then the necessary safeguards, carbon accounting frameworks and governance schemes that have been identified here need to be in place and strictly enforced. Moreover, the finance must be available to ensure delivery. Initiatives such as LEAF and the Green Gigaton Challenge offer promising ways forward, at least for forests. A proportion of the necessary finance could be delivered through the responsible use of nature-based solution offsets, provided that new and emerging frameworks are utilized to ensure that the achievement of net zero targets is not compromised and biodiversity and local communities benefit. These initiatives for forests should be adapted for use in other systems, particularly in agricultural lands and degraded peatlands of all types, to allow nature-based solutions to be advanced there.
Equitable and resilient nature-based solutions can mitigate climate change while simultaneously strengthening both ecosystems and communities' resilience to climate change, promoting biodiversity conservation and reducing the risk of climate change feedbacks and impacts (Seddon et al. 2021). We have an opportunity now, while rebuilding economies in a post-Covid-19 world, to deploy robust and resilient nature-based solutions. With strategic planning, evidence-based action, and engagement of local communities, solutions based on nature can create jobs and stable livelihoods, and better manage our food and forestry systems, all while addressing the urgent challenges of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.

UNEP-2021-3.txt,"The Gathering Storm Adapting to climate change in a post-pandemic world Adaptation Gap Report Glossary  Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm  The entries in this glossary are primarily taken or modified from definitions provided by reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. (IPCC, 20141). Adaptive capacity: The ability of systems, institutions, humans, and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (IPCC, 20141).  Limits to adaptation: The point at which an actor's objectives (or system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions.  Hard adaptation limit: No adaptive actions are possible to avoid intolerable risks.  Soft adaptation limit: Options are currently not available to avoid intolerable risks through adaptive action (IPCC, 20141). Maladaptation: Actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increased vulnerability to climate change, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Maladaptation is usually an unintended consequence (IPCC, 20183).  Adaptation costs: Costs of planning, preparing for, facilitating, and implementing adaptation measures, including transaction costs (IPCC, 20072).  Mitigation (of climate change): A human intervention to reduce the sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 20141).  Baseline: The state against which change is measured. It might be a current baseline, in which case it represents observable, present-day conditions. It might also be a `future baseline', which is a projected future set of conditions excluding the driving factor of interest. Alternative interpretations of the reference conditions can give rise to multiple baselines (IPCC, 20072). Exposure: The presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected (IPCC, 20141). Hazard: The potential occurrence of a natural or human induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resources (IPCC, 20141). Impacts: The consequences of realized risks on natural and human systems, where risks result from the interactions of climate-related hazards (including extreme weather and climate events), exposure, and vulnerability. Impacts generally refer to effects on lives; livelihoods; health and well-being; ecosystems and species; economic, social and cultural assets; services (including ecosystem services); and infrastructure. Impacts may be referred to as consequences or outcomes, and can be adverse or beneficial (IPCC, 20183).  Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): [Climate change] Scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use/land cover. The word representative signifies that each RCP provides only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasizes the fact that not only the long-term concentration levels but also the trajectory taken over time to reach that outcome (IPCC, 20141). Resilience: The capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganizing in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation (IPCC, 20141). Risk: The potential for consequences where something of value is at stake and where the outcome is uncertain, recognizing the diversity of values. Risk is often represented as probability of occurrence of hazardous events or trends multiplied by the impacts if these events or trends occur. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard (IPCC, 20141). Vulnerability: The propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected. Vulnerability encompasses a variety of concepts and elements including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (IPCC, 20141).  Foreword  Adaptation Gap Report 2021: The Gathering Storm  2021 was the year in which climate impacts hit developed and developing countries with a new ferocity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, meanwhile, warned we have at best a 50 per cent chance of limiting global warming to a ∞C temperature rise this century.  So, even as we look to step up efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions ≠ efforts that are still not anywhere strong enough ≠ we must dramatically up our game to adapt. This is because the sixth edition of the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report finds that climate impacts continue to outpace our attempts to adapt to them.  Adaptation financing is a major concern. The gap between what we need to spend to adapt and what we are actually spending is widening. Estimated costs of adaptation continue to rise and could reach US$ 280-500 billion per year by 2050 for developing countries alone. Meanwhile, international public adaptation finance has increased more than 50 per cent between 2017≠2018 and 2019≠2020 but still remains far too low.  COVID-19 recovery stimulus packages are a window of opportunity for green and resilient recoveries that is being lost. US$  trillion of fiscal stimulus has been deployed, but only a small portion of this funding has gone towards adaptation. Less than one-third of 66 countries studied explicitly funded COVID-19 measures to address climate risks up to January 2021. Moreover, the heightened cost of servicing debt, combined with decreased government revenues, may hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, the report also points to a number of encouraging developments. Implementation of adaptation actions did grow, backed by the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility and bilateral public funding. Information from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that the top 10 donors funded more than 2,600 projects with a principal focus on adaptation between 2010 and 2019. The report also finds that climate change adaptation is increasingly being embedded in policy and planning across the world. Around 79 per cent of all countries have now adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument, an increase of 7 per cent since 2020. However, we are just not doing enough. We need to scale up and further increase public adaptation finance, including by overcoming barriers for private sector engagement.  As implementation at current rates may not keep pace with increasing levels of climate change, we need to turn the growth in policy and planning into real and rapid implementation and financial support. Even if we were to turn off the tap on greenhouse gas emissions today, the impacts of climate change would be with us for decades to come. This report clearly shows that we need a step change in adaptation ambition for funding and implementation to significantly reduce damages and losses from climate change. And we need it now. Inger Andersen Executive Director United Nations Environment Programme  XI  Executive summary  Context and framing of the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2021 The sixth edition of the UNEP Adaptation Gap Report (AGR2021) has been produced in the second year of the global COVID-19 pandemic. While encouraging trends in tackling the pandemic are emerging, including the unprecedented development and roll-out of highly effective vaccines in many industrialized countries, the COVID-19 crisis continues to create severe human health challenges, economic turmoil and recurring restrictions on daily life in most parts of the world. The pandemic's impact on global climate change adaptation processes is increasingly visible through direct effects on adaptation planning and constraints on available finance. Climate impacts also tend to be more severe in vulnerable developing economies, many of which are also among the worst affected by COVID-19. At the same time, rescue and recovery initiatives designed to kick start economies in the wake of the pandemic offer a unique opportunity to secure a green recovery by mainstreaming adaptation into public financing streams worth trillions of dollars, dwarfing the sums otherwise dedicated to adaptation. Furthermore, climate change and the pandemic share some striking similarities: like the pandemic, the climate change crisis is a systemic problem that requires coordinated global, national and local responses. Many of the lessons learned from handling the pandemic have the potential to serve as examples of how to improve climate adaptation planning and financing. Meanwhile, climate change continues its unrelenting path towards a warmer future. As the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in August 2021, starkly documents, some impacts are now irreversible. Many parts of the world have experienced unprecedented climate impacts this year, such as the heat dome and rampant wildfires in the Pacific Northwest of the United States of America and Canada; severe flooding in Western Europe, eastern parts of the United States of America, the province of Henan in China, and the state of Maharashtra in India; and imminent hunger after continued droughts in Madagascar. The assessment report also documents how, even under the most optimistic emissions mitigation scenarios where net-zero is reached by around 2050, global warming will continue in the short to medium term, potentially levelling off at ∞C above preindustrial levels. All this makes adaptation an increasingly urgent global imperative.  At the political level, international climate efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) continue, despite the postponement of the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26), which was put back from November 2020 to November 2021. COP 26 will have a strong focus on adaptation issues and will see consultations and work proceed towards the first Global Stocktake in 2023, including the submission of new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). AGR2021 provides an update on current actions and the emerging results of regional-level to national-level adaptation planning, finance and implementation worldwide (figure  All three elements are critical for tracking and assessing progress towards the global goal on adaptation. AGR2021 also expands and strengthens the assessment of future adaptation outcomes, in particular through the inclusion of qualitative expert judgements. In view of the ongoing pandemic, the report provides an in-depth assessment of the emerging consequences of COVID-19 in relation to adaptation planning and finance and highlights the lessons and opportunities for future adaptation efforts through economic growth and climate resilience as part of a green recovery. Status and progress of global adaptation planning, finance and implementation PLANNING Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change adaptation is becoming increasingly embedded in policy and planning across the world. National-level adaptation planning processes remain a critical element in the global response to the impacts of climate change, as underscored by the Paris Agreement. While early evidence suggests that some National Adaptation Plan (NAP) development processes have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among least developed countries, progress is still being made on national adaptation planning agendas. Around 79 per cent of all countries have now adopted at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument (for example, a plan, strategy, policy or law). This is an increase of 7 per cent since 2020 (figure  Furthermore, 9 per cent of countries that do not currently have such an instrument in place are in the process of developing one (no change since 2020). At least 65 per cent of countries have one or more sectoral plans in place and at least 26 per cent have one or more subnational planning instruments.  XII   Indicators of adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation planning show positive trends compared to 2020. While it is currently not possible to directly assess the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation planning due to a lack of consensus on definitions and approaches to their assessment, it is possible to analyse relevant elements indirectly by examining the comprehensiveness, inclusiveness, implementability, integration, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of planning instruments. Compared to a similar analysis presented in the 2020 edition of the Adaptation Gap Report (AGR2020), this year's report ≠ based on an updated analysis reflecting new submissions of NDCs, NAPs and Adaptation Communications ≠ shows that countries have made consistent progress in developing adaptation planning instruments and across almost all indicators of adequate and effective adaptation planning. This progress is largely incremental (within 10 per cent of the previous score), with the exception of areas such as stakeholder engagement, gender considerations and the use of policy instruments, which saw larger increases (figure  Regarding inclusiveness, more countries now demonstrate stakeholder engagement (an increase from  43 per cent to 70 per cent between 2020 and 2021) and gender considerations (an increase from 52 per cent to 73 per cent between 2020 and 2021). There was also a significant increase in the application of policy instruments deemed to enhance the implementability of adaptation plans through provisions for investments (50 per cent in 2021 compared to 31 per cent in 2020), regulations (49 per cent in 2021 compared to 28 per cent in 2020) and incentives (30 per cent in 2021 compared to 8 per cent in 2020). Likewise, over two-thirds of all countries (9 per cent more than in 2020) are now targeting priority sectors with their planning instruments. Progress is also being made on integration: 75 per cent of countries now have horizontal coordination mechanisms (compared to 68 per cent in 2020) and 32 per cent have vertical coordination mechanisms (compared to 26 per cent in 2020). On the other hand, progress is mixed for M&E: while 26 per cent of countries have M&E systems in place and another 36 per cent are in the process of developing a system, only 8 per cent of countries have evaluated their adaptation plans. This is frequently attributed to the lack of financial, human and technical resources.  XIII    FINANCING New estimates of the costs of adaptation and the estimated financial needs for adaptation from developing countries indicate higher values than previously reported. The review of the most recent adaptation cost estimates from the literature and the finance needs expressed by countries' submissions to the UNFCCC resulted in a number of major findings. First, estimates of the economic costs of climate change in developing countries are now generally higher than indicated in earlier studies. This is true both later in the century, under higher warming scenarios, but crucially also over the next two decades even under ambitious mitigation scenarios. Second, the estimated annual adaptation costs in the literature are now also generally in the upper range of the 2016 estimate of the Adaptation Gap Report of  US$ 140≠300 billion by 2030 and US$ 280≠500 billion by 2050. Third, a review of updated NDCs and NAPs indicates that estimates of adaptation financing needs are increasing in many countries, often due to the incorporation of more sectors. A sectoral analysis of submissions reveals that the four sectors of agriculture, infrastructure, water and disaster risk management make up three-quarters of quantified adaptation finance needs so far (figure  Taken together, these findings suggest increasing costs of adaptation compared to previous AGR assessments, particularly in the event of failing to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping the increase in the global average temperature well below 2∞C above pre-industrial levels. This new emerging evidence means a more detailed and systemic stocktake of the costs of adaptation and finance needs is required.  XIV   The evidence suggests that the adaptation finance gap is larger than indicated in 2020 and widening. Despite a recent trend of gradually increasing international public adaptation finance for developing countries up to 2019, adaptation finance flows are projected to stabilize or possibly even decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to financial institutions and governments ≠ including those in advanced economies, which provide the majority of dedicated international adaptation funding ≠ needing to prioritize limited resources to meet the urgent health and financial needs caused by COVID-19. While conclusive data is still pending, the most recent analysis indicates that climate finance flows to developing countries (for both mitigation and adaptation) reached US$  billion in 2019. In the absence of a significant increase of around US$ 20 billion (26 per cent) in 2020, the US$ 100 billion mobilization goal for 2020 will not have been met. Despite the limitations of the available evidence, estimated adaptation costs and likely adaptation financing needs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current international public adaptation finance flows. Evidence suggests that the gap is larger than indicated in the previous AGR (2020) and is widening, due to adaptation costs and finance needs being higher and funding flows remaining stable or decreasing. There is an urgent need to scale up and further increase public adaptation finance both for direct investment and for overcoming barriers to private-sector adaptation. New instruments, actors and approaches to scale up adaptation finance are emerging, including privatesector adaptation financing. These offer opportunities to raise adaptation finance (for example, resilience bonds) and to use public adaptation finance to leverage private  investment (for example, using blended finance to de-risk investments). However, due to the barriers to private finance (including around information, positive externalities and low revenues) and the public interventions or finance needed to overcome these, the rate of uptake and the scaling up of these new instruments remains slow. Furthermore, private investment will gravitate to opportunities where revenues are highest and risks are lowest. It is unlikely to target the most vulnerable in least developed countries or non-market sectors. This underscores the continued importance of international public support and the requirement to further increase ambition. I M P L E M E N TAT I O N Implementation of adaptation actions is continuing to grow slowly worldwide, despite uncertainty about future trajectories. Although there has been increased variability in the number of new projects over the last four years, the implementation of adaptation initiatives approved under the three multilateral funds serving the Paris Agreement through the provision of funding for adaptation (the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility) has risen slowly but steadily. The tendency for larger projects (more than US$ 10 million) also remains intact. Information from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development shows that the top 10 donors funded more than 2,600 projects between 2010 and 2019 with a principal focus on adaptation. This highlights the important role of bilateral support for adaptation (figure  About 20 per cent of the projects primarily address the agricultural sector and 20 per cent focus on ecosystems. Almost 30 per cent are multi-sectoral projects, while approximately two in 10 projects were directed towards either water or infrastructure. The sectoral priorities align with four of the top five adaptation priorities mentioned in countries' most recently submitted NDCs. However, health, the third most frequently mentioned priority, is seldom the primary focus, confirming the findings of the previous two reports. Regional disaggregation shows that adaptation initiatives are concentrated in eastern, southern and western Africa, South and Southeast Asia and parts of South America (figure  Implementation levels must be further scaled up to avoid falling behind with managing climate risks, particularly in developing countries. The limited data on the effectiveness of adaptation activities for reducing climate risk, combined with the escalating impacts documented in the most recent IPCC assessment report, implies that current implementation rates may not keep pace with increasing levels of climate change. The design of adaptation interventions needs to consider factors identified as making effective risk reduction more likely, including a thorough understanding of climate risks and their interaction with local contexts, inclusion of the target population in project design, joint agreement on objectives and ways of achieving them, and avoidance of potential and actual negative effects of adaptation actions (maladaptation). To avoid falling further behind, it is essential to enhance the implementation of adaptation actions and ensure more effective mainstreaming of climate risks into decision-making processes, including the COVID-19 recovery. Adaptation planning and implementation must also consider higher-end climate scenarios and impacts projected by the most recent IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 2021 to prepare for more intense risks than those already observed. EMERGING CONSEQUENCES OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change have created compound risks that negatively affect the adaptive capacity of governments, communities and societies, particularly in developing countries. The pandemic and associated responses by societies may be compounding risks by affecting our ability to respond to climate change. For example, during the Pacific cyclones in 2020, COVID-19 restrictions impeded disaster-response efforts through the quarantining of supplies and aid workers. The indirect effects of the pandemic also have the potential to severely reduce adaptive capacity. For instance, the negative economic consequences, such as the slow-down in some economic sectors, job losses and increased poverty (an additional 97 million people fell into poverty in 2020) tend to disproportionally affect vulnerable groups and further reduce their capacity to adapt to extreme climate events. Governments and businesses ≠ particularly small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries ≠ have also drawn on financial reserves and some/many have issued new debts to deal with the pandemic, making them vulnerable to future economic shocks, including from extreme climate events. While the stimulus packages for the COVID-19 recovery present a window of opportunity for green and resilient recoveries, these opportunities are not currently being seized. In response to the current pandemic, US$  trillion of fiscal stimulus was deployed by governments. However, only a small proportion of this funding appears to have gone towards adaptation. Less than one-third of 66 countries that were studied explicitly funded specific measures to address physical climate risks in their announced investment priorities up to January 2021 (figure  Moreover, the costs of servicing the debt raised to respond to the pandemic, combined with lower government revenues due to the economic impacts of COVID-19, may also hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries. The COVID-19 crisis also provides lessons to improve climate adaptation planning and financing, as well as opportunities to secure a green recovery. The pandemic highlights the importance of governments addressing compound risks through integrated risk management approaches, bringing together a set of cross-cutting risk management and adaptation objectives. For example, in many cases country-specific risk assessments of vulnerable groups, which are applied in adaptation planning processes like NAPs, can be used in broader risk management, including for the impacts of the pandemic. In terms of adaptation finance, the pandemic has created the conditions for extensive fiscal spending. It is critical that governments seize this opportunity to identify and prioritize interventions that achieve both economic growth and climate change resilience through a green recovery. Particularly in developing countries, governments can also increase the resilience of fiscal frameworks to deal with compound risks by establishing flexible disaster finance frameworks. These could be configured to ensure that predictable, timely and cost-effective finance is available to respond immediately to any emergency with the potential for systemic shocks, such as the pandemic or an extreme climate event. Finally, advanced economies have a clear role to play in helping developing countries that are both vulnerable to climate change and have suffered the economic consequences of the pandemic to free up fiscal space for green and resilient national COVID-19 recovery efforts through concessional finance and substantive debt relief to ""build forward better"". OUTLOOK ON THE GLOBAL PROGRESS OF ADAPTATION Overall, progress in national-level adaptation planning, finance and implementation worldwide generally continues to grow and may be partially accelerating, but further ambition is needed. The importance of adaptation at the national and international levels as a means to galvanize the response to climate risks is now widely accepted and mainstreaming continues to increase. New planning instruments have been released at increasing rates over the past decade and there is evidence of growing maturity in their design, potentially indicating early signs of acceleration. The implementation of new initiatives with a principal focus on adaptation has generally risen since 2010, albeit without indications of acceleration. Moreover, increased variability in the number of new initiatives over the last four years makes projections into the future more difficult. Finance for adaptation also continues to grow globally. However, this may not be the case everywhere,  particularly in developing countries that are among the most vulnerable to climate impacts. Nonetheless, there are signs that a more climate-resilient financial system is evolving through increased mainstreaming of climate risks and the emergence of new instruments, actors and approaches, even though acceleration is not yet visible. Despite encouraging trends, the rate and scale of adaptation progress at the national level is not enough to keep up with growing needs and tracking progress remains a challenge. Adaptation costs appear to be rising faster than adaptation finance, potentially leading to a widening of the adaptation finance gap. Moreover, finance flows seem to be levelling off, whereas the uptake and scaling up of innovative finance vehicles is still too low to catch up with growing adaptation needs. While the level of adaptation implementation is rising, there is still scarce evidence of climate risk reduction as a result of adaptation actions. Although planning instruments are maturing, several indicators of effectiveness and adequacy, such as for vertical integration and incentives for increasing implementability, are mixed. The continued low rate of setting up M&E systems is also of major concern, although there are encouraging signs of improvement as one-third of all countries are now in the process of developing a system. This limits the ability to track progress in adaptation, particularly in relation to the implementation of adaptation actions. In addition to making the availability of M&E systems more widespread, there must also be greater focus on assessing effectiveness and adequacy of adaptation interventions limiting climate risks rather than simply measuring outputs. Growing climate risks require a step change in adaptation ambition. Over the past two decades, climate risk warnings discussed in IPCC reports have continually risen due to increasingly stronger signals of reasons for concern. The most recent IPCC assessment report now concludes that some impacts of climate change are irreversible, even under highly ambitious mitigation regimes. Adaptation can significantly reduce loss and damage, particularly in the second half of the century, when climate impacts will accelerate (figure  While strong mitigation is the way to minimize impacts and long-term costs, increased ambition in terms of adaptation, particularly for finance and implementation, is critical to prevent existing gaps widening. Chapter 1 Setting the scene  Context In 2021, the global COVID-19 pandemic entered its second year. While encouraging trends are emerging, including the unprecedented development and roll-out of vaccines in most industrialized countries, the pandemic continues to pose severe challenges to human health, create economic turmoil and impose rolling restrictions on daily life in most parts of the world. Climate change, in the meantime, continues its unrelenting progress towards a warmer, more unpredictable future, riven by extreme events and trends, as starkly documented in the recent Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released in August 2021 (IPCC 2021). The situation is also reflected in the ever-increasing risks of floods, droughts, storms and heat waves. Recent examples include the heat dome in the Pacific northwest of the United States of America and Canada towards the end of June 2021, which saw the latter break its national temperature record three days in a row and by a total of ∞C (World Meteorological Organization 2021), and the severe flooding events in western Europe and the Province of Henan in China in July 2021. The recent AR6 report also showed that even under the most optimistic emissions scenarios that deliver net-zero by around 2050, global warming will continue in the short to medium term, peaking above ∞C, compared to pre-industrial levels. All this makes the global imperative of adaptation more urgent than ever before. At the global level, international climate efforts under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) continue, despite the postponement of the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 26), which was put back from November 2020 to November 2021. Consultations and work are proceeding ahead of the first Global Stocktake in 2023,1 including a political push to further define and operationalize the global goal on  To facilitate these discussions the UNFCCC Adaptation Committee also recently published a technical report on approaches to reviewing overall progress towards this goal (UNFCCC Adaptation Committee 2021). However, while promising, such developments have not yet been able to ensure real progress on adaptation tracking methodologies. Nor have they been able to resolve the associated and  persistent difference of opinions, with some Parties maintaining that global indicators are necessary and others stating that they will never adequately capture the full variety and breadth of adaptation across countries (UNFCCC 2021; Beauchamp, da Silva Bernardo and Bueno 2021).  In response to the need for science-based and policy-relevant global perspectives on adaptation, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has produced the Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) since 2014, making this 2021 report the sixth edition. From the outset, the report has pursued two main goals: firstly, to provide negotiators of Parties to the UNFCCC, the broader UNFCCC constituency and civil society with robust assessments of global adaptation gaps; and secondly to provide information on the status and results of global adaptation efforts under way (box  As such, while it remains an independent assessment, the objective of the AGR is closely aligned with that of the UNFCCC Global Stocktake.  The sixth Adaptation Gap Report  The Adaptation Gap Report 2021 ≠ its sixth edition ≠ is part of a new set of reports launched in 2020 in the run up to the 2023 Global Stocktake. It is structured in three parts:    Part I (chapters 3 to 5) assesses national and global  progress on adaptation, covering three central  elements of the adaptation process: planning,  financing3 and implementation. This part has formed  part of each AGR edition and indicates the status  and trends of the global adaptation process. Over  time, the reports will provide a cumulative record of  progress.    Part II (chapter 6) presents a deep dive into the three  elements of part I but focuses on a particular theme  or sector of society. The purpose of this deep dive  is twofold: first, it provides a more detailed picture  of progress in a selected focus area; second, it adds  additional perspectives, nuance and detail to the  overall assessment of progress contained in the  report. The theme or sector is decided by the report's  steering committee,4 taking into account global  developments, international priorities and the needs  of the UNFCCC and other global agreements.  1 The Paris Agreement Global Stocktake is a process for taking stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement with the aim of assessing the world's collective progress towards delivering on the agreement and its long-term goals. The first Global Stocktake will take place from 2021 to 2023 and the process will be repeated every five years. 2 The global goal on adaptation is defined in the Paris Agreement: ""enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change, with a view to contributing to sustainable development and ensuring an adequate response in the context of the temperature goal referred to in Article 2"". The temperature goal in question means ""holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2∞C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to ∞C above pre-industrial levels"" (UNFCCC 2021). 3 Under the UNFCCC, finance is one element of the ""means of implementation"" (finance, technology and capacity-building). In the context of this report, however, capacity-building and technology transfer are considered to be elements of ""implementation"" more broadly. 4 A steering committee, chaired by UNEP, guides the production of the report, including its thematic content and overall strategic direction, the selection of lead authors, and the review and sign-off of the report's content. The committee includes representatives from UNFCCC, IPCC and WASP, as well as a representative from the upcoming COP host. Chapter 1 ≠ Setting the scene  Box  Overview of past Adaptation Gap Reportsa UNEP, in partnership with sponsoring bodies and other partners, including the World Adaptation Science Programme (WASP),b produced its first AGR (UNEP 2014) for COP20 in Lima, Peru, in 2014. The report arose in response to requests from UNFCCC Parties for an assessment on adaptation that would complement the annual UNEP Emissions Gap Report (see, for example, UNEP 2020). In particular, the report aimed to provide an independent assessment of the ""adaptation gap"" to help inform UNFCCC discussions on adaptation ahead of COP21 in Paris in 2015. From the first AGR, it was clear that assessing the adaptation gap was going to be very different and methodologically much more challenging than evaluating the annual emissions gap. The first AGR proposed defining the adaptation gap as ""the difference between actually implemented adaptation and a societally set goal, determined largely by preferences related to tolerated climate change impacts, and reflecting resource limitations and competing priorities"" (UNEP 2014). It also provided a preliminary framework for assessing adaptation gaps and proposed three dimensions: the funding gap, the technology gap and the knowledge gap.  The second AGR was produced in 2016, providing an in-depth assessment of the adaptation finance gap, looking at both estimates of the costs of adaptation and the availability of bilateral, multilateral and private sector financing. The third AGR was released in 2017 and did not assess a thematic gap. Instead, it focused on the methodological issues involved in assessing global progress on adaptation. In 2018, the fourth AGR introduced a thematic topic alongside the assessment of adaptation progress in terms of enabling environments, adaptive capacity and finance. The focus was on the adaptation gap in the health sector. The fifth AGR, which was published in 2020, introduced a framing focused on assessing progress by aiming to answer three important questions: What are we doing today to adapt? To what extent are we currently reducing climate risks? To what extent will our adaptation trajectory help us reduce future climate risks? The report also included a deep dive into the answers to these questions, focusing on Nature-based Solutions.     Part III (covered in chapters 2 and 7) introduces a recovery plans.

It focuses on adaptation progress at the global and national scales, relying primarily on publications from national governments (for example, documents submitted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] process). It has also expanded the sources of information to include recent peer-reviewed scientific literature and reports by multilateral organizations and think tanks. This chapter frames the report both in terms of the climate risk context within which adaptation is taking place (section  and the conceptual and methodological approach used to understand adaptation progress (section   The climate risk context Climate risk is a function of exposure and vulnerability to climate hazards. Current and future climate risks will not only be determined by changes in global temperature levels and associated hazards at the local scale, they will ultimately result from the combination of these hazards with the affected systems' exposure and vulnerability. Due to interactions between affected systems, there are cascading and often reinforcing consequences of climate-driven hazards on natural systems and human systems and sectors. As a result, only a combination of adaptation ≠ the purpose of which is primarily to minimize exposure and vulnerability to a changing climate ≠ and ambitious mitigation actions can reduce climate risks over different timescales and in the various ecological and societal systems around the world. Accordingly, adaptation must be considered a priority not only at the national and local levels but also as an issue of high global concern. This means there is an urgent need to track global progress on adaptation and identify gaps.  Appraisal of climate risk is changing over time Our appraisal of climate risk has evolved as we learn more about the interactions between rising temperatures and climate impacts. Since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment Report (Smith et al. 2001) this relationship has been expressed as ""reasons for concern"" and presented in the iconic ""burning embers"" diagram shown in figure  (Zommers et al. 2020). The evolution of this framework and associated conclusions across the IPCC assessment cycles show that risk levels at a given temperature have generally increased from one IPCC report to the next, particularly for higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Accordingly, climate impacts are likely to be larger than previously projected and the related cost of adaptation and residual losses and damages will also be higher. In turn, this means it will be necessary to be more ambitious and act sooner than anticipated to avoid  high risks through mitigation and adaptation. Assessments also show that moderate levels of risk across all ""burning embers"" are virtually unavoidable, even if the global temperature rise is kept to ∞C above pre-industrial levels through ambitious climate change mitigation (HoeghGuldberg et al. 2018; Magnan et al. 2021). Similarly, this is a strong call to ramp up adaptation planning, finance and implementation to reduce residual climate impacts on people, society and nature.  Estimating global climate risk The NDCs of the Parties do not currently reflect the level of ambition required for mitigation that would avoid locking in temperature changes that will result in high risks to essentially all of the ""reasons for concern"" (UNFCCC 2021). Average global temperatures are projected to reach 3∞C above pre-industrial levels at the end of this century, a point at which many fragile and unique systems, for example, will have been heavily deteriorated or even lost (IPCC 2021). The IPCC estimates that temperatures will likely be above rather than below the ∞C threshold in the near term (2021≠2040) even under a very low greenhouse gas emissions scenario, and will very likely cross this marker without strong mitigation action (IPCC 2021). The three recent special reports of the IPCC on the ∞C threshold, land and ocean≠cryosphere, respectively (IPCC 2018; IPCC 2019a; IPCC 2019b), provide more details of the risks to natural and human systems, allowing a better understanding of ""global climate risk"". A synthesis study using a composite risk index shows firstly that climate change impacts are expected to substantially increase over the course of this century, probably in an accelerated way; and secondly, while different societies and social groups around the globe will be affected differently in the coming decades, climate impacts will affect us all (Magnan et al. 2021). The IPCC special reports on ocean≠cryosphere and land (Hurlbert et al. 2019; Oppenheimer et al. 2019) assessed climate risk levels under contrasting mitigation-adaptation scenarios in contexts including representative low-lying coastal settlements (atoll islands, deltas, megacities, arctic communities), food insecurity, land degradation and desertification. The combined results illustrate the potential outcomes of different societal adaptation at the global level (figure , with the potential to reduce today's global climate risk level by almost a half by the end of this century under both low and high mitigation scenarios (Magnan et al. 2021). However, even ambitious adaptation will not eliminate all future climate risks. Residual risks will rise in the second half of the century, albeit at much lower levels than under less ambitious adaptation. The continuous rise in climate impacts means that adaptation costs and the costs of residual losses and damages will invariably continue to rise as the century progresses. Impacts will be felt much more strongly in many developing countries, however, strong mitigation action would avoid many of these costs, particularly in the second half of the century (Admiraal et al. 2016; De Cian et al. 2016; UNEP 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; UNEP 2021; Chapagain et al. 2020). Strong mitigation action will impose earlier costs, but climate change cannot be seen as an optimization problem in which estimated mitigation costs are simply compared against the estimated costs of adaptation and damage. Such an approach disregards the significant uncertainties surrounding all cost estimates. For instance, despite improving to better reflect observations (Ueckerdt et al. 2019), the top-down damage functions used  in integrated assessment models are rather simplistic and do not take into account ethical considerations or non-monetary loss and damage (Walsh, Hormio and Purves (eds.) 2016; GarcÌa 2020; Hattori 2021). Moreover, they disregard the possibility of large-scale discontinuities with catastrophic consequences (IPCC 2018; Dietz et al. 2021). As such, considering the uncertainties, the IPCC special report on ∞C estimates that limiting global warming to ∞C instead of 2∞C would avoid economic damage of 22 per cent (10≠26 per cent) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018).  Framing of the adaptation assessment presented in the AGR2021 Understanding adaptation progress essentially means asking three intertwined questions:  What are we doing today to adapt?  To what extent are we currently reducing climate risks?  Depending on our mitigation trajectory, will our adaptation trajectory help us reduce future climate risks? Establishing a clear framing (section  and providing guidance (section  is a critical part of assessing global adaptation progress, even though answering these questions still raises important methodological issues and data challenges.   The overarching framing This report builds on previous AGRs (UNEP 2017; UNEP 2021) to address ""adaptation progress"" in three distinct ways (figure  First, adaptation actions and outputs relate to the question: what has been done until today to adapt? Outputs are assessed in the AGR in both quantitative terms (for example, the number of plans, the amount of financing committed, and the type and scale of implementation activities) and qualitative terms (for example, how actionable plans are and how they address climate risks, and the types and targets of action). This provides an overview of global progress on adaptation planning, finance and implementation. Second, it is also key to understand the adaptation outcomes that have already been achieved in order to determine the extent to which we have actually reduced climate risk levels. Assessing outcomes is considerably harder than tracking outputs, for example, due to a gap in understanding the effects of adaptation on current climate risk levels (UNEP 2021), as well as because of the value judgements associated with making statements on the results of actions (UNEP 2017). Third, expected outcomes refer to the question of the extent to which our adaptation trajectory (and in relation with our mitigation trajectory) will help us reduce future climate risks. Comprehensively assessing adaptation progress in terms of future climate risks requires the combined appraisal of both observed and expected adaptation outcomes. In addition to the aforementioned challenges associated with assessing current outcomes, there are large uncertainties around the ways in which climate change will affect future climate risks (IPCC 2021), as well as the definition of ""(un)acceptable"" levels of risk from one society to another (Handmer and Nalau 2019). This means that caution should be exercised in our understanding of assessments of future outcomes.   Criteria to assess adaptation progress in the AGR series The AGR2020 introduced a number of categories in order to consistently assess adaptation planning, finance and implementation (table  Information on progress, gaps and factors constraining the interpretation of findings provided in the chapters of the report form the basis for the synthesis in chapter 7. This report presents a first attempt at informing expected outcomes of adaptation in the absence of robust information about future trends in planning, financing and implementation. This is based on forward-looking expert judgement and involved a survey to gather additional insights into future trends for the various assessment criteria based on the expertise of the chapter authors, grounded in scientific evidence and deep knowledge.   Chapter 3 Global progress on adaptation planning Key messages    Countries have made consistent progress in developing adaptation planning instruments and across  almost all indicators of adequate and effective adaptation planning. This progress is mostly incremental  (within 10 per cent of scores from the 2020 analysis), with the exception of stakeholder engagement,  gender and the use of policy instruments, which saw greater improvements.    At present, 79 per cent of countries have at least one national-level adaptation planning instrument in  place, up from 72 per cent in 2020.    In terms of the adequacy and effectiveness of those plans, there has been a significant increase in inclusive  adaptation planning and the application of policy instruments deemed to enhance the implementability  of adaptation plans, including regulations and provisions for investment and incentives. Countries also  progressed in terms of the comprehensiveness of their adaptation planning.    There is evidence of steady progress on the integration of adaptation across sectors and levels, although  results remain mixed, with three-quarters having horizontal coordination mechanisms in place, compared  to just around one-third with vertical coordination mechanisms. Furthermore, at least 65 per cent of  countries have at least one sectoral plan in place and at least 26 per cent have at least one subnational  planning instrument.    Only around a quarter of countries have a monitoring and evaluation framework in place, reflecting the  difficulty of designing and implementing such frameworks.   Introduction In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that anthropogenic climate change is already affecting weather and climate extremes across the world and that the scale of recent changes across the climate system, as well as the current state of many of its aspects, are unprecedented (IPCC 2021). At the same time, in 2021 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) found that emissions reductions that were estimated based on targets communicated through countries' new or updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ""fall far short of what is required"" to limit global warming to ∞C or even ∞C above pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC 2021a). These findings underscore the urgency of developing ≠ and subsequently implementing ≠ adequate and effective adaptation plans to reduce vulnerability and build resilience to withstand the current and future impacts of climate change.  and reducing vulnerability (article  The Agreement also stresses that adaptation should follow a gender-responsive and participatory approach, with a view to integrating adaptation into relevant socioeconomic and environmental policies and actions (article  As part of the Global Stocktake under the UNFCCC process, Parties will review the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation and progress towards the global goal on adaptation (articles  and 14). The Adaptation Gap Report 2020 (AGR2020) assessed the global status of adaptation planning by examining the number of adaptation plans and strategies produced by 196 Parties to the UNFCCC and the extent to which these plans and strategies are effective and adequate (UNEP 2021).1 This chapter provides an update on the previous analysis, providing both a more advanced snapshot of adaptation planning worldwide and a sense of how this compares to the 2020 assessment.  All Parties to the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2016) commit to engage in adaptation planning processes and the implementation of actions, including the development or enhancement of relevant plans (article , with a view to contributing to the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience   Methodology Applying the same methodology as the AGR2020, this chapter looks at the overall number of national, subnational and sectoral adaptation strategies, plans and laws. Five  1 As at 5 August 2021, 191 of the Parties were also Parties to the Paris Agreement. Given the focus on analysis at the national level, the European Union, which is also a Party to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, is excluded from the analysis. Chapter 3 ≠ Global progress on adaptation planning  Table  Overview of criteria used to assess adaptation planning (including their underlying rationale) and associated indicators  Rationale  Indicators  1. Comprehensiveness  Identifying climate risks and hazards and assessing vulnerability to existing and future climate hazards and impacts constitute foundational steps of the adaptation planning process. Countries can then use this information to prioritize sectors for adaptation measures and develop a comprehensive adaptation plan by identifying adaptation options that align with these priorities and respond to the risks, hazards and vulnerabilities they face.   Adaptation options comprehensively address assessed risks, impacts, hazards or vulnerabilities  2. Inclusiveness  For adaptation planning to adequately reflect existing and forthcoming risks and vulnerabilities and to effectively enhance the ownership of any implementation, emphasizing the engagement of all relevant stakeholders and gender considerations.   Dedicated stakeholder engagement process in place  Consideration of gender  3. Implementability  Planning can be assumed to be effective if it leads to real implementation by public and private actors. As such, planning can benefit from a central administrative body that is officially in charge of adaptation policymaking and a variety of policy instruments, including investment, incentives and regulations that lead to the desired outcomes.  Presence of:  a central administrative body  regulations  investments  incentives  4. Integration  Integrating or mainstreaming adaptation planning and action horizontally (across sectors) and vertically (across levels of administration) is increasingly recognized as an important component of effective adaptation planning. This helps ensure that adaptation planning is comprehensive, avoids the duplication of effort or maladaptation, and enhances synergies.  Presence of:  sectoral adaptation plans and coordination mechanisms  subnational adaptation plans and coordination mechanisms  5. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E)a  For planning to remain adequate and effective, it must be periodically monitored and evaluated.

The five criteria are detailed in table   These criteria and associated indicators were chosen as they respond to the provisions of the Paris Agreement setting out the commitments of the Parties (articles  and  They have also been included in relevant global guidance documents on adaptation planning2 or in previous global or regional assessments of adaptation  For example, the 2012 UNFCCC Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) technical guidelines for the NAP process (UNFCCC LEG 2012), the 2015 PEG M&E tool for the LEG (UNFCCC LEG 2015) and the 2016 Guidance on vertical integration (DazÈ et al. 2016). 3 For example, the 2018 Evaluation of the European Union Strategy on adaptation to climate change (European Commission 2018) and the 2019 global review of national laws and policies on climate change adaptation (Nachmany et al. 2019).  As part of a desk review by the authors,4 24 National Adaptation Plans (NAPs),5 18 Adaptation Communications6 and 151 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with adaptation components7 were analysed for evidence of the chosen indicators. Where none of these documents was available for a country, National Communications were  Data on national laws and policy instruments was also drawn from, cross checked with and complemented by Grantham Research Institute Climate Change Laws of the World  Data limitations include the lack of rigorous standards regarding the accuracy and completeness of reporting by countries. As with the initial analysis, the aim is to assess as many countries as possible, with all indicators are scored as present, absent or in progress/partial. While this allows for the construction of a broad global picture of adaptation planning, it hides important nuances and significant differences between countries.  It is also critical to acknowledge that planning (even good planning) is only a precursor to the implementation of adaptation measures. This chapter stops short of assessing whether plans have actually had an impact and have been followed through at the national, subnational and sectoral levels.  Progress in adaptation planning  Status of adaptation planning Globally, 79 per cent of countries have addressed adaptation at the national level through a plan, strategy, policy or law. This is an increase over the analysis from 2020, when 72 per cent of countries had a national adaptation instrument in place. A further 9 per cent of countries are in the process of developing their first national instrument (figure  The cut-off for the analysis of the various documents and databases was 5 August 2021. 5 NAPs here refer exclusively to the plans submitted to the UNFCCC NAP Central. More information is available at  Pages/ 6 More information available at  7 More information available at  8 Annex I ( and Non-Annex I ( 10 This includes national plans, strategies, policies or laws explicitly and primarily focused on adaptation or focused on climate change more broadly, with a significant adaptation component. National adaptation programmes of action were not included in the tally due to their unique role as a tool for LDCs to identify and act on urgent priority adaptation activities, rather than as an instrument to facilitate an overarching or holistic adaptation response. Chapter 3 ≠ Global progress on adaptation planning  Box  Progress by developing countries in formulating and implementing NAPs Developing countries have made gradual progress in formulating and implementing NAPs since the process was established in 2010. However, progress has accelerated since 2015. As at September 2021, at least 125 of the 154 developing countries had undertaken activities related to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. Some countries had developed and submitted sectoral and thematic strategies and other relevant outputs. Twenty two countries had put in place or were working on their M&E frameworks or systems for the NAPs.  A detailed set of measures is shown in figure  below. Fourteen countries had also submitted at least one project concept note to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for implementing priority actions associated with their NAPs. A further, eight countries had received approval for funding from the Least Developed Countries Fund for activities related to the process to formulate and implement NAPs. Technical support is provided by the Least Developed Countries Expert Group, other constituted bodies under the UNFCCC, United Nations organizations, specialized agencies and other relevant organizations, as well as by bilateral and multilateral agencies, including through support programmes.   Under UNFCCC, the process of formulating and implementing NAPs remains a cornerstone of adaptation planning efforts, particularly for developing countries (UNFCCC 2020). Indeed, many of these countries already have one or more national adaptation instruments in place and are simultaneously in the process of formulating a NAP, highlighting the added value of this instrument over and above other national plans, policies, laws and frameworks for adaptation. Box  provides an overview of NAP progress to date.  UNFCCC Adaptation Committee 2019b; Mimura et al. 2014; UNFCCC 2019), wherein countries are building and improving on their initial plans and other instruments. The growth in adaptation planning throughout the world has taken place alongside increasingly dire warnings from the scientific community ≠ particularly the IPCC ≠ about the need for adaptation, alongside an expansion of institutions under the UNFCCC to support the adaptation efforts of countries (figure ; see also UNFCCC Adaptation Committee 2019a).  Since the first national-level adaptation instrument identified in this analysis was established in 2000, the pace of adaptation planning around the world has accelerated considerably. Furthermore, almost half of the countries with a national instrument in place have developed at least one further national-level instrument, which serves to replace, update or complement the initial adaptation plan, policy, strategy or law. In some cases, this may reflect progress in iterative adaptation planning (see, for example,  Looking ahead, the presence of clearly defined national adaptation goals and quantitative and qualitative adaptation targets could be an important way of gauging where adaptation planning has now become outcome-oriented and is measurable. Indeed, new and updated NDCs suggest that countries are already moving in this direction by including more quantitative and time-bound targets as part of their adaptation contributions (box  provides a snapshot of recent developments; see also UNFCCC 2021).  established from 2000 to 2019 that had not been reflected in the 2020 edition of the AGR.  Chapter 3 ≠ Global progress on adaptation planning  Box  National laws and policies National legislative and executive actions (laws, policies, strategies, plans, etc.) are essential to translate adaptation planning into action. Setting clear targets, defining clear governance and accountability mechanisms, securing implementation budgets and tying policy into broader societal frameworks and processes are all critical aspects for success. During 2020 and 2021, several national laws and policies focusing on adaptation or disaster risk management were adopted or amended significantly. For example, the Russian Federation has published its first National Adaptation Action Plan; Spain and South Africa have published new adaptation policies that significantly update older ones (from 2006 and 2011, respectively); Japan has updated its Basic Disaster Prevention Plan to include disease prevention; and South Korea has amended its National Strategic Plan for Climate Adaptation (2021≠2025).  Similarly, Dominica published its Climate Resilience and Recovery Plan, which is a requirement of the Climate Resilience Act 2018 and is aligned with the country's National Resilience Development Strategy developed in 2018. The plan sets targets, defines initiatives and outlines the resources required to implement resilience measures. It also sets clear and quantifiable targets for 2030, including zero fatalities from extreme weather events, 90 per cent of housing stock built or retrofitted to meet resilient building codes and 100 per cent resettlement of individuals living in physically vulnerable locations. Lastly, it includes time-sensitive targets for access to infrastructure and resources during and after extreme weather events (including critical government and emergency services, water, local and international transport, power, schools, health services and telecommunications).   Adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation planning The results of the assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of adaptation planning are discussed below. Table  provides an overview of the results for all 196 Parties. Furthermore, given the acute vulnerability of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) to the impacts of climate change, the table also disaggregates the results for these groups. Figure  provides a comparison with the situation in 2020. COMPREHENSIVENESS More than two-thirds of countries identified a set of adaptation options within their identified priority sectors, a 15 per cent increase on the 2020 analysis. The analysis of available reporting has shown that 23 per cent have adaptation measures that partially matched their identified priority  A total of 9 per cent of countries either did not address adaptation options that link to key priorities within their assessments or did not address any adaptation options in the documents reviewed. This is a 15 per cent reduction on the 2020 analysis. INCLUSIVENESS Compared to 2020, the number of countries addressing stakeholder engagement in their reports has increased by 22 per cent. As of 5 August 2021, about 70 per cent of countries have developed their adaptation plans through consultations with a broad range of stakeholders. The  stakeholders involved included different government levels, non-governmental and sectoral organizations, research institutes and the private sector. Out of 70 per cent of countries identified as developing adaptation plans through stakeholder consultations, 71 per cent (50 per cent of all countries) provided details on their stakeholder consultation process, which included aspects such as identifying and informing relevant stakeholders in all key sectors, organizing participatory stakeholder workshops or elaborating on the process to involve different relevant stakeholders through a coordinating body. In terms of gender considerations in adaptation planning, the growth rate is even higher (40 per cent). This is mainly due to the considerable number of new and updated NDCs submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat since October 2020. According to the documents reviewed, 73 per cent of countries highlighted the importance of integrating gender considerations into adaptation planning. This represents a significant increase from the previous analysis, which found that 52 per cent of countries were integrating gender considerations into their planning, suggesting that they are taking swift action on the imperative of following a gender-responsive approach. The way countries report on gender considerations continues to vary considerably, from generally emphasizing the imperative of enhancing gender equality in their adaptation planning to aligning their approaches to gender responsiveness with the relevant provisions of the enhanced gender action plan (box   In some cases, countries also describe efforts to engage particular groups of stakeholders in their adaptation planning, including indigenous peoples and local communities. This follows from the acknowledgement of the Parties, in article  of the Paris Agreement, that adaptation action should be based on and guided by aspects such as traditional knowledge, the knowledge of indigenous peoples and local knowledge systems. In addition to consulting indigenous peoples and local communities while producing their plans and commitments, there are also examples of countries making reference to supporting indigenous-led solutions and better reflecting that leadership in climate plans, as well as strengthening the capacity of institutions to integrate indigenous and local knowledge in vulnerability and adaptation assessments.  IMPLEMENTABILITY Y A total of 43 per cent of countries report having put in place a central administrative body to oversee adaptation policymaking and implementation, while the remainder have not done so. This represents a slight increase from the previous analysis in 2020, which reported that only 35 per cent of countries have such a body in place. Common institutional barriers and enablers related to adaptation planning and implementation for both developed and developing countries include institutional coordination and key actors, advocates and champions, initiating mainstreaming and sustaining momentum for adaptation. A central administrative body that is primarily responsible for adaptation can therefore help bolster the effectiveness and continuity of adaptation planning.   Box  UNFCCC Gender Action Plan At COP 25 in 2019, the Parties agreed a five-year enhanced Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan to promote gender equality and enhance the implementation of gender-related decisions and mandates in the UNFCCC process. Parties were invited to submit information on efforts to implement the gender action plan in their national reporting under the UNFCCC process. Countries are increasingly integrating gender-responsive approaches into adaptation planning by using gender-disaggregated data and gender analysis to identify gaps and needs, as well as developing targets and measures to enhance gender equality and monitoring progress in gender-responsive budgeting, planning and implementation. Examples include:   The updated NDC of Cabo Verde contains additional detail on measures for climate-empowering women and reducing their vulnerabilities, such as setting a target of increasing the female employment rate to at least 40 per cent in the marine and coastal sector by 2030 (Cabo Verde 2021).  Canada continues to advance gender equality and gender-responsive climate policy development and action at the national and multilateral levels. Its latest climate plan included a gender analysis to ensure gender equality in existing policies and programmes and the development of new ones (Canada 2021a; Canada 2021b).  The Marshall Islands committed to include enhanced gender-responsive actions and investments in its NAP (Marshall Islands 2020).  Since 2020, there has been a notable increase in the application of the various instruments to ensure the effectiveness of the different adaptation plans and policies. Almost 100 countries have added at least one policy instrument compared to 2020. Half the countries have set aside financial resources to support their identified adaptation options, including through direct funding or budget allocations, a significant increase from the 31 per cent mentioned in the 2020 edition of the AGR. Countries are continuing to make progress in costing their adaptation options, including as part of the development of NDCs and NAPs, and investing domestic resources in adaptation, though there continues to be significant needs for international support in the form of finance, technology transfer and capacity-building, as the most recent NDCs submitted by Parties to the UNFCCC have made clear (UNFCCC 2021). Around half of countries are now making use of regulatory instruments such as standards and obligations, building codes, zoning/spatial planning and disclosure obligations. Moreover, almost a third include incentives such as taxes or subsidies to encourage adaptation action. Yet, around a quarter of countries do not apply any of those instruments to enhance the implementability of their adaptation plans. INTEGR ATION Currently, 75 per cent of countries report having horizontal coordination mechanisms in place, such as, interministerial committees. This is an 11 per cent increase in established  mechanisms, compared to the 2020 analysis. Additionally, 32 per cent have vertical coordination mechanisms in place, such as a national committee, working group or other body related to adaptation, with representatives from different governance levels. This is 22 per cent higher than found in the previous analysis. Lastly, at least 8 per cent of countries are in the process of establishing vertical coordination mechanisms. Countries are also advancing horizontal and vertical integration through sectoral and subnational plans. Around 65 per cent of countries have one or more standalone sectoral plans in place that address climate change adaptation,12 while at least 5 per cent of countries are developing such plans. While these figures are limited to stand-alone plans, in many cases countries have also embedded sectoral plans within overarching national-level ones. Furthermore, 26 per cent of countries mention at least one subnational plan in place13 and an additional 10 per cent of countries noted that such plans are in progress. MONITORING AND EVALUATION Some 26 per cent of countries have dedicated monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems for adaptation in place, with a further 36 per cent in the process of developing such a  A quarter of countries have published an M&E-related progress report while only 8 per cent of countries have already undertaken an evaluation of their adaptation plans. This limits opportunities for learning and revising adaptation planning to make it more adequate and effective.  Chapter 3 ≠ Global progress on adaptation planning   This is among the lowest scores in the analysis, which is likely due to the various challenges associated with designing and implementing M&E systems for adaptation, such as a lack of standard best practice methodologies and the difficulty of attributing outcomes to specific adaptation interventions (Christiansen et al. 2016; Bours, McGinn and Pringle 2014). Indeed, as with the 2020 analysis, countries continue to reference these challenges and stress that additional resources and capacity-building are required to overcome them and develop effective and sustainable M&E systems. ADAPTATION PL ANNING IN LDCS AND SIDS The Paris Agreement recognizes that LDCs and SIDS are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints (articles  and  To understand how these countries are progressing with adaptation planning in the face of these challenges, the analyses mentioned above have been disaggregated into SIDS and LDCs (table  These results show that, while SIDS and LDCs are performing on par with the global average in most areas, in other areas (for example, subnational plans, M&E, policy instruments and ≠ in the case of SIDS, vertical coordination and central administrative bodies as well), they are lagging behind by 10 per cent or more. In some cases ≠ such as subnational plans and vertical coordination ≠ these indicators may be of slightly less importance in smaller countries like SIDS. Stakeholder engagement is the one area in which SIDS significantly outperform the global average. Overall, however, it is clear that SIDS and LDCs continue to require support to advance their adaptation planning.  Conclusion and outlook Around the world, countries continue to make progress in establishing adaptation plans, strategies and laws at the national, subnational and sectoral levels, and in taking  steps to bolster the quality of these instruments. While the widespread disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have weakened this progress in some cases (chapter 6 provides an analysis on the emerging consequences of the pandemic on national adaptation planning), it is not yet possible to draw decisive conclusions regarding its impact on global adaptation planning. Nonetheless, it is clear that countries remain committed to developing new adaptation plans, strategies and policies to meet their evolving needs, and to improving these instruments so that they are better equipped to enhance their adaptive capacity, strengthen their resilience and reduce their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. Indeed, as compared with the baseline analysis in AGR2020, this chapter shows progress both in terms of the number of plans and their adequacy and effectiveness. With the exception of M&E, for which a direct comparison is not possible due to the change in scoring methodology, this analysis reflects progress in all indicators on both the status of adaptation planning and its adequacy and effectiveness. While, in most cases, this progress has been incremental, there are areas, such as the field of gender, where there has been a large boost in progress. At the same time, significant gaps remain with respect to vertical coordination mechanisms, subnational plans, central administrative bodies for adaptation and M&E. Countries and other stakeholders should therefore redouble their efforts in these areas, including support in particularly challenging areas, such as M&E, in order to put themselves and the world on a path towards adequate and effective adaptation planning. However, the ultimate test of this adequacy and effectiveness will be whether these plans are implemented and, in turn, whether this implementation reduces risk and vulnerability and bolsters resilience and adaptive capacity (chapter 5 discusses implementation in further detail).  4 Chapter 4 Global progress on adaptation finance  Key messages    Since the 2020 edition of the Adaptation Gap Report (AGR), there have been some new estimates of the  costs of adaptation for developing countries, reporting higher figures than earlier studies. There are also  new estimates of adaptation finance needs from some updated Nationally Determined Contributions  and National Adaptation Plans, which report higher estimates for many countries.    This new evidence indicates potentially higher adaptation costs and financing needs than indicated in  previous AGRs. This emerging evidence requires a detailed updated stocktake of the costs of adaptation  and finance needs.    The costs of adaptation, and thus adaptation finance needs, will be much lower if the goals of Paris  Agreement are met.    While there has been a trend of gradually increasing international public adaptation finance to developing  countries in recent years (up to 2019), adaptation finance flows are projected to decline as a result of  the COVID-19 pandemic.    Although final data still need to be prepared and analysed for 2020, unless it shows an increase in  climate finance of 26 per cent between 2019 and 2020 (compared to just 2 per cent between 2018 and  2019), the US$ 100 billion target for 2020 will not have been met.    There have been positive trends in the emergence of new instruments, actors and approaches to scale  up adaptation, including in the private sector. These include opportunities to leverage private-sector  investment with public finance. However, due to the barriers to private finance and the public intervention  or finance needed to overcome these, the rate of upscaling remains slow. Furthermore, private-sector  investment will be uneven across countries and sectors and is unlikely to target the most vulnerable.    The available evidence has limitations but suggests that estimated adaptation costs, and likely adaptation  financing needs in developing countries, are five to ten times greater than current international public  adaptation finance flows.    The evidence suggests that the gap is larger than indicated in the AGR2020 and is widening for two  reasons. First, new bottom-up evidence indicates higher estimated adaptation costs/needs. Second,  known finance flows seem broadly stable or may even be decreasing.    There remains an urgent need to scale up and further increase international public adaptation finance,  for both direct investment and for overcoming barriers to private-sector adaptation.   Introduction The adaptation finance gap has been defined as the difference between the estimated costs of meeting a given adaptation target and the amount of finance available to do so (UNEP 2014). In practice, this is a simplification: estimating the finance gap is challenging, both in conceptual and quantitative terms (UNEP 2016a). Furthermore, while a common monetary metric helps to  define the adaptation finance gap, it is important to note that finance is a means rather than an end: the availability of funds does not guarantee that they will be used efficiently and effectively. This chapter provides an update on the adaptation finance gap for developing countries (defined as the non-Annex I countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC]1), as reported in previous  1 This refers to countries that have ratified or acceded to the UNFCCC that are not included in Annex I to the Convention. The industrialized countries listed in Annex I to the Convention includes the 24 original Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members, the European Union and 14 countries with economies in transition. The List of Parties to the Convention is available at  Chapter 4 ≠ Global progress on adaptation finance  Adaptation Gap Reports (AGRs) (UNEP 2014; UNEP 2016a; UNEP 2016b; UNEP 2018; UNEP 2021). It has reviewed the evidence base on the estimated costs of adaptation, including recent studies, and also considered the emerging estimates of country adaptation needs from National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This provides an updated view on the potential costs of adaptation. It has also reviewed the latest data on global adaptation finance flows. This allows, in theory, a comparison of finance flows against the estimated adaptation costs, and thus makes it possible to determine the potential size of the adaptation finance gap (and whether this is changing) in developing countries. However, the analysis of both adaptation costs and finance flows is very challenging (UNEP 2016a; UNEP 2021). In this respect, this chapter provides insights rather than new numbers. Finally, it provides an update on the opportunities and progress to bridge the gap and discusses new insights since the 2020 edition of the AGR (UNEP 2021).  The costs of adaptation and adaptation finance needs Previous AGRs have reviewed the evidence base for the costs of adaptation in developing countries, concluding that there is no definitive estimate for the (global) costs of adaptation, not least because there is no agreed (quantitative) adaptation target. The wide range of cost estimates in the literature reflects major differences in targets, future scenarios, methods, assumptions, coverage (sectors and impacts), investment periods, uncertainty and the costs of implementation. A key challenge is uncertainty. Future climate change varies with future emissions scenarios (for example, a global temperature rise of 2∞C or 4∞C by end of century, relative to pre-industrial levels) and the uncertainty around climate model outputs for a given scenario (for example, wetter or drier climate projections). Different scenarios and models lead to different impacts of climate change, and thus different adaptation costs. This leads to a large possible range of values, making proactive and planned adaptation difficult in practice, since it requires decision-making under conditions of uncertainty and changes the options and costs compared to analyses of adaptation for a single, precisely defined future. The amount of adaptation needed (and thus its total cost) also depends on the level of benefits that adaptation delivers (that is, its effectiveness), which also varies with the objectives. A further issue is whether countries' existing adaptation deficits are included in the estimated cost of adaptation. This deficit is defined as the adverse impacts of natural (that is, non-human-induced) climate variability and extremes (for example, from periodic floods that already happen, rather  than those arising due to human-induced climate change). This deficit is often large in developing countries. While the existing adaptation deficit is not primarily caused by climate change, future adaptation will be less effective and will involve higher costs if it is not addressed first. There are also issues regarding whether these deficits are included in country estimates of adaptation finance needs.  Global costs of adaptation in developing countries The AGR2016 (UNEP 2016a; UNEP 2016b) estimated that the annual costs of adaptation in developing countries could be between US$ 140 billion and US$ 300 billion by 2030. Moreover, with increasing levels of climate change, the annual cost was projected to increase to between US$ 280 billion and US$ 500 billion by  The figures reflect low and high future emissions scenarios (approximately 2∞C and 4∞C pathways by the end of the century, relative to pre-industrial levels), therefore, the costs of adaptation are projected to be much lower if the Paris Agreement goals are met. These estimates were compiled from a combination of global integrated, global sectoral, and national studies and must only be considered as indicative (discussion on the challenges of estimation is included in Annex  [online]). This range of estimates was reported in subsequent AGRs (UNEP 2018; UNEP 2021). Since the AGR2016, which had a special focus on finance, there have not been any major new global assessments nor re-analysis and synthesis of the evidence on the global costs of adaptation in developing countries. There are, however, some new studies that shed new light on the previous AGR estimates. This section summarizes the findings of a rapid review of new estimates. Additional details and references are provided in Annex  (online) of this chapter. A first key insight is that recent estimates of the economic impacts of climate change are generally higher than reported in earlier studies, both in the near-term under ambitious mitigation scenarios and later in the century under higher warming scenarios. This includes updated values from existing integrated assessment models, which indicate substantially higher impacts (for example, Nordhaus 2017; Chen et al. 2020). It also includes estimates from other modelling methods, including from computable general equilibrium models (for example, Kompas, Pham and Che 2018; Bosello et al. 2021), and econometric-based studies (Burke, Hsiang and Miguel 2015; Burke, Davis and Diffenbaugh 2018). The latter report much higher values because of the consideration of climate change impacts on growth rates as well as output. Implicitly, if the economic impacts of climate change are higher than previously anticipated, all other things being equal, the costs of adaptation are also likely be higher (or otherwise there will be higher residual damage  after adaptation). To illustrate this, the higher sea-level rise projected in the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR6 report (IPCC 2021) would be expected to lead to increased costs of sea defences (to maintain similar levels of protection or to deliver the optimal level of adaptation), although the economic benefits of adaptation would also be higher. It also highlights that strong mitigation action is indispensable to reduce adaptation costs and residual damage in the long term (Chapagain et al. 2020; Estrada and Botzen 2021; Iizumi et al. 2020; Markandya and Gonz·lez-Eguino 2019). A second insight is that the estimated costs of adaptation in many national and sector studies are also increasing, as compared to earlier studies. For example, a recent estimate of the global costs of adaptation for developing countries, based on a compilation of national studies using a similar approach to the AGR2016 (UNEP 2016b), indicates costs in a similar range to those found in this report but with higher adaptation costs in high-emissions scenarios after 2030 (Chapagain et al. 2020). Similarly, a study using global integrated assessment models estimated adaptation costs in line with the upper estimates in previous AGRs (Markandya and Gonz·lez-Eguino 2019). Findings from sectoral studies also indicate similar trends. There have been several studies of the global costs of coastal adaptation (Nicholls et al. 2019; Schinko et al. 2020; Tiggeloven et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2021; Tamura et al. 2019). These studies report costs that are significantly higher than earlier estimates, even when using the same models. This is due to rising sea level projections and higher estimated costs from maintenance but also updated socioeconomic change scenarios. Similar findings emerge for other sectors, for example for river flood adaptation (Ward et al. 2017), the water sector (Straatsma et al. 2020) and the agricultural sector, (Iizumi et al. 2020; Baldos, Fuglie and Hertel 2020). This new evidence reinforces the AGR reported range of estimated adaptation costs and plausibly suggests a higher upper estimate, although more detailed systematic analysis is needed to confirm this. On the other hand, there is growing evidence ≠ at least in the short-term ≠ that there are many low-cost adaptation interventions ≠ so called no-regret and low-regret options (Global Commission on Adaptation 2019) ≠ with high benefit-to-cost ratios. These include, for example, weather and climate services, sustainable soil and land management options, water efficiency and capacity-building. This highlights the incentives to act early and start scaling up adaptation, while recognizing that more major investment will be needed in the medium term and beyond, as these low-regret actions do not deliver more transformational adaptation. This early action is particularly important because the lags in the climate system mean that the largest benefits of mitigation will be from 2040 (Estrada and Botzen 2021) and most of the impacts projected for the next two decades can only be reduced by adaptation. Overall, the new evidence reinforces the estimates presented in the AGR2016 but indicates that these could be towards  the higher end of the ranges, especially if the Paris Goals are not met. Given the new evidence that is emerging, a more detailed stocktake of the costs of adaptation is now required and it is thus recommended that a more comprehensive cost assessment is undertaken in line with the approach from the AGR2016.  Adaptation finance needs in developing countries A further indication of the costs of adaptation for developing countries is provided by the costs/finance needs reported in countries' domestic adaptation ambitions, submitted to the UNFCCC in the form of NDCs and NAPs. The submission of updated NDCs means this is a rapidly evolving area and this chapter has reviewed updates submitted up to the end of July 2021. The review found that 58 developing countries (specifically non-Annex I countries, the focus of this chapter) include estimates of adaptation financing needs in their latest NDCs and NAPs. These are generally not based on detailed technical analyses and use a range of methods, making them difficult to aggregate or compare, both with each other and against the costs of adaptation reported above. The costs indicated in these political documents should be interpreted with care for various reasons: (i) their level of precision varies considerably; (ii) NDC implementation periods vary; (iii) estimates are partial (covering only limited numbers of sectors); and (iv) there is no clear differentiation of the adaptation deficit versus the adaptation gap (Pauw et al. 2020). As a result, there is a large variation in estimated costs among countries. Nevertheless, these cost estimates are relevant to the international community because many developing countries make their NDC implementation conditional on international support (ibid.). There may be benefits to encouraging a more rigorous analysis of adaptation finance needs in NDCs. This will help recognize the issues above and help convert the estimates into bankable projects and pipelines that consider potential financing, including from public, private and public≠private partnerships. The indicative financing needs for these 58 countries total around US$ 70 billion per year for 2020≠2030. Extrapolation of these NDC and NAP estimates using per capita costs and population estimates (demand-side adaptation finance needs) to all developing countries ≠ while being highly indicative ≠ would increase the estimate to US$ 250 billion per year by 2030 (Chapagain et al. 2020). This is at the upper range of the costs of adaptation from modelling studies reported in previous AGRs (US$ 140 billion to US$ 300 billion per year by 2030) but many NDCs do not clearly separate financing the adaptation deficit from future climate change. Some countries have updated their adaptation finance needs in their updated NDC submissions. A comparison of original and updated NDCs indicates that adaptation finance needs for these countries have increased. For example, the Dominican Republic, Cambodia, Guinea and Mongolia revised their NDCs and report significantly higher adaptation financing needs compared to their initial submission. A clear reason for this increase is the incorporation of more sectors in the adaptation plan. The sectoral distribution of adaptation finance needs is shown in figure  The figure is based on a subset of 26 NDCs and NAPs that provide sectoral estimates. These needs are from studies that use different approaches and methods (as discussed above) but that nonetheless provide useful information. The analysis shows that the reported needs are highest in the agriculture and infrastructure sectors, followed by water, and then disaster risk management. These four sectors cover over 75 per cent of adaptation finance needs that have been communicated. However, this sectoral distribution may be influenced by a larger proportion of African countries in the sample, where economies are highly dependent on natural resources. Further estimates of adaptation finance needs for developing countries will be published later in 2021, by the UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance in its first report on the needs of developing-country Parties related to implementing the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. These estimates were not available in time for inclusion in this edition of the AGR. Aligned with the recommendation above, it would also be useful to consider the new evidence on adaptation finance needs as part of a more detailed stocktake on the costs of adaptation. This should also assess why needs are increasing, and whether this is due to higher costs, greater coverage or improved assessment methods.   Financing adaptation: status and progress in adaptation finance flows This section considers the main channels of adaptation finance for developing countries and how they have evolved over time. It starts with the global estimates and then provides a breakdown by bilateral, multilateral, domestic and private sources. The understanding of adaptation finance flows is heavily constrained by data availability and limitations (see Annex  [online]). There are a number of significant challenges in tracking adaptation finance, including definitions, accounting issues, confidentiality restrictions and a lack of universally accepted impact metrics (UNFCCC 2018; UNEP 2016b; Climate Policy Initiative [CPI] 2020; see also Annex  [online]). These challenges vary depending on the source of finance. International public bilateral and multilateral finance flows are well documented by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) database of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). However, much less data exist on domestic public sector finance and private-sector investments in adaptation (UNEP 2021; UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance 2018; Weikmans and Roberts 2019; Pauw et al. 2016). Details of the specific data sources considered for the assessments used in this chapter are included in the following sections, with more information in Annex  (online).  Global climate-related finance According to the CPI Global Landscape of Climate Finance 2021 (CPI 2021), global climate finance flows ≠ including public and private flows of both domestic and international origin ≠ were tracked at US$ 632 billion per year for 2019≠2020. These global figures do not only concern flows to UNFCCC developing-country Parties (see next section)   and they include finance for both mitigation and adaptation. This means they are not comparable with the goal of mobilizing US$ 100 billion by 2020. The vast majority (US$ 571 billion) of tracked finance flowed to mitigation, with US$ 46 billion for adaptation and US$ 15 billion to cross-cutting themes that include both mitigation and adaptation (ibid.). Adaptation finance gained momentum in 2019≠2020, increasing 53 per cent to an annual average of US$ 46 billion from US$ 30 billion in 2017≠2018. However, the level still falls far short of estimated needs (Global Center on Adaptation [GCA] 2021) and continues to account for only a minor share of total public climate finance (14 per cent). The majority of this tracked adaptation finance comes from public finance channels (ibid.).  also changed the way they report. This makes it very difficult to compare data over time (Weikmans and Roberts 2019). However, it is clear that the adaptation component of such self-reported finance under the UNFCCC has been growing in recent years, at least before the COVID-19 pandemic. Some non-Annex II countries also report their adaptation-related finance contributions to the OECD DAC on a voluntary basis. The OECD also tracks multilateral adaptation finance committed by multilateral development banks (MDBs), multilateral climate funds and other international institutions (see Annex  [online]). This mainly includes grants and loans of varying levels of concessionality, equivalent to Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Other Official Flows (OOF), as defined by the OECD (see Annex  [online]).  Data for developing countries for 2020 are still emerging. Studies undertaken at the start of the pandemic projected there might be a decrease in finance flows (see also chapter 6), with the potential for a single-digit percentage decline in adaptation finance in 2020 and a potentially larger decline in subsequent years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic (CPI 2021; GCA 2021). This prediction was based on the projected reductions in international development finance, increased debt distress, and slow vaccine roll-out in climate-vulnerable countries (CPI 2021; GCA 2021). These projections need to be compared to the actual figures for 2020 and 2021 once data are available. However, there are a number of factors pointing in the direction of positive longterm growth in adaptation finance, including the increase of adaptation finance over time prior to 2020, the potential for funding towards addressing COVID-19 to include adaptation co-benefits (see chapter 6) and the potential that increasing climate risk disclosure and strengthened accounting frameworks may drive an increase in adaptation finance flows and the capacity to accurately track them. Data on climate-related finance to developing nations shows an increasing trend in finance flows over time, reaching US$  billion in 2019, a 2 per cent increase compared to 2018. However, this falls some US$ 20 billion short of the US$ 100 billion target for 2020 (OECD 2021a). To meet the target, the current trend in climate finance would therefore need to increase from 2 per cent (between 2018 and 2019) to 26 per cent (between 2019 and 2020).  Adaptation finance to support developing countries Under the UNFCCC, Annex II Parties3 are required to report on the climate finance that they provide to developing countries. Annex II Parties use various methodologies to track adaptation finance (see Annex  [online]) and some countries have  The Rio Marker and Climate Components methodologies are currently used across the landscape of bilateral and multilateral funders to track and report climate change finance. Except for MDBs, which use Climate Components, all funders use Rio Marker, although both use compatible definitions of climate mitigation and adaptation (OECD 2018). According to the Rio Marker methodology, adaptation and mitigation can be targeted as a ""principal"" objective (where mitigation or adaptation ""is explicitly stated but is not the fundamental driver or motivation for undertaking the activity"") or is not be ""targeted"" at all (OECD 2011). MDBs track and report data on their climate-related contributions following their own Climate Components methodology (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2019). Based on this approach, MDBs determine the specific components of a transaction that directly contribute to mitigation, adaptation or both simultaneously. Self-reporting comes with some limitations. The attribution of financial support is subjective because the judgement and reporting is made by the funders and is not independently verified. The definition of adaptation used by both methodologies leaves room for interpretation and the accounting methods differ (see Annex  [online]). Several studies claim that the self-reporting of donors and the lack of independent quality control result in low data reliability and sometimes substantial overestimations of finance flows (Junghans and Harmeling 2012; Weikmans et al. 2017), especially for activities tagged as ""significant"" (Weiler, Klˆck and Dornan 2018). Finally, historical data of loan amounts are reported by the funders at face value, instead of using the grant-equivalent amounts, resulting in overestimates of loan amounts (Oxfam International 2020; Roberts et al. 2021). Moreover, financial flows reported include the administrative costs of donors, which in some cases can be high (Atteridge and Savvidou 2020). Regarding gender considerations around equity and justice, although gender-  3 Under the UNFCCC, Annex I Parties include the industrialized countries that were members of the OECD in 1992, plus countries with economies in transition. Annex II Parties (considered here as developed countries) are Annex I Parties that are obliged to provide support to non-Annex I Parties (considered here as developing countries). Chapter 4 ≠ Global progress on adaptation finance  responsive public finance is thought to be more effective and efficient (UNDP 2018), funders do not systematically report data on gender. Furthermore, not all financial transactions in the OECD DAC databases are screened against the Rio marker for adaptation, so there may be adaptation-related finance flows that are not captured (Savvidou et al. 2021). Despite the limitations mentioned above, the OECD DAC data provides the most comprehensive and comparable picture on international development finance for climate change (Weiler and Sanubi 2019; Doshi and Garschagen 2020). While it is important to acknowledge that tracking the provision and reporting of finance does not provide much information about efficient or effective use of funds (UNEP 2021), it is necessary for examining the effectiveness of financial contributions (Savvidou et al. 2021).  BIL ATER AL PUBLIC FLOWS Overall, bilateral flows to developing countries reported to the OECD DAC have increased between 2011 and 2019 (figure , Panel A). There are substantially higher allocations tagged as significant as compared to principal. Contributions tagged as ""principally"" targeting adaptation were lower in 2018 and 2019 than in 2017. Although there is no firm evidence on these trends, it could reflect efforts by countries to make their finance flows consistent with climate-resilient development pathways (article  of the Paris Agreement) as part of mainstreaming, which integrates climate adaptation in existing policies, programmes and plans. However, some analyses prior to 2015 did identify over-reporting of adaptation-related finance due to ambiguous definitions (Republic of India 2015) and political motives in reporting by funder institutions (Junghans and  Harmeling 2012, Adaptation Watch 2015). This means that some caution is needed in interpreting the data and trends. Increased finance for climate change adaptation is a central issue for climate justice (Heffron and McCauley 2018). There is a growing body of evidence indicating that funders are not strategically targeting their adaptation support towards those countries with the greatest vulnerability and needs (Savvidou et al. 2021; Weiler and Sanubi 2019; Doshi and Garschagen 2020; Alcayna 2020). The share of total adaptation-related finance committed to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) for 2011≠2019 was 23 per cent for principal and 28 per cent for significant. The Rio Marker methodology allows analysis of the extent to which adaptation finance is gender responsive. Around 60 per cent of bilateral ODA from OECD DAC contributors marked as relevant to adaptation was also marked as supporting gender equality for 2018≠2019. Most of this adaptation-related finance (86 per cent) has a significant objective for the gender marker, compared to just 14 per cent for principal (see Annex  [online] for more on gender in adaptation finance). This is despite the approval of the UNFCCC Gender Action Plan at COP23, which includes the use of gender-responsive finance as a core tool for implementation (UNFCCC 2017) and despite the fact that funded programmes taking into account gender dynamics have been found to be more effective and efficient (UNDP 2018). Most of the finance was earmarked as grants (64 per cent for principal and 73 per cent for significant), with loans being the second-most used instrument (at face value) (figure , Panel B). Three sectors ≠ agriculture, water supply and sanitation, and general environment protection ≠ received well above 50 per cent of the total finance throughout the period for both ""principal"" and ""significant"" markers. To some extent, this aligns with the adaptation finance needs expressed in the NDCs and NAPs of developing countries (figure  However, basic development sectors such as health, education and others such as disaster prevention and preparedness, and other social infrastructure and services, received negligible amounts of adaptation spending, despite the needs expressed by countries in their development plans (section  as well as their importance in building longterm resilience and adaptive capacity (Atteridge, Verkuijl and Dzebo 2019). MULTIL ATER AL PUBLIC FLOWS Adaptation-related financial flows to developing countries by MDBs exhibited a strong uptrend through to 2019 (figure , Panel A). Support for adaptation as a share of overall MDB climate finance rose from 10 per cent in 2011 to 39 per cent in 2019 (including 4 per cent for activities targeting both adaptation and mitigation). During the same period, a total of 26 per cent of adaptation-related MDB finance went to LDCs. The two sectors of agriculture, on the one hand, and water supply and sanitation, on the other, account for 36 per cent of finance contributions to adaptation.  The bulk of the increase of commitments to adaptation from MDBs comes from debt instruments, which make up 92 per cent of total commitments for 2015≠2019, with just 6 per cent delivered as grants and 2 per cent as equity and shares in collective investment vehicles or unspecified financial instruments (figure , Panel B). Adaptation finance flows from multilateral climate funds are also presented in figure  (Panel B). Multilateral climate funds have a critical role to play in the adaptation-related finance landscape, given their exclusive focus on supporting climate change objectives. In contrast to MDBs, multilateral climate funds use a higher proportion of grants than loans. The total share of grants was 85 per cent for contributions classed as principal and 74 per cent for significant. Notably, from 2011 to 2019, the share of principal contributions to least developed countries from multilateral climate funds increased substantially, from 26 per cent to 63 per cent (figure , Panel B). The largest proportion of principal adaptation-related finance from multilateral climate funds is for the general environment protection sector (29 per cent for both principal and significant), followed by water supply and sanitation (14 per cent for principal and 17 per cent for significant). PRIVATE FLOWS So far, few biennial reports by Annex II Parties have reported on the private climate finance that they mobilized through public interventions. The UNFCCC Standing Committee on Finance and OECD data show that mobilized private sector finance has varied between 17 and 27 per cent of all climate finance for developing countries (Bhattacharya et al. 2020). The total amount of mobilized private finance has been relatively stable from 2017 to 2019, with an annual average of US$  billion (OECD 2021b). However, the majority of private finance mobilized by public climate finance in developed countries benefits mitigation activities (93 per cent for 2016≠2018) (OECD 2020). However, the OECD has observed that there is room for improvement in identifying adaptation-relevant activities within mobilized private finance data sets. Tracking mobilized private adaptation finance is expected to remain challenging. Despite private-sector flows to adaptation remaining limited and being challenging to track, there is considerable innovation in this area, increasing the potential for private sector finance to play a larger role in closing the adaptation finance gap. In summary (Annex  [online] provides a review of new developments), there are now examples of the use of private investors and financial markets to raise adaptation finance, for example, with green and resilience bonds (debt instruments). There is also growing involvement of the private sector in developing and delivering adaptation and a range of new instruments and approaches have been developed to encourage this, incentivized by blending public finance to address barriers and de-risk private investment (for example, seed funding, concessional lending, guarantees and equity). Nonetheless, barriers to private investment in adaptation (information  gaps and uncertainty, positive externalities, lack of or low revenues) and the public interventions or finance needed to overcome these mean the uptake and scaling-up of these new instruments remains slow. Furthermore, private-sector investment will gravitate to opportunities where revenues are highest and risks are lowest, meaning it is unlikely to target the most vulnerable in LDCs or non-market sectors. More work is needed to identify where public finance is most needed and most effective in leveraging private finance, as well as where private finance is unlikely to fill the gap.  DOMESTIC FINANCE FLOWS Domestic budgets are an underexamined but vitally important source of adaptation finance and current data are largely based on case studies. Allan et al. (2019) report that for many countries, domestic public finance for climate change (mitigation and adaptation) has in the past exceeded that of international sources. For example, in Ghana, for adaptation, 2 per cent of the total annual budget was climate-relevant between 2014 and 2017. This compares to 3 per cent in Antigua and Barbuda and 8 per cent in both Kenya and Pakistan (Watson et al. 2020).   Similarly, 5 per cent of the budget of Nepal is considered as being ""highly relevant"" to climate change (Nepal 2021). However, countries apply their own definitions and methods and transparency is often low (Watson et al. 2020). Furthermore, other aspects of countries' budgets can counteract domestic finance for adaptation by increasing emissions or vulnerability (ibid.). There is growing recognition of the role fiscal policy can play in building resilience to climate change. This includes taxes, price supports, revenue and expenditure measures that work to reduce, retain or transfer climate-related risks and help build resilience to shocks (International Monetary Fund 2019; World Bank 2019). This is in line with article  of the Paris Agreement, which states that all countries need to make their finance flows consistent with low-carbon and climate-resilient development pathways (Zamarioli et al. 2021). However, emerging evidence shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to tax revenue reductions in many countries. In combination with the needs of governments to reallocate resources towards health or social services, this could cause countries to cut domestic climate finance flows (Caldwell, Alayza and Larsen 2021).  Progress, outlook and recommendations This chapter has provided an update on the adaptation finance gap in developing countries. Estimating this gap is challenging but the evidence suggests that the costs of adaptation and reported needs from updated NDCs and NAPs are higher than in previous AGRs. At the same  time, this review has found that public finance flows for adaptation have remained broadly stable in recent years and may even have decreased slightly since the COVID-19 pandemic. These two findings suggest that not only is the gap larger than indicated in the AGR2020 but it is also widening. Taken together, the evidence indicates that estimated adaptation costs, and similarly likely adaptation finance needs in developing countries are five to ten times greater than current international public adaptation finance flows, a sizeable finance gap. While there is some promising innovation to incentivize private-sector and domestic adaptation financing, data on such flows are scarce and there is little evidence to suggest such finance will bridge the adaptation finance gap. Related to this, while there is an upward trend in climate finance, based on current projections (OECD 2021b; Bhattacharya et al. 2020), it seems unlikely that the US$ 100 billion target for 2020 has been met, particularly the inferred adaptation component of this target. The review in this AGR has also found that there is now more evidence on the costs of adaptation, on adaptation finance needs and on finance flows. This makes it timely to undertake a more detailed stocktake and it is recommended that a more comprehensive cost assessment is undertaken in line with the AGR2016. Moreover, there is also more evidence on the benefits of adaptation and its effectiveness, which warrants consideration in such a stocktake, including a more detailed analysis of the potential roles and complementarity of public and private adaptation. Such information would also provide important insights needed for UNFCCC negotiations on future climate finance targets.  Chapter 5 Global progress on adaptation implementation  Key messages    In the period between 2010 and 2019, more than 2,600 principal adaptation projects have been funded  by the top 10 bilateral donors on adaptation, underscoring the significance of bilateral finance as a  driver of adaptation. Furthermore, the number of new principal adaptation projects that started during  the latter half of this period is 50 per cent higher than the total number for the preceding five years,  illustrating a strong acceleration in adaptation implemented with bilateral support since the adoption  of the Paris Agreement in 2015.    The number of activities marked as principal adaptation by the top 10 donors in the Organisation  for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Creditor Reporting System is actually significantly  higher than 2,600. However, more than one-third of these activities were not found to meet the OECD  criteria for principal adaptation, meaning principal adaptation is being over-reported. This analysis  confirms similar findings by civil society organizations and academia.    Under multilateral adaptation finance, between 1 December 2020 and 30 September 2021, 39 new  principal adaptation projects funded by the Adaptation Fund, the Green Climate Fund and the Global  Environment Facility were started ≠ an increase of 10 per cent compared with the 397 projects started  between 2006 and 2020 (assessed in the 2020 Adaptation Gap Report).    The sectors prioritized across countries' most recent Nationally Determined Contributions closely  match the primary sectors being addressed by projects supported with bilateral and multilateral  adaptation funding, with agriculture, water, ecosystems and infrastructure featuring in the top five  sectors in each list.    Evidence assessed in this chapter suggests that implementation of adaptation is unevenly distributed,  with certain regions having relatively little evidence to suggest that adaptation is taking place,  particularly North Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and parts of South America.    Data on adaptation outcomes and evidence of risk reduction remains scarce. Less than 2 per cent of  the 1,682 scientific journal articles that document implemented adaptation provide primary evidence  of risk reduction.    Poor understanding of contextual drivers of vulnerability, top-down design, limited consideration of  future climate risks and unclear success criteria reduce the likelihood of adaptation projects achieving  risk reduction. More attention is therefore needed on inclusive project design and implementation to  better elaborate the intended adaptation process and prevent maladaptation.   Introduction The objective of this chapter is to provide a global assessment of the implementation of adaptation, with a particular focus on developing countries. It provides essential information that would not be apparent from solely focusing on the amount of finance and/or the extent and quality of planning, namely whether adaptation is actually taking place, and where and in which sectors it is happening. In addition, this chapter assesses the available data on results and risk reduction achieved and concludes with recommendations for the design and assessment of adaptation actions. The assessment of global implementation of adaptation in the 2020 edition of the Adaptation Gap Report (AGR2020)  was based on an analysis of project documents from the three funds that serve the Paris Agreement (UNEP 2021a), and on the initial results from the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI), a research initiative that systematically assessed documented adaptation in the scientific literature (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021). This year's AGR updates and expands the 2020 analysis by assessing data from the top 10 bilateral adaptation donors over the 10-year period from 2010 to 2019. While it does not capture adaptation being implemented by all actors and has limited coverage of actions in developed countries, this combination of data sources provides one of the most comprehensive global assessments of the extent, location and focus of adaptation actions globally available to date. As such, its findings are directly relevant for the Global Stocktake.   The scope and content of this chapter are complementary to Working Group II (WGII) of the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),1 which will be published in February 2022. The WGII AR6 will go into detail on key sectors and all geographic regions.  Scope and data sources Adaptation actions are undertaken from the local to international level and are carried out by a variety of different actors. At the national level, countries are only just beginning to report on the implementation of their national adaptation plans (Leiter 2021). Consequently, country submissions to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) presently do not provide a sufficient basis for determining the level of implementation worldwide. This chapter therefore uses three comprehensive data sources to obtain an indication of adaptation actions globally: 1. project documents from three funds serving the Paris Agreement (Adaptation Fund [AF], Green Climate Fund [GCF] and Global Environment Facility [GEF]; all adaptation projects until 30 September 2021); 2. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics on aid activities targeting adaptation to climate change (available for 2010-2019, covering all recipient countries of development aid); 3. implemented adaptation as documented in scientific journals (global coverage, journals indexed in Web of Science, Scopus or Medline, publications between January 2013 and December 2019). These data sources complement each other and, combined, are able to provide unique insights into the extent and status of implemented adaptation actions globally. However, they do not provide a representative overview of adaptation being implemented across all scales and by all actor groups. Data from the three funds serving the Paris Agreement and OECD statistics, for example, both exclusively provide information about adaptation projects funded by international finance flows and therefore do not capture actions implemented with finance from other sources. As a result, adaptation implemented by actors more likely to operate without this funding ( local or international non-governmental organizations [NGOs], community groups, the private sector and the national  governments of developed countries) are likely to be underrepresented. To a certain extent, these actions could be captured by GAMI. However, this would require them to be documented in scientific articles, which is likely to be the exception rather than the rule. Nevertheless, the three data sources used provide longitudinal coverage over 15, 10 and 8 years, respectively, which enables the identification of trends and new developments over time. Further information about the analysis conducted for this chapter is described in Annex  (online).  Implemented adaptation actions  Internationally funded adaptation actions The AGR2020 identified 397 projects primarily aimed at adaptation that were started between 2006 and 2020, funded by the three funds serving the Paris Agreement (AF, GCF and GEF from its Least Developed Countries Fund [GEF-LDCF] and Special Climate Change Fund [GEFSCCF]). Seven more adaptation projects were started in 2020, and 34 between January and September 2021, giving a total of 437 supported principal adaptation projects. This is an increase of almost 10 per cent since the AGR2020, despite the pandemic. Since 2015, a quarter of new principal adaptation projects have grant volumes above US$ 10 million (table  and figure  The number of new adaptation projects that were started in 2020 and 2021 is similar to the number of newly started projects per year in the period from 2015 to 2019. However, this number could have been higher had the pandemic not occurred. As a new data source, this year's implementation chapter also includes bilaterally funded adaptation projects. Between 2010 and 2019, the top 10 bilateral adaptation donors3 funded 2,607 principal adaptation projects. Table  shows the number of newly started projects per year per donor and figure  shows the development of the total number of projects throughout the decade. The overall trend has been upward except for 2018, when the number of projects funded by the US fell substantially due to the previous administration's position on climate  This fall was partially offset in 2019 by a strong increase in the number of projects supported by France, Germany and the UK (table  Despite the drop in 2018, the combined number of new projects started in the last five years of the decade (2015-2019) was 50 per cent higher than for the first five years, which illustrates the strong acceleration in the implementation of principal adaptation projects since the adoption of the Paris Agreement.  The number of activities marked as principal adaptation by the top 10 donors in the OECD Creditor Reporting System is actually significantly higher than 2,607. However, more than one-third of the activities were not found to meet the OECD criteria for principal adaptation, which the OECD defines as adaptation being ""fundamental in the design of, or the motivation for, the activity"" (OECD 2016). This means that principal adaptation is being over-reported, which confirms similar findings by civil society organizations and academia. The numbers reported in table  are the result of manual screening of the information provided in the OECD database, and therefore do not include projects that were not found to meet the OECD criteria for principal adaptation (see Annex  [online]). Almost one-third of the bilaterally funded principal adaptation projects address multiple sectors, while 21 per cent focus primarily on agriculture and 20 per cent  on ecosystems (figure , Panel A). A comparison with the priority sectors mentioned in the most recent Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of each country (see Panel B) shows a close match, with agriculture, water, ecosystems and infrastructure occupying four of the top five positions each. NDCs mentioning health as a priority sector for adaptation increased in frequency, from 25 per cent of all NDCs with an adaptation component in the first round of (intended) NDCs to 45 per cent of each country's most recent NDC, up to August 2021. This increase is likely due to the increase in awareness of health-related matters caused by COVID-19. Over the 10-year period, the composition of primary sectors addressed by new principal adaptation projects has remained relatively constant. Agriculture is an exception to this, having increased significantly to an average of almost 25 per cent over the last five years compared to 16 per cent for the period 2010-2014 (figure  Water as the primary   Figure  Composition of primary sectors addressed by new principal adaptation projects per year sector accounted for less than 10 per cent of new adaptation projects in 2013, 2015 and 2016, but has steadily increased since then and reached 21 per cent in 2019. Ecosystems as the primary sector accounted for 18-25 per cent of new adaptation projects over most of the period 2010-2019, but saw a strong decrease in 2018 and 2019 to 11 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively. Of the 2,607 principal adaptation projects, 133 projects (~5 per cent) were identified as aiming to enhance the generation and utilization of climate information as a primary objective. This is lower than was indicated in the AGR2020, which determined that 12 per cent of the 397 adaptation projects funded by the three funds serving the Paris Agreement focused on climate information. However, the AGR2020 applied a broader definition that also counted projects that had a single component related to climate information. Regarding the extent to which bilaterally funded adaptation projects promote gender equality, approximately 4 per cent of all projects in the OECD Creditor Reporting System marked as having adaptation as a principal objective are also marked as having gender equality as a principal objective. This rate is slightly lower than that found in projects of the funds serving the Paris Agreement, which the AGR2020 determined to be around 6 per cent. Figure  shows the number of principal adaptation projects per country. The figure shows that bilaterally  funded adaptation projects are unevenly distributed among countries, with the majority of projects being located in East, Southern and West Africa, South-East Asia and parts of South America. Fewer projects are found in Central Asia, the Middle East and parts of North Africa. Forty-five per cent of principal adaptation projects were located in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) while 9 per cent were located in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), demonstrating a similar ≠ albeit slightly lower ≠ focus on LDCs and SIDS to that found for the three funds serving the Paris Agreement by the AGR2020 (53 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively).  Implemented adaptation actions documented in scientific journals GAMI identified and analysed journal articles published between January 2013 and December 2019 that describe implemented adaptation actions (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021). It found that only a fraction of the tens of thousands of published articles that directly address adaptation to climate change actually document implementation, a finding confirmed by another review of the adaptation literature (Sietsma et al. 2021). In total, GAMI identified 1,682 journal articles that describe implemented adaptation actions across the globe, although some regions and countries are associated with a far larger number of publications than others. More than 50 articles were identified for Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nepal, and the United States (figure    A comparison with the map of bilaterally funded adaptation projects (figure  shows that some areas are characterized by a low number of adaptation projects and only a few cases of implemented adaptation documented in journal articles, in particular North Africa, Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and parts of South America. The low number of adaptation projects being documented in these regions could ≠ in part ≠ be exacerbated by issues such as reporting bias caused by, for example, language barriers which hinder the publication of articles in English. As a result, it cannot necessarily be concluded that adaptation actions are less frequent in these regions. However, the fact that data from both the GAMI and OECD databases provide only limited evidence that adaptation is taking place in these regions suggests that adaptation is not as common in some of these regions as elsewhere. Further results from GAMI including sectoral composition, targeted climate hazards, targeted actors, the potential for transformative adaptation, and the methods used, are outlined in Berrang-Ford et al. (2021). In addition, a series of associated articles are examining various dimensions of adaptation, such as equity, health, gender and responses to specific hazards or in specific   Adaptation outcomes and risk reduction The ultimate goal of adaptation is to reduce risks associated with the impacts of climate change that have not been avoided through mitigation. By reducing these risks, adaptation seeks to maintain or enhance human and ecological well-being in the face of climate change (see chapter 2).  Assessing adaptation performance A review of implemented adaptation found that effectiveness is most commonly described in terms of reduced risk or vulnerability and increased well-being (Owen 2020). The framing of adaptation can influence which of these concepts (risk, vulnerability, resilience, well-being or others) are emphasized in the definition of effectiveness (Singh et al. 2021). Importantly, the outcomes of adaptation actions are not just either successful or unsuccessful, but can fall along a continuum from negative outcomes (referred to as ""maladaptation"") to effective adaptation (Schipper 2020; Tubi and Williams 2021). Figure  visualizes this continuum in general terms and by providing a tangible example of how differing adaptation outcomes could materialize in a smallholder farming context. Furthermore, adaptation outcomes are rarely consistent across different social groups, and in some cases adaptation actions can benefit certain groups while harming others (thereby leading to  maladaptation). Additionally, the effectiveness of adaptation can decrease over time if climate hazards become more intense and/or more frequent. Assessment of the extent to which adaptation interventions reduce risks associated with climate change is a critical prerequisite for continuously improving adaptation actions and avoiding maladaptation. However, a number of challenges to assessing adaptation outcomes exist, which limit its application (Bours, McGinn and Pringle 2014a). Principal among these challenges is that effectiveness is relative to the level of climate hazards (rather than an absolute value), that the composition of factors that determine risks and their relative importance can be very dynamic, and that adaptation is highly site and context specific, meaning there can be no globally standardized indicators to universally and comprehensively assess the success of adaptation interventions (Arent et al. 2014; Leiter and Pringle 2018). The UN Statistics Division's multi-year process6 to identify a globally applicable and feasible set of adaptation indicators demonstrates the trade-offs, the lack of globally available data and the challenge to express local adaptation outcomes through global indicators. In addition, indicators based on national averages do not account for inequalities and differences in people's vulnerability that are crucial to determine the effectiveness and fairness of adaptation. At the national and subnational level, a variety of indicators have been used to assess adaptation actions, and sector-specific assessment practices are evolving as well (M‰kinen et al. 2018; Leiter et al. 2019; Brooks et al. 2019; Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2019; Donatti et al. 2020). However, adaptation indicators rely on a prior understanding of how adaptation is expected to work and what it aims to achieve. Theories of change or similar ways of outlining the intended change process from actions to outcomes can help to design adaptation interventions and to guide the formulation of suitable indicators (Bours, McGinn and Pringle 2014b; Oberlack et al. 2019). In this way, adaptation actions do not gain relevance through their indicators but through how they address current and future climate risks in a way that is robust and accounts for context and equity (see section  To date, many monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems of adaptation projects remain focused on easily measurable short-term outputs such as people supported, policies drafted, or assets improved, and are ill equipped to assess changes in vulnerability or risks or detect maladaptation (Eriksen et al. 2021). Indeed, indicators used by the three funds serving the Paris Agreement to assess portfolio-wide performance primarily measure outputs (Leiter et al. 2019). The way most adaptation projects and their results are currently assessed therefore limits our understanding   of the effectiveness of adaptation. Annex  (online) discusses several approaches (from mobile-phone based household surveys and combinations of process and outcome-based data, to statistically verified resilience indicators and qualitative evaluations) that can be further explored to advance the assessment of adaptation, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach to adaptation M&E. The appropriateness of particular M&E approaches depends on the purpose of undertaking M&E and associated information needs, as well as the available resources and links to decision-making processes (Leiter 2017).  Global status of adaptation results Funds serving the Paris Agreement, as well as some bilaterally supported climate funds, publish performance data that are often based on portfolio-wide standard indicators, such as the number of beneficiaries. As at June 2020, the LDCF has reached more than  million direct beneficiaries and trained 508,000 people, while the SCCF has reached over  million direct beneficiaries and  trained 80,000 people (GEF 2021). As at 31 December 2020, GCFfunded adaptation projects were reported to have reached a total of 49 million direct and indirect beneficiaries (GCF 2021). Through its projects approved before 30 June 2021, AF is expecting to reach 10 million direct beneficiaries (AF 2021). While this type of data indicates a fund's reach and level of activity, it does not provide information about the actual outcomes of adaptation ≠  to what extent the beneficiaries have become more resilient and against what level of climate risk. Due to different calculation methods, even data using seemingly identical indicators are not currently comparable across funds (Pauw, Gr¸ning and Menzel 2020; AF 2021). There have also been instances of double counting of beneficiaries (Binet et al. 2021). Furthermore, it is difficult to interpret indicators without context. For example, the indicator ""Meters of coastline protected"", a portfolio indicator used by AF, says little about how effective this protection is in reducing climate risk, particularly risks associated with future sea-level rise and associated hazards. Consequently,   while the data can be aggregated across projects, this does not necessarily lead to a meaningful statement about risk reduction and it leaves out who benefits. This example illustrates the limits of standard indicators, which can be useful for accountability and communication purposes, but less useful for understanding context-dependent results. A recent evaluation by the GCF Independent Evaluation Unit (IEU) (Binet et al. 2021) likewise found that the ""depth of impact for adaptation interventions cannot be monitored with the current set of indicators"". Projects could therefore employ a mix of different M&E approaches to generate multiple types of information for different target audiences and be based on theories of change developed together with stakeholders and beneficiaries (see subsection  Evidence of risk reduction being achieved by adaptation actions documented in the scientific literature is also very limited. Less than 2 per cent of the articles identified by GAMI provide primary evidence of risk reduction (BerrangFord et al. 2021). It was found that many articles assumed rather than observed or empirically demonstrated risk reduction. Just 30 out of the 1,682 articles ( per cent7) offered evidence of risk reduction, half of them through quantitative assessments, 11 through qualitative methods, and four using a combination of both methods (BerrangFord et al. 2021, Supplementary Materials 4). While this finding does not necessarily mean that the other 98 per cent did not contribute to risk reduction, it shows that quantitative or qualitative evidence of risk reduction is rare. It also highlights the limited focus given to assessing the outcomes of adaptation actions, reinforcing the need to design adaptation actions in a way that increases the chance of risk reduction being achieved, particularly for those most vulnerable to climate change.  Project design and factors that support or hinder risk reduction A stakeholder-informed understanding of current and expected climate hazards and vulnerability in the respective location, how they affect the population and who is most at risk, is critically important for adaptation planning (see chapter 3). However, the 1,682 articles identified by GAMI and a meta-analysis of 34 adaptation projects show that climate risk contexts are often poorly articulated in the design of adaptation interventions (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021; Eriksen et al. 2021). Indeed, a recent evaluation of the adaptation portfolio of the GCF found that establishing the climate rationale ( the explanation of a project's contribution to adaptation) is the biggest hurdle in project development (Binet et al. 2021). The evaluation concludes that clearer guidance is needed on what counts as adaptation and how to draft a meaningful climate rationale.  Recent research identified several factors that hinder achievement of risk reduction outcomes (Eriksen et al. 2021), namely: I. poor understanding of contextual drivers of vulnerability; II. top-down design and implementation with inadequate representation of vulnerable and marginalized groups ( women and indigenous groups); III. rebranding development activities as adaptation without considering climate risks; IV. failing to identify criteria for adaptation success and/or allowing success to be defined implicitly by dominant groups. The review of 34 adaptation projects found that despite intentions being stated in project documents, these often did not truly address the underlying drivers of vulnerability to climate change, particularly where these are embedded in deep-rooted economic and political structures (Eriksen et al. 2021). To analyse this dimension, greater attention to these drivers is essential if the positive transformation promised by many adaptation interventions is to be delivered. Furthermore, adaptation is more likely to be effective where it involves genuine and substantial participation by those it is intended to support, in planning, implementation and M&E (Buontempo et al. 2014; Forsyth 2018; Vincent et al. 2020). This finding has motivated the principles for ""locally-led adaptation"" spearheaded by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) (Soanes et al. 2021). Its premise is that a participatory approach, including joint agreement on what constitutes ""successful"" adaptation and how it can be reached, will increase ownership and be more effective. Such ""bottom-up"" insights can also be combined with ""topdown"" climate scenarios to integrate scientific and local knowledge (Conway et al. 2019). Finally, progressively higher levels of warming and associated increases in climate risks also need to be considered, given that current NDCs are projected to substantially breach the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2021).  Outlook and recommendations Despite the growing number of adaptation projects, the lack of knowledge about their outcomes and the increasing concern over the way adaptation projects are currently planned and implemented ≠ and the implications this has for their effectiveness ≠ is a call for action. This section outlines the main recommendations to improve adaptation design, implementation and assessment.   Main recommendations:  1. Ensure that planning is risk focused and clearly explains how adaptation is expected to take place. A prerequisite for achieving risk reduction is that projects are grounded in an inclusive understanding of climate risks and vulnerability and that it is clearly elaborated how their activities address climate risks. As identified by the evaluation of GCF's adaptation portfolio and by the analysis of GAMI's database of 1,682 articles, there is a need to substantiate how objectives will be achieved. Rather than just adding some vague resilience targets or indicators that mostly represent business as usual, project proposals need to specify how adaptation is envisaged to achieve its objectives. To facilitate this change, better guidance is needed on how to design adaptation projects. The associated development and approval processes also need to be modified accordingly, including project templates which currently pay too little attention to adaptation mechanisms. 2. Ensure that planning is inclusive and context informed. To understand the risk context of locally implemented adaptation actions and develop an appropriate theory of change, genuine, substantial and sustained inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalized must be ensured. Such an approach can also help to prevent maladaptation since social exclusion of certain groups ( women or indigenous peoples) during project development can leave important sources of risk unaddressed (Forsyth 2018). The principles for locally led adaptation can be used to support a participatory approach (Soanes et al. 2021). 3. Facilitate the assessment of adaptation outcomes and communicate the results. There needs to be a stronger focus on assessing whether the adaptation mechanism works as intended and whether the intended outcomes ≠ and not just the outputs ≠ are being achieved. This could involve applying complementary adaptation-specific assessments in addition to common project monitoring arrangements and accountability-focused indicators (Leiter 2018). This change would require commitment and adequate resourcing. The results should be made publicly available and be easily accessible. The same applies to project evaluations which often remain internal documents, thereby preventing opportunities for learning.  4. Validate outcome indicators and use multiple sources. Indicators that are chosen to represent concepts like resilience, vulnerability or adaptive capacity need to be justified on the basis of empirical evidence ( how they measure the respective concept needs to be demonstrable). However, in practice they are often chosen on the basis of data availability or ease of measurement. To better measure risk reduction, indicators need to be grounded in a well informed understanding of contexts and potential future risks. Surveys and interviews with relevant actors can yield valuable insights that quantitative indicators cannot capture. This approach is also usually cheaper than gathering new quantitative data. 5. Promote reflective monitoring. Suitable approaches to monitoring, evaluation and learning need to be applied to actively support decision-making rather than simply serving as a once-a-year accountability tool. Beyond indicators, the monitoring system needs to be able to detect unintended consequences including maladaptation in order to support adjustments to actions as necessary. Monitoring should therefore take a reflective approach that involves active sharing of experiences as implementation unfolds. As such, it may include multiple types of information to meet the needs of different users (Faulkner, Ayers and Huq 2015). 6. Plan for higher-end impacts. The extreme events experienced throughout 2021, many of them record breaking, underscore the need to consider higher-end climate scenarios and to plan with sufficient safety margins ( not relying on the lower bound of estimated sea-level rise). This requires enhanced adaptation ambition to address impacts that might fall outside the range of previously modelled or anticipated impacts. More than anything else, these events underscore the urgent need to decarbonize the global economy much faster than NDCs currently foresee (UNEP 2021b). This is the only way to avoid escalating climate risks and to prevent the adaptation gap from widening further.  6 Chapter 6 Emerging consequences of COVID-19 on adaptation planning and finance  Key messages    COVID-19 and climate change have had a compounding effect, creating significant human suffering  and stretching the economic and disaster response capacity of governments around the world. The  compound nature of these risks continues to impact the adaptive capacity of governments, communities,  societies and social groups, particularly those that are either already vulnerable (for example, women  and indigenous groups) and those in developing countries.    The pandemic has delayed existing adaptation planning in some countries and disrupted disaster  risk finances. National Adaptation Plan processes have been hampered by health restrictions, as well  as by the political and budgetary focus on immediate pandemic responses. Additionally, budgets  for emergency disaster risk management have been depleted, raising concerns about a reduction in  adaptive capacity for subsequent health emergencies and climate shocks.    COVID-19 has exacerbated pre-existing financial barriers to investment in adaptation. However, there  is an opportunity to redress these low levels of investment by directing recovery funding into green  and resilient recoveries. In response to the pandemic, as at 15 August 2021, US$  trillion of fiscal  stimulus had been announced by countries. Less than one-third of 66 studied countries had explicitly  funded specific measures to address physical climate risks in their announced investment priorities  up to January 2021. The costs of servicing the debt raised to respond to the pandemic, combined with  decreased government revenues due to the economic impacts of COVID-19, may also hamper future  government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries.    COVID-19 provides lessons for improving climate adaptation planning and financing. COVID-19 highlights  the importance of governments addressing compound risks through integrated risk management  approaches. The pandemic also deepens the need for substantive debt relief for heavily indebted and  climate-vulnerable countries and creates an opportunity to ""build forward better"", through investment  in activities that support green economic recovery and build adaptive capacity.   Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has reverberated throughout the world, placing strain on many of the systems that are essential to our lives. The crisis has revealed and reinforced many of the pre-existing vulnerabilities and fault lines running across our globalized world. It has also demonstrated that the notionally distinct domains of health, economics, society and environment are in fact complex, nested, interconnected systems, which require coordinated global responses (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] 2020a). Climate change adaptation practitioners are dealing with a similarly complex problem that also crosses physical, temporal and organizational boundaries. As with COVID-19, the climate crisis acts as a threat multiplier of preexisting vulnerabilities, impacting people, livelihoods and  ecosystems. These threats are addressed by the Paris Agreement, which established the global goal on adaptation of ""enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change"".1 This chapter aims to synthesize the literature that describes how COVID-19 has impacted country-level ""adaptive capacity"" (see the glossary for a definition and discussion below) and identifies emerging opportunities for policymakers and decision makers to improve their responses to both the health and climate crises. For instance, the significant fiscal spending on the health emergency, welfare payments and economic recovery may make ongoing spending on measures to increase preparedness for climate hazards more challenging for some governments. However, it also presents an opportunity to invest in programmes and policies that enable governments to ""build forward better"".   This chapter focuses on governmental ≠ rather than societal, business or household ≠ contributions to country-level adaptive capacity. Nonetheless, it is important to note that these dimensions are interlinked and cannot be neatly separated. The chapter also focuses primarily on the impacts of the pandemic on adaptation financing and planning, since the impacts on implementation are still emerging and are not well documented in existing studies. To synthesize the literature, the authors conducted a rapid review of peer-reviewed literature and reports from multilateral organizations and policy institutions, published in or after 2020, on the link between COVID-19 and adaptation financing and  The chapter is organized as follows. Section  explores the ways in which the pandemic and climate change interact and create ""compound risks"", which increase the vulnerability and threaten the adaptive capacity of governments and societies. Section  sets out how COVID-19 has delayed existing adaptation planning processes in some countries, creating potential compound risks in the future. Section  analyses the emerging implications of COVID-19 for adaptation financing. As governments move from deploying ""rescue"" stimulus to ""recovery"" spending, the chapter synthesizes existing data to determine whether countries are investing in recoveries that are both economically effective and building countries' adaptive capacity to climate change. Our analysis of these fiscal flows is constrained by pre-existing difficulties inherent in classifying and tracking adaptation  Section  outlines lessons for governments and multilateral institutions on how to address the adaptation financing and planning impacts of COVID-19, as identified above, to enable COVID-19 to act as a catalyst, rather than an impediment, to enhancing global climate adaptive capacity.  How COVID-19 has impacted adaptation planning and finance Climate change and COVID-19 share many similarities. Like the COVID-19 crisis, the climate crisis is a systemic problem that requires coordinated global and domestic responses. Both crises are protracted, with effects that unfold over months and years, and are deeply entangled with other social, environmental and economic shocks and disruptions (Phillips et al. 2020). They both reveal the inequity in who experiences, and has the ability to respond to, the effects of crises (Dodds et al. 2020; Patel et al.  2020). Emerging evidence suggests that the pandemic has also impacted climate adaptation at multiple scales. This section highlights how COVID-19 has had a particularly significant impact on the ""adaptive capacity"" of countries (defined below), by creating or exacerbating compound risks at multiple levels.  COVID-19 and adaptive capacity The emerging literature on COVID-19 and climate adaptation suggests that the pandemic impacts the Paris Agreement's goals of ""enhancing adaptive capacity"", ""strengthening resilience"" and ""reducing vulnerability"". As highlighted by the 2018 edition of the Adaptation Gap Report (AGR), the distinction between these terms is not well established in the literature, with many of their key constructs overlapping one another. Instead, the report suggested that it may be more helpful to draw a distinction between ""adaptive capacity"" on the one hand, and country exposure and sensitivity to physical climate hazards, on the other. Adaptive capacity is a broad concept with multiple definitions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has defined the concept as referring to the ability of systems, institutions and humans to adjust to potential climate damage, to take advantage of opportunities, or to respond to consequences (IPCC 2014). Academic scholarship makes the point that multiple actors work together to enable adaptive capacity, including governments, businesses and communities, and highlights the importance of the interactions between these layers. To date, the literature on the impacts of COVID-19 on adaptation has primarily focused on the way the pandemic has impacted institutions and the economy. Reflecting this emphasis in the literature, this chapter focuses primarily on the issue of the ""adaptive capacity"" of governments. Box  What is a ""compounding risk""? Compound risk is a term that is used in multiple domains, including climate science (IPCC 2012), disaster risk response and other sciences, with different meanings. The common denominator, however, is that compound risks build on each other and exacerbate hazards and other outcomes. Among others, the context-specific differences in the term's definition centre on whether the causal basis of such risks should be related and on whether social and physical interaction should be considered the same or separate (Pescaroli and Alexander 2018). In this chapter, the term is used to refer to interactions not only between physical hazards but also involving other areas, such as social and economic systems.  The literature highlights that the impact of COVID-19 on physical climate risks is uncertain. Although the government-imposed restrictions on movement and economic activity that were enacted in response to the pandemic led to a reduction in emissions within some sectors, its long-term effects on climate hazards will be contingent on the length of the pandemic and government responses to it (Forster et al. 2020; le QuÈrÈ et al. 2020; Shan et al. 2020). At the time of writing, the emission reductions induced by government-imposed restrictions on movement and economic activity are unlikely to meaningfully reduce climate hazards. Despite temporarily slowing the usage of the global carbon budget, they do not appear to have reduced emissions permanently, with most countries having already returned   The concept of compound risk is widely used in relation to climate adaptation. Zscheischler et al. (2020) reviewed historical instances of compound events related to weather extremes and concluded that many major catastrophes bear the hallmark of being caused by compound events. For example, they noted that in 1983, the largest synchronous wheat failure in modern history was driven by a strong El NiÒo event, which fuelled heatwaves and droughts in crop-producing regions across multiple continents. Maladaptation is another example of compound risk, this time inherent in adaptation projects. Maladaptation refers to adaptation projects which inadvertently increase the vulnerability of communities or specific segments of communities (for example, women and indigenous groups). Some adaptation programmes explicitly try to avoid such risk compounding.  to their pre-pandemic emission levels (IPCC 2021). However, as highlighted in the remainder of this chapter, existing research shows with greater certainty that COVID-19 and its associated policy, economic and social responses are already impacting the adaptive capacity of governments.  COVID-19 and climate change present ""compounding risks"" that impact adaptive capacity In the literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and climate adaptation, ""compound risk"" (box  has been used to describe the way in which the pandemic and climate change  On the one hand, climate change may have contributed to conditions that exacerbate the pandemic (among other health impacts; see, for example, UNEP 2018).5 Increased risk of COVID-19 infection has been associated with exposure to higher levels of certain air pollutants (Cole, Ozgen and Strobl 2020), and some scholars have linked geographic shifts in wildlife induced by climate change and ecosystem degradation with the spread of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19 (Carlson et al. 2020; Everard et al. 2020; Dasgupta 2021; UNEP and International Livestock Research Institute 2020). On the other hand, the pandemic and the social responses to it may also be impacting our ability to respond to climate change (Ranger, Mahul and Monasterolo 2021). This chapter focuses primarily on the latter. In 2020, droughts, cyclones, and floods exacerbated by climate change damaged critical infrastructure or  impeded the public health responses needed to contain epidemics (Phillips et al. 2020). In Morocco, for example, droughts occurred in parallel to the pandemic, leading to major increases in unemployment in rural communities as farmers with lower incomes struggled to find work. Similarly, in developed economies, we have seen a compounding of the pandemic and climate risks. In the United States of America, the available evidence suggests that emergency response measures for COVID-19, coupled with responses to increased major hurricanes and wildfires, may have exacerbated staffing shortfalls at the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency in 2020 (United Sates Government Accountability Office 2020). Box  contains a case study of how the pandemic has reduced the resilience of Pacific states to cyclones. While this chapter focuses on the government level, it is important to acknowledge that COVID-19 has also diminished adaptive capacity at other scales, making communities, organizations and households more vulnerable, which has a knock-on negative impact on country-level adaptive capacity. At the household level, the World Bank estimates that an additional 97 million people fell into poverty in 2020, driven by the economic shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic (World Bank 2021b). The links between poverty and climate vulnerability are well documented: poverty is both a driver and a result of vulnerability to climate change shocks and stressors (Hallegatte, Fay and Barbier 2018; Thomas et al. 2019). There have also been systematic reductions in adaptive capacity  use funds and including COVID-19 in new funding calls (Cornish 2021). While this demonstrates the responsiveness of pre-allocated financing frameworks to imminent crises, as emergency funds are depleted it also indicates potential vulnerability to future compounding COVID-19 shocks or natural disasters (Mahul and Signer 2020). The extent of this vulnerability will depend on the responses of donors in addressing short-term shortfalls and longer-term funding trends.  The impact of COVID-19 on adaptation financing  Record fiscal spending in response to COVID-19: a window of opportunity for green and resilient recoveries In response to the immediate health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have announced US$  trillion in fiscal support as at 15 August 2021. Of this figure, 75 per cent (US$  trillion) has been directed to immediate ""rescue"" initiatives designed to keep businesses and people afloat, 13 per cent (US$  trillion) to ""recovery"" initiatives designed to rejuvenate economies and the remainder elsewhere (Desvars-Larrive et al. 2020; International Monetary Fund [IMF] 2021b; O'Callaghan et al. 2021). Relative to Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs), Advanced Economies (AEs) have deployed more fiscal spending, for longer. Excluding loans,  equity and guarantees, between 2020 and 2022, advanced economies are expected to deploy over eight times more spending relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) than low-income developing countries (figure  While countries continue to deploy rescue spending in response to outbreaks of COVID-19, the opportunities for increased adaptation support are greatest in recovery spending. As discussed in the Emissions Gap Report 2021 and the AGR2020, and as called for by world leaders and multilateral organizations, COVID-19 recovery spending presents a window of opportunity to invest in a green, resilient and inclusive economic recovery (for example, Asian Development Bank 2020; G7 2021b; O'Callaghan and Murdock 2021; OECD 2020b; UNEP 2020c). Investment in adaptation activities can generate durable economic benefits and reduce climate vulnerability. The Global Commission on Adaptation has estimated that investment in adaptation can deliver benefit≠cost ratios of between 2:1 and 10:1, largely through avoiding future costs (Global Center on Adaptation 2019). Similarly, as discussed in the AGR2020, nature-based solutions are a source of investment with the potential to reduce climate risks and vulnerability, while providing economic, environmental, and social inclusion co-benefits (UNEP 2021). An IMF working paper estimated that for every dollar spent on ecosystem conservation (a form of nature-based solution), almost seven more were generated in the economy over five years (Batini et al. 2021).    Emerging evidence indicates a failure to capitalize on opportunities Initial analysis of COVID-19 stimulus packages indicates limited investment in green and resilient recoveries, with some recovery packages likely deepening climate vulnerability. However, a conclusive assessment is constrained by the lack of comprehensive, global data and analysis on COVID-19 recovery spending allocated to adaptation  An analysis by the World Resources Institute (Krishnan and Brandon 2021) of response and recovery packages announced up to 31 January 2021 by 66 economically and geographically diverse countries, including all G20 and V20 countries,7 found that less than one-third ( just 17 countries and the EU) of the countries studied explicitly flagged or incorporated physical climate risks, adaptation or resilience in their announced investment and priorities (as defined in Caldwell and Alayza 2021). Investment was categorized as adaptation or resilience if it explicitly mentioned addressing climate hazards or risks through one of the following approaches: climate risk considerations; local decision-making; shock-responsive social safety nets, including for vulnerable populations; projects in urban areas; water resources management; food security; nature-based solutions; disaster prevention; and infrastructure (Krishnan and Brandon 2021). The study also looked at whether addressing physical climate risks was mentioned in the introductions or preambles of countries' stimulus  For example, if a country mentioned improving water management practices to address reduced water availability or if it invested in early warning systems, then it was considered to have selective climate risk management actions. The 13 countries (18 per cent) that cited adaptation and resilience as a core objective of their recovery, alongside jobs and growth, are classified as having ""climate risk integrated plans"" (figure  The study found that almost all the countries that cited the need to manage climate risks are on the front-line when it comes to experiencing climate change impacts, including several of the Small Island Developing States. Sectoral analysis of COVID-19 pandemic stimulus packages indicates that some countries have invested more in activities that will increase climate change vulnerability than in those that will reduce it. The Vivid Economics Greenness of Stimulus Index found that, as at 1 February 2021, only US$ 141 billion of US$ 667 billion of tracked green stimulus had been directed towards ""nature and biodiversity"",  compared to US$ 262 billion of stimulus directly associated with pollution or activities expected to negatively impact biodiversity (Vivid Economics 2021a). Furthermore, it also found that, despite encouraging examples of green and resilient stimulus, the packages announced by 15 of the G20 nations will have a net negative environmental impact and even in the National Resilience and Recovery Plans in Europe, there is more spending that will damage nature than enhance it (Vivid Economics 2021b).  COVID-19 may be encouraging greater international public finance flows in the short term but this is unlikely to apply to adaptation finance Over the last 18 months, the demands on international public finance have increased significantly. Not only are international financial institutions facing simultaneous pressures to channel resources to address the ongoing health crisis, they must also respond strategically to the economic and climate crises. Similarly, developed  economies are also under domestic fiscal pressure and may be constrained in their abilities to channel additional finance to multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other countries in the medium to longer term (OECD 2020c). Comprehensive reporting across MDBs and bilateral and other multilateral institutions on public finance (particularly climate finance), is limited. It also has a two-year time lag,9 which makes it hard to project trends with a high degree of confidence. The analyses considered in this section all focus on 2020 flows to countries eligible to receive Official Development Assistance (ODA). Taken together, they provide some clarity on the short-term outlook. Preliminary analysis from the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) indicates that, as a whole, ODA flows from its 29 member countries and EU institutions reached their highest ever recorded level, rising by  per cent in 2020 over 2019 flows (OECD 2021). These figures demonstrated the willingness of DAC members to maintain or increase ODA budgets in 2020, likely in response to immediate needs related to the pandemic. It remains to be seen whether these overall ODA levels will be sustained in the medium- to longterm or will experience a delayed tightening, consistent with previous financial crises (OECD 2020d). Drilling down more specifically into climate finance, the 2020 Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks' Climate Finance (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2021), an annual report jointly published by nine MDBs, shows that while the participating MDBs' overall climate finance for developing countries fell by almost 5 per cent in 2020 (as compared to 2019), the share of adaptation finance slightly increased from 34 per cent of 2019 to 35 per cent of 2020 flows, continuing the positive trend of the last five years, albeit with a decline in absolute terms (see chapter 4 for further details).10 This indicates that there are likely opportunities not only for MDBs, but for countries to continue to invest in adaptive capacity while advancing their recovery from the pandemic. However, this study only examines MDBs' own climate-related investment and represents a small subset of international public climate finance.  Box  How COVID-19 reduced the adaptive capacity of Pacific States to Cyclone Harold In April 2020, category 5 tropical cyclone Harold hit Small Island Developing States in the Pacific, including Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. The impact of the cyclone was catastrophic, with as many as 90 per cent of the population in Sanma, the most affected province of Vanuatu, losing their homes. At first, response measures to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pacific impeded the response of governments to the cyclone. In Fiji, the disaster response was constrained by COVID-19 restrictions, since the country's evacuation centres had to adhere to COVID-19 protocols, which included restrictions on capacity and social gatherings. In Vanuatu, officials banned foreign aid workers from entering the country to assist with disaster recovery, in line with strict measures to prevent the importation of COVID-19 into the country. Furthermore, aid supplies had to be quarantined for three days before disbursement to prevent the spread of the disease in a country with weak health infrastructure. Sources: Gunia 2020; World Meteorological Organization 2020. in business. Firms ≠ particularly small to medium-sized enterprises in developing countries ≠ have also experienced severe and widespread shocks, with declining sales and rising job losses (Adian et al. 2020; Christine et al. 2020). Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could trigger extensive corporate debt distress, building on high pre-pandemic over-indebtedness (Liu, Garrido and Delong 2020). Moreover, compound shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have reverberated along existing lines of inequality, exacerbating existing socioeconomic inequities. The literature documents some of the many disproportionate health, economic and social impacts of COVID-19 experienced by groups already facing structural inequalities along socioeconomic, gender, class and ethnic lines (Dodds et al. 2020; Patel et al. 2020). Such inequalities, which leave many unable to take appropriate preventative measures, may also exacerbate the pandemic. The compound nature of both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic has significant policy implications, particularly for government adaptation planning and finance, which we discuss in the following sections.   The impact of COVID-19 on adaptation planning COVID-19 has impacted a range of adaptation planning processes. This section focuses on the impact on national adaptation planning and disaster risk planning. Chapter 3 of this report provides further details on progress made in national adaptation planning during 2020 and 2021.  COVID-19 has impacted the development of National Adaptation Plans National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) are a planning process through which countries can identify medium-term and longterm adaptation needs and bring adaptation into country-level policymaking processes. Between the creation of the process to formulate and implement NAPs in 2010 and 31 July 2021, only 24 of the 154 developing countries had so far completed and submitted their first NAPs. However, as at September 2021, at least 125 developing countries are in the process of formulating and implementing NAPs. Emerging evidence suggests that while COVID-19 has hampered some NAP processes, particularly among Least Developed Countries (LDCs), countries are working to progress their NAPs despite the constraints of the current environment (United Nationals Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNFCCC] 2021). This view is supported by qualitative evidence (box  These constraints are also likely to have been experienced across adaptation planning and implementation processes beyond NAPs, particularly in LDCs (Caldwell and Alayza 2021). Despite constraints, direct support has continued to be provided throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including through the Open NAP initiative and through virtual administration of support programmes, where possible. Eighteen LDCs participating in the Open NAP initiative reported progress, despite COVID-19 (UNFCCC 2021). There is also anecdotal evidence that accelerating digitalization trends, driven by COVID-19, have created new opportunities for community engagement and consultation in planning processes by increasing accessibility and inclusivity of consultations for certain groups within communities (McKinley et al. 2021).  COVID-19 has impacted contingent disaster risk finances COVID-19 has created additional vulnerability to future climate-related shocks, since contingent funding retained for disaster relief has been redirected to address pandemic related shocks. This depletion has been partly amplified by requests from recipient countries to divert climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction aid to COVID-19 responses (Quevedo, Peters and Cao 2020). For example, as at July 2020, India, Nepal and Pakistan had all made requests to the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. Many donors are accepting these requests and are providing additional flexibility to recipients in how they   Box  The impact of COVID-19 on NAP processes For some countries, such as Ghana, COVID-19 served as a ""wake up call"" to instigate the NAP process (UNEP 2020b). However, the available evidence suggests that for many other governments, COVID-19 has slowed the development of NAPs in 2020 and 2021. The NAP Global Network, which supports countries in advancing their NAP processes, carried out research with partner countries on how the pandemic impacted country NAP processes. The research, which is backed by other similar studies, found that in some cases the pandemic had ""completely stalled"" or ""delayed"" NAP processes. It cited a number of factors:  Cancelled meetings and consultations: Prohibition on travel in some countries and physical distancing requirements limited the ability to carry out NAP meetings. This was particularly problematic for communities with limited or no Internet access and also had the potential to restrict the extent to  which the perspectives of vulnerable groups like women and indigenous peoples are considered within NAPs.  Diverting political support for adaptation: Politicians were focused on responding to short-term issues, triggered by waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the NAP of South Africa was due to be approved by the cabinet of the country's government in April 2020 but had to be put on hold because of the pandemic.  More competition for adaptation funding and resources: Some countries reported facing difficulties accessing the same levels of budget support because of COVID-19. In addition, several countries reported concerns that the debt they were taking on might create future problems for adaptation funding (see further discussion on this topic below in section  Sources: NAP Global Network 2021.  lower economic activity, many countries have significantly reduced fiscal space (IMF 2021c). Fiscal space is a necessary but not sufficient condition for adaptation spending. Political or policy barriers, such as a reluctance to take on debt to invest in adaptation, could prevent spending on adaptation (Mortimer, Whelan and Lee 2020). However, limited fiscal space could exacerbate these barriers, making it harder for governments to commit funds to adaptation. The pandemic could result in downgrades to countries' credit ratings, increasing the cost of public borrowing and further constraining access to financing and the ability to invest in adaptation (OECD 2020d). Furthermore, public and private debt may not have fully priced in climate risks, leading to the potential of future repricing of such debt and possible increased debt servicing costs for nations (Climate Policy Initiative 2020; Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021; Monasterolo and Volz 2020; Klusak et al. 2021). As a consequence, researchers estimate that critically indebted countries are more likely to constrain spending on adaptation (Kaiser et al. 2021). This is reflected in qualitative evidence (see box   Looking forward, the Climate Policy Institute and the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) studied the potential impact on adaptation finance flows in the post-COVID-19 world: based on interviews with representatives from development finance institutions, they projected that ≠ due to the competing pressures on financiers ≠ there would be a single-digit percentage decline in adaptation finance in 2020, with the potential for a larger fall in following years. The estimated decline is based on several variables, including projected reductions in international development finance, increased debt distress and slow vaccine roll-out in climate-vulnerable countries (GCA 2021).  The compounding of COVID-19 debt and climate risk could be a problem for adaptation spending by governments. Countries with limited fiscal space ≠ further reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic ≠ may lack the financing needed to implement adaptation measures, in turn leaving them more exposed to climate risk through lower preparedness and therefore also more likely to experience further increases in borrowing costs (Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021). However, this risk could be mitigated by using COVID-19 recovery spending to advance adaptation goals (as discussed in sections  and    COVID-19 induced debt distress and ongoing economic disruptions may constrain future climate adaptation spending COVID-19 has exacerbated fiscal distress for many countries, particularly Emerging Market and Developing Economies. Many governments have had to increase borrowing to finance the fiscal rescue and recovery packages (among other measures). The median public debt among LowIncome Developing Economies rose from  per cent of GDP over 2010≠2014 to  per cent pre-crisis, peaking at  per cent in 2020 (IMF 2019; IMF 2021b). Average public debt worldwide reached  per cent of GDP in 2020, 13 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic projection (IMF 2021b).11 Such additional borrowing, combined with a drop in GDP due to the economic impact of the pandemic, has led to much higher debt-to-GDP ratios worldwide. As a consequence, and in combination with falls in revenue from   Emerging lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic for adaptation planning and financing As discussed in section , there are similarities in the systemic, compounding and unequal nature of COVID-19 and climate change. The following lessons, drawn from across the literature, are intended to address this systemic and institutional nature of the challenge.  Lessons for adaptation planning Governments should develop an integrated approach to the governance of risk management that is based on wide consultation. As discussed above in section , the COVID-19 pandemic compounds climate-related risks. This makes it important for governments to adopt an integrated approach to risk management across hazards to acknowledge such risk compounding (Ranger, Mahul and Monasterolo 2021; Monasterolo and Volz 2020). The World Bank (2021a) outlines how this more comprehensive approach to risk management within public finance frameworks ≠ incorporating climate, pandemics and other major risks ≠ could form an important part of a wider shift towards a whole-of-government integrated approach to risk management. Several years ago, the World Bank suggested that countries establish a national risk board to support government-wide coordination in their management of critical risks (World Bank 2013),12 a suggestion made all the more timely by the COVID-19 pandemic. In many countries, this approach is already practised to some extent, typically with cabinet offices, ministries/departments and equivalent institutional bodies holding responsibilities for monitoring and managing national critical risks. A national risk board could bring together a set of cross-cutting risk management and adaptation objectives, a national risk assessment, a system of national financial protection planning and a much wider and integrated approach to fiscal risk management, thereby driving a whole-of-government approach. Donors could also continue to support developing countries to better plan for compound risks, including through the establishment of flexible funding mechanisms and  improving governance and accountability for cross-sectoral decision-making (Hallegatte, Rentschler and Rozenberg 2020; Kruczkiewicz et al. 2021). Governments should leverage existing adaptation policy processes to manage compound risks. While COVID-19 has impeded adaptation planning processes, it has also reinforced the relevance of planning for compounding risks. To do so, governments could better leverage existing adaptation planning processes, including the climate rationales of project proposals to the Green Climate Fund and adaptation-specific sections of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and NAPs (Hammill 2020). For example, governments that have developed a NAP may have undergone rigorous, country-specific risk assessments and identified medium-term and long-term priorities for building adaptive capacity to climate change. These assessments can offer a raft of benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic, including identifying vulnerable populations (for example, women and indigenous groups) and places that are likely to be disproportionately affected during the compounding crises. This would help provide mechanisms and institutional frameworks through which to deploy immediate support and offer investment options to inform resilient stimulus packages (Hammill 2020; World Bank 2020a). Box  provides an example of how integrated planning can help respond in a practical way to compounding disasters (World Health Organization 2021).   Box  Leveraging existing climate disaster risk response tools to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how integrated risk management can offer multiple benefits. In Pakistan, as part of the country's response to the COVID-19 crisis, in 2020 it developed a Multidimensional Vulnerability Index to identify the communities most at risk from the pandemic. The Index was implemented through a map that integrated physical climate change risks as part of its assessment. It drew on tools developed for assessing flood and drought risk and created an integrated vulnerability tool, which was applied during the pandemic. Sources: Quevedo, Peters and Cao (2020). Planned NAP processes can be used to help countries address specific risks exposed by COVID-19, such as through support for increased food security. For example, the Government of the Dominican Republic is planning to design the country's NAP process to incorporate adaptation strategies for the water, agriculture and food security sectors that will seek to create synergies with the government's programmes to finance farmers affected by COVID-19. The projects prioritized under the NAP will include climateresilient investment in food production. However, the usefulness of NAPs for managing compound risks is contingent on the rigour of the assessments. For instance, few NAPs currently integrate health risks, let alone other risks, as part of an integrated risk management process (World Health Organization 2021). UNEP has developed resources to encourage governments to integrate health considerations into NAPs (UNEP 2020a). Additionally, as at July 2021, UNEP is supporting 18 national governments to advance their NAP processes, including projects that simultaneously link to the COVID-19 response and recovery (UNEP 2020c). Governments should continue to be encouraged to ensure ≠ with support where required ≠ that NAPs are underpinned by rigorous, forward-looking climate change risk assessments to identify medium- to long-term adaptation priorities.  Lessons for adaptation financing Government and donors could increase investment to improve adaptive capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred extensive fiscal spending. Governments should ensure that recovery spending is used to build forward better by actively targeting increases in climate adaptive capacity.  This suggestion is in line with the communiquÈ of G7 climate and environment ministers following their meeting in May 2021 (G7 2021a), which stressed the importance of increased action on adaptation (including by reaffirming their commitment to article  of the Paris Agreement, which calls for the provision of scaled-up financial resources contributing to adaptation action) and committed countries to working intensively to increase the quantity of finance for adaptation. Similar commitments have been made by the G7 world leaders, G20 energy and climate ministers and African ministers for the environment (G7 2021b; G20 2021; UNEP, African Ministerial Conference on the Environment and the African Union 2020). When crafting stimulus packages, governments can apply emerging frameworks to identify and prioritize interventions that achieve both economic recovery and climate change resilience, such as the World Bank's Proposed Sustainability Checklist for Assessing Economic Recovery Interventions (World Bank 2020b), the World Bank Adaptation Principles (Hallegatte, Rentschler and Rozenberg, 2020) and the GCA Framework for Identifying Effective Interventions (GCA 2021). In addition, if available, countries can use existing country-specific adaptation plans and instruments as a starting point to identify stimulus measures suited to local contexts, as illustrated by the case study in box  Governments and donors could increase the resilience of fiscal frameworks to deal with compound risks. COVID-19 has reinforced the need for governments and donors to ensure the rapid availability of finance after disasters to mitigate economic shocks and enable a swift and effective emergency and recovery response (Wahba et al. 2020). Such financing can reduce the financial shock of disasters on a government's balance sheet and ensure that predictable, timely and cost-effective finance is available to respond to the emergency (World Bank 2021a). In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries that had prearranged disaster finance in place were able to respond to the pandemic swiftly. For instance, in Sierra Leone, having learned from its response to the Ebola outbreak in 2013≠2014, the government was able to adjust its national social safety net programme to rapidly reach vulnerable households with donor support in its response to the pandemic (Sandford et al. 2020). Despite its importance, prior to 2020 many governments' fiscal and macrofinancial frameworks did not anticipate or prepare for systemic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic (OECD 2020a). However, some governments are now taking steps to manage systemic shocks beyond pandemics, including climate shocks (World Bank 2021a). To build resilience to compound risks, the World Bank Adaptation Principles include the recommendation that countries build flexibility, redundancy or both into budgets to account for ongoing costs that the country will face (OECD and World Bank 2019). For example, the Bhutan governmental budget process includes financial allocations for natural disasters and climate change impact risks as part of a ""fiscal risk     allocation matrix"" (Hallegatte, Rentschler and Rozenberg 2020). Taking such an approach to risk within public finance frameworks could enhance a country's adaptive capacity by enabling it to manage risks in an integrated way. Developed economies could significantly increase direct grants, concessional finance with adaptation requirements and support for local capacity-building to help countries counter the economic pains of the COVID-19 pandemic and meet adaptation requirements. As discussed above, highly climate-vulnerable nations require better access to concessional finance, alongside substantive debt relief in order to create the fiscal space necessary to invest in adaptive capacity (Dibley, Wetzer and Hepburn 2021; Kaiser et al. 2021). Some governments and international financial institutions have already contributed to such causes (UNEP 2020a), while others have pledged to do more in the face of the pandemic (World Bank and IMF 2020). In this respect, the increase in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) by the IMF in August 2021 (equivalent to US$ 650 billion) is historically significant in size (IMF 2021a). However, to meet the needs of vulnerable countries, the amount of finance provided will need to be substantially higher than current commitments (O'Callaghan and Murdock 2021; United Nations 2020).  An ambitious and well-targeted package of support, with adaptation priorities, can support country-level adaptation capacity in a variety of ways, such as freeing up fiscal space for economically vulnerable countries, helping drive the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring the planned fiscal intervention promotes well-defined adaptation objectives (for example, UNEP 2021b). A strategy designed along these lines can take various forms, including debt relief, incentivizing greater private debt relief and privatesector investment in adaptation, or using promising debt relief mechanisms (see box ; chapter 4; Khan 2020; Singh and Widge 2021; Volz et al. 2021). In addition to providing support in the form of finance, governments and donors should help fund and support capacity-building for compound risk management. This could include assisting government treasuries to better evaluate climate physical and transition risks, including considering how to manage such risks in the context of the pandemic and other compounding events. Such support could also help to develop local research capabilities in this area. Box  Identifying adaptation measures that meet short- and long-term goals in Fiji Countries can increase the adaptive capacity of their recoveries by identifying fiscal stimulus priorities from within existing government resilience plans. For example, the World Bank identified interventions with the potential to reconcile the short-term economic and job creation needs of Fiji with longer-term climate change adaptation goals, by drawing on the country's existing Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA). The CVA was produced in 2017 and proposed a list of 125 interventions that would be most effective in reducing the country's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. In 2020, the World Bank screened each proposal against its Proposed Sustainability Checklist for Assessing Economic Recovery Interventions to narrow the list to 63 core  interventions that could enable Fiji to ""build forward better"". However, the country's government will likely be operating in a fiscally constrained environment, with the economy contracting by  per cent in 2020 and the total outstanding debt of the country expected to increase from  per cent of GDP at the end of 2020 to  per cent of GDP at the end of the 2022 financial year. The analysis suggested that, if pre-existing planning instruments are sufficiently robust, governments can apply more rigorous constraints and still identify interventions that deliver co-benefits. For example, even assessing proposals against a budget cut-off of 3 per cent of GDP and solely prioritizing short-term stimulus effects resulted in a list of 10 initiatives that could contribute to resilience, long-term economic development and decarbonization.

Box  Debt-for-climate swaps: a promising debt relief mechanism Debt-for-climate (DFC) swaps have been identified as a promising debt relief instrument to generate fiscal space for countries to allow green and resilient investment as part of the recovery from COVID-19. DFC swaps involve a debtor nation committing to greater climate ambition, funding or both for domestic climate activities, on terms agreed with the creditor instead of continuing to make external debt servicing payments. The types of climate actions suitable for a debtor nation depend on the specific circumstances of individual countries, including their level of vulnerability to climate change. The generic structure of a DFC swap agreement is shown in figure  below.   a Creditor is likely to be another nation State, but private sector creditors are also encouraged to participate in a DFC swap. b An ""escrow"" is a legal vehicle in which funds are held in trust -- usually by a third party -- and can only be released once specific conditions are met. These funds should be sufficiently transparent so the public is able to determine to where funds have been dispersed. In this example, funds might be held in an escrow/fund until a government has taken preliminary steps to implement a climate project or once the project has achieved reductions in risk or vulnerability. Source: Singh and Widge (2021).  DFCs have three primary benefits: increased climate spending, while avoiding debt servicing payments dedicated to climate-positive activities; boosting economic recovery, with direct investment that stimulates private investment and assists economic recovery; and reduced external country debt. DFC swaps are particularly suited to countries with high levels of bilateral public external debt with other countries and are currently not captured by the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. This primarily means middle-income and some low-income countries. Sources: Singh and Widge (2021); Volz et al.

Lastly, there is qualitative information suggesting that the COVID-19 crisis has served as a ""wake-up call"" to instigate or accelerate adaptation processes, such as the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) development processes in some countries (for example, Ghana).   Synthesis of results across the chapters Building on the framing in table  (chapter 2), this section synthesizes knowledge from chapters of this Adaptation Gap Report (AGR) on progress, gaps and factors constraining the interpretation of findings related to adaptation planning, finance and implementation. It also provides insights in expected future trends, based on the chapter authors' expert judgement. Figure  provides a contextual visualization of the results (panel A) and synthesizes them using the assessment criteria described in chapter 2 of this report (section  and table   Progress There is more robust evidence compared to AGR2020 that progress made worldwide over the last decade in enhancing national-level adaptation continues to accelerate. This conclusion is supported by multiple findings below. Recognition of the policy importance of adaptation to galvanize action at the international and national levels: Climate adaptation has become an established part of climate policy action worldwide (UNEP 2021a). Nearly eight out of 10 countries have at least one national-level planning instrument in place that addresses adaptation (including regular updates and additions) and about one in 10 countries are in the process of developing a new one. Results also show some signs of acceleration: among countries with one or several national-level planning instrument(s) that address adaptation, almost one in five have introduced such an instrument in the past five years (including one country in 2021). The analysis also shows some acceleration since 2015 in terms of the number of adaptation-related projects financed through international funders (Adaptation Fund,  Increasing maturity in the way adaptation is considered in policies and strategies: Approaches to adaptation at the national level demonstrate varying degrees of maturity ≠ either through adaptation-centred instruments or mainstreaming of the adaptation component into existing planning processes ≠ depending on national circumstances and risk profiles. For example, six out of 10 countries now have one or more stand-alone sectoral planning instruments in place and at least one out of four has one or more subnational planning instrument(s). The inclusion of vertical coordination mechanisms in adaptation planning instruments, which facilitates governance across levels of administration, has also progressed since AGR2020, with a 22 per cent increase in the number of such mechanisms. Stakeholder engagement (different government levels, non-governmental and sectoral organizations, research institutes, and the private sector) in national-level processes has also increased by about 20 per cent compared to the assessment of adaptation plans in AGR2020. Actionable policies providing guidance on how to operationalize adaptation: The increasing levels of adaptation finance reported by multilateral and bilateral funding agencies (for example, the hundreds of projects in developing countries that have received support from multilateral climate funds since 2005) indicate that there is increasing focus on more actionable policies. The move towards more stand-alone sectoral plans is an illustration of this phenomenon: besides more integrated plans contributing to more actionable policies, more dedicated plans also indicate sector-specific approaches to the topic.  Early signs suggesting more progress in the near to long-term future: Evidence of more climate-resilient and sustainable financial systems and investments is accumulating (for example, through increasing measures addressing climate risks to components of the financial system, such as industries, corporations, enterprises and  consumers). The analysis also confirms an important point made in AGR2020 on the emergence of new instruments, actors and approaches to scale up adaptation finance, including private adaptation, despite the effects of the COVID-19 crisis (section  (UNEP 2021a). There is widespread agreement that continued effort towards more climate-proof financial systems and investments will be important to progressively minimize and counteract cascading risks throughout societies as a whole and ensure longer-term and transformational reductions in climate vulnerability.  Gaps This year's report warns that despite encouraging trends, adaptation progress made at the national level to date does not appear to be at the appropriate scale. Five aspects support this conclusion. Adaptation finance: Estimates of adaptation costs and adaptation finance needs, as reported in updated NDCs, appear to indicate higher totals than previous AGRs, while adaptation-oriented financial flows appear to be broadly similar. This suggests that a sizeable adaptation finance gap remains in place and is likely increasing. Besides incomplete information on public flows, information on private flows also remains unclear. There have been positive trends in the emergence of new instruments, actors and approaches to scale up adaptation, including by the private sector, but the rate remains slow and is unlikely to fill the gap. Lastly, it is also unclear exactly how adaptation financing flows have been impacted by the pandemic, not least because up to mid-2021 COVID-19 stimulus packages were not very explicit about how they consider physical climate risk, adaptation or resilience dimensions in their announced investment priorities.  strategies and plans, in practice, it remains unclear whether the planning processes in various countries lead to actual implementation at the national and subnational levels. For example, more than 60 per cent of countries with a NAP are not yet tracking its implementation (Leiter 2021). Moreover, even countries with horizontal and/or vertical coordination mechanisms in place in their planning instruments flag effective coordination as a continuing area of difficulty. Connection to climate risk reduction: National-level data provide very limited evidence of effective climate risk reduction today and even more in the future. There is also a lack of evidence in the scientific literature: out of more than 1,680 scientific papers analysed by the Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative (GAMI),1 less than 2 per cent contain empirical evidence of risk reduction as a result of adaptation-related interventions (Berrang-Ford et al. 2021). While this does not exclude the possibility of reducing climate risks, adaptation initiatives are still very much operating on the basis of the assumption that the intended results are being achieved. Gender and equity: Despite broad recognition of gender as an important adaptation dimension, the national-level policy documents of about seven out of 10 countries tend to underscore the importance of integrating gender considerations into adaptation planning. In addition, the way in which countries report on gender considerations varied considerably, ranging from general statements through to more elaborate ways of taking gender into account in action plans.  Factors constraining the interpretation of the findings There are three main types of limitations and uncertainties to be considered:  Monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) enables the adjustment of adaptation objectives, strategies and resources over time and is therefore key to ensure adequate and effective adaptation planning and implementation. While over one-third of the countries have an adaptation-dedicated M&E system under development, only about one-quarter already have one in place. In addition, there are indications that M&E approaches still strongly focus on outputs at the expense of outcomes and lack perspective on risk reduction per se, partly due to difficulties identifying how this can be measured in relation to climate hazards using climate data and scenarios. Similarly, there has been little attention on assessing the effectiveness of transformational adaptation. Knock-on effects: This report reinforces the conclusions of the AGR2020. While in theory, national-level adaptation planning plays a substantial role in stimulating the development of subnational and sectoral adaptation  Lack of clarity in adaptation goals: The Global Goal on Adaptation is not specific in terms of resilience and vulnerability at the global level and on climate risk reduction now and in the future. While there are reasons that article 7 of the Paris Agreement does not provide a precise definition (such as to accommodate interpretation by a variety of Parties), this has resulted in certain limitations, such as the difficulty to infer precise global-level targets and guide the analysis of adaptation progress (Magnan and Ribera 2016). There is an expectation that with growing experience in adaptation, reporting under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) will continuously converge and become more informative. Improved information across countries' reporting has the potential to advance information on some quantitative indicators (for example, the relative number of actions implemented on the ground or at-risk population groups covered by specific interventions). More qualitative goals could also emerge, for example in terms of knowledge at the local scale of risk   reduction, the inclusion of equity dimensions or extending the timescale of planning from the short-to-medium term to the longer term. To date however, this remains largely aspirational.  Availability of information: Information levels on the three dimensions considered in the UNEP AGRs (planning, finance, implementation) have not improved since 2020. This means there are still substantial limitations and uncertainties:    First, there are gaps in data availability. For example,  it remains challenging to get a sense of the scale  of private finance dedicated to adaptation because  databases are mostly scattered or difficult to access.  Similarly, and despite recent progress under the  GAMI, there is a lack of comprehensive databases  gathering information on adaptation planning  and implementation in high-income countries  because adaptation is frequently mainstreamed  at subnational and sectoral levels. Data on project  outcomes and evaluations are also often not publicly  available.    Second, there are knowledge gaps in understanding  the effectiveness of a wide range of climate  adaptation measures and policies in terms of the  adaptation process itself (for example, the extent to  which vulnerable population groups are included and  equity issues are considered), but also in terms of  their actual contributions to climate risk reduction  now and in the future. It is therefore unclear whether  current adaptation approaches contribute to long-  term successful adaptation or to an increased level of  maladaptation. In turn, this limits our understanding  of the contribution of adaptation-related national  plans, strategies, frameworks and laws to societal  resilience and climate risk reduction across sectors,  territories and population groups.    Third, the lack of understanding of future risk  levels under various warming and (national-level)  socioeconomic scenarios prevents comparison of  adaptation outputs observed today with potential  outcomes in the future. There are, however, avenues  for improvement. In principle, for example, it is  possible to assess progress in implementation of  climate-relevant interventions and compare this with  levels of exposure in the future, which would give us  a proxy for understanding progress or gaps.  Uncertainty around the enabling conditions for adaptation: External factors that are not climate-related have a considerable influence on vulnerability trends and the extent and time of the emergence of climate risks. This includes, for example, changes to the political economy of nations (for example, changes in the rights of women and indigenous groups), geopolitical shifts and global shocks. The COVID-19 crisis, which is expected to have increasingly profound implications for future adaptation efforts and outcomes  (though not fully studied and understood), illustrates this phenomenon. For example, the global pandemic crisis appears to have halted the trend for the gradual increase in international public adaptation finance observed in recent years. There is also emerging evidence that the pandemic has disrupted existing adaptation planning and disaster risk financing. In some countries, NAP processes have been hampered by health restrictions, as well as by the focus on immediate pandemic responses at the expense of climate change adaptation. Additionally, some contingent disaster risk management budgets have been depleted, raising concerns of reduced adaptive capacity to respond to subsequent health emergencies and climate shocks. On a more positive note, the COVID-19 crisis also highlights the importance for governments to address compound risks through integrated risk management approaches and provides opportunities for governments and donors to finance activities that support economic recovery, while also building adaptive capacity.  Exploratory forward-looking findings While chapters 3 to 6 are essentially backward-looking, an exploratory forward-looking approach has also been used, based on expert judgement, to complement limited data and evidence. The findings are both encouraging and worrying at the same time. Crucially, there is overall consensus among the authors of this report and in the literature that more ambitious adaptation will be critical going forward. Recent conclusions from the IPCC state that the Paris Agreement temperature goal is in peril, with the global mean surface temperature rapidly approaching ∞C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2021). Moreover, the recent NDC synthesis by the UNFCCC confirms that the world is not on a path towards 2∞C (UNFCCC 2021; UNEP 2021b). The chapters of this AGR indicate that adaptation planning and implementation are mostly incremental and still following historical and current events and trends, rather than taking a more anticipatory approach and considering unexpected factors (for example, tipping points in climate and social systems). The authors of this report also expect that adaptation costs and needs will likely continue to rise, especially if insufficient progress is made towards the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Public adaptation finance flows are also likely to continue to increase modestly, but will not close the finance gap, while private adaptation flows will continue to increase, but will be uneven and often not reach those in greatest need. Overall, the large adaptation finance gap is likely to remain and it is plausible that it will even grow. The COVID-19 pandemic is also expected to negatively impact adaptive capacity at multiple scales, affecting a wide range of stakeholders. For example, the economic shocks of COVID-19 have contributed to household vulnerability (with around 100 million more people falling into poverty in 2020), job losses and declining sales for businesses. The pandemic has also exacerbated high levels of existing corporate debt and the prevalence of unsustainable sovereign debt, which will   likely hamper future government spending on adaptation, particularly in developing countries. The length and depth of these consequences will vary across and within countries and will become more apparent over time but there seems to be general agreement that long-term adaptation challenges in terms of planning, finance and implementation will be substantially affected. To summarize, the level of transformation required to address future climate risks does not yet seem to be materializing. However, this conclusion deserves some caution due to the difficulties in tracking transformational adaptation processes, partly because data collection on such future processes has not really begun in the scientific and policymaking communities. This report therefore calls for the scaling up of efforts to develop methods that combine metrics or indicators on resilience (grounded in empirical studies and recognizing the contextual nature of resilience and adaptation); adaptation performance in terms of implementation; and the effects on actual risk reduction now and in the future (in relation to measuring ""successful adaptation"" and the risk of maladaptation). Progress may be slow in these areas, but the authors of this report estimate that further development and promotion of robust assessment and decision-making approaches are likely as climate change impacts intensify, increasingly highlighting the need for enhanced adaptation ambitions.  The way forward This section discusses some overarching challenges in assessing adaptation progress and outlines key takeaways for future work on tracking it globally.   The challenges ahead This report raises several recurring knowledge barriers to understand adaptation, globally and across scales, aligned with those described in previous AGRs. These limitations underpin a number of key recommendations for the scientific and policymaking communities. First, on climate hazards, it is crucial to better understand future climate trends and hazards at the national level, as well as at the subnational levels (for example, to highlight levels of cross-scale homogeneity/heterogeneity in terms of adaptation-related challenges). The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (IPCC 2021) contains ground-breaking information in this area (see the contribution of Working Group I, released in August 2021). The contribution of Working Group II, due in early 2022, will provide additional information, for example through the identification of representative key risks relevant to the interpretation of dangerous interferences with the climate system stressed by UNFCCC. Second, climate risk projections need to be dramatically improved as they are key to informing the assessment of adaptation progress or gaps. Given the multidimensional nature of climate risk (hazard, exposure, vulnerability and including adaptive capacity), a hard push is especially needed to better combine climate projections with scenarios on societal exposure and vulnerability (Garschagen et al. 2021; Magnan et al. 2021), for example through a more systematic application of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways approach to national contexts. Such combined scenarios can be highly beneficial to the policymaking community. By allowing contrasting risk levels under various warming scenarios and adaptation scenarios (for example, business-as-usual, medium ambition, high ambition), they will in turn highlight   the range of possible risk reductions (for example, business-as-usual versus high adaptation), support the identification of feasible adaptation scenarios, depending on context-specific risk tolerance patterns, and provide a sense of the residual risks expected to persist even after adaptation. Third, there is an urgent need for science-based advances to understand the effectiveness of adaptation responses in terms of their ability to reduce climate risk levels, both now and in the future, and therefore support successful adaptation over the long run, while limiting the risk of maladaptation. There is emerging scientific literature on frameworks to assess effectiveness, but more is needed, especially on national-level policy analysis. Lastly, the availability of multiple types of data and information needs to be substantially increased, including on private climate finance (to provide more comprehensive information on trends in adaptation finance) and adaptation plans implemented locally (to better capture the knock-on effect of national-level policies).  Towards the next generation of approaches for tracking adaptation progress The UNFCCC Adaptation Committee recently prepared several technical papers, including one in 2021, to review existing approaches for adaptation progress tracking, especially from the perspective of the Global Stocktake and with a view to opening up avenues to develop further methodological guidance (UNFCCC Adaptation Committee 2021a).2 Among several issues identified by the Adaptation Committee, two touch on critical points raised throughout the AGR series, namely the type of information needed to understand adaptation progress and the way to use/ aggregate the data and information. In addition to reinforcing caution about the overall feasibility of aggregating quantitative indicators and data, the  Adaptation Committee paper argues that a standardized approach to assess progress carries the risk of masking both the sensitivities of national contexts in terms of exposure and vulnerability to climate change, and the divergence of approaches to monitor, evaluate and report on adaptation action. In line with findings from the scientific community, the paper also emphasizes that existing approaches usually rely on just a few different types of information (often just one), such as national communications or quantitative indicators/ statistical data. Yet it is increasingly acknowledged that multiple sources of information (both quantitative and qualitative data, both scientifically-based and from traditional knowledge systems, etc.) provide different types of understandings that do not compete with but complement each other. For example, quantitative data sets help describe formal dimensions of vulnerability conditions but are unable to reflect more qualitative dimensions. On the other hand, traditional and indigenous knowledge or the perspectives of women and other vulnerable groups are key to reflecting such qualitative and often intuitive information on vulnerability and risk on the ground but can be hard to include in traditional scientific analysis. Lastly, the paper also warns against the risk of the dilution and loss of information throughout the complex synthesis and reporting mechanisms under the UNFCCC. The issue may not always be data itself, but rather the way information is used to inform policy and action at higher levels. Being able to identify new approaches to allow different types of information (quantitative and qualitative, and evaluative and descriptive) to be brought together at multiple scales is an emerging challenge. For example, recent publications have used expert judgement approaches to understand future climate risk at local levels (Oppenheimer et al. 2019; Duvat et al. 2021) or support a more comprehensive assessment of adaptation (for example, the UK Climate Change Committee regular reports3 and GAP-Track approach by IDDRI4). Such approaches provide promising ways forward, but still need further exploration and validation.  "
UNEP-2021-5.txt,"2021 Report The Production Gap Governments' planned fossil fuel production remains dangerously out of sync with Paris Agreement limits  About This Report The Production Gap Report -- first launched in 2019 -- tracks the discrepancy between governments' planned fossil fuel production and global production levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or 2∞C. The report represents a collaboration of several research and academic institutions, including input from more than 40 experts. UNEP staff provided guidance and insights from their experience leading other gap reports. This year's report presents the first comprehensive update of the production gap analysis since our 2019 assessment. The report also tracks how governments worldwide are supporting fossil fuel production through their policies, investments, and other measures, as well as how some are beginning to discuss and enact policies towards a managed and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production. This year's report features individual country profiles for 15 major fossil fuel-producing countries, and a special chapter on the role of transparency in helping to address the production gap. Assessment of the production gap is based on recent and publicly accessible plans and projections for fossil fuel production published by governments and affiliated institutions. For other elements of the report, such as the magnitude of producer subsidies or the status of policies to limit production, the report draws from a mix of publicly available government, intergovernmental, and research sources as cited and listed in the references.

Extraction-based emissions accounting An accounting framework that attributes greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels to the location of fuel extraction. Fossil fuel production A collective term used in this report to represent processes along the fossil fuel supply chain, which includes locating, extracting, processing, and delivering coal, oil, and gas to consumers. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) Atmospheric gases that absorb and emit infrared radiation, trap heat, contribute to the greenhouse effect, and cause global warming. The principal GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). Just transition In the context of climate policy, this refers to a shift to a low-carbon economy that ensures disruptions are minimized for workers, communities, consumers, and other stakeholders who may be disproportionately affected (ITUC 2017; UNFCCC 2016).  Long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) Under the Paris Agreement and its accompanying decision, all countries are invited to communicate LT-LEDS by 2020, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) Submissions by Parties to the Paris Agreement that contain their stated ambitions to take climate change action towards achievement of the Agreement's long-term goal of limiting global temperature increase to well below 2∞C, while pursuing efforts to limit the increase to ∞C. Parties are requested to communicate new or updated NDCs by 2020 and every five years thereafter. Production gap The discrepancy between countries' planned fossil fuel production and global production levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or 2∞C. Stranded assets Assets that suffer from unanticipated or premature write-offs or downward revaluations, or that are converted to liabilities, as the result of a low-carbon transition or other environment-related risks (Ansar et al. 2013). Subsidy A financial benefit accorded to a specific interest ( an individual, organization, company, or sector) by a government or public body including direct transfer of government funds; tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and underpricing of goods and services; induced transfers (price support); and transfer of risk to government.   v  Abbreviations  AFOLU Agriculture, forestry, and other land use  Bcf  Billion cubic feet  BECCS Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  CCS Carbon capture and storage  CDR Carbon dioxide removal  CH4 CO2 CO2e  Methane Carbon dioxide Carbon dioxide equivalent  CPP  Countries' plans and projections  ∞C  Degree Celsius  DFI  Development finance institution  ECA  Export credit agency  EITI  Extractive Industries Transparency  Initiative  EJ  Exajoule  EU  European Union  FPIC Free, prior, and informed consent  GGroup of Seven  GGroup of Twenty  GDP Gross domestic product  GHG Greenhouse gas  Gt  Gigatonne (billion tonnes or  metric tons)  IEA  International Energy Agency  ILO  International Labour Organization  IMF  International Monetary Fund  IPCC  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  LNG  Liquefied natural gas  LT-LEDS Long-term, low-emission development strategies  Mb/d Million barrels per day  MDB Multilateral development bank  Mt  Million tonnes (metric tons)  NDC Nationally determined contribution  NOC National oil and gas company  NZE  IEA's Net Zero by 2050 pathway for  the energy sector  OECD  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  OPEC  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  PFI  Public finance institution  PGR  Production Gap Report  SDG Sustainable Development Goal  SOE  State-owned enterprise  TCFD  Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  UAE  United Arab Emirates  UN  United Nations  UNEP  United Nations Environment Programme  UNFCCC UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  UK  United Kingdom  US  United States  WTO World Trade Organization  vi   Foreword  The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report serves as a crucial reminder that climate change is already affecting our lives today: the damages are widespread, rapid, and intensifying. The report also serves as a clarion call that while there is still time to limit long-term warming to ∞C, that window of opportunity is rapidly closing. The Production Gap Report ≠ now in its third edition ≠ shines a spotlight on the path that governments must take to align their fossil fuel supply with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thus far, this action has largely been restricted to promoting carbon capture and storage and minimizing emissions from extraction processes. However, as this year's report shows, these measures alone are insufficient; they cannot substitute for a global, long-term wind down of coal, oil, and gas. A global transition away from fossil fuels is paramount to avoiding dangerous climate change, saving millions of lives from air pollution, ending harm to local communities in extraction frontiers, and protecting our biodiversity and ecosystems. At COP26 and beyond, the world's governments must take immediate steps to address the production gap, while ensuring that this transition occurs in a just and equitable manner.  A growing number of countries are announcing targets to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. While this is a positive development, bending the emissions curve downwards requires these pledges to be accompanied by concrete, near- and long-term actions. This includes immediate, steep, and sustained reductions in fossil fuel production and burning. However, the world's energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil, and gas. And as this report reveals, the global production gap has remained largely unchanged since the first assessment in 2019. Governments are still planning to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C. This discrepancy points to the urgent need for net-zero pledges to be translated into action to wind down fossil fuel production. Governments have a key role to play here. State-owned companies control more than half of global fossil fuel production, and government policies and spending shape energy markets in significant ways. It is imperative that fossil fuel-producing nations recognize their role and responsibility in closing the production gap and steering us towards a safe climate future.  Key Findings  Governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C. The production gap has remained largely unchanged since our first analysis in 2019.  Global fossil fuel production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to ∞C.  Most major oil and gas producers are planning on increasing production out to 2030 or beyond, and several major coal producers are planning on continuing or increasing production.  G20 countries have directed more new funding to fossil fuels than clean energy since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  International public finance for the production of fossil fuels from G20 countries and multilateral development banks (MDBs) has significantly decreased in recent years.  Governments have a primary role to play in closing the production gap and in ensuring that the transition away from fossil fuels is just and equitable.   Executive Summary This report first introduced and quantified the ""production gap"" in 2019, finding that the world's governments planned to produce far more fossil fuels than consistent with their Paris Agreement commitment to limit global warming. Two years on, with the climate crisis clearer and more urgent than ever, governments continue to bet on extracting far more coal, oil, and gas than is consistent with agreed climate limits.  Specifically, this report's production gap analysis -- the first full update since 2019 -- finds that the world's governments still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C, and 45% more than consistent with limiting warming to 2∞C. Collectively, although many governments have pledged to lower their  emissions and even set net-zero targets, they have not yet made plans to wind down production of the fossil fuels that, once burned, generate most of those emissions. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report issued an important call to action: we are running out of time to limit long-term global warming to ∞C or  Figure   even 2∞C. This report shows that doing so requires steep and sustained reductions in fossil fuel production and use. The world's governments must take urgent action to close the production gap. The report's main findings are as follows: As countries set net-zero emission targets, and increase their climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement, they have not explicitly recognized or planned for the rapid reduction in fossil fuel production that these targets will require. Rather, the world's governments plan to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C. The production gap has remained largely unchanged since our first analysis in 2019. Since the release of the first Production Gap Report in 2019, many governments have announced new, more ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, including net-zero pledges. While this is a positive development, only a few fossil-fuel-producing countries have begun to grapple with how zeroing out global GHG emissions will affect their future coal, oil, and gas production. As shown in Figure , according to our assessment of recent national energy plans and projections, governments are in aggregate planning to produce 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C, and 45% more than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2∞C, on a global level. By 2040, this excess grows to 190% and 89%, respectively. Collectively, governments are planning and projecting production levels higher than those implied by their emission reduction goals, as announced in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the UN climate process and other climate policies as of mid-2020, as also shown in Figure  Global fossil fuel production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to ∞C. However, as shown in Figure , governments are collectively projecting an increase in global oil and gas production, and only a modest decrease in coal production, over the next two decades. This leads to future production levels far above those consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or 2∞C. The production gap is widest for coal in 2030: governments' production plans and projections would lead to around 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas than would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C.  Compared to global production levels under the 2∞C-consistent pathways, governments' production plans and projections would lead to 120% more coal, 14% more oil, and 15% more gas in 2030. The production gaps for all fuels grow much wider by 2040 under both temperature limits. This disconnect could be even worse than our analysis implies. As explored in Chapter 2, our estimate of the size of the production gap depends on model assumptions and conceptions of how the low-carbon transition unfolds, such as how much carbon dioxide can be captured and stored or sequestered, and the tradeoffs among different emission-reduction strategies. If carbon dioxide removal technologies fail to develop at large scale, or if methane emissions are not rapidly reduced, the production gap would be wider than estimated here. Furthermore, Chapter 2 shows that minimizing methane emissions from fossil fuel extraction and distribution alone is not a substitute for a rapid wind-down in fossil fuel production itself. G20 countries have directed nearly USD 300 billion in new funds towards fossil fuel activities since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic -- more than they have toward clean energy. In contrast, they have significantly decreased new international public finance for fossil fuel production in recent years; multilateral development banks (MDBs) and G20 development finance institutions (DFIs) holding a total of over USD 2 trillion in assets have adopted policies that exclude fossil fuel production activities from future finance. The trajectory of fossil fuels will be shaped by the unprecedented levels of investment that many governments are now injecting into their economies, as part of their COVID-19 recovery efforts. Since January 2020, G20 countries have directed USD 297 billion of new public financial commitments towards fossil-fuel-consuming and -producing activities. Though governments have begun to shift more of their COVID-19 recovery spending to clean energy, they still spend more on support for fossil fuels. While international public finance institutions continue to support fossil fuel extraction, distribution, and processing, there are promising trends: new public finance for the production of fossil fuels from MDBs and G20 countries has significantly decreased since 2017, and, increasingly, MDBs and G20 DFIs have policies that exclude future investment in these activities.  This report details the government strategies, support, and plans for fossil fuel production in 15 major producer countries. Most major oil and gas producers are planning on increasing production out to 2030 or beyond, while several major coal producers are planning on continuing or increasing production. This report provides country profiles for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The profiles summarize each country's stated national climate ambitions; available information on government views, projections, and support for fossil fuel production; and emerging policies and discussions towards a managed and equitable wind-down of production. These countries have announced GHG emission reduction targets through their NDCs and, in some cases, have set net-zero goals. However, few have assessed, at least publicly, whether their projected fossil fuel production is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This focus on emissions alone ignores their roles and responsibilities in producing the predominant source of these emissions. Moreover, the country profiles show that most of these governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, through tax breaks, finance, direct infrastructure investments, exemptions from environmental requirements, and other measures. As Figure  shows, most major oil- and gas-producing countries are planning on expanding production. For coal, some countries plan to reduce production while others still plan to continue or increase it. While some countries are beginning to discuss and enact policies towards a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production, these efforts have not yet affected the plans and strategies of major producing countries. Verifiable and comparable information on fossil fuel production and support -- from both governments and companies -- is essential to addressing the production gap. Governments should strengthen transparency by disclosing their production plans in their climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. While existing transparency initiatives have shed some light on fossil fuel production, the available information is incomplete, inconsistent, and scattered. Addressing  + For India, changes shown are for 2024 relative to 2019. Denotes an increase of greater than 5% by 2030, relative to 2019 production in energy terms. Denotes a decrease of greater than 5% by 2030, relative to 2019 production in energy terms. Denotes change in production by 2030 stays within 5% of 2019 production in energy terms. Annual production in 2019 is less than  EJ.  the production gap requires governments to be far more transparent in their plans and projections for oil, gas, and coal production. Governments have already committed to reporting climate-related information as part of the Paris Agreement. This reporting currently focuses on emissions goals, but governments could also include production plans and projections -- and how these plans align with climate goals -- in their NDCs, their long-term, low-emissions development strategies (LT-LEDS), and their progress reports on implementing and achieving their NDCs. Governments can also mandate that investor- and stateowned fossil fuel companies disclose their spending, project plans, emissions, and climate-related financial risks in a way that is consistent across countries. Governments have a primary role to play in closing the production gap. In addition to strengthening measures to reduce the demand for fossil fuels, governments should also take actions to ensure a managed and equitable decline in production, such as the following: j Acknowledge in their energy and climate plans that there is a need to wind down global fossil fuel production in line with the Paris Agreement's temperature limits. This creates impetus and accountability for policy action. j Chart the course towards a rapid, just, and equitable wind-down of fossil fuel production as part of overall decarbonization plans. Comprehensive efforts to wean countries off the use of coal, oil, and gas should be coupled with strategies to ramp down production to ensure a less disruptive transition. j Place restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and extrac tion to avoid locking in levels of fossil fuel supply that are inconsistent with climate goals. j Phase out government support for fossil fuel production. Governments can end subsidies and other support for production, exclude fossil fuels from public finance, and direct greater support towards low-carbon development. j Leverage international cooperation to ensure a more effective and equitable global wind-down of production. A just, equitable, and effective transition will require greater international support for countries highly dependent on fossil fuel production and with limited financial and institutional capacity. Countries with greater capacity can lead the way. 1. Introduction For many people, the extraction, processing, and burning of coal, oil, and gas is invisible; it happens out of sight and out of mind. We turn on lights, heat water, light a stove, buy goods -- and rarely see the physical fuel itself, let alone the emissions caused by burning it. Further from view is where the fuel came from: the well or mine.  Governments, however, very much have fossil fuels in their sights. The production and export of fossil fuels can support or hinder local economies, aid or impede alliances between countries, and make or break the political careers of government policymakers. This report, now in its third edition, highlights the tension between the importance that governments have traditionally attached to fossil fuels and a harmful effect of fossil fuel production and trade: global warming. We find that government plans for fossil fuel production are still far more in line with worsening climate disasters than they are with internationally agreed temperature limits. This disconnect is the ""production gap"" -- the difference between government plans for fossil fuel production and the levels consistent with globally agreed climate limits. And while the breadth of the gap is sobering, governments have the power to address it. Fossil fuels are something governments have substantial control over. More than half of the world's fossil fuel production is directly owned by governments, including by state-owned companies. Even when governments do not directly own fossil fuels, their policies and permits still control, to a large degree, how much fossil fuel gets extracted. This ability to steer fossil fuel supply can be an important component of meeting global temperature and emissions goals, including ""net-zero"" emissions targets. When fewer fossil fuels are produced, fewer are burned, and fewer greenhouse gas emissions are released. Therefore, by working together to constrain fossil fuel production, countries can help bend the emissions curve downwards on a path towards net zero. Working together on emissions from fossil fuels is something nations already do, through major critical venues like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which yielded the Paris Agreement in 2015. Though nations have also cooperated on steering fossil fuel production -- such as through the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) -- they have not yet done so with the intent of limiting climate change.  A few countries, however, are starting to announce their intentions to ban or move away from producing fossil fuels. This collection of nations is -- so far -- composed of countries with relatively limited fossil fuel resources (such as Costa Rica and Denmark), but it could expand, while other groups and coalitions of fossil-fuel-producing nations could form or adapt their missions to focus on climate. After all, major fossil-fuel-producing countries have reason to limit the supply of fossil fuels: tighter supply leads to higher prices and revenues for existing fossil fuel resource holders, which can boost local economies. Higher prices also can help reduce emissions. Governments may be wary of being perceived as getting too directly involved in fossil fuel markets in a way that might increase prices for energy consumers. That is understandable, and fossil fuel prices that are too high can negatively affect the economy. However, the bigger, longer-term risk is instead prices that are too low. By enacting measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, and hence cutting fossil fuel demand, countries will already be pushing producer prices lower. As an example of the problem of low fossil fuel prices, the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently found in its Net Zero by 2050 report that oil prices could head steadily downward toward USD 37 per barrel by the end of this decade, as nations move to low-carbon forms of transport such as electric vehicles. To ward off volatility and keep prices from sinking even lower, the IEA foresees that even fossil-fuel-rich states may need to purposefully limit supply, so as not to threaten the financial value of their existing deposits. In other words, working together to limit supply, in tandem with demand, could bring more certainty to the markets, adding extra force to the low-carbon transition. Furthermore, constraining supply can help ensure that, as fossil fuel demand declines, prices do not get so low as to spur new consumption, undermining the path to net-zero emissions. Put simply, limits on supply can ensure that when increasingly stringent climate policy prevents a barrel of oil or ton of coal from being burned in one location, it is not instead burned somewhere else. The way forward for aligning fossil fuel production with climate limits is not easy. Government efforts to limit fossil fuel production will need strong support to succeed politically. That is a challenge, in part due to the long history of fossil fuel extraction -- and associated social and political institutions that maintain fossil fuel dominance -- in many coal-, oil-, and gas-producing communities. One source of support may be local residents. They feel the health effects of extracting fossil fuels, whether through water pollution, coal dust, or other dangerous chemicals in the air. Local residents also value biodiversity, recreation, and tourism; fossil fuel development conflicts with these priorities. And, in many areas of the world, engaged citizens are the ones who have most clearly pointed out the disconnect between fossil fuel development and climate change mitigation. Another source of support may be the courts. National courts in some countries have issued rulings that underscore the conflict between expanding fossil fuel production and climate limits. For example, the District Court of The Hague in the Netherlands ruled that Royal Dutch Shell's production levels contribute to global warming, and that, by reducing production of fossil fuels, Shell would help reduce global carbon emissions. Still, few national policymakers are on board with limiting fossil fuel supply in the name of climate protection. The most recent cooperative climate effort from major fossil-fuel-producing national governments -- the Net-Zero Producers Forum -- has thus far focused on extracting fossil fuels in less-polluting ways, not on winding down production levels in line with climate goals. Those efforts are important, as reducing methane and other emissions at fossil fuel extraction sites is a critical step in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. But as we show in this report, making fossil fuel extraction less polluting is also highly insufficient. The overall levels of fossil fuel production urgently need to decrease. Governments, with fossil fuels under their policy control, are key to closing the production gap. They can establish the norms and rules that will ensure that companies extract less fossil fuels, and only they have the broad,  economy-wide interests, power, and responsibilities to protect social and economic stability during the transition. While private-sector actors -- including energy companies and financial institutions -- should also move away from extracting and investing in fossil fuels, their action is no substitute for the economy-wide, public-interest role and responsibility of government. This report thus focuses on governments, and their role in widening, or closing, the production gap. It quantifies the size of the production gap (Chapter 2), summarizes how governments support fossil fuel production (Chapter 3), details how governments in 15 key countries deal with fossil fuel production (Chapter 4), and highlights opportunities for strengthening the transparency necessary to help close the production gap (Chapter 5). Finally, a concluding chapter (Chapter 6) discusses how governments can manage the decline of fossil fuel production in line with climate goals in a just and equitable way.   2 The Production Gap  Key Messages  The world's governments are planning to produce 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C, and 45% more than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2∞C. The production gap grows much wider by 2040.  The size of the production gap has remained largely unchanged compared to our prior assessments.  The production gap is widest for coal: governments' production plans and projections would lead to around 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas in 2030 than global levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C.  Governments are in aggregate planning on increasing gas production out to at least 2040. This continued, long-term expansion in gas production is inconsistent with the Paris Agreement's temperature limits.  Global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting longterm warming to ∞C.  If carbon dioxide removal technologies fail to develop at large scale, fossil fuel production would need to decline even more rapidly.   2. The Production Gap Since the release of the first Production Gap Report in 2019, many governments have updated their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement and announced new, more ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets, including net-zero pledges. While this is a positive development, only a few fossil-fuel-producing countries have begun to grapple with how zeroing out global GHG emissions will affect their future coal, oil, and gas production.  This chapter quantifies the global fossil fuel production gap: the discrepancy between the global levels of fossil fuel production implied by governments' plans and projections and the levels consistent with the Paris Agreement's goals (namely, limiting warming to well below 2∞C and ""pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to ∞C""). It provides the first comprehensive update to the production gap estimate since the inaugural edition of this report in  We first quantify the production gap in Section , before discussing the major trends and drivers of the gap -- and its changes compared to our 2019 assessment -- in Section  We then explore the uncertainties of the production gap, due to assumptions underlying different mitigation pathways, in Section   The fossil fuel production gap The calculation of the production gap relies on two major elements. The first is the pathway of global future fossil fuel production implied by the plans and projections of national governments. The second is the pathway of global fossil fuel production that would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or to 2∞C. The first element relies on our compilation of government projections for fossil fuel production, as outlined in recent and publicly available national energy outlooks and targets as of August  This year, that includes outlooks from the eight major countries included in our 2019 report, as well as outlooks from seven additional countries. Altogether, these 15 countries accounted for around 75% of global fossil fuel extraction, on an energy basis, in 2020. Their combined production levels are then scaled up to a global estimate, based on these countries' projected future shares of global production (see details in Section  and online Appendix B). The result is our global ""countries' plans and projections"" pathway. Our updated assessment of the gap therefore reflects -- to the extent  possible based on data availability -- how governments expect their fossil fuel production will be influenced by more ambitious climate mitigation targets and policies, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other factors. The second element to the production gap is the pathway of global fossil fuel production that would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or to 2∞C, based on the mitigation scenarios compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for their Special Report on Global Warming of ∞C, which the IPCC refers to as """" (IPCC, 2018b; Rogelj et al., 2018). These scenarios show how much ""primary energy"" is supplied by coal, oil, and gas under emissions pathways with varying global warming outcomes, from which we calculate the median values and interquartile ranges. We calculated the ""2∞C-consistent"" pathway as the median of scenarios that have at least a 66% probability of limiting warming to below 2∞C over the entire 21st century (meaning, no temperature overshoot), relative to the pre-industrial global average atmospheric temperature. We calculated the ""∞C-consistent"" pathway as the median of scenarios with at least a 50% likelihood of limiting warming to below ∞C by end-of-century (meaning, with a low amount of  1 Last year's Special Report 2020 put the production gap in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, but did not fully re-assess the production gap. 2 Throughout the report, we collectively refer to the sources from which future fossil fuel production is estimated as ""plans and projections"", given that there are varying levels of details, certainty, and intent associated with each document published by governments and affiliated institutions. Governments take a variety of factors into consideration in assembling these plans and projections, including the state of each country's fossil fuel reserves, the evolution of technologies and costs of extraction, the presence of subsidies and regulations, and foreseeable dynamics of domestic and international demand. Some of these factors are described further in Chapters 3 and 4.  temporary overshoot allowed before 2100).3 We further constrained these two sets of scenarios by how much carbon they sequester from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and by afforestation; specifically, we only included scenarios in which BECCS sequesters an average of less than 5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year (GtCO2/yr) and in which afforestation sequesters an average of less than  GtCO2/yr, both as assessed between 2040 and 2060. This approach follows the Climate Action Tracker's interpretation of sustainable limits for these carbon dioxide removal (CDR) practices, given their ""multiple feasibility and sustainability constraints,"" as noted by the IPCC (IPCC, 2018a, p. 19; New Climate Institute et al., 2018). Further details are provided in online Appendix B. These low-carbon pathways are identical to those we used in prior assessments of the production gap, since new scenario sets from the IPCC were not yet available when we conducted this year's gap analysis. The release of the IPCC's Mitigation of Climate Change: Working Group III Contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 will enable us to update these low-carbon pathways in the  The global levels of fossil fuel production under each of these pathways are shown in Figure  The production gap is the difference between the production level under the low-carbon pathways (2∞C or ∞C) and the level under the countries' plans and projections pathway in any given year. In this figure, the production gap is denominated in units of billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2), representing the amount of CO2 emissions expected to be released from the combustion of extracted coal, oil, and  As shown, countries are planning on producing around 110% more fossil fuels (or more than double the amount) in 2030 than would be consistent with the median ∞C-warming pathway, and 45% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the median 2∞C-warming pathway. This amounts to 19 GtCO2 more than the median ∞C pathway (with an interquartile range of 16≠21 GtCO2 relative to all ∞C pathways  analysed), and 12 GtCO2 more than the median 2∞C pathway (with a range of 9≠14 GtCO2), in 2030. The gap then grows wider beyond 2030, as countries' plans and projections continue upward, further departing from the low-carbon pathways. By 2040, countries' plans and projections show 190% more fossil fuels than would be consistent with the median ∞C pathway, and 89% more than the median 2∞C pathway. Figure  also shows a fourth pathway (gold line): global fossil fuel production levels implied by countries' climate pledges, as modelled by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in their Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) in the World Energy Outlook 2020 (IEA, 2020). This pathway reflects the estimated levels of fossil fuel production that would result from countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs under the UN climate process), as well as other announced policy intentions as of mid-2020 (IEA, 2020, p. 415). We find that governments' fossil fuel production plans and projections in aggregate (red line) exceed, by close to 10%, the levels of global fossil fuel production implied by their own stated climate pledges (gold line).6 The production gap can also be quantified in terms of its component fuels. Figure  shows the individual production gaps for coal, oil, and gas. Here, the amounts of fossil fuel production under the four different pathways are calculated and shown in energy-based units (exajoules). This enables a direct comparison between the levels of production under the countries' plans and projections pathway, and those under the ∞C- and 2∞C-consistent pathways (which are in their original energy-based units, as reported by the integrated assessment model scenarios compiled by the IPCC  (IPCC, 2018b). Under both the median ∞C- and 2∞C-warming pathways, global coal and oil production peak in 2020 and decline thereafter. The same is true for gas under the ∞C-warming pathway; under the 2∞C-warming pathway, it rises modestly until 2030 before declining thereafter.  To be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C, global coal, oil, and gas production would have to decrease by around 11%, 4%, and 3%, respectively, each year between 2020 and  However, governments are collectively projecting an increase in global oil and gas production, and only a modest decrease in coal production, from 2020 onwards (as shown by the ""countries' plans and projections"" pathways in Figure  By 2030, this would lead to 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas than consistent with the median ∞C-warming pathway, and to 120% more coal, 14% more oil, and 15% more gas than consistent with the median 2∞C-warming pathway. The production gaps grow much wider by 2040 under both temperature limits.  In other words, the production gap is proportionally largest for coal, with countries planning on producing coal at levels vastly incommensurate with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In aggregate, countries are planning on producing  billion tonnes more coal in 2030 than would be consistent with the median ∞C-warming pathway (with an interquartile range of  billion≠ billion tonnes relative to all ∞C pathways analysed). To put this excess amount into context, it is roughly equivalent to 75% of current levels of global coal production. The production gap for oil is also substantial, especially compared to the ∞C-warming pathway. Nations are, in aggregate, planning on producing around 40 million barrels per day (Mb/d) more oil than would be consistent with the median ∞C pathway in 2030 (with a range of 26≠56 Mb/d). This excess is roughly equivalent to half of current global oil production. Similarly, for gas, countries are in aggregate planning on producing around 2 trillion cubic meters (Tcm) more in 2030 than would be consistent with the median ∞C-warming pathway (with a range of ≠ Tcm). This excess is roughly equivalent to half of current global gas production. Our analysis shows that continued, long-term expansion in gas production is inconsistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the models that generate the ∞C- and 2∞C-consistent pathways include assumptions that may not pan out, meaning gas production would need to decline even more quickly than shown in Figure  Namely, these models assume that methane emissions associated with producing, transporting, and distributing gas can be minimized, and also rely on substantial levels of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for gas-based energy from 2040 onwards (installed, for example, at gas power plants or hydrogen facilities) (Rogelj et al., 2018). Should these outcomes not be plausible because of technical and public perception issues (Bruckner et al., 2014), the role of gas in low-carbon pathways would be even more limited than that shown in Figure   A breakdown of the ""countries' plans and projections"" pathway In this section, we explore trends in major producer countries that underlie the global coal, oil, and gas ""countries' plans and projections"" (CPP) pathway, and then describe how these pathways have changed compared to our 2019 assessment. This year's analysis of the CPP pathway comprises an evaluation of the most recent government plans and projections from the eight major fossil-fuel-producing countries we assessed in our 2019 report, as well as from seven additional countries. This year's analysis thus relies on the plans and projections of 15 major producer countries (countries added this year are denoted with an asterisk*): Australia, Brazil*, Canada, China, Germany*, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan*, Mexico*, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia*, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)*, the United Kingdom (UK)*, and the United States (US). On an energy basis, these producer countries accounted for 75% of global fossil fuel production in 2020 (IEA, 2020). Within these 15 countries, 8 had government plans and projections for coal (accounting for around 90% of global production), 14 had projections for oil (70%), and 13 had projections for gas (65%). Figure  shows the individual contributions of these 15 countries to the global coal, oil, and gas CPP pathways, denominated in units of energy and extraction-based CO2 emissions. The global values (shown by the red lines, which are equivalent to the pathways shown in Figure  are estimated by scaling the aggregated production levels of the 15 countries shown, based on their future shares of global coal, oil, and gas production as modelled in the IEA STEPS (IEA, 2020) (see online Appendix B for further details on this approach). As previously described, the CPP pathways show global oil and gas production continuously rising out to 2040, after a small dip in 2020, while coal declines slightly throughout this period. Specifically, under the CPP pathways, annual coal production is projected to be 12 EJ lower (-7%) in 2030 than in 2019, while oil production is 31 EJ higher (+16%), and gas production is 28 EJ higher (+19%). The decline in coal is led by today's largest two coal producers, China and the US, which foresee drops of 13 EJ and 4 EJ, respectively, over this period. However, this decline is partially counteracted by projected increases in India, Russia, and  The projected increase for oil is led by Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and the US, each of which project oil production to be 5≠7 EJ higher in 2030 relative to 2019. Of the other 11 countries assessed, 8 also foresee smaller increases (while the UK, Russia, and Indonesia see small decreases). For gas, the planned increase is led by Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, and the US, each of which project gas production to be more than 5 EJ higher in 2030 than in 2019. Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, and Mexico also foresee smaller increases (while the UK, Norway, Indonesia, and Kazakhstan foresee small decreases). As shown in Figure , according to the outlooks from governments and affiliated institutions, today's largest producers will dominate the global total cumulative production between 2019 and 2040. Between one and four countries will account for around half of the projected global total of each fuel: China for coal; the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Canada for oil; and the US, Russia, China, and Saudi Arabia for gas. Compared to our 2019 analysis, this year's assessment of the global CPP pathways is more comprehensive, since it includes government plans and projections from seven additional countries. This expanded scope makes it difficult to directly compare the CPP pathways in our 2021 assessment to those in our 2019 assessment; the lack of regular, standardized reporting across countries on planned domestic fossil fuel production, and a general lack of transparency, also complicates the  Nevertheless, in aggregate, we find that the size of the production gap has remained largely unchanged compared to our 2019 assessment (see Figures  and  and further details online Appendix B).10 This broadly stagnant gap includes slight changes for oil production. The COVID-19 pandemic has played some role in lowering the CPP pathway for oil in the near term. The sharp decrease in travel associated with the response to the pandemic pushed down oil demand forecasts (and, in turn, investment levels in new oil supply). However, these economic effects are projected to be short-lived (IMF, 2021). By 2030, plans for oil production grow to the same levels foreseen in our 2019 analysis, before flattening out by 2040 to levels about 9% below our previous analysis. Still, we find that global planned oil production will exceed levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C by 57% in 2030 and by 170% in 2040. For coal, projections under the CPP pathway in 2030≠ 2040 have decreased slightly compared to our 2019 analysis. Still, governments' planned coal production will vastly exceed global levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C -- by 240% in 2030 and by 450% in 2040. For gas, the global level of production estimated under the CPP pathway in 2030≠2040 has remained largely unchanged since our 2019 analysis. Governments' planned gas production will exceed the levels consistent with limiting warming to ∞C by 71% in 2030 and by 150% in 2040.  Altogether, the largely unchanged outlooks for global coal, oil, and gas production under the CPP pathways in 2030 means that our estimate of the overall production gap has remained almost the same for that year. In 2040, small reductions in the levels of oil and coal under the CPP pathways translate to a very small narrowing of the overall gap (by 3%).Implications of mitigation pathways on the production gap As discussed in Section , one of two major elements we use to estimate the size of the production gap is the future pathways of global fossil fuel production that would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C or 2∞C. Our analysis relies on the set of mitigation pathways assembled by the IPCC  (IPCC, 2018b). Each model scenario has its own estimates for how quickly coal, oil, and gas have to be phased down in order to meet the ∞C- and 2∞C-warming limits of the Paris  We use the median values across scenarios to calculate the production gap, but this is not the only way this estimate could be made (Huppmann et al., 2018). For example, it is possible that certain groups of scenarios -- or even individual scenarios on their own -- are more plausible than the median values. There are also very different conceptions of how the low-carbon transition might unfold. Accordingly, in this section, we explore how the size of the production gap might differ under the four ""illustrative pathways"" of the IPCC  (IPCC, 2018b; Rogelj et al., 2018), as well as under IEA's recently released Net Zero by 2050 pathway (NZE) for the energy sector (IEA, 2021). Since these pathways are all designed to limit long-term warming to ∞C, we focus on this temperature limit in this section. Figure  shows how global fossil fuel production differs among different ∞C-consistent pathways, and how these six pathways compare to the ""countries' plans and projections"" pathway. We include the median pathway used to calculate the production gap, as well as the four IPCC  illustrative pathways (termed P1, P2, P3, and P4) and the IEA NZE pathway.  IPCC chose the four illustrative pathways to demonstrate ""the spectrum of CO2 emissions reduction patterns consistent with ∞C"", which range from very rapid decreases, facilitated by efficiency and demand-side measures, to relatively slower reductions that lead to a temperature overshoot and necessitate large carbon dioxide removal (CDR) deployment later in the century (Rogelj et al., 2018, p. 99).13 CDR refers to various approaches to removing carbon dioxide from the air, including afforestation, reforestation, BECCS, direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering of minerals, and ocean fertilization (Minx et al., 2018). The two CDR methods most often included in the IPCC  scenarios are BECCS and afforestation (Rogelj et al., 2018). Figure  shows how four key model variables that could substantially affect the size of the production gap differ among the P1≠P4 and NZE scenarios. These are: (a) CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning that can be captured and stored (fossil CCS); (b) CO2 emissions that can be captured and stored from bioenergy use from biomass (BECCS); (c) CO2 emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU); and (d) methane  The P1 pathway warrants special mention. This pathway was designed to reflect a mitigation approach that relies much more on reducing energy demand and electrifying end uses than on deploying CDR technologies (Grubler et al., 2018). As shown in Figure , the P1 scenario relies on lower levels of fossil fuels as a source of primary energy than either the Production Gap Report (PGR) median or any of the other pathways. Relatedly, as shown in the Figure  panels (a) and (b), the P1 scenario uses no CCS, either with fossil fuels or biomass, while relying on similar amounts of forest carbon sequestration as our PGR median pathway (panel c). Accordingly, this P1 pathway illustrates a key finding of this sensitivity exercise: the less CDR and CCS that can be deployed at scale in future years, the faster that fossil fuel supply and demand must decline, and the wider the production gap. Specifically, under the P1 pathway, the production gap in 2030 would be 23 instead of 19 GtCO2 -- or 21% larger than when using the median ∞C-warming scenario, as shown in Figure  The opposite is also true: with more CDR and/or CCS assumed to take place, more fossil fuels could be produced and burned in 2030, as the P3, P4, and NZE pathways illustrate. As shown in Figure , the P3 pathway assumes that much more emissions from fossil fuel burning can be captured and stored (as does the NZE, but to a lesser extent), while the P4 pathway assumes much more BECCS. This higher reliance on CCS and/or BECCS leads to a smaller production gap than that relative to our median pathway. This observation deserves a major caveat, however: the P4 scenario's use of land for both afforestation and biomass (and, by extension, biomass used in CCS) is higher than levels considered to be plausibly sustainable by the IPCC itself (Rogelj et al., 2018). Using this much land (and associated nutrient and chemical inputs) for afforestation and biomass could lead to unsustainable levels of water use and pollution and pose additional sustainability risks for agriculture and food systems and biodiversity (Calvin et al., 2021; Fuss et al., 2014, 2018; Minx et al., 2018; Nemet et al., 2018; Robledo-Abad et al., 2017; SÈfÈrian et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2016, 2019). Consequently, we consider the production gap implied by the P4 scenario to also be implausible, at least on the basis of land requirements. In fact, we did not use the P4 scenario in our calculation of the median ∞C-warming pathways, as it exceeded the BECCS and AFOLU constraints we imposed to select our scenario set (see Table  in the online Appendix for a list of all scenarios included). The P2 pathway offers some more nuanced insights about how different forms of emissions abatement can substitute for each other. It shows how, even if CDR technologies develop more slowly than in the median scenario, other forms of mitigation could achieve a similar level of emissions reduction. Specifically, while the P2 pathway relies on less BECCS than the PGR median pathway (Figure , it relies on greater methane emissions reduction (Figure  and carbon sequestration in land (Figure  Consequently, the size of the production gap in 2030 relative to the P2 pathway is nearly the same as that relative to the median ∞C pathway (Figure  These trade-offs between different means of reducing or removing emissions should not be surprising, since climate change is driven largely by cumulative total carbon dioxide emissions (IPCC, 2018b). Thus, different options for reducing or removing emissions can, in some cases, substitute for each other, depending on assumptions about -- among other factors -- non-CO2 warming effects, the interpretation of the required timing of the Paris Agreement temperature goals (Schleussner et al., 2019), and the effectiveness and social acceptability of CDR and its associated risks for land, food, water, and biodiversity, as discussed above. These observations have important implications for the production gap. First, even under implausibly high levels of BECCS in the P4 pathway, there would still be a sizeable production gap, and fossil fuel production would still need to start declining between now and 2030 (Figure  Second, CDR technologies may fail to develop at large scale due to technical and economic viability and/or social constraints (Anderson & Peters, 2016; Fuss et al., 2018; Grant et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2016). Thus, a precautionary approach would demand that fossil fuel production and use decline even more rapidly than in our median ∞C-warming pathway (Figure , P1 scenario). From this perspective, our calculation of the production gap is conservative, since it assumes more than 5 billion tonnes of CDR annually in the latter half of the century, a level at which the ""multiple feasibility and sustainability concerns"" noted by the IPCC (IPCC, 2018a, p. 19) -- such as intense land competition, and water pollution and biodiversity risks -- may present themselves (Fuss et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018). Lastly, relying on other emission-reduction strategies, such as reduction of methane, to compensate for the delayed availability of CDR strategies also poses some risks. As shown in Figure , the IPCC ∞C-consistent scenarios (P1, P2, P3 and P4) all show steep declines in methane emissions over the next 20 years, including by aggressive measures to minimize methane emissions at fossil fuel production sites (UNEP & CCAC, 2021). However, global methane emissions from human activities have been increasing and are expected to continue to increase under current policies; methane emissions from gas and oil production alone is expected to increase by around 280 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year (MtCO2e/yr) (Saunois et al., 2020; UNEP & CCAC, 2021).15 Ongoing efforts to reduce methane emissions from the extraction and distribution of fossil fuels are essential for slowing the rate of near-term warming (Ocko et al., 2021), and represent one of the most cost-effective, emission-reduction strategies (UNEP & CCAC, 2021). Nevertheless, a focus on reducing methane and other ""upstream"" emissions, as advocated by some fossil fuel producers and industry partnerships, is not a substitute for the need to wind down fossil fuel production itself in line with the Paris Agreement's goals. There are also other decarbonization roadmaps for limiting warming to ∞C beyond the model scenarios analysed and discussed here. For example, other researchers have explored pathways that do not assume continued growth in gross domestic production and do not rely on CDR technologies (Keyﬂer & Lenzen, 2021). Others have also pointed out that low-carbon pathways with limited CDR deployment and a faster phase out of fossil fuels will bring additional air pollution reduction and public health co-benefits (Shindell et al., 2018). Among all these models, the peak dates and decline rates in coal, oil, and gas production and use vary, depending on their assumptions. However, they all share one common outcome for meeting the temperature limits of the Paris Agreement: a global, long-term wind down of coal, oil, and gas production and use.   Conclusions Our assessment of the most recent government plans and projections for fossil fuel production reveals that the world's governments plan on producing around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with the median ∞C-warming pathway, and 45% more fossil fuels than would be consistent with the median 2∞C-warming pathway. The production gap has remained largely unchanged since our 2019 analysis. The gap remains proportionally largest for coal, even as governments plan small production decreases in aggregate. Meanwhile, governments plan to increase oil and gas production until at least 2040, leading to large production gaps for these fuels as well. As shown in this chapter's analysis of modelled scenarios assembled by the IPCC, global coal, oil, and gas production (and consumption) have to start declining immediately to be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C. Global coal and oil also have to decline immediately to be consistent with a 2∞C limit, while gas production must decline no later than 2030. However, current government plans and outlooks for fossil fuel production would take the world in the opposite direction, creating an ever-widening production gap that is vastly inconsistent with the Paris Agreement's goals. This disconnect could be even worse than our analysis implies. As explored in this chapter, our estimate of the size of the production gap partly depends on model assumptions and conceptions of how the energy sector can be decarbonized, such as how much carbon dioxide emissions can be captured and stored or sequestered, or how much methane emissions can be reduced in the near term. If CDR technologies fail to develop at large scale, a precautionary approach would demand that fossil fuel production and use decline even more rapidly than in our median ∞C- and 2∞C-consistent pathways. Similarly, relying on other near-term, emission-reduction strategies to compensate for the delayed availability of CDR technologies, such as minimizing methane emissions from fossil fuel extraction and distribution, is not a substitute for a sustained wind-down in fossil fuel production and use.   3 Government support and policies for fossil fuel production  Key Messages  Governments continue to commit more funds to fossil fuels than to clean energy through their COVID-19 recovery plans.  Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, public finance institutions have spent at least USD 294 billion supporting fossil fuels overseas.  Major multilateral development banks (MDBs) and G20 countries have significantly decreased new international public finance for production since 2017. MDBs and G20 development finance institutions (DFIs) holding a total of over USD 2 trillion in assets have adopted policies that exclude fossil fuel production activities from future finance.  Governments have an opportunity to reduce production through their leverage in state-owned companies, which control 50% of global oil and gas production and 55% of global coal production. However, current trends instead show an increase in government support for fossil fuel production and infrastructure.  Seven of the 15 major fossil-fuel producing countries analysed in this report have made net-zero emissions pledges. At the same time, most still plan on increasing their oil and gas production until at least 2030, in contradiction with the global production declines needed to limit warming to ∞C or 2∞C.   3. Government support and policies for fossil fuel production Governments have injected trillions of US dollars into the economy to respond to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many governments have committed to using some of these funds to ""build back better,"" including through public investment in low-carbon development, high-quality clean energy jobs, and a just transition for all. However, the policies, investments, and measures adopted so far have yet to match up with this ""build back better"" commitment.  Since the start of the pandemic, many governments have added to their long-standing support for domestic and overseas fossil fuel production through tax breaks, direct government spending, public finance, and support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (Geddes et al., 2020; Sanchez et al., 2021). This increase in support stands in contrast with the declines in production necessary to meet the Paris Agreement's goals as shown in Chapter 2, as well as with the International Energy Agency's recent report that found that ""there is no need for investment in new fossil fuel supply"" in a scenario that limits warming to ∞C (IEA, 2021b, p. 21). This chapter reviews both the way in which the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced new public support for fossil fuels and the mixed trends in government institutions' efforts to shift public support away from fossil fuel production.  Plans, targets, and projections Governments are key entities in driving future fossil fuel production. Not only do SOEs control more than half of global fossil fuel production (Beaton & Roberts, 2019; Nelson et al., 2014; NRGI, 2021), but governments also influence the decision-making of private fossil fuel companies and investors, including through their plans, targets, and projections for fossil fuel production. The future trajectory of fossil fuels is also being shaped by the unprecedented levels of COVID-19-related investment that many governments are injecting to boost their economies. The IEA and International Monetary Fund (IMF) now both project strong rebounds in oil demand and supply in coming years (IMF, 2021; IEA, 2021a). At the same time, a growing number of countries have announced targets to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century. As of July 2021, 53 countries and the European Union, representing more than two thirds of global GHG emissions and 93% of global GDP, have pledged  net-zero emissions targets (Climate Watch, 2021; Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, 2021).16 Seven of the 15 major fossil fuel producers profiled in Chapter 4 have adopted such commitments. Meeting these targets will require declines in fossil fuel production alongside reductions in consumption. Yet, as illustrated in Figure , and described in more detail in Chapter 4, most producer countries with net-zero targets still plan on increasing their oil and gas production, as do most who lack such targets. Indonesia, Norway, and the UK do project declines in the long term. But such trends are primarily a reflection of natural resource depletion (as producing fields become exhausted), rather than the result of intentionally aligning production with a decarbonized future. All major coal-producing countries with net-zero targets also project some declines in coal production; however, among those without them, some -- notably India and Russia -- are still projecting significant production increases this decade. Many countries continue to view expanding fossil fuel production as a key lever for their national development, energy security, and sovereignty (Harrison & Bang, 2021; Strambo & Gonz·lez Espinosa, 2020), even though the risks of relying on production have become increasingly clear -- either of stranded assets if decarbonization goals are achieved or of climate damages undermining development if they are not (IPCC, 2021; IEA, 2021b; IPCC, 2014). These views, along with projections and plans to increase fossil fuel production, provide rationales for continued national and international support for fossil fuels -- support which is at odds with countries' commitments to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals.   National support mechanisms At the national level, governments support fossil fuel production through a variety of financial, regulatory, and administrative mechanisms. In this section, we pay specific attention to financial mechanisms, including fossil fuel subsidies,17 aid to state-owned coal and oil and gas companies, and public funding commitments approved during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 response and economic recovery The scale and type of COVID-19 economic responses have varied widely across countries. Many wealthier countries have been able to rapidly fund large stimulus efforts, while many low- and middle-income countries are struggling to mobilize support at scale, burdened by high levels of debt and unfavourable conditions in international markets (Kose et al., 2021; O'Callaghan & Murdock, 2021). Several research efforts are tracking the potential climate, social, and environmental implications of economic measures approved during the COVID-19 pandemic. While they differ in scope, sectoral coverage, and methods, their findings are broadly aligned. The Global Recovery Observatory found that as of August 2021, only 23% (USD 530 billion) of announced economic recovery spending (USD  trillion) was ""green spending"" (Global Recovery Observatory, 2021). Another assessment found that, as of July 2021, stimulus measures in 20 of 30 countries analysed are likely to have a net negative environmental impact (Vivid Economics & Finance for Biodiversity Initiative, 2021). Focusing on energy-intensive sectors, the Energy Policy Tracker found that since January 2020, G20 countries have directed 45% (USD 297 billion) of new public money commitments towards fossil-fuel-consuming and -producing activities18 (Energy Policy Tracker, 2021).  In late 2020, countries' proportion of expenditure toward ""green"" policies increased, though governments continue to commit more COVID-19 funds to fossil fuels than to clean energy (Dufour et al., 2021; Green Recovery Tracker, 2021; SEI et al., 2020; Vivid Economics & Finance for Biodiversity Initiative, 2021). This is shown in Figure  As part of their COVID-19 responses, governments have provided support to the production of fossil fuels through new tax incentives, guarantees, regulatory changes, and other financial support, largely without accompanying social, economic, or environmental requirements (Energy Policy Tracker, 2021). Between January 2020 and June 2021, 31 countries added over USD 55 billion in support to production of fossil fuels (Energy Policy Tracker, 2021). This may be an underestimate, given the lack of data and transparency in many countries. These types of commitments may have long-lasting impacts by locking in fossil-fuel-intensive energy systems with equipment lifetimes of 10≠50 years (Erickson et al., 2015). Such commitments have included, for example, a special COVID-19 tax in Argentina, used to raise an estimated USD 479 million for new gas production (Government of Argentina, 2021; Boletin Oficial, 2020), and Canada's creation of the Oil and Gas Industry Recovery Assistance Fund, which has allocated USD 241 million (CAD 320 million) to activities such as facility maintenance and upgrades for the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore energy sector (Department of Finance Canada, 2020). This latter measure was part of a larger federal stimulus package, which also included USD  billion (CAD  billion) to fund the closure and reclamation of orphan and inactive wells in Western Canada, as well as USD 559 million (CAD 750 million) to reduce emissions in Canada's oil and gas sector, with a focus on methane. Fossil fuel subsidies A large number of fossil fuel production and consumption subsidies predate the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, fossil fuel subsides totalled approximately USD 468 billion (OECD, 2021). While lower fossil fuel prices have driven a recent decline in fossil fuel consumer subsidies,19 fossil fuel producer subsidies have been on the rise (OECD, 2021). In 2019, subsidies supporting the production of fossil fuels increased by 30% compared to 2018 levels, reaching a total of USD 53 billion, according to the data collected on 50 OECD members, non-OECD G20 members, and economies in the European Union's Eastern Partnership (OECD, 2021).20 The surge in production subsidies among OECD countries was driven by attempts to alleviate corporate debt and promote investment in fossil fuel infrastructure -- trends that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated in 2020 (OECD, 2021). The increase was particularly prominent in North America, due in part to Mexican government efforts to shore up its heavily indebted state-owned oil company, Pemex, and to automatic increases in long-standing US subsidies as oil prices declined and production increased (OECD, 2021). This trend is at odds with the commitment made by G20 countries in 2009 to ""rationalise and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption, while providing targeted support for the poor"" (G20, 2009), and the reaffirmed G7 commitment to ""eliminating inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by 2025"" (G7, 2021). The lack of progress in reforming fossil fuel subsidies is a lost opportunity, as such reforms could free up scarce public resources to build back better from the pandemic (IISD, 2021). State-owned coal and oil and gas companies Support channelled into fossil fuel production and infrastructure through state-owned enterprises (SOEs) -- specifically, national oil, gas, and coal companies -- also plays a prominent role in the evolution of the production gap. National oil and gas companies (NOCs)21 are responsible for more than 50% of global oil and gas production, and national coal companies control around 55% of global coal  NOCs account for 40% of total investment in oil and gas worldwide, making them one of the largest vehicles steering public revenues toward fossil fuel production (Manley & Heller, 2021). Governments have traditionally justified investments by NOCs and national coal companies by pointing to the central role fossil fuel extraction has played in government revenue, jobs, and energy security (Mahdavi, 2020; Victor et al., 2011). However, the risks of investing in fossil fuel extraction are rising amid the global energy transition. An increasing number of public finance institutions, investors, and insurance companies are reluctant to finance upstream fossil fuels (see Section  Meanwhile, NOCs are expected to invest almost USD 2 trillion over the next decade,23 predominantly on projects that may break even only if global oil and gas consumption exceeds the carbon budget compatible with limiting global temperature rise to ∞C or well below 2∞C (Manley & Heller, 2021). Moreover, NOCs tend to react to price changes more slowly than private companies when it comes to oil and gas investments, because their public ownership serves as a buffer from the effects of markets. When their revenues fall, NOCs cut governments' dividends and taxes faster than the capital they invest back into the oil  This not only results in governments having fewer funds for public services -- including diversification -- it also allows NOCs to sustain spending longer on new exploration and production. As oil prices fell between 2014 and 2016, for example, NOCs' share of global upstream oil and gas investment increased from 36% to 44% (IEA, 2018), indicating that NOCs' spending cuts were less than those of international oil companies. This suggests that NOCs may sustain production even if private companies turn away from some of their new fossil fuel investments (Adams-Heard et al., 2021; Cahill, 2021; Eschenbacher & Jessop, 2020). This tendency does not bode well for the resilience of NOC-dependent countries under a global  energy transition, where long-term global oil demand and prices fall. In addition to making demand-side policy less effective by dampening market signals, it risks both greater stranding of assets and fewer resources to prepare workers and economies for the transition. Presently, NOCs show the least comprehensive plans to shift to a low-carbon economy compared to other types of companies (World Benchmarking Alliance, 2021). This trend suggests that the barriers outweigh the opportunities for state-owned oil and coal companies to transition away from fossil fuels production (Box , slowing down changes in a sector whose investments and support contribute significantly to the production gap.  Multilateral and bilateral finance International finance plays a significant role in supporting fossil fuel production. We focus here on international public support provided by governments through bilateral export credit agencies (ECAs), development finance institutions (DFIs), and multilateral development banks (MDBs). This finance -- in the form of loans, grants, equity, insurance, and guarantees -- is often provided at preferential below-market rates and has a significant impact on what projects get implemented by leveraging substantial additional commercial investment; international private finance has provided trillions of US dollars to fossil fuels since the adoption of the Paris Agreement (Rainforest Action Network et al., 2021). Public finance institutions (PFIs) also shape the energy landscape by signalling government priorities, providing political cover and pre-investment support (OECD, 2017; Tucker et al., 2020). Scale of finance Governments have committed to making finance flows ""consistent with a pathway towards low GHG emissions and climate-resilient development"" (Paris Agreement, 2015 Art.  Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, however, international PFIs have continued to support fossil fuels significantly, totalling USD 294 billion since 2016. From 2017 to 2019, international public finance for fossil fuels from major MDBs25 and G20 countries averaged USD 62 billion a year, including USD 28 billion for fossil fuel extraction, distribution, and processing (OCI, 2021).  As shown in Figure , international public finance for fossil fuel extraction from major MDBs and G20 countries has decreased significantly since 2017, which may reflect the increasing number of commitments to exclude, or limit, future investments in fossil fuels, referred to here as ""exclusion policies"" and discussed below. However, since some historically significant funders of fossil fuel extraction have not excluded upstream finance, this trend could ultimately be reversed. For coal, international public finance from the G20 countries and major MDBs26 totalled USD 14 billion each year from 2014 through 2017; this dropped to an average of USD 8 billion per year in 2018 and 2019. International coal finance should continue to fall, following the G7 commitment to end ""new direct government support for unabated international thermal coal power generation by the end of 2021"" and China's commitment to not build new coal-fired power plants abroad (G7, 2021; Xi, 2021).27 Oil finance, however, stayed relatively stable over the 2014≠2019 period, and gas finance has continued to grow.   Gas received more international public finance than any other source of energy from 2017 to 2019, averaging USD 16 billion each year (Muttitt et al., 2021). Levels of international public finance may be underestimated, given the lack of transparency in reporting and the increasing levels of public finance flowing through financial intermediaries (Fuchs et al., 2021; Larsen et al., 2018). Preliminary data for 2020 suggest an overall drop in multilateral and bilateral finance for energy across all categories, following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and an outsized drop in finance for oil and gas in particular (OCI, 2021). It remains unclear whether this is representative of future trends, given the growing perception of climate risks by PFIs, or a temporary effect due to the drop in demand during the pandemic (McMonigle et al., 2020). Fossil fuel exclusion policies Meanwhile, a growing number of PFIs have made commitments to limit or exclude fossil fuels from their future investments and align with the Paris Agreement goals (Bhattacharya et al., 2019; Larsen et al., 2018; Finance in Common Summit, 2020; IDFC & MDBs, 2017). At the time of writing, the European Investment Bank is the only MDB to formally exclude all ""unabated"" energy fossil fuel projects  (EIB, 2019, p. 4). Most other institutions with exclusion policies have limited them to fossil fuel production. Major MDBs and DFIs from G20 countries control more than USD  trillion in public assets, and thus have a major influence on public and private investment decisions in the countries they support. MDBs and DFIs representing thirty four percent of these assets have adopted official policies limiting or excluding future financing for coal, oil, and gas production. If we also consider publicly announced policies, this proportion increases to 38% for oil and gas, and 54% for coal (see Figure  However, for some G20 DFIs and MDBs, debates on these policies are still in the early stages, or non-existent (Erzini et al., 2020; Khinmaung-Moore et al., 2020; Muttitt et al., 2021). The majority of the world's ECAs have yet to formally exclude or limit future fossil fuel production investments (Shishlov et al., 2021; Tucker et al., 2020). A full exclusion policy on coal, oil, and gas has only been reported for the UK, which in 2021 excluded all fossil fuel production from its export credit support (UK BEIS, 2021). Other countries, like France and Sweden, are tightening their restrictions on upstream oil and gas (EKN, 2020; French Ministry for the Economy and Finance, 2020), and in 2021,China, the Republic of Korea and the G7 announced they will end financing of overseas coal-fired plants (G7, 2021; Government of Korea, 2021; Xi, 2021). Some legal experts argue that continued financing of fossil fuel production is a breach of international obligations for ECAs (Cook & ViÒuales, 2021). There can also be a perceived disconnect between the stated policies and recent actions of international finance institutions (Ramos et al., 2021). For example, in its most recent annual report, the IMF underscores the need for diversification in economies that depend on fossil fuel exports (IMF, 2020). Yet in some of its country monitoring reports -- known as Article IV consultations -- the IMF appears to promote expanded fossil fuel production, including for Mongolia, South Sudan, and Bolivia (IMF, 2017a, pp. 8, 54, 2017b, 2019). In another example, UK Export Finance -- along with the African Development Bank and ECAs from Italy, Japan, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States -- approved support for a multibillion-dollar gas project in Mozambique, just months before the UK exclusion policy was formally approved (TotalEnergies, 2020).   Conclusions As Chapter 2 shows, global coal, oil, and gas production need to decline steeply if we are to limit global warming to ∞C or 2∞C. In contrast, many countries continue to offer significant support to new and increased fossil fuel production -- and are even increasing this support when it comes to subsidies and pandemic recovery packages. A significant course correction, including profound changes in technology deployment, policy adoption, and financing, is needed if the world is to get on track with an equitable, low-carbon recovery that is consistent with the Paris Agreement goals. In their efforts to ""build back better,"" governments should shift their support away from fossil fuel production and towards preparing for a managed transition that equitably addresses the needs of people and communities. Some governments and international financial institutions have begun to take encouraging steps in this direction. These efforts need to deepen and more must follow.   4 Fossil fuel production and policies in key countries  Key Messages  This chapter provides an overview of the climate ambitions and fossil fuel production plans, views and policies for 15 key producer countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the UAE, the UK, and the US.  These countries have announced various emission reduction targets through their nationally determined contributions (NDC) and, in several cases, have set net-zero goals. Few have assessed, at least publicly, whether their projected fossil fuel production is compatible with limiting global warming to ∞C or well below 2∞C.  Most major oil and gas producers are planning on increasing production out to 2030 or beyond, while several major coal producers are planning on continuing or increasing production.  A few countries are beginning to discuss and enact policies towards a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production. However, these efforts have not yet affected the plans and strategies of major producer countries.   4. Fossil fuel production and policies in key countries This chapter surveys government strategies, support, and plans and projections for fossil fuel production across 15 key countries. As shown in Figure , the first eight countries -- China, the United States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Australia, India, and Canada -- are the largest global producers of fossil fuels in terms of extraction-based COThe remaining seven countries represent other major producers with readily available data (United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico), as well as those with strongly stated climate ambitions (Norway, the United Kingdom, and Germany). Altogether, these 15 countries accounted for 77% of global, extractionbased CO2 emissions in 2019.  Each of the 15 profiles in this chapter includes a summary of the country's stated national climate ambitions; available information on government views, projections, and support for fossil fuel production; and emerging policies and discussions towards a managed and equitable wind-down of production. The profiles draw on national energy plans and outlooks published by government and affiliated institutions; on studies by government, research, and intergovernmental institutions; and on other publicly available information. These countries' plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production underpin the global gap analysis detailed in Chapter 2. We do not provide an assessment on whether each individual country's projected level of fossil fuel production would be consistent with limiting global warming to ∞C or 2∞C. This would require making assumptions and establishing principles for how to equitably distribute the remaining global fossil fuel extraction consistent with these temperature limits, taking into account factors including, but not limited to, countries' relative capacity to transition away from fossil fuel production, relative economic dependence on production, relative costs of production, and historical responsibility in terms of past extraction and benefits accrued (Caney, 2016; McGlade & Ekins, 2015; Muttitt & Kartha, 2020; Pye et al., 2020; SEI et al., 2020). As one starting point for considering how to effectively and equitably align their domestic production with the Paris Agreement's goals, countries could look to global decline rates that would be consistent with these goals. As shown in Chapter 2, annual average decline rates of around 11% for coal, 4% for oil, and 3% for gas between  2020 and 2030 would be consistent with limiting warming to ∞C, based on the mitigation scenarios compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In order to ensure a just and equitable wind-down, countries with greater capacity and lower dependency on fossil fuels will likely need to wind down their production faster than the global average. Meanwhile, countries with limited capacity will need financial, technological, and capacitybuilding support from the international community, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the 2020 Production Gap Report (SEI et al., 2020). Table  provides some metrics that reflect countries' dependence on, and capacity to transition away from, fossil fuel  The countries profiled here have announced various emission reduction targets through their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and, in several cases, have set net-zero goals (See Figure  However, this focus on emissions alone ignores their roles and responsibilities in producing the predominant source of these emissions, fossil fuels. Achieving net-zero emissions globally will require countries to wind down their production of coal, oil, and gas. To date, few producer countries have assessed, at least publicly, whether their projected fossil fuel production is compatible with limiting global warming to ∞C or well below 2∞C. In April 2021, the governments of Canada, Norway, Saudi Arabia, and the US ≠ along with Qatar ≠ announced a ""Net-Zero Producers Forum"" with goals to ""form a cooperative forum that will develop pragmatic net-zero emission strategies, including methane abatement, advancing the circular carbon economy approach, development and deployment of clean-energy and carbon capture and storage technologies, diversification from reliance on hydrocarbon revenues, and other measures in line with each country's national circumstances"" ( Department of Energy,  2021). Further details have not emerged since this initial announcement, and the Forum has not acknowledged or addressed the need to reduce production itself. As this chapter illustrates, several major coal producers are planning on continuing or increasing domestic production, while most major oil and gas producers are promoting, investing in, and planning on expanding production. For the few oil and gas producers projecting long-term decreases, this largely reflects natural resource depletion rather than a managed wind-down. A few countries are now beginning to discuss -- and in some cases to enact policies towards -- a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production, but thus far, these efforts have largely been limited to coal (see , Germany) and have yet to affect the plans and strategies of major producer countries. China  Announced climate ambitions In 2020, President Xi Jinping announced China's updated 2030 NDC targets that ""aim to peak CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060"" (Xi, 2020a, 2020b). As of August 2021, the government had not yet submitted its updated NDC to the UNFCCC. Government views on fossil fuel production President Xi recently stated that China will wind down coal consumption during the 15th Five-Year Plan period, and ""control the total use of fossil fuels and take action to shift to alternative energy sources,"" but did not explicitly address production at these meetings (Xi, 2021a; XinhuaNet, 2021). China's heavy reliance on gas imports is driving the country's recent efforts to develop unconventional gas production (OECD, 2021g), and China's first NDC listed expanding gas production and use as one of its strategies for ""building [a] low-carbon energy system"" (Government of China, 2016). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production As of August 2021, the Chinese government had not yet released sector-specific plans of its 14th Five-Year Plan. China's fossil fuel production is dominated by several large state-owned companies (G20 Peer-review Team, 2016). As shown in Figure , the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)'s 2050 World and China Energy Outlook projects oil and gas production to increase by 5% and 58%, respectively, and coal production to decrease by 8%, between 2020 and 2030 (CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute, 2020). However, a 2025 production target from the China National Coal Association (CNCA) suggests an increase in coal production through 2025 (CNCA, 2021). Government support for fossil fuel production j Provincial governments provided budgetary transfers for coal exploration and extraction totalling CNY  billion (USD 380 million) in 2019, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2021i).  j The central government provided CNY  billion (USD  billion) in budgetary transfers and tax expenditures for oil and gas production in 2019, including per-unit payments to coal-bed methane and shale gas producers (OECD, 2021i). j In 2020, the central government issued a five-year special fund to support ""the clean development and utilization of renewable energy, clean fossil energy, and the clean utilization of fossil energy,"" targeted at unconventional gas and hydropower development (China Ministry of Finance, 2020; quotations translated from Mandarin Chinese). The starting budget for 2020 is CNY 420 million (USD 61 million); to incentivize unconventional gas production, the level of ""reward"" will increase from year to year if production increases (China Ministry of Finance, 2020a). j China does not release official data on its overseas development finance. According to independent estimates, in 2000-2019, the Chinese Development Bank (CDB) and Chinese Export-Import Bank (EXIM) provided a total of at least USD 169 billion in finance to international fossil fuel projects, including USD 70 billion for oil and gas exploration and extraction (Gallagher, 2021). In 2021, China committed to not build new coal-fired power plants abroad (Xi, 2021b). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No specific discourses were identified beyond President Xi's announcement that China will reduce its coal consumption between 2026 and 2030; this has implications for production since over 90% of coal use is domestically produced (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2019). Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production: In his speech at the 2021 Leaders Summit on Climate, President Xi mentioned delivering ""social equity and justice in the course of green transition"" (Xi, 2021a). No other government policies or discourses were identified.  United States  Announced climate ambitions In 2021, President Biden announced a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a new NDC target to reduce GHG emissions by 50%≠52% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels (The White House, 2021b, 2021c). Government views on fossil fuel production The US government has long incentivized the expansion of US oil and gas production, including through support for the research and development of fracking technologies and the withdrawal of a four-decade ban on most crude oil exports (National Research Council, 2001; Rusco, 2020; Vietor, 1984; Wang & Krupnick, 2015; Warner & Shapiro, 2013). The government also has largely taken a permissive approach to fossil fuel development and supporting infrastructure, such as pipelines (Brady & Crannell, 2012; Clark, 1987; Vietor, 1984). A notable exception is the Keystone XL pipeline, which it cancelled because the pipeline ""would undermine  climate leadership"" (The White House, 2021a). The country is now the world's largest producer of oil and gas, and second (in energy terms) in coal (IEA, 2021). In April 2021, the US joined four other countries in establishing the Net-Zero Producers Forum (see chapter introduction). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production Projections from the  Energy Information Administration (EIA) show oil and gas production increasing to 17% and 12% above 2019 levels by 2030, respectively, increases that would largely go to exports (US EIA, 2021). EIA projects that coal production will continue its decline, to 30% below 2019 levels in 2030 (US EIA, 2021). Government support for fossil fuel production j The federal government provides over a dozen subsidies to coal, oil, and gas production (US Government, 2015), such as the immediate depreciation of many capital expenses, worth USD 4 billion in 2019 (OECD, 2021f). j Individual US states provide additional subsidies, including through tax exemptions (OECD, 2021f), and by levying charges for well plugging and abandonment that are much too low to  cover actual clean-up costs (Achakulwisut et al., 2021; Raimi et al., 2021). j The US leases public lands and waters for fossil fuel extraction, often at below-market rates (Rusco, 2019). About 40% of all coal (and less than 20% of all oil and gas) has been extracted from federal lands and waters in recent years (Merrill et al., 2018; US EIA, 2015). j Over time, the US Congress has exempted fossil fuel extraction from numerous federal environmental regulations, such as hazardous waste requirements (Achakulwisut et al., 2021; Brady & Crannell, 2012; Congressional Research Service, 2020; Goldman et al., 2013; Simms, 2017). j The US government also indirectly supports fossil fuel production through long-standing support to fossil fuel consumption, such as by constructing and expanding the extensive highway system (Dilger, 2015). Support for highways was expanded in the infrastructure legislation that passed Congress in August 2021 along with other indirect measures of support for both fossil and non-fossil energy (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 2021). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production The current administration is considering aligning the leasing of federal lands for fossil fuel extraction with climate goals (US DOI, 2021a, 2021c). The State of California, historically one of the top oil-producing states, is evaluating how to phase out oil extraction across the state by 2045 as part of its climate strategy (Erickson et al., 2018; Office of the Governor, 2021). Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production The current administration has created a working group to ""revitalize the economies of coal, oil and gas, and power plant communities"" as part of decarbonizing the economy (The White House, 2021b). The group's initial recommendations have been on funding infrastructure, mine clean-up, and economic development in coal-mining communities (NETL, 2021). Russia  Announced climate ambitions Russia's 2020 updated NDC reiterated its 2015 NDC goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to 30% below 1990 levels by 2030 (Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production In June 2020, Russia approved its new Energy Strategy to 2035 (Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, 2020a). While recognizing shifts in global energy markets, the strategy relies heavily on the production and export of fossil fuels as ""stimulating infrastructure"" for development and diversification of the Russian economy, particularly for gas and coal. Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production Under the Russian Energy Strategy's ""Optimistic"" scenario, gas and coal production increase by 38% and 52%, respectively, from 2018 to 2035, and by 18% and 10%, respectively, under its ""Pessimistic"" scenario, as shown in Figure  (Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, 2020a). In contrast, the strategy projects relatively flat (Optimistic) or declining (Pessimistic) production for oil. Government support for fossil fuel production j Russia is investing heavily in liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure (RUB  trillion, or USD 158 billion, by 2030), with LNG exports expected to account for most of the growth in gas production over the coming decade (Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, 2020a; RBC, 2021). Similarly, Russia is expanding its seaport terminals and other coal export infrastructure, with an eye to increasing coal exports across the Asia-Pacific Region (Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, 2020a). j Tax breaks and budget expenditures for fossil fuel production totalled RUB 713 billion in 2019 (USD  billion), nearly three times the amount in 2015, with the vast majority associated with exemptions or reductions of extraction taxes for oil and gas development (OECD, 2021d). By one prior estimate, not adjusted for  new and removed exemptions, the government could forego RUB  trillion (USD 32 billion) in revenue by 2033, by under-taxing oil extraction (RBC, 2019). j In response to the major drop in oil and gas revenues in 2020, the Russian government removed certain tax breaks for the industry, including repealing prior exemptions of some petroleum fields from mineral extraction tax and export duties (Official Portal of Legal Information, 2020b, 2020a). The government also adopted measures to support fossil fuel producers and other ""systemically important enterprises"", providing for potential state guarantees, deferral and instalment plans for the payment of taxes, and preferential loans (Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation, 2020b). It granted new exemptions from the mineral extraction tax to promote new oil and gas development in the Arctic regions, as well as LNG production and exports. It also launched a program to subsidize the use of Russian oil and gas equipment, allowing advance payments to be reduced by up to 30% (Government of the Russian Federation, 2020). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production Over the past year, the Russian president has issued a federal decree to reduce GHG emissions (President of the Russian Federation, 2020), the government has drafted a law to limit emissions (Government of the Russian Federation, 2021b), and the Bank of Russia has launched a consultation process to consider climate risks and disclosure (Bank of Russia, 2021). However, there are no publicly available indications that Russian authorities and stateowned energy companies have discussed the need to prepare for a managed wind-down in fossil fuels (Grushevenko et al., 2021; Korppoo et al., 2021) Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified.  Saudi Arabia  Announced climate ambitions Saudi Arabia's first NDC, issued in 2015, seeks to reduce emissions by 130 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) by 2030 (no baseline indicated), contingent on ""an increasingly diversified economy and a robust contribution from oil export revenues"" (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2015, p. 1). Government views on fossil fuel production Saudi Aramco, the state-owned enterprise responsible for oil and gas exploration and extraction, holds 17% of the world's proven petroleum reserves. It has indicated its intention to remain the ""last man standing"" among major producers, even under a global transition to low-carbon energy, given that its oil is among the world's cheapest and least GHG-intensive to extract (Blas, 2021; Krane, 2021; McQue, 2021). In April 2021, Saudi Arabia joined four other countries in establishing the Net-Zero Producers Forum (see chapter introduction). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production There are few publicly available government documents that reveal planning assumptions or government intentions for future domestic oil and gas production. A notable exception is Saudi Aramco's bond prospectus, first issued in 2019. As illustrated in Figure , it forecasts that Saudi oil production will increase by 37% from 2020 to 2040 under a scenario where global oil demand levels off by 2035, and by 31% over the same period under a more rapid transition scenario where demand declines by the late 2020s (Saudi Aramco, 2020d). In March 2020, the Saudi Ministry of Energy directed Saudi Aramco to raise maximum production capacity from 12 to 13 million barrels per day, which is expected by 2024 (Kawar, 2021; Saudi Aramco, 2020b). Saudi Aramco also plans to double its natural gas production and export gas for the first time by 2030, with an aim to be one of the world's top three natural gas producers (Saudi Aramco, 2020c). Saudi Arabia has recently approved the world's largest gas development project; the offshore Jafurah shale gas field costs USD 110 billion and will also be used to produce blue hydrogen (with carbon capture and storage) for export (Kimani, 2021; Saudi Aramco, 2020a). Government support for fossil fuel production No information is publicly available on tax expenditures or other measures that support fossil fuel production in Saudi Arabia. Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production While economic diversification lies at the core of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 planning framework (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 2021), no government policies or discourses to prepare and support workers and communities for a just transition away from fossil fuels were identified.  Indonesia  Announced climate ambitions Indonesia's NDC, first issued in 2016 and updated in 2021, sets an unconditional emission reduction target of 29% by 2030, against a business-as-usual scenario, and a reduction target of up to 41% conditional on international support (Republic of Indonesia, 2016, 2021). The state-owned electric monopoly utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), has pledged carbon neutrality by 2050 (Rahman, 2021) . Government views on fossil fuel production The central government has undergone a paradigm shift from viewing oil and gas as export commodities to seeing them as strategic domestic resources (Braithwaite & Gerasimchuk, 2019). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production As shown in Figure , the most recent government outlook provides short-term projections under various scenarios to account for the effects of the pandemic on Indonesia's energy sector (PPIPE & BPPT, 2020). Longer-term projections from the government's 2019 outlook foresee coal production growing at 1% per year, on average, through 2050, with around three-quarters destined for export (PPIPE & BPPT, 2019). In contrast, the long-term strategy (LTS) that Indonesia recently submitted to the UNFCCC projects coal production to peak around 2025 and decline about 1% annually thereafter in its current policy scenario, and 3% per year in its low-carbon scenario (Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021). These latter projections, however, have not yet been integrated into national energy outlooks and thus are not depicted in Figure  According to the government's 2019 outlook, crude oil oil and gas production are projected to decrease by around 5% and 3% per year, respectively, between 2019 and 2040 (PPIPE & BPPT, 2019).  Government support for fossil fuel production j Indonesia provided subsidies for oil and gas production valued at IDR  trillion (USD 320 million) in 2019, according to the OECD (OECD, 2021c). These subsidies include special treatment for import duties and taxes, value-added tax, income tax, capital goods and equipment taxes, and land and building taxes (MEMR & MoF, 2019), as well as other fiscal benefits such as investment credit, domestic market obligation (DMO) holidays, and accelerated depreciation (PPIPE & BPPT, 2019). j The 2020 Job Creation Act provided a royalty exemption to coal producers who expand their businesses into coal derivatives, such as coal gasification as an alternative fuel to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) (Kementerian Sekretariat Negara, 2020). One study estimates the resulting forgone revenue to be USD  billion in royalties and USD  billion in taxes (Peh, 2020). j In 2020, the government created automatic contract extensions for coal mining areas and relaxed environmental regulations related to spatial planning (Harsono, 2020). For example, the Job Creation Act reduced public engagement during the environmental impact assessment process and eliminated the requirement of an environmental license (Kementerian Sekretariat Negara, 2020). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production Indonesia's LTS identifies future policies and interventions that are needed to ensure a just transition of the work force, gender equality, intergenerational equity, and the protection of vulnerable people (Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2021).  Australia  Announced climate ambitions Australia's first and updated NDCs both set the same emission reduction target of 26%≠28% below 2005 levels by 2030 (Government of Australia, 2016, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production The federal government promotes its fossil fuel industry, emphasizing the economic importance of its coal and gas sectors (Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, 2020; Prime Minister of Australia, 2021). As shown in Fig , coal and gas production have grown rapidly since 2010, driven by the major expansion of coal exports and a newly established liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. Australia is now the world's largest coal exporter and the second largest LNG exporter (Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, 2021a; IEA, 2021). The federal government has promoted a ""gas-fired recovery"" from the COVID-19-related economic slowdown, including by providing substantial new public funding to unlock new gas basins, supporting the expansion of the gas transport network, and using various measures to boost gas supply and domestic gas use (Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, 2020b, 2021b; Prime Minister of Australia, 2020). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production As illustrated in Figure , the Australian government projects increases in coal, oil, and gas production of 4%, 32%, and 12%, respectively, from fiscal year 2019 to 2030 (Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, 2020a).  Government support for fossil fuel production j Australia's fiscal regime for oil and gas production allows some operators of major projects to pay little or nothing in royalties or resource rent taxes (Bruce, 2019; Butler, 2021; Campbell, 2020). j Australia exempts fuel used in mining from fuel taxes through the fuel tax credit system, which is also available to other sectors of the economy (Australian Taxation Office, 2017). j The Queensland State government has expedited approval for proposed large coal mine developments in the Galilee basin (Bavas, 2019; Wahlquist, 2019), as well as agreed to defer royalty payments on a concessional basis (Swann, 2018; Thornhill, 2020; Zillman & Horn, 2020). However, market conditions, limited access to financing, and recent Chinese import restrictions have delayed, limited, or stalled these developments (Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, 2021a). j Export Finance Australia provided between AUD  and  billion (USD  to  billion) in finance to fossil fuel projects from mid-2009 to mid-2020, including AUD  billion (USD  billion) to a LNG facility and coal export terminal (Rui & Strachan, 2021). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production Policies and discourses have been limited to transition assistance at the local level, related to coal plant closure in the Latrobe Valley, as well as some early considerations for how to handle future coal plant closures in the Hunter Valley (Green, 2019; Wiseman et al., 2020). India  Announced climate ambitions India's first NDC, issued in 2016, pledged a 33%≠35% reduction in the ""emissions intensity"" of its economy by 2030, compared to 2005 levels (Government of India, 2016). Government views on fossil fuel production Under the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) campaign, the government seeks to ""unleash the power of coal"" and become self-reliant by 2023≠24 (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India, 2020c), and commits to ""augment production through government companies"" (Indian Ministry of Coal, 2021a). The government articulated this as ""a paradigm shift in the approach from being oriented to maximum revenue from coal to making maximum coal available in the market at the earliest"" (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India, 2020b). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production In 2020, several ministries jointly produced a vision and action plan for developing India's resources. The plan outlines measures to expand coal production by nearly 60% from 2019 to 2024 (from 730 to 1,149 million tonnes), including through the removal of barriers to land acquisition and building capacity for exploration (Indian Ministry of Coal, 2021b). India also aims to increase total oil and gas production by over 40% in the same period through measures such as accelerated exploration licensing, faster monetization of discoveries, and gas marketing reforms (Indian Ministry of Coal, 2021b; Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, 2020). Government support for fossil fuel production j India provided tax breaks and budget expenditures for fossil fuel production worth INR  billion (USD 168 million) in 2019, according to the OECD (OECD, 2021b). Another report, considering a wider range of government support measures, estimates that subsidies for coal production totalled INR  billion (USD 249 million) and those for oil and gas production totalled INR   billion (USD 417 million) in 2020 (Garg et al., 2021). Fiscal support for coal production is small in comparison with the fiscal revenue collected from coal. j In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the government provided a 50% rebate on revenue payable to the government for coal extraction projects (Bhaskar, 2021). j As part of structural reforms announced in 2020 amid the Self-Reliant India campaign, the government committed INR 500 billion (USD  billion) for coal extraction infrastructure (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India, 2020a). j In 2020, India opened up its coal mining sector to private and foreign investment, offering financial incentives and organizing large auctions of coal mining blocks. A 2020 auction included mines that would add an estimated 225 million tonnes at peak production, representing around 15% of India's projected coal output for 2025 (Press Information Bureau of the Government of India, 2020d, p. 41). It was opposed by the states of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, with concerns about potential social and environmental impacts (Indian Ministry of Coal, ; Jamwal, 2020). A second auction took place in 2021. j Over the past decade, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has narrowed the public consultation process for coal mine projects (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, 2019; Aggarwal, 2021). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified at the federal level. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified at the federal level.  Canada  Announced climate ambitions Canada released its updated NDC in mid-2021, pledging to reduce emissions 40%≠45% from 2005 levels by 2030 and confirming its 2019 commitment to reach net-zero domestic emissions by 2050 (Government of Canada, 2021; Prime Minister of Canada, 2021). In 2021, Canada also passed climate accountability legislation that enshrines the net-zero target in law (Parliament of Canada, 2021). Government views on fossil fuel production The federal government views fossil fuel exports as critical for Canada's economic growth and prosperity and to funding the transition to a low-carbon economy (McSheffrey, 2017; O'Regan, 2021). In particular, it has emphasized the need to expand export infrastructure, such as pipelines and LNG (Jang, 2019; Rabson, 2020). In April 2021, Canada joined four other countries in establishing the Net-Zero Producers Forum (see chapter introduction). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production In the 2020 Canada's Energy Future report, the government changed its primary scenario from the ""reference"" scenario to a new ""evolving"" scenario, with assumptions of greater global climate action and lower future oil prices (Canada Energy Regulator, 2020a). It projects lower oil and gas production than the report's updated ""reference"" scenario. As shown in Figure , under the evolving scenario, oil and gas production increase by 18% and 17% respectively from 2019 to 2040, as compared with increases of 43% and 38% respectively under the reference scenario (Canada Energy Regulator, 2020a). Government support for fossil fuel production j National and subnational subsidies for fossil fuel production amounted to CAD  billion (USD 1 billion) in 2019, according to the OECD (OECD, 2021a). Other estimates, which include direct transfers made by governments, suggest national and subnational  subsidies are much higher, totalling over CAD  billion (USD  billion) per year pre-pandemic, mostly for production (Corkal & Gass, 2019, 2019; Environmental Defence & IISD, 2019; Equiterre & IISD, 2018; OECD, 2021a; Touchette et al., 2017). j In 2020, as part of its COVID-19 economic response efforts, the Government of Canada allocated CAD 320 million (USD 240 million) for an Oil and Gas Industry Recovery Assistance Fund to support the Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore oil industry. It also allocated CAD  billion (USD  billion) for provincial governments to clean up orphan and inactive oil and gas wells that the private sector has not remediated on their own, and CAD 750 million (USD 560 million) for an Emissions Reduction Fund for oil and gas companies (Department of Finance Canada, 2020; Department of Natural Resources Canada, 2021; Prime Minister of Canada, 2020). j During the 2018≠2020 period, the Governments of Canada and Alberta provided at least CAD 23 billion (USD 17 billion) in public finance to three fossil fuel pipelines (Corkal, 2021). j Since 2016, Export Development Canada (EDC) has provided a yearly average of over CAD 13 billion (USD 10 billion) in public finance for fossil fuels (EDC, 2021a, 2021b). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production In 2018, the Canadian government created a Task Force on Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities. Its 2018 and 2019 budgets allocated CAD 35 million (USD 26 million) for worker transition centres and CAD 150 million (USD 110 million) for economic diversification in affected communities, over five years (Department of Finance Canada, 2019). United Arab Emirates  Announced climate ambitions The UAE announced its second NDC in December 2020, committing to reduce GHG emissions by  below business-as-usual in 2030 (Government of the United Arab Emirates, 2020). The NDC also notes that in 2020, the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) announced a target to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of oil and gas production by 25% by 2030. Government views on fossil fuel production The UAE government views oil and gas, the mainstay of its economy, as key to the country's future socio-economic growth (Government of the United Arab Emirates, 2020), with the stated objective to maximize export revenues from its hydrocarbon sector for the longest time possible (United Arab Emirates Ministry of Energy & Industry, 2019). In parallel, the country has stepped up efforts over the past decade to position itself within the Middle East as a ""green hub"", promoting clean energy and freeing up domestic fossil fuel production for export. Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production The UAE has ambitious plans to ramp up oil and gas production in the near term, reflecting increasing pressure to reconcile longterm profit maximization with global climate action and the risk that oil and gas assets could become stranded in the future (Cahill, 2021; Faucon et al., 2021; Meyer, 2021). ADNOC, which produces nearly all of the country's hydrocarbons, plans to increase the UAE's crude oil production capacity from 4 million barrels per day (Mb/d) in 2020 to 5 Mb/d by 2030, relying on enhanced oil  recovery (EOR) in existing oil fields, as well as output from around 22 billion barrels of unconventional reserves newly confirmed in 2020 (Kerr, 2020). To support this aim, the UAE government has pledged USD 122 billion in capital expenditure for its national oil company between 2020 and 2025 (Kerr, 2020). With the intent of ensuring self-sufficiency and becoming a net exporter once again, the country has also announced plans to invest aggressively in gas production, including significant unconventional gas resources (ADNOC, 2018a, 2018b). ADNOC plans to add 3 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day of new gas production this decade, an increase of 50% over current production levels (6 Bcf/day). Government support for fossil fuel production No information is publicly available on tax expenditures or other measures to support fossil fuel production in the UAE. Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified, though UAE has invested in workforce training for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and other low-carbon technologies. South Africa  Announced climate ambitions South Africa released a draft of its enhanced NDC in March 2021, proposing to limit the country's annual emissions to 398≠440 MtCO2e by 2030 (Government of South Africa, 2021a); the country's 2017 emissions were around 513 MtCO2e/yr (Government of South Africa, 2021b). In its long-term, low-emissions development strategy (LT-LEDS), South Africa mentioned that it will ""ultimately mov[e] towards a goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050"" (Government of South Africa, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production Coal mining has been central to the industrialization of South Africa (Burton et al., 2018). Coal currently accounts for around 77% of South Africa's primary energy mix and is historically viewed as key to the country's economy (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2021), though this view is increasingly contested (The Presidency of the Republic of South Africa, 2021). Coal production has historically had relatively secure demand from users such as Eskom, South Africa's state-owned electricity utility, and from the country's large coal-to-liquids industry (Burton et al., 2018). Eskom recently ""committed in principle to net zero emission[s] by 2050"" (Ramaphosa, 2021). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production To date, the government has not published national projections or targets for coal production. South Africa's 2019 Integrated Resource Plan sets a target for reducing coal's contribution to installed power sector capacity -- from 72% in 2018 to 45% in 2030 -- but does not address production (Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, 2019). Government support for fossil fuel production j The coal sector has historically received significant direct and indirect support via regulatory measures, state-owned enterprises, and subsidies to large users such as Eskom and Sasol (a minority state-owned, coal-to-chemicals producer) (Bridle et al.,  2020; Burton et al., 2018). While indirect support remains substantial, direct subsidies for coal mining are now smaller than in the past (Bridle et al., 2020; Burton et al., 2018; OECD, 2021l). In 2019, the government still provided direct budgetary transfers worth an estimated ZAR 760 million (USD 53 million) to projects that supply water to power stations and to coal mines (OECD, 2021l). j South Africa's state-owned development finance institutions, the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC), support coal production through their investment holdings (Halim & Omar, 2020). For example, the IDC holds shares in the New Largo proposed coal mine project, which is intended to supply Eskom's under-construction plant, Kusile (Seriti, 2019). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No policies or discourses to actively phase out coal production were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production South Africa's first NDC mentioned the broad concept of a just transition (Government of South Africa, 2015). Its draft updated NDC elaborates on this issue, noting that the country ""will need to put measures in place that plan for... diversifying coal dependent regional economies, and developing labour and social plans as and when ageing coal-fired power plants and associated coal production infrastructure are decommissioned"" (Government of South Africa, 2021, p. 4). Many high-level political discourses are actively taking place on the importance of, and how to implement, a just transition to a low-carbon, resilient, and inclusive economy and society, including for the coal mining and power sector (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2018; GreenCape, 2021; Joubert, 2019; The Presidency of the Republic of South Africa, 2020, 2021; TIPS, 2020).  Brazil  Announced climate ambitions In its updated NDC, released in 2020, the Brazilian government maintained its earlier targets of reducing GHG emissions by 37% and 43% from 2005 levels by 2025 and 2030, respectively, and stated that it is considering a long-term goal of achieving climate neutrality in 2060 (Government of Brazil, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production With the oil and gas sector making up an estimated 13% of Brazil's GDP, the government views oil exports as critical for economic development, which has resulted in many regulatory changes since 2017 to ""encourage new investments"" and expand production (ANP, 2018a). In the face of global decarbonization efforts and potential near-term peak oil demand, the Brazilian government intends to boost domestic production in the coming years to maximize the ""monetization"" of its domestic oil and gas reserves (ANP, 2019; Mariano et al., in press). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production The National Energy Plan 2050, approved by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in 2020, shows that the Brazilian government intends to attract investments and ramp up oil and gas production to ""become one of the five largest producers in the world"" (MinistÈrio de Minas e Energia, 2020c). As shown in Figure , the Plan foresees production of oil and gas increasing by 60% and 110%, respectively, between 2020 and 2030. Government support for fossil fuel production j The country's tax expenditures and direct budgetary transfers to incentivize oil and gas production were around BRL 10 billion (USD  billion) in 2019, according to the OECD (OECD, 2021h). The overwhelming majority (99%) of this value comes from one tax break: Repetro, a tax exemption for equipment used in the research and mining of oil and gas. Originally created in 1999, it  was set to expire in 2020 but was renewed until 2040 (Delgado & Cals, 2017; Pedra, 2020; PPI, 2017). j The Revitalization of Onshore Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Activities (""REATE"") program, first launched in 2017 and updated in 2020, aims to double onshore oil and gas production over the next 10 years (MinistÈrio de Minas e Energia, 2020a). j In 2018, the government approved a reduction in the royalty rate from 10% to 5% or less on the incremental production from mature fields, to be applied from 2020 onwards, designed to promote exploration, development, and production (ANP, 2017, 2018b). j In 2019, Brazil introduced a new ""Open Acreage"" program that consists of a continuous offer of exploration blocks (ANP, 2018a, 2021a), designed to attract new private investments, expand exploration and production, and increase government revenues from the hydrocarbon sector (Mariano et al., in press). j The Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) has historically provided extensive support to its domestic oil and gas industry; between 2008 and 2013, it provided loans worth a total of BRL 46 billion (USD 24 billion) (Oliveira, 2015). These loans, including to Petrobras (a state-controlled oil company), have enabled the ramp-up of oil production in Brazil's new frontier basins over the last five years (Barbosa, 2013; MinistÈrio de Minas e Energia, 2019). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified.  Norway  Announced climate ambitions In its updated NDC, Norway increased its emission reduction targets to 50%≠55% by 2030, and 90%≠95% by 2050, compared to 1990 levels (Government of Norway, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production With oil and gas making up about half of the total value of Norway's exported goods, the government views oil and gas as ""the most important export commodities in the Norwegian economy"" (Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, 2021a). The government recently stated that it will ""facilitate profitable production of oil and gas in a long-term perspective within the framework of Norway's climate policy,"" which includes intentions to ""continue to pursue its exploration policy with regular concession rounds to ensure that new areas for exploration are made available to the industry"" (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021a, 2021d). So far in 2021, the government has issued 61 production licenses and offered 84 new blocks for exploration on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021b, 2021c). In April 2021, Norway joined four other countries in establishing the Net-Zero Producers Forum (see chapter introduction). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production Due to recent large discoveries, oil production is set to increase for the next few years, before an expected longer-term decline, as shown in Figure  The government recently argued that its forecasted oil and gas production is compatible with the Paris Agreement's ∞C limit, as the projected decline (65% from 2020 to 2050) is broadly in line with the median declines in oil and gas consumption in the IPCC ∞C scenarios (Sanner & Bru, 2021). However, the declines reflect the expected resource depletion rates rather than a planned transition (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021a), and Norway's projected production out to 2030 ""have consistently been adjusted upwards"" (Norwegian Ministry of Finance, 2021a, p. 85; translated from Norwegian).  Government support for fossil fuel production j Norway's oil tax scheme for oil is characterized as ""investment friendly"" by the government. The estimated amount of forgone government revenue in 2020 is NOK 16 billion (USD  billion), due to a system for accelerated depreciation and high uplift and interest deductions (Norwegian Ministry of Finance, 2020). j The government covers significant investments in exploration and field development. For example, exploration costs are fully deductible, with cash refunds available for companies that are in a negative tax position (Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, 2021b). The government also provides funds for geological surveys and for research and development activities. This amounted to NOK 660 million (USD 75 million) in 2019 (OECD, 2021k). j In response to the oil price fall in 2020, the government passed several interim tax measures, including deferred taxation on new projects. The total value of these tax breaks is estimated to be around NOK 8 billion (USD 850 million). (Norwegian Ministry of Finance, 2021c). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production There is increasing awareness that international climate policy may pose economic risks to Norway's oil and gas production (Bang & Lahn, 2019). To date, the most direct response measure has been the divestment of Norway's USD 1 trillion sovereign wealth fund from coal and certain upstream oil and gas companies (Norwegian Ministry of Finance, 2019; Norwegian Parliament, 2015). The government will also require oil and gas companies to disclose climate risk in development plans for new projects (Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, 2021a, p. 161). Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No specific government policies were identified beyond Norway's general system of workers' rights, including financial and retraining assistance.  Mexico  Announced climate ambitions Mexico's updated NDC, submitted in 2020, maintained the same targets as its 2015 NDC -- a 22% (unconditional) and 36% (conditional) reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 relative to business-as-usual -- while it increased the business-as-usual value for 2030 from 973 MtCO2e to 991 MtCO2e (Government of Mexico, 2015, 2020). Government views on fossil fuel production Pemex, a state-owned enterprise, accounts for 97% of Mexico's oil and gas production (Sistema de InformaciÛn de Hidrocaburos, 2021). In March 2021, Pemex published its Business Plan for 2021≠2025, signalling its intent to boost oil and gas production and reverse the significant decline of the past 15 years (PEMEX, 2021). This is in line with the current government's priorities of ""energy sovereignty"" and increased oil production as a lever for national development (Government of Mexico, 2019a, 2019b). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production The Ministry of Energy's most recent annual outlooks on oil and gas production, last updated in 2018, provide production projections under a ""maximum"" and ""minimum"" scenario (SecretarÌa de EnergÌa SENER, 2018b, 2018a). As shown in Figure , under the maximum scenario, oil and gas production would increase by 66% and 89%, respectively, from 2018 to 2032. Under the low scenario, oil production would decline by 3% and gas production would increase by 25% over the same period.  Government support for fossil fuel production j Mexico provides tax allowances and relief for oil and gas production, which totalled MXN 31 billion (USD  billion) in 2019 (OECD, 2020). Most of this is attributed to an increase in the tax deduction cap from  to 40% of the value of onshore production (35% for offshore) (Diario Oficial de la FederaciÛn, 2019a) j In 2019, the Mexican Congress reduced Pemex's minimum mandated dividend to the federal government for oil and gas extraction activities, from 65% to 58% in 2020 and to 54% in 2021 and onwards (Diario Oficial de la FederaciÛn, 2019b). Pemex has estimated that this reduction will grant savings of up to MXN 45 billion (USD  billion) in 2020 and MXN 83 billion (USD  billion) in 2021, which would be used to boost hydrocarbon extraction (PEMEX, 2019). j In response to the drop in global oil prices at the beginning of 2020, the Mexican government provided a tax credit for oil producers for the 2020 fiscal year of up to MXN 65 billion (USD 3 billion), to account for lost profits (Diario Oficial de la FederaciÛn, 2020). In early 2021, the tax credit was extended for the 2021 fiscal year, though at a lower rate, with a maximum credit set at MXN 73 billion (USD  billion) (Diario Oficial de la FederaciÛn, 2021). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production No such government policies or discourses were identified. United Kingdom  Announced climate ambitions In its latest NDC, the UK pledged to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, with a further announcement in 2021 of 78% reductions by 2035 (UK Government, 2020a, 2021b). In 2019, the country set a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (UK Government, 2019). Government views on fossil fuel production Oil and gas policy is governed by a statutory duty to ""maximise economic recovery"" (UK Parliament, 2015, Section 41), and the government has indicated its aim to ""extract every drop of oil and gas that it is economic to extract"" (UK Parliament, 2017). Climate change concerns have featured prominently in deliberations around the local approval of a new coal mine in the north of England; the national government launched an inquiry to consider whether to uphold the approval given its climate change impact (Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government, 2021). Plans and projections for domestic production After peaking at the turn of the century, UK oil and gas production dropped steeply until 2014. In response to a government-commissioned report on maximizing oil and gas recovery (Wood, 2014), the UK government instituted regulatory changes and tax cuts to spur production, and production grew steadily from 2014 to 2019. According to the UK's Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), these changes are expected to lead to 30% more oil and gas production from 2016 to 2050 than would have otherwise occurred (OGA, 2018). While the OGA projects oil production to decline by 58% for oil and by 70% for gas from 2021 to 2040 (OGA, 2021a), as shown in Figure , its 2035 Vision, described in OGA's 2019 Corporate Plan, is for production to exceed these and prior projections (OGA, 2019, p. 7). Government support for production j In 2019, the UK provided tax allowances and relief for oil and gas production totalling GBP  billion (USD  billion) (OECD, 2021e).  j Between 2020 and 2065, the UK will provide an estimated GBP  billion (USD  billion) in tax relief to oil companies for the costs of decommissioning offshore infrastructure (OGA, 2021b). As of December 2020, the UK government had signed 98 Decommissioning Relief Deeds with oil companies, providing companies with certainty on the level of tax relief they will receive on future decommissioning (UK Treasury, 2021, p. 380). j In 2020, UK Export Finance approved GBP 300 million (USD 420 million) in loans and GBP 850 million (USD  billion) in guarantees to a major LNG project in Mozambique, a decision that is under judicial review (Friends of the Earth, 2021). Five months later, in 2021, the UK ended all new bilateral public finance for fossil fuel production overseas, the first G20 government to do so (UK Government, 2020b). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of production In March 2021, the UK Government announced a North Sea Transition Deal with its offshore oil and gas industry that will not stop national fossil fuel exploration or production (BEIS & OGA UK, 2021; Brooks, 2021). The government announced that a new climate compatibility test will be conducted before future exploration and production licensing rounds, to ensure licenses awarded are ""aligned with wider climate objectives, including net-zero emissions by 2050"" (UK Government, 2021a). Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition The North Sea Transition Deal will invest in skills and job training oriented around CCS and hydrogen, complementing continued oil and gas production and with no plans for a wind-down in production. The Scottish Government has appointed a Just Transition Commission (Just Transition Commission, 2021).  Germany  Announced climate ambitions In May 2021, the German parliament enhanced the ambitions of the Climate Change Act -- the country's first major climate law that entered into force in 2019 -- with a goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2045 instead of 2050, and by increasing the 2030 target for GHG emission cuts from at least 55% to at least 65%, relative to 1990 levels (BMU, 2021). Government views on fossil fuel production Germany phased out hard coal production in 2018, but remains the world's largest producer of lignite, the most carbon-intensive type of coal (IEA, 2021). In 2020, the German parliament finalized the Coal Phase-out Act, with an end date of 2038 at the latest for both hard coal and lignite power generation (BMWi, 2019). This has implications for lignite mining since 100% of supply is currently domestically consumed (IEA, 2021). Plans and projections for domestic fossil fuel production Figure  shows the estimated declines of Germany's fossil fuel production out to 2030, as modelled in the 2019 Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) (BMWi, 2019, pp. 176≠177). Coal and gas production are projected to decrease by around 50%, and oil by 24%, between 2020 and 2030. This figure does not yet reflect the more ambitious climate goals recently adopted by Germany and by the EU's 2030 Climate Target Plan (European Commission, 2021a). The NECP is expected to be revised in 2024. Government support for fossil fuel production j National and subnational subsidies for lignite production amounted to EUR 309 million (USD 346 million) in 2019, according to the OECD. This includes exemptions from mining royalties and water fees for existing production (22% of the total subsidy amount), as well as financing for lignite mine rehabilitation in East Germany (78%) (LMBV, 2017; OECD, 2021j). j Germany's development bank, KfW, is Europe's top national development finance institution for international oil and gas financing, providing a total of USD  billion in 2015≠2018 (Erzini  et al., 2020). It supports conventional oil and gas and unconventional gas investments, and actively promotes gas imports as being a ""bridging technology on the path to climate neutrality"" (Pflume & Rˆmer, 2021; translated from German). In 2019, KfW excluded financing for new projects related to the exploration and extraction of coal and unconventional oil (KfW, 2019). j In 2019, Germany's export credit agency provided EUR  billion (USD  billion) of support for international fossil fuel projects (Euler Hermes Aktiengesellschaft, 2021). Although there is a lack of transparency on which and what types of projects were supported, the agency's latest policies exclude new coal plants and oil production with routine flaring (Investitionsgarantien, 2021). Policies and discourses towards a managed wind-down of fossil fuel production Germany's 2019 NECP considered the implications of the country's and the EU's climate goals on domestic fossil fuel production out to 2030 (BMWi, 2019, pp. 176≠177). The Coal Phase-out Act further commits power generation from coal to be phased out by 2038 at the latest, but does not explicitly mention production (BMWi, 2019). Policies and discourses supporting a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels Germany passed the Structural Development Act alongside the Coal Phase-out Act to provide up to EUR 40 billion (USD 46 billion) between now and 2038 for directly affected coal-mining areas (Government of Germany, 2020). This includes close-down premiums for hard-coal-fired power plant operators and direct compensation payments totalling EUR  billion (USD 5 billion) for lignite-fired power plant operators. These contracts remain a subject of conflict, with the European Commission currently investigating whether compensation for forgone profits has been kept to the minimum necessary, as required by EU state aid rules (European Commission, 2021b; Heilmann & Popp, 2020).  5 The critical role of transparency in addressing the production gap  Key Messages  Verifiable and comparable information on fossil fuel production and support -- from both governments and companies -- is essential to addressing the production gap.  Existing transparency initiatives shed some light on fossil fuel production and its implications for meeting climate goals, but available information is incomplete, often inconsistent and scattered across various, mostly voluntary, government-driven and non-governmental efforts.  Governments should strengthen transparency by disclosing their fossil fuel production plans and projections, and how these align with climate goals. They should do this in their published national climate and energy plans, including in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and their long-term, low-emission development strategies under the Paris Agreement.  Governments should require that both private- and state-owned fossil fuel companies disclose their spending, project plans, emissions, and climate-related financial risks, and do so in a consistent manner across countries.   5. The critical role of transparency in addressing the production gap The public disclosure of verifiable and comparable information by governments and corporations is key to addressing the fossil fuel production gap. Such information can reveal the extent to which governments are supporting fossil fuel production, and provide insights into how countries can wind down production in light of the Paris Agreement's goals.  Transparency strengthens climate and energy policymaking in several ways. It helps policymakers better understand the scope of a problem, clarifying the social, economic, and environmental consequences at stake. Openness and disclosure can also encourage more inclusive and participatory decision-making. Moreover, transparency can help hold governments, companies, and other actors accountable, driving them to modify their behaviour by facilitating market pressure, public shaming, or litigation. When countries seek to simultaneously expand fossil fuel production and achieve greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets, transparency can highlight the inconsistencies in these domestic policies, and draw attention to the risk of stranded assets and communities. Transparency further matters for international climate cooperation. It can reveal whether collective climate goals are being met, help identify which actors are making progress, which ones are lagging, and which ones require support, and facilitate learning between countries (Gupta & Mason, 2014; Hale, 2008). Moreover, countries tend to be more willing to increase policy ambition when their performance is verified by other countries (Bell et al., 2012; Chayes & Chayes, 1998; Victor, 2011). In the context of the production gap, transparency entails reporting production levels, plans, and support, in addition to the emissions-focused information covered by the international climate regime under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This chapter highlights transparency initiatives and information gaps relevant to fossil fuel production (Section , and discusses how governments, companies, and other actors can strengthen transparency around fossil fuel production (Section   Existing transparency initiatives and information gaps Transparency is central to many international initiatives related to fossil fuels. International organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) emerged with the  specific aim of improving information sharing and collective action among fossil fuel consumer countries (Van de Graaf, 2015). The growing number of transparency and data collection efforts (summarized in online Appendix C) have diverse rationales and objectives for improving fossil fuel transparency, including: reducing fossil fuel price volatility through more accessible production data ( the Joint Organisations Data Initiative, or JODI); removing fossil fuel market distortions (such as through data collection on fossil fuel subsidies by various international organizations); and improving extractive industry governance ( the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, or EITI). These transnational initiatives have not, historically, focused on climate change. More recently, however, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector have launched initiatives that can help to better understand the impacts of fossil fuel production on the climate. This has included the development of frameworks to assess climate-related financial risks through the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), understand fossil fuel industry emissions through the Climate Change Reporting Framework of the Inter-   national Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA), and monitor infrastructure development through trackers such as those developed by the non-profit Global Energy Monitor. Governments are slowly beginning to take up various transparency initiatives related to fossil fuels and climate. For instance, G20 and other governments have begun to report their fossil fuel subsidies, while the EITI board (which includes government representatives) has resolved to advance work on the transparency of climate and energy transitions (Bradley, 2020; Clark, 2020). Existing transparency initiatives already capture a lot of information relevant for assessing and addressing the production gap (see online Appendix C). However, this data is spread across an array of initiatives and is often not standardized or comparable; it also only exists for a portion of fossil fuel producers (for example, the EITI does not include several major fossil fuel producers among its implementing countries). Moreover, these initiatives are largely voluntary, making it challenging to assess progress on aligning fossil fuel production with climate goals, and to identify transition needs. To better understand the extent of the production gap, improved transparency about fossil fuel production is urgently needed, including the disclosure of information on:  j National plans and policies for fossil fuel production, including: production data; licensing of fossil fuel resource exploration or extraction; plans and policies for future production, including underlying economic and technological assumptions; production levels implied by climate targets; GHG emissions embedded in fossil fuel exports; plans for decommissioning existing fossil fuel infrastructure; and assessments of whether production plans are equitable in the context of global climate objectives. j Government support for production, including: fossil fuel production subsidies; domestic and international public finance for fossil fuel infrastructure; and other non-fiscal measures to promote or expedite production ( fast-track approvals and regulatory exemptions). j Fossil fuel companies' plans and strategies, including: information on the economic viability of fossil fuel reserves under different price conditions; details on investment and production plans and strategies, including underlying assumptions; end-use emissions from the coal, oil, and gas produced; and exposure to climate-related financial risk. In addition, further information is necessary to enable a well-managed and equitable transition away from fossil fuel production, including on: laws and policies to manage   future fossil fuel production; estimates of the revenues that may be needed to replace lost fossil fuel rents and royalties; and data on the scale of the economic transition at national and subnational levels, including specific data on workforce transition needs. Information is also needed on the costs and liabilities associated with decommissioning fossil fuel production sites, and on the benefits of the transition (such as cost savings and public health benefits).  Strengthening transparency If governments strengthened transparency around their fossil fuel production, they would facilitate the assessment of whether and how production plans align with climate goals. Moreover, such transparency can benefit a country's own citizens (see Box  In this section, we outline how governments can boost transparency by: 1) publicly releasing plans and policies for fossil fuel production, 2) reporting financial and non-financial support to production, and 3) mandating the disclosure of fossil fuel companies' plans and strategies, to assess their (mis)alignment with climate goals (see Figure  Transparency of national plans and policies for fossil fuel production At present, only a handful of small producer countries have spelled out a strategy for aligning domestic fossil fuel production with international climate goals in their national climate and energy plans (Jones et al., 2021). There is a need for governments to provide clearer information in these plans about current and future fossil fuel production, and how they will manage the energy transition away from fossil fuels. Ideally, comprehensive climate and energy plans would include: details on historical and planned fossil fuel production; clear targets and timelines for bringing production in line with agreed climate goals; descriptions of planned or enacted policies to wind down fossil fuel production; measures introduced to support a just transition and economic diversification; and information on international cooperation to wind down fossil fuel production. Governments have already committed to reporting climate-related information as part of the Paris Agreement, and thus could include information on fossil fuel production through the same reporting process (see Box  Governments could further strengthen transparency through initiatives outside of the UNFCCC process. For instance, the EITI could be used as a mechanism for governments to disclose intended production plans, along with the assumptions underlying these plans; this would provide citizens with a better understanding of the relative   levels of risks governments are incurring. Requirement  of the EITI Standard already encourages governments to disclose information about assumptions related to projected fossil fuel production and commodity prices; extractive sector revenue forecasts; and the proportion of future fiscal revenues expected to come from fossil fuels (EITI, 2019). The multi-stakeholder nature of the EITI also makes the initiative a possible forum for discussing plans for a just transition away from fossil fuel production. Another option -- which would provide a more targeted focus on fossil fuels and climate change -- would be for governments to jointly create an independently managed registry, through which they can report and review information on fossil fuel production plans and policies (Byrnes, 2020). There is also a need for transparent information on fossil fuel projects and infrastructure. NGOs have begun to track the development of fossil fuel production infrastructure, which is relatively easy to monitor and verify (Green & Kuch, 2021). However, more and better information from governments would boost transparency. The need for public information about new or expanded fossil fuel production infrastructure is especially acute. Such transparency would mean governments publishing information on each new project, including: the project proponents; expected and permitted annual production volumes; the expected and permitted project lifetimes; GHG emissions, including end-use emissions from the fossil fuels  produced; the total amount of capital invested; and the assumptions about future resource prices, carbon prices, and other variables on which the investment was made. Since governments also need to wind down existing fossil fuel production to meet climate goals, transparency on existing production sites and infrastructure would likewise be important, including: the expected or scheduled winddown rate and closure date; the emissions implications of the infrastructure's remaining operational life; and the estimated costs and assignment of liabilities associated with closure and site decommissioning (Eisen et al., 2021). International standardization of all such information could pave the way to a global registry of fossil fuel production sites and infrastructure, building on NGO-driven initiatives (Byrnes, 2020). Transparency of government support for fossil fuel production Governments also can strengthen transparency around their financial support for fossil fuel production, which they provide through government finance ministries, national development banks, export credit agencies (ECAs), and other public finance institutions. Very few of these institutions publicly report project-level information. ECAs, for example, do not provide comprehensive and fully comparable data for fossil fuel projects, nor are there universal definitions of sectors and financial support metrics (Shishlov et al., 2020). Multilateral development banks (MDBs), by contrast, are more transparent, with many providing project-level information and a joint commitment in recent years to report on how bank activities help countries meet and exceed their climate goals (E3G, 2020; MDBs, 2019). It can be difficult to obtain a full picture of public finance investments in fossil fuel projects, due to data gaps and limited accessibility of ECA and MDB data. For example, researchers were unable to include any ECA transactions for Argentina, Saudi Arabia, or Turkey for 2016≠2018 in a recent study on the G20 governments' financing for fossil fuels (Tucker et al., 2020). Moreover, neither ECAs nor MDBs provide reliably accessible information about their funding of fossil fuel production through financial intermediaries, despite intermediaries channelling a large and increasing portion of development finance (E3G, 2020; Tucker et al., 2020). The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank Group's private-sector lending arm, has started to address this by asking financial intermediary clients to voluntarily disclose high-risk sub-projects, and in March 2020 the Bank itself committed to disclosing certain categories of sub-projects. However, the IFC has not yet done that consistently across projects and years when reporting to the Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (E3G, 2020). Moreover, voluntary disclosure -- while enabling the rapid diffusion of reporting frameworks -- nevertheless risks pre-empting regulatory requirements that would be stricter. It is therefore vital for public finance institutions to publicly share the total amounts of finance by fossil fuel, production stage, and type of financing mechanism. Ideally, they would use their annual reports to disclose project-level data, as well as activities that receive financing through the main bank and their financial intermediaries. This reporting could draw on existing frameworks, such as the EU's sustainable finance taxonomy (European Commission, 2020) or the OECD format for reporting development finance (OECD, 2021a). Governments also must provide greater transparency on fiscal support and other subsidies to fossil fuel production. Several efforts to strengthen transparency are already underway. Members of the OECD and several other countries report tax expenditures and budgetary transfers in support of fossil fuel production, as summarized in Chapter 3 (OECD, 2021b). However, as the country profiles in Chapter 4 show, some countries do not report this at all (such as Saudi Arabia and UAE), while other countries do not report all forms of support. The information collected by the OECD on subsidies, along with that gathered by the IEA and the International Monetary Fund, is collated through the Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker to provide a global picture of subsidies directed towards fossil fuels (Coady et al., 2019; Fossil Fuel Subsidy Tracker, 2021; IEA, 2021). A small number of countries have further chosen to submit their fossil fuel subsidies to a voluntary peer review by other countries, in the context of commitments made under the G20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) (Verkuijl & van Asselt, 2020). World Trade Organization (WTO) members are required to report (""notify"") subsidies that meet the definition of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and are specific to certain enterprises. However, notification rates on subsidies have generally been low, and the WTO's surveillance mechanism rarely leads to questioning (Casier et al., 2014; Collins-Williams & Wolfe, 2010). Governments can also report fossil fuel production subsidies on a voluntary basis under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target  Despite these efforts, transparency on fossil fuel production subsidies remains problematic in many countries (Skovgaard & van Asselt, 2018). Governments can therefore strengthen the effectiveness of these transparency arrangements by: providing comprehensive information   on fossil fuel production subsidies through the voluntary reports submitted under SDG 12, following the methodology created by UNEP et al. (2019); strengthening their notifications to the WTO, and using the WTO's Trade Policy Review Mechanism to draw attention to their own or other Members' production subsidies; and undergoing a voluntary self- or peer-review of their fossil fuel subsidies (van Asselt & Moerenhout, 2020). Transparency of fossil fuel companies Notwithstanding some positive steps forward, fossil fuel companies -- including publicly traded companies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) -- still exhibit major gaps in their transparency around their investment and production plans and, more generally, their climate-related financial risks. Governments can play a key role in improving and enhancing the transparency of fossil fuel companies. Fossil fuel companies have faced calls for transparency from civil society and investor groups, such as Climate Action 100+. More recently, calls for mandatory disclosure and reporting have come from market regulators, including governments and international organizations. The EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive, for example, has sought to shed light on whether the business practices of fossil fuel companies are sustainable. Furthermore, G20 central banks (through the TCFD) have pointed to individual company transparency as a starting point in  addressing the potential economic impact of unabated climate change and an abrupt and disorderly transition away from fossil fuels. This has led to calls to incorporate the TCFD standards into national corporate reporting regimes, including by the G7 (G7, 2021b), as well as a call for the establishment of a new ""International Sustainability Standards Board"" that would develop baseline rules for climate-related reporting (G7, 2021a). A closer look at current disclosures by companies, as well as civil society recommendations to regulatory bodies such as the  Securities and Exchange Commission, reveals fruitful areas for regulators to explore (SEC, 2021). Regulators could insist that fossil fuel companies disclose the emissions associated with the end-use of their products. They could also provide greater clarity on what constitutes a fossil fuel reserve, which is subject to a range of subjective assumptions and uncertainties, yet forms a critical part of oil and gas companies' financial reporting (Green & Kuch, 2021). Some regulators, such as the SEC, already define ""proven reserves"", whereas other jurisdictions allow firms to rely on industry classification systems. Overall, regulators must ensure that climate constraints are considered in evaluating potential reserves, which are supposed to represent geologically and economically producible resources. Regulatory standards for evaluating reserves would generate comparable information regarding climate-related financial risk. It is unlikely that voluntary initiatives can achieve the same level of disclosure, given the low historic levels of company participation and compliance in voluntary mechanisms such as the EITI. Regulators should require the disclosure of forward-looking assumptions around, for example, future commodity prices, the useful lives of fossil fuel infrastructure, and the expected costs of complying with decommissioning obligations, since in many cases these items underpin the asset valuations presented in financial statements. Considering the role SOEs play in fossil fuel markets, it is critical for these companies, their governments, and international initiatives to strengthen transparency standards on SOE spending, production projections, GHG emissions, and exposure to climate-related financial risk. National oil companies (NOCs) produce more than half the world's oil and gas, and invest around 40% of the total capital in the sector (Manley & Heller, 2021). They can be major players in the economies of their home countries; in at least 25 countries, NOCs collect revenues equivalent to more than 20% of all government revenues (Heller & Mihalyi, 2019). Most NOCs report little about their operations and finances to the public. Of the 52 NOCs assessed in the 2017 Resource Governance Index from the Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI), 62% had ""weak"", ""poor"", or ""failing"" transparency (NRGI, 2017). Some have improved recently: Colombia's Ecopetrol and Malaysia's Petronas now release detailed information, while Saudi Aramco and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation have begun  publishing financial reports. In addition, the EITI and the OECD's Working Party on State Ownership and Privatization Practices have strengthened standards for SOE reporting (EITI, 2019; OECD, 2019). Still, major gaps remain, including in reporting on how NOCs plan to navigate the energy transition. As of June 2021, more than half of the 71 NOCs in NRGI's National Oil Company Database had not published their total capital expenditure for 2019, including major players such as the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), Iraq's Basra Oil Company, and PetrÛleos de Venezuela,  (PDVSA) (NRGI, 2021). Without this information, it is difficult to understand the drivers of the production gap and what is needed to close it, or how their spending exposes the public to climate-related financial risk. Even NOCs that do report their aggregate investments tend to disclose few details on projects or infrastructure spending, on the carbon intensity of production, or on the price required to avoid stranded assets. State-owned coal enterprises are also far from transparent. With few exceptions, the largest coal SOEs report little about their plans or expenditures, or about the impact of climate change on their viability (OECD, 2020).  Conclusions Improved transparency plays an essential role in both assessing and closing the fossil fuel production gap. It can provide governmental and non-governmental stakeholders with the needed information to support improved decision-making on fossil fuel production, infrastructure development, investment, and policies, thereby strengthening the accountability of governments' actions in light of climate goals. Moreover, transparency can facilitate international cooperation by building trust and promoting compliance with international commitments. Various government-driven and non-governmental initiatives have begun to shed light on fossil fuel production and its impacts on climate goals. However, the available information is spotty and incomplete: many producer countries and companies have yet to participate, key types of information are not reported, the data are scattered across various initiatives, and initiatives are largely voluntary or driven by civil society. The lack of available and consistent information makes it difficult to properly assess the production gap and the extent to which governments are driving this gap, as well as identify opportunities for governments to close it. Governments and other actors can work together to boost transparency, including by: j disclosing plans and projections for fossil fuel production and for a just transition in NDCs, LT-LEDS, and UNFCCC national reports. j providing information on fossil fuel infrastructure at various stages of development. j divulging information on public finance for fossil fuels by production stage and financing mechanism. j mandating that investor-owned and state-owned fossil fuel companies disclose their spending, project plans, GHG emissions (including end-use emissions), and climate-related financial risks. j ensuring that the decision-making processes both for fossil fuel infrastructure and for winding down production are open and transparent, and that civil society has adequate capacity to engage. j ensuring that relevant information on fossil fuel production is not only available, but also understandable, usable, and timely. Governments can strengthen existing transparency initiatives, or create new ones. On the international stage, countries can make better use of existing mechanisms; for instance, they can convey information on fossil fuel  production through the UNFCCC, and improve subsidy reporting under the WTO and the SDGs. Multi-stakeholder initiatives such as the EITI can use their long-standing experience in the sector to strengthen transparency on the climate impacts of fossil fuel production, including by proposing uniform standards for information disclosure. New transparency initiatives may be warranted, however. Specifically, governments should consider establishing a dedicated platform for reporting and reviewing information on fossil fuel production, which would bring the dispersed information together in a harmonized and standardized manner, building on advances made by civil society organizations.   6 Closing the fossil fuel production gap  Key Messages  Governments have a primary role to play in closing the production gap and ensuring the transition away from fossil fuels is just and equitable.  Few countries have acknowledged the need to wind down fossil fuel production. Doing so can provide the impetus for governments to develop plans and implement policies that align their production with climate goals and commitments.  Governments can restrict fossil fuel exploration and extraction, phase out producer subsidies and public finance for fossil fuel projects, and re-direct support towards decarbonization and just transition efforts.  International cooperation can support a more effective and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.   6. Closing the fossil fuel production gap Over 75% of global GHG emissions stem from fossil fuels (SEI et al., 2019). Meeting the agreed objectives of the Paris Agreement -- and achieving net-zero emissions by mid-century -- thus requires dramatic and sustained reductions in fossil fuel use and extraction. Existing national energy plans and outlooks, however, take the world in the opposite direction.  It has been six years since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. The continued presence of a wide production gap underscores the urgency with which countries must align their fossil fuel production plans with global climate goals and commitments. Thus far, most countries have focused their climate policies on reducing the demand for coal, oil, and gas, with their actions on the supply side of fossil fuels largely restricted to promoting carbon capture and storage and addressing emissions from extraction, processing, and distribution processes. Governments can do much more, as they have a primary role to play in closing the production gap and in ensuring that the transition away from fossil fuels is just and equitable. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) control more than 50% of global fossil fuel production (see Chapter 3). While privately-owned fossil fuel companies also have important roles to play, and can take important steps to increase their alignment with climate objectives (Coffin, 2021; World Benchmarking Alliance, 2021), governments wield great influence: they drive private-sector exploration and extraction through their policies, permitting, and investments. The extent of COVID-19 recovery spending on fossil fuel energy since the start of the pandemic demonstrates how entrenched these industries remain. Only a handful of countries clearly acknowledge the need to wind down fossil fuel production to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. None are top producers. Such an acknowledgement is important: it can provide the impetus for developing plans for a managed wind-down of production and for implementing specific policy measures. Two policy areas for governments to pursue are: j Placing restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and extraction to avoid locking in levels of fossil fuel supply that are inconsistent with climate goals. Examples of relevant policies include moratoria, bans, or limits on all or certain types of fossil fuel exploration and extraction (such as offshore or unconventional drilling) or infrastructure (such as oil pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals). Countries with higher financial and institutional capacity should lead the way with these  restrictions, as they are better equipped for a rapid and sustained decline (Muttitt & Kartha, 2020; SEI et al., 2020). j Phasing out government support and financing for fossil fuel production. As detailed in Chapter 3, governments continue to support domestic coal, oil, and gas production through fossil fuel subsidies, regulatory exemptions, aid to SOEs, and public funds, including those committed through COVID-19 recovery packages. In addition, support for overseas fossil fuel production provided through bilateral export credit agencies (ECAs), development finance institutions (DFIs), and multilateral development banks (MDBs) play a significant role in shaping the international energy landscape. Therefore, a key step towards closing the production gap is for governments to phase out their production support policies, ramp up the exclusion of fossil fuel projects from public finance institutions, and re-direct support towards decarbonization and just transition efforts. Table  and Appendix A provide examples of governments and international financing institutions that have adopted these types of policies.    It is also critical that governments ensure the wind-down of fossil fuel production is just and equitable, minimizing economic and social disruption for workers, enterprises, communities, and other stakeholders. In recent years, the concept of a ""just transition"" to a low-carbon society has gained significant traction, driven by ethical as well as strategic imperatives (Atteridge & Strambo, 2020; ILO, 2019; ITUC, 2017; Jenkins et al., 2020; UNFCCC, 2016). Indeed, a just and equitable transition is pivotal to reaching the level of consensus and social acceptability that is needed for the deep changes required to limit global warming to ∞C or well below 2∞C (Green & Gambhir, 2019; Jakob et al., 2020; Robins, 2020; Winkler & Klinsky, 2018). Increasingly, governments have made commitments to a just transition. The Paris Agreement formally recognized the imperative of a just transition (Paris Agreement, 2015 Preamble, , over 50 heads of state signed the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration in 2018, and 46 countries have committed to place jobs at the heart of ambitious climate action (UNFCCC, 2018). Numerous countries have put in place national commissions, task forces, dialogues, and other policies. For example, in 2020, Germany approved the Structural Development Act, which provides financial support of up to EUR 40 billion (USD 46 billion) to mitigate the social and economic repercussions of the Coal Phase-out Act (Government of Germany, 2020). Also in 2020, South Africa established a Presidential Climate Change Coordinating Commission to advise the government on how to ensure a just and fair transition for communities and workers reliant on the coal sector (Lo, 2021; The Presidency of the Republic of South  Africa, 2020). These and other examples are described in more detail in Appendix A. Still, as the country profiles in Chapter 4 show, most major producing countries have not yet implemented strategies for workers, businesses, and communities to transition away from dependence on fossil fuel production. Given the pace of decline needed to meet climate goals, governments will need to act more swiftly and comprehensively to adopt and accelerate transition planning processes. They will need to dedicate greater resources to economic diversification and worker re-training. These steps increase the chances of a successful transition and can help to avoid leaving behind fossil-fuel-dependent workers, communities, and businesses; this includes the highly vulnerable informal sector, which is the source of many fossil fuel production jobs, especially for coal, but has yet to receive much attention in just transition efforts (see Box  Such strategies will also need to address the needs of communities that have borne the negative socioeconomic and health impacts of production (Healy et al., 2019; Hern·ndez, 2015; O'Rourke & Connolly, 2003). Finally, international cooperation can support a more effective and equitable transition away from fossil fuels. Through international processes such as the UNFCCC, governments can enhance transparency and ambition by communicating plans to align their fossil fuel production and climate goals, including through their NDCs and longterm low emissions development strategies under the Paris Agreement (see Chapter 5). Additionally, countries can also engage in other forms of cooperation, such as multilateral clubs and treaties, to coordinate the winding down   of fossil fuel production (Green, 2018; Newell & Simms, 2019). Some countries, such as Costa Rica and Denmark, have begun paving the way for more ambitious, coordinated action by jointly announcing commitments to phase out fossil fuel production (J¯rgensen & Murillo, 2020). Through international cooperation, countries can also seek to ensure that declines in fossil fuel production are distributed as equitably as possible, while minimizing the risks of disruption and maximizing the participation of affected stakeholders (Achakulwisut & Erickson, 2021; Green & Denniss, 2018). International cooperation can also direct support to countries that face the most risk in a transition, due to their limited financial and institutional capacity and high dependence on fossil fuel production (SEI et al., 2020). International financial institutions also have a key role to play: they can restrict financing for fossil fuel projects and direct it to just transition measures (SEI et al., 2020). As shown in Chapter 3, an increasing number of MDBs and bilateral DFIs are enacting or considering policies to limit or exclude financing for fossil fuel production. Countries can accelerate this process for multilateral institutions, and expand it to include export credit agencies and other vehicles for public finance.  As the impacts of climate change become even clearer and starker, citizens will be looking to their governments to put the world on a net-zero emissions trajectory as rapidly as possible. To do so, governments will need to reckon with the production gap, and in short order, take the steps needed to close it.  Box  A just and equitable transition for the informal economy  Just transition efforts to date have focused heavily on the needs of those in the formal economy, who are employed with regular hours and wages in positions subject to tax and legal requirements. However, many fossil-fuel-production-related activities take place in the informal economy. This is especially true in some coal-dependent regions of the global South. In India, for example, nearly 360,000 people work in formal coal mining operations (Bhushan et al., 2020), while over 15 million depend on coal for income (Chandra, 2019), many by gathering coal manually and selling it at local markets (Lahiri-Dutt, 2014). Informal coal mining for subsistence use and smallscale commerce is also common in South Africa, and informal employment plays a key role in the main coal-producing regions of Colombia (Burton et al., 2018; DANE, 2021). The informal workforce is generally poorer, with lower life expectancies, fewer years of schooling, and greater socio-economic challenges than the formal  workforce. Consequently, it has less capacity to adapt to the types of economic and social changes that a rapid transition away from fossil fuels would bring (Bhushan et al., 2020). Therefore, where the informal sector is a significant part of the economy, just transition efforts should place a particular focus on it, providing skills, mobility, and alternative livelihood opportunities -- for example, in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries or in mine closure and rehabilitation -- with pathways to join the formal economy. Engagement, through social dialogue with representatives of the informal sector, particularly the Indigenous communities and women who often make up a significant part of the informal economy, is critical to ensure that their needs are met (NSO, 2020). Addressing energy poverty and providing households with access to modern energy services, as well as providing other social and physical infrastructure, is another key step in building community resilience for the transition.    "
UNEP-2021-7.txt,"CHEMICALS, WASTES AND CLIMATE CHANGE
INTERLINKAGES AND POTENTIAL FOR COORDINATED ACTION

Climate change and management of hazardous chemicals and wastes are two of the many challenges facing policy and decision makers committed to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A number of global agreements have been established to address these issues. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change seeks to both stabilize greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere and adapt to the eventual inevitable impacts of climate change. Falling within the scope of this study, hazardous chemicals related agreements include the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and the Minamata Convention on Mercury. Finally, the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal focuses specifically on waste-related issues.
A number of interlinkages exist between climate change, hazardous chemicals and wastes are identified, including that:
· Climate change can lead to increased releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment; · Chemicals production, chemicals containing products and product usage can give rise to both
hazardous chemicals and GHGs; · The waste sector is a potential source of GHGs and hazardous chemicals; · There can be both synergies and sometimes trade-offs, between mitigation measures for releases
of GHGs and hazardous chemicals; and · Opportunities exist for aligning inventories of GHGs and hazardous chemicals.
In this report, an exploration of the technical aspects of these interlinkages is presented based on existing literature, towards ultimately supporting the identification of opportunities for taking action on both climate change and hazardous chemicals and waste, in a cost-effective, integrated manner.
The impacts of climate change are already being observed, including increased temperature, changes to precipitation, shifts in ocean currents, melting of ice, rising sea levels and increased severity and frequency of sea level events, thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and ice sheets, increase in weather conditions conducive to fires and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The extent to which changes to these observed impacts will occur over time will vary significantly between regions, and will depend on the extent to which future growth in GHG emissions can be constrained.
These climate change impacts are linked to increased primary releases of hazardous chemicals, being those associated with the intentional use of chemicals including pesticides and chemicals in many industrial applications. In terms of pesticide usage, it is highlighted that pests, diseases, and vectors for both crop and livestock diseases are likely to be altered by climate change. Although changes in usage will vary depending on local context, with increases in some situations and decreases in others, in general there is a greater likelihood of higher incidences of pest and disease outbreaks and associated pesticide usage. In terms of other chemical usage applications, a key driver of primary releases is that temperature increases can result in increases in the volatility of chemicals, thereby driving increased releases during usage and from stockpiles.
Secondary releases of hazardous chemicals, from environmental reservoirs such as soil and glaciers, will also increase due to climate change impacts. Increased concentrations of some POPs are already being observed at one of the Arctic monitoring stations, which has been attributed to warming in the Arctic and retreating of sea ice and melting of glaciers, although these are an exception in the region, and modelling results differ on the potential future links between climate change and releases of POPs from Arctic and Alpine glaciers. Projections also suggest that mercury emissions to the atmosphere from permafrost regions are likely to grow as a result of climate change. Under a high GHG emissions scenario, mercury emissions from permafrost alone could reach a peak of 1.9±1.1 Gg Hg year-1 in 2200, which is similar to current global atmospheric emissions.
In addition to increased primary and secondary releases of hazardous chemicals to soil, water and the atmosphere, climate change has implications for their long-range transport, including through changes in atmospheric circulation, ocean currents and circulation, precipitation, extreme weather events and migration of animals. Climate change will also affect how chemicals impact on various animal species and humans, with evidence thereof already being observed.
Finally, the impacts of climate change are considered from the perspective of physical infrastructure and operations. In the waste sector, disruption of operations and mobilization of hazardous chemicals from waste and wastewater facilities can occur. Mine sites, tailing dams and other infrastructure can be disrupted, leading to hazardous chemicals releases.
· Mitigating GHG emissions and hence future global climate change is a high priority not only for reducing the impacts of climate change on the planet, but also because of the benefit of avoiding increased movement and impacts of hazardous chemicals. The interlinkages between the two issues presented in this report thus provide additional support to the case for mobilizing resources to combat climate change.
· Waste and wastewater management infrastructure and operations, mine waste sites, and industrial facilities need to be designed to be resilient to future climate impacts to prevent hazardous chemicals releases. Historical sites need to be evaluated to determine remediation requirements and retrofitting of infrastructure to make them resilient to climate change. Waste minimization should be pursued wherever possible, with waste disposal being the last and least preferred option.
· Planning for hazardous chemicals management needs to take into account current and future impacts of climate change, to minimize the potential risks. Accounting for climate change in managing industrial/disaster risks also requires consideration of transboundary impacts thereof, and hence opportunities for international cooperation.
The chemicals sector is a significant contributor to global GHG emissions, and has strong links to the fossil fuels sector. Releases of GHGs and hazardous chemicals occurring at all stages in the chemicals' life cycle, including production of input materials, primary and secondary production processes, use and disposal. Potential releases of hazardous chemicals and GHGs from the use phase of products can occur include application of pesticides, and during usage of high value chemicals in refrigeration and air-conditioning, fire suppression and explosion protection, foam blowing, and other applications. Chemicals are used in production of manufactured articles. For example, flame retardants in a variety of products and articles such as mattresses and textiles used in furnishings, aircraft, vehicles, construction of houses, agriculture and others have been shown to volatilise during the use phase, with releases increasing as a function of temperature.
· Circular economy and life cycle approaches to design of systems, process and product design have the potential to simultaneously reduce potential for GHG and hazardous chemical releases (as well as other negative environmental externalities) associated with provisioning of goods and services to meet societal needs.
· Mining and minerals processing operations, which provide raw material inputs for many chemical production processes as well as renewable energy and energy storage infrastructure, need to apply Best Available Technology/Best Environmental Practices (BAT/BEP) to ensure energy efficiency and minimization of releases of hazardous chemicals. Renewable energy rather than fossil energy should be adopted where feasible in the mining sector to reduce GHG and hazardous chemicals releases, or fuel switching from coal to gas should be evaluated where renewables are not feasible, recognizing that gas is a transition fuel which is not compatible with a net zero GHG emissions world.
· Primary chemicals production and downstream industries also need to apply BAT/BEP, towards reducing energy inputs, avoiding releases of unintentional hazardous chemicals and GHG emissions and minimizing waste generation Where available, process and product changes to reduce production-related releases should be implemented. As with mining and minerals processing, renewable energy and fuel switching can result in further benefits.
· Reductions in primary releases of hazardous chemicals in the use phase can be achieved by researching, developing and adopting alternatives to hazardous pesticides and other agricultural practices such as implementing integrated pest management; by implementing ""Design-for-Environment"" principles for manufactured products and by using low hazard, low Global Warming Potential chemicals in applications such as flame retardants, foam blowing and electronics.
· Policy and management approaches that focus on the plastics issue are often focused on the plastic litter problem. Awareness is, however, growing about the negative impacts of plastics across their entire life cycles, including GHG and hazard considerations. Plastics policy and management approaches should also be expanded to take circular economy and life cycle considerations into account.
The application of Life Cycle Thinking is demonstrated using the case of plastics, given the growing importance of this environmental issue, and its relevance to the different conventions covered by this study. Impacts of plastic waste on the oceans is a headline environmental issue, with increasing recognition of plastics' impacts on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and even on human health. The impact of plastics on climate change has been less recognised, although recent studies have served to highlight the importance of looking at the climate impact of plastics over their life cycle, especially when taken in the context of the projected growth of the sector. Different plastics waste streams are highlighted to have different potentials for both releases of GHGs and contaminants. End of life management of plastics contributes around 10% to the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, or 161 MtCO2e of emissions in 2015, from incineration, recycling and landfill, with potential negative impacts on land, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems if not managed properly. Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment products contain lead, mercury and other metals, flame retardants and certain phthalates, that may be released during end of life management, with some of these chemicals having high Global Warming Potentials. A total of 53.6 Mt, or an equivalent of 7.3 kilogram per capita, of e-waste is estimated to have been generated annually in 2019, up from 44.4 Mt in 2014, a figure that is expected to grow in the future. Hazardous materials from renewable energy installations need to also be managed properly, to avoid end of life products from entering the waste stream. Household wastes also have potential for releases of both hazardous chemicals and greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the options used in their management. Finally, management of hazardous health care wastes represent a major challenge in many parts of the world, if facilities are not available for proper disposal thereof.
· Reducing demand for materials and circular economy approaches can help reduce waste generation across the economy.
· BAT/BEP, Basel Convention Technical Guidelines and environmentally sound management guidelines should be applied as appropriate to identify, design and implement appropriate technologies for management of different waste streams, towards limiting releases of both GHGs and hazardous chemicals. What is deemed appropriate and feasible will vary between locations.
GHGs and hazardous chemicals, including unintentionally produced POPs and heavy metals, can be released from the same sources. Mitigation options or integrated policy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may have positive benefits for reducing emissions of hazardous chemicals, and vice versa. However, the opposite also holds true: certain GHG mitigation technologies can give rise to an increase in hazardous chemicals production and/or release, thus resulting in a trade-off between GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation. Some examples of mitigation synergies and trade-offs include:
· Across all sectors and applications, adoption of BAT/BEP technologies and approaches, and improving technologies and approaches over time, will help to minimize releases of both hazardous chemicals and GHGs, and ultimately move towards being consistent with pathways aligned with net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
· Coal is a substantial contributor to both GHGs and mercury emissions, as well as to releases of other hazardous chemicals. Where feasible, reducing coal usage through a transition to low carbon energy in the energy sector and to alternative industrial feedstocks will thus contribute substantially to reducing GHGs, mercury and other hazardous chemical releases, with associated benefits for air quality and public health.
· Shifting from other fossil fuels apart from coal to renewable energy will also contribute positively to reducing GHG and hazardous chemical releases.
· Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) can result in significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from both the energy and industrial sectors, and is considered to have an important role to play in meeting global emission reduction targets, particularly in hard to decarbonize sectors. CCUS can, however, have a significant energy penalty and hence lead to increased impacts associated with energy supply to meet additional energy requirements. This should be taken into account when evaluating these technologies.
· Chemical process efficiencies and shifts to alternative feedstocks and alternative products can reduce both GHGs and hazardous chemicals. These should be sought out and implemented as soon as possible.
· The cement sector is a significant emitter of both GHGs and hazardous chemicals, with a number of opportunities for mitigation that are being pursued to varying extents around the world, that should be supported. However, use of waste as fuel can result in increased hazardous chemicals releases if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed.
· Production of metals from recycled material has significantly lower GHG emissions that from primary processes and should be implemented where feasible. These processes can, however, release hazardous chemicals if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed.
· Replacing mercury lights with light emitting diodes (LEDs) reduces electricity demand, and reduces demand for mercury and end-of-life management impacts of mercury containing lamps. Phasing out of mercury lamps is thus desirable. However, LEDs do potentially contain other heavy metals, including nickel, lead and arsenic, and so should also be properly managed at end-of-life.
· Biomass represents a low carbon energy source, although combustion of biomass can release hazardous chemicals if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed. Furthermore, production and use of biomass for bioenergy can have benefits and negative impacts linked to land degradation, food insecurity, livelihoods and other environmental and sustainable development goals, with the impacts being dependent on a range of context-specific considerations.
· Addressing artisanal and small-scale gold mining will reduce mercury exposure for mine workers as well as emissions to the environment, while simultaneously addressing GHGs associated with land clearing that typically accompanies these activities.
The final consideration relates to the potential synergies in compilation of emissions inventories. Inventory guidelines are available for compilation of inventories of GHGs, POPs, mercury and other pollutants, with a number of commonalities being observed, particularly with respect to activity data requirements. Exploitation of these commonalities can allow for efficiencies in data collection, streamline Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) of inventories and potentially reduce uncertainty and misalignment.
· Collection of data should be coordinated by establishing appropriate national and regional data management systems for common data. This will contribute to reducing data uncertainty, personnel and other resource requirements and costs, and areas of misalignment.
· Similarly, systems and processes for QA/QC can be coordinated between the different inventories, thereby reducing resources required for compilation.
Although a wide a range of information is available in the open literature on specific topics or regions, insufficient information is available to provide a full quantitative and coherent assessment of all the interlinkages between climate change and hazardous chemicals use and releases.
· There is a need for generation of further relevant information and data on the links between climate change and hazardous chemicals to be gathered through targeted studies in areas less comprehensively addressed in the open literature. Examples of such areas include groundwater, freshwater systems, pesticide usage projections and desertification. A comprehensive needs assessment is required to identify specific R&D target areas.
In conclusion, the report presents a comprehensive technical review of the literature on report on climate change and hazardous chemicals management, towards identifying a set of opportunities for simultaneously addressing these two critical elements of the broader sustainability challenge. It is hoped that the information presented will guide the development and implementation of cost-effective strategies, institutional capacity, enforcement mechanisms and other components of an enabling environment to address these issues at the global, regional, national and local levels, thereby supporting the concurrent implementation of the multitude of treaties that are already in place.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 STUDY CONTEXT
The earth's climate is changing as a result of increased levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and short-lived climate forcers in the atmosphere from anthropogenic or human-based activities. These activities include energy supply, industrial processes, waste management and land related activities (Fiedler et al., 2012; IPCC, 2013b, 2018b).
Emissions of GHGs have continued to rise at an average of 1.5% per year in the last decade (UNEP, 2019a). Global emissions, including from land-use change, were a record high of 55.3 GtCO2e in 2018. Fossil CO2 emissions from energy use and industry dominate, making up 68% of global emissions in 2018. Emissions from these sources reached a record 37.5 GtCO2 that year, growing 1.5% per year in the last decade and 2.0% in 2018 alone, with the growth largely being driven by energy use. Emissions of methane (CH4), the next most important GHG, grew at 1.3 per cent per year in the last decade. Methane is a short-lived climate forcer and also affects local air quality. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions grew at 1.0% per year in the last decade. Finally, fluorinated gases (SF6, HFCs, PFCs) are the fastest growing GHGs, at 4.6% per year in the last decade (UNEP, 2019a).
Projections of intensity and frequency of climate change impacts vary significantly between regions, and between longer-term scenarios of the extent to which these GHG emissions are likely to grow in the future. Projections are comprehensively documented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), through Assessment Reports published at regular intervals (IPCC, 2013a, 2014b)1, and through special reports including the Special Reports on Global Warming of 1.5° C (IPCC, 2018b), Climate Change and Land (IPCC, 2019b) and the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019c). There is no indication that global GHG emissions will peak in the next few years, with delays in peaking leading to a need for faster and deeper cuts in the future to limit global warming and its impacts. The United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP's) most recent Emissions Gap Report suggests that emissions would need to be 25% lower by 2030 compared to 2018 levels to realize a least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to below 2°C. To move towards a 1.5° C pathway, 2030 emissions would need to be 55% lower than 2018 levels (UNEP, 2019a). While global emissions continue to grow, there are a number of developed countries where declines in carbon dioxide emissions have been observed as a result of renewables displacing fossil fuels (Le Quéré et al., 2019), while the 2020 global pandemic lockdowns resulted in large-scale temporary reductions in emissions (Le Quéré et al., 2020).
The production and release of a range of hazardous organic and inorganic chemicals and wastes drive further global environmental change and pose threats to natural environments and animal and human life. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are chemicals of concern due to their potential for long-range transport, persistence in the environment, bio-magnification and bio-accumulation in living organisms, and negative effects on animal and human health and the environment. POPs enter the environment as agricultural chemicals (pesticides), industrial chemicals and through unintentional generation. POP pesticide production and use has declined in many parts of the world, due to legislative interventions and the introduction of safer alternatives. Production of industrial chemicals including perfluorinated chemicals and flame retardants for a range of applications has, however, grown. In 2017, global consumption of flame retardants, many of which are classed as hazardous, amounted to more than 2.25 million tonnes per year. Growth in demand for hazardous flame retardants could, however, slow in the future due to targeted legislation (UNEP, 2019b). Sources of unintentionally generated POPs, such as dioxins, furans, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), include power generation, combustion of fuels in other stationary and mobile applications, metallurgical processes and burning of wastes.
Decreasing concentrations of POPs measured in air and in humans have been observed globally, indicating the effectiveness of intervention measures to reduce and ultimately eliminate environmental releases (UNEP, 2017). However, levels of dioxin-like compounds, PCB and in certain cases DDT, observed in human breast milk are above World Health Organization (WHO) safety standards, indicating that further remedial actions are necessary in all regions of the world (UNEP, 2013a). Releases and impacts of POPs have been widely studied, such as within the active ongoing programme in the Arctic regions being operated under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP), and under the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP).
1 The most recent Assessment Report at the time of writing was the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)

CHAPTER 1 Introduction

Heavy metals are a further class of hazardous chemicals of concern due to impacts on animal and human

health and the environment. Human activity has resulted in atmospheric mercury levels being 450% higher

than natural levels, with emissions of mercury in the environment rising by 20% between 2010 and alone. Stationary combustion of fossil fuels and biomass is responsible for about 24% of global mercury

emissions, with coal burning being the primary contributor (21%). Under current policy scenarios, mercury

deposition fluxes will grow in Asia but drop in North America and Europe by 2035. However, additional

policies could go a long way to reducing future mercury fluxes across the world (UNEP, 2019c).

1.2 GLOBAL RESPONSES

In response to the challenges of climate change and hazardous chemicals, a number of international agreements have been implemented. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) entered into force in 1994 to ""stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"". Parties to this Convention also make commitments to adapting to the eventual inevitable impacts of climate change. The UNFCCC has led to the establishment of the Paris Agreement the first universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, through which Parties agreed to various commitments, including to collectively limit ""the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2° C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5° C above pre-industrial levels"" through peaking global emissions as soon as possible and rapidly reducing emissions thereafter. There are also provisions in the Agreement related to adaptation, transparency, loss and damage, and provision of support to developing countries.
A number of global agreements have been established towards management of hazardous chemicals and wastes. This document focuses on four of the international treaties, which share the common aim of protecting human health and the environment from hazardous chemicals and wastes:
· The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal2;
· The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade3;
· The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants4; and · The Minamata Convention on Mercury5.
Various other agreements that have related objectives to the above four treaties6. Collecting and providing easy access to information related to releases of pollutants are covered by the Kyiv Protocol on pollutant release and transfer registers (PRTRs), covering GHGs, POPs, mercury, as well as transfers of waste. On the regional level, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution promotes an integrated approach to environmental policymaking, striving to reduce key air pollutants, including those that are climate-relevant. The UNECE Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents supports countries in the prevention of, preparedness for and response to industrial accidents, including those accidents caused by natural disasters. The Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM)7, hosted by UNEP, is a policy framework to promote global chemical safety. The Bamako Convention focuses on imports into and control of transboundary movement and management of hazardous wastes within Africa, with the Waigani Convention serving a similar function in the Pacific region. The International Labour Organization (ILO) have developed a number of legally binding instruments in the form of ILO Conventions that directly address chemicals and waste in the world of work as well as their impact on the environment, including the ILO Chemicals Convention, 1990 (No.170) and the Prevention of Major Industrial Accidents Convention, 1993 (No. 174)8.

1.3 INTERLINKAGES BETWEEN THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS AND WASTE

The projected impacts of climate change are directly linked to hazardous chemicals and waste management. Table 1 provides an overview of the major impacts as a result of climate change in different regions (IPCC, 2014c), that have potential links with and hazardous chemicals and waste management. In addition to the links that arise as a result of these impacts, sound management of chemicals and wastes is intrinsically linked to the climate agenda in that there is the potential to work in a cost-effective, integrated manner to address both chemicals and wastes and climate mitigation, towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals as set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction


This report presents a comprehensive technical review of the interlinkages between climate change, hazardous chemicals and waste. It is based on information available in the open literature, and thus topics on which published literature is limited will not be addressed. Examples of such areas where climate change and hazardous chemicals interlinkages are not well explored include groundwater, desertification and freshwater systems. As identified previously, the report focuses on the UNFCCC and four of the chemicals' treaties, being the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and Minamata Conventions, towards identifying areas where there are overlaps, thereby supporting concurrent implementation of the treaties. A schematic representation of the interlinkages between the four chemicals treaties covered by this report is shown in Figure 1. It is noted that, although not covered in the study, many other treaties also have links to climate change. Notable here is the Vienna Convention and associate Montreal Convention on Ozone Depleting Substances, which is already well understood in terms of its links with climate change9.
FIGURE 1: COVERAGE OF THE FOUR CHEMICALS TREATIES CONSIDERED IN THIS STUDY

The report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the context in which this document has been prepared, and the purpose thereof. Chapter 2 explores the impacts of climate change on releases and transport of hazardous chemicals. In Chapter 3, the relationships between hazardous chemicals production and use and climate change are discussed. Chapter 4 explores synergies and trade-offs between GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation options, while Chapter 5 presents the links between environmentally sound management of waste and climate change. In Chapter 6, an overview of opportunities for aligning emissions accounting for GHGs and hazardous chemicals is presented. Finally, Chapter 7 presents a summary and set of conclusions which will serve to guide policy and decision makers in streamlining action on these issues.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE RELEASE, FATE AND TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS
2 IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE RELEASE, FATE AND TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS
Climate change has the potential to change both the release patterns of hazardous chemicals and their environmental fate, and their transport through the environment. Furthermore, impacts on various classes of infrastructure and operations will occur. Each of these topics is explored separately in the following sub-sections.
2.1 RELEASES AND FATE OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS
Both primary and secondary releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment can be impacted by climate change. Primary releases include direct dispersion on soils and into air (for example, through the application of pesticides), volatilization into air during use of chemical products (semi-volatile technical chemicals), and leaching into water (through use of water soluble technical chemicals) (see Figure 3.1 in UNEP/ AMAP (2011) for a graphical representation of long range transport mechanisms of hazardous chemicals). Secondary releases on the other hand refer to volatilization and mobilization from environmental reservoirs of hazardous substances such as snow and ice.
Primary releases of chemicals are linked to the impacts of climate change in the following ways: · Pests, diseases, and vectors for both crop and livestock diseases are likely to be altered by climate change. Specific changes will vary depending on local context, with increases in some locations and decreases in others. In general, however, there is a greater likelihood of higher incidences of pest and disease outbreaks, as increased distribution, growth and reproduction of pests is observed at higher temperatures and wetter conditions, and efficacy of pesticides decreases with increased temperature. These factors could lead to changes to the types, timing and frequency of pesticide application, with concurrent negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Boxall et al., 2009; UNEP/AMAP, 2011; IPBES, 2019). One study in China highlighted that pesticide usage as a result of both increased temperature and precipitation could rise by 1.1 to 2.5% by 2040 and 2.4 to 9.1% by 2070, despite current efforts to reduce pesticide usage (Zhang et al., 2018). Robust strategies are thus required for pest and disease mitigation to avoid excessive growth in pesticide use (Kattwinkel et al., 2011; Wang, Sun and Yao, 2016a; IPCC, 2019b; Matzrafi, 2019; Mbow et al., 2019). · DDT is the only POP pesticide that is still produced and applied in appreciable amounts, for the purposes of malaria control. Some studies suggest climate change could lead to an increased spread of malaria and other vector-borne diseases (see for example (Hundessa et al., 2018; Karypidou et al., 2020)), although there is still disagreement as to how extensive such spread will be. In the event, however, that they are observed, larger areas may need malaria control than at present, which could lead to enhanced demand for DDT and, consequently, may lead to higher emissions of and exposure to this chemical (Bouwman, van den Berg and Kylin, 2011). · The rate of volatilization of chemicals is directly linked to temperature, with a temperature increase of 1° C potentially resulting in a 10% to 15% increase in the volatility of typical semi-volatile POPs, such as PCBs (Lamon, Von Waldow, et al., 2009; UNEP/AMAP, 2011; Gouin et al., 2013). Temperature increases as a result of climate change will thus result in increased emissions of POPs used in open applications, such as PCBs used as plasticizers in paints and joint sealants, and PBDEs used as flame retardants. · Increased mobilization and volatilization of chemicals from materials storage and stockpiles will occur as temperatures rise. These effects will be most relevant in the case of chemicals with relatively low direct emissions during manufacturing and chemicals which are not readily incorporated into materials. For example, it is estimated that 240,000 tonnes of obsolete pesticides are stockpiled in Eastern Europe alone, and that between 4 and 7 million tonnes of HCH isomers, generated as a byproduct of Lindane manufacture, have been stockpiled globally since the 1950s. -HCH is volatile and so has potential to increasingly be released into air as temperatures increase, while -HCH is more water soluble. Abandoned stockpiles of compounds containing heavy metals, which may include mercury, are also found in parts of the world. The volatilization of mercury also increases with increasing temperature (Vijgen et al., 2011, 2018; Gouin et al., 2013; Wöhrnschimmel, 2013).
Of the above impacts, it is noted that the effect of temperature on emissions of semi-volatile POPs is considered to be the most important factor linking climate change and the environmental cycling of POPs (UNEP/AMAP, 2011).



Links between secondary releases and climate change include:

· Melting of polar and alpine glaciers, permafrost and ocean ice will result in releases of trapped

hazardous chemicals, including POPs and mercury, into freshwater systems, and allowing for air-

water and air-soil exchanges (specifically for volatile and semi-volatile chemicals) (Noyes et al., 2009;

UNEP/AMAP, 2011; Stern et al., 2012; Ma, Hung and Macdonald, 2016; Hock et al., 2019; Meredith

et al., 2019; Potapowicz et al., 2019).

· Changes in characteristics of snowpack and sea-ice and increases in precipitation in the Arctic which

are linked to climate change, have been found to be primary contributors to changes in mercury

concentrations in air, and in mercury deposition processes (Goodsite et al., 2013; Hock et al., 2019;

Meredith et al., 2019). Higher precipitation rates may be especially important in causing increased

releases of both mercury and organic matter, which together result in increased concentrations of

methyl mercury in water bodies which is then available to aquatic food chains (Chen et al., 2018;

Schartup et al., 2018). Furthermore, based on soil measurements, it has been estimated that 1,± 962 kilo tonnes of mercury are stored in the top three meters of soil in the permafrost regions

alone, which represents nearly double the mercury as all other soils, the ocean, and the atmosphere

combined. Of this, 793 ± 461 kilo tonnes of mercury is frozen in permafrost. This mercury is vulnerable

to release as permafrost thaws over the next century (Schuster et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019;

Schaefer et al., 2020). Projections suggest that under a high GHG emissions scenario, mercury

emissions from permafrost could reach a peak of 1.9±1.1 Gg Hg year-1 in 2200, the equivalent of

current global atmospheric emissions (Schaefer et al., 2020). The potential also exists for climate

change to lead to increased releases of mercury into the environment from terrestrial soils, other

than those in permafrost regions.

· Observed changes in many biogeochemical and ecological processes that drive mercury cycling

have already been attributed to climate change. Increased secondary releases of chromium, nickel,

copper, lead and cadmium from permafrost and soils could also be seen in Arctic regions as a result of

climate change (Stern et al., 2012; McKinney et al., 2015; AMAP/UNEP, 2019; Potapowicz et al., 2019).

· The chemistry of seawater is projected to change, in part due to melting of glaciers (IPCC, 2019c).

Salinity and pH changes impact on the solubility of chemicals in water and, as a result, air-water

partitioning. For example, solubility of POPs decreases as salinity increases (Lamon, Dalla Valle, et

al., 2009).

· Mobility of water-soluble chemicals, such as PFOS and PFAS, present in both contaminated and

uncontaminated soils, may increase with temperature. This is due to the exponential increase in

vapor pressure with temperature, which affects the partitioning between air and soil and between

air and water.

· Land use changes, land degradation and erosion (for example, due to growth of agriculture, tourism

and spread of communities in the Arctic and high latitude regions as the climate warms (Alvarez,

Yumashev and Whiteman, 2020)) will change vegetation cover, affect environmental reservoirs such

as surface water, soils, vegetation, permafrost, snow and ice, and modify secondary emissions of

POPs (IPCC, 2019b). They may also impact on deposition from the atmosphere into foliage, and

formation of long-term soil reservoirs may be impacted by modification of land uses associated with

climate change (Ma, Hung and Macdonald, 2016).

· Higher temperatures are likely to increase degradation of chemicals; including reservoirs of POPs

in soils, vegetation and seawater. However, although the activity of microorganisms which degrade

chemicals may increase with temperature contributing to this effect, the possibility also exists that

microorganisms may experience thermal stress under a warming climate thereby reducing degradation.

Microorganisms are also impacted by changing precipitation (UNEP/AMAP, 2011). Global warming,

which is linked to the rate of heat uptake of the ocean, marine heat waves, deoxygenation, acidification

and reduced ventilation, has already, and will continue to, impact on marine biological productivity

and consequently the POP storage capacity of the ocean (Wang, Sun and Yao, 2016b; IPCC, 2019c).

· Droughts, floods and other weather events that are projected to increase in both intensity and

frequency (IPCC, 2019b, 2019c) can result in redistribution of hazardous chemicals through mechanisms

such as increased soil erosion, flooding and air transport of dust.

· Forest and peat fires, which are already becoming more frequent and intense with climate change

(IPCC, 2019b, 2019c), can result in releases of POPs, including PCB, polychlorinated naphthalene

(PCN), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) as well pesticides (Wang et al., 2017), while at the

same time releasing methane (Kohlenberg et al., 2018). They also give rise to low particulate but

high gaseous mercury releases, regardless of the combustion temperature or fuel moisture content.



Estimates vary between studies, with one estimate suggesting global annual emissions of mercury in the early 2000s from forest fires to be 612 Mg/year. This same study suggested that climate change would contribute to a global increase in emissions of mercury from forest fires of 14% between 2000 and 2050, with large regional variations being seen (Kumar et al., 2018). Drying of wetlands as a result of climate change could result in increased burning and associated releases of mercury from this repository, although no quantitative estimates of the potential for these releases were found.
A range of studies consider potential current and future releases of POPs via secondary pathways from frozen reservoirs including the Arctic and Alpine glaciers. Observed levels of PCB 52 and PCB 101 in the atmosphere at the Arctic station of Stórhöfði in Iceland (Figure 2) have demonstrated a steady increasing trend since just before the turn of the century. These trends have been attributed to re-emissions of these compounds that were previously deposited and accumulated in water, ice and soil to the air due to warming in the Arctic and retreating of sea ice and melting of glaciers, noting, however, that the Stórhöfði site is an exception in the region as, in general, declining trends in air are being monitored (UNEP, 2017). Models of Arctic and Alpine glaciers have suggested that changes in seasonal melt profiles, snowfall and other precipitation, which are impacted by climate change, will disrupt cycles of releases and absorption of POPs into glacial ice (Steinlin et al., 2014; Miner et al., 2017), with the net impacts depending on a range of assumptions. It is thus not possible to make conclusive statements on this topic. However, while impacts of climate change on secondary releases of POPs from ice reservoirs remain uncertain, studies comparing primary and secondary releases as a result of climate change suggest that increased primary releases as a result of changing land uses, including agriculture, and increased resource exploitation in Arctic regions, will be the dominant cause of increased selected POP releases (Wöhrnschimmel et al., 2012).

2.2 LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT OF HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS

Climate change will also result in changes to environmental transport pathways across the globe, including

through moving air masses and ocean currents (UNEP/AMAP, 2011; Teran, Lamon and Marcomini, 2012; Ma,

Hung and Macdonald, 2016; Pacyna et al., 2016; Wang, Sun and Yao, 2016b; Obrist et al., 2018; Bindoff et

al., 2019; Collins et al., 2019):

· Changes in temperature were highlighted above to affect partitioning of chemicals between phases

in environmental compartments (air, water, soil, vegetation), through an increase in vapor pressure

of volatile compounds with increasing temperature. A shift towards higher gaseous fractions and

increased concentrations in water make hazardous chemicals more available for long-range transport.

Furthermore, a higher temperature of surface water may increase the presence of particulate organic

matter which can associate with hazardous chemicals, thereby leading to a reduction of freely

dissolved water concentrations and increased transfers to sediments, which will have implications

for long-range water transport.

· Changes in atmospheric circulation and ocean currents have already, and will continue to, impact

on the global transport of POPs and other volatile and water-soluble chemicals and plastic pollution.

The effectiveness of airborne transport of volatile compounds is determined by a number of factors

including wind speed and direction; degradation; dry and wet removal from air by deposition of

gases and aerosols, and rate of volatilization as a function of temperature. Increased wind speeds

as a result of climate change can lead to faster and more distant transport of chemicals to locations

away from current primary and secondary sources.

· It has been suggested that climate change will have high impacts on mercury cycling, linked to

changes in ecosystem function; global atmospheric and ocean circulation; changes to vegetation

cover and atmospheric oxidants; and enhanced air­seawater exchange.

· Increased rainfall and other precipitation can result in deposition of volatile chemicals from air to

surface, whereas low or no precipitation can support airborne transport.

· Increased frequency and/or intensity of extreme weather events, including storms, floods and forest

fires as a consequence of global warming, as well as sea level rise and sea level events, can result

in remobilization and subsequent bioavailability of hazardous chemicals. Flooding events have the

potential to contribute to re-emission and transport of chemicals from sediments and agricultural soils.

· Altered migration patterns of contaminated species (e.g., fish and seabirds) may result in long-range

transport of hazardous chemicals.



BOX 1: CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPOSURE ROUTES AND TOXICOLOGICAL AND ECOTOXICOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE FOR WILDLIFE AND HUMANS IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS
Climate change can alter exposure routes and toxicological/ecotoxicological impacts of chemicals on humans and wildlife. Examples of such interlinkages, relevant to the Arctic regions, include (UNEP/ AMAP, 2011; Stern et al., 2012; AMAP, 2019; IPBES, 2019; Meredith et al., 2019):
· Changes to aquatic and terrestrial food-chain structures can lead to biomagnification of hazardous chemicals in ecosystems. An example here is in Arctic environments, where climate change is likely to increase species diversity and the geographical distribution of existing species. Together these factors increase food-chain length, which in turn results in greater mercury bioaccumulation within predatory species. Such impacts have already been witnessed in marine mammals that rely on sea-ice, such as beluga whales and seals, with changes in their habitat choices and food sources affecting dietary mercury intake.
· Toxicity of air pollutants and pesticides and absorption by animals and humans can be increased at higher temperatures. Toxicity increases with increased temperatures have been observed for toxins across a wide range of species, including: dieldrin in freshwater darters, atrazine in catfish, endosulfan in freshwater fish, and endosulfan in bollworms. Changes in absorption mechanism is demonstrated by one study, which considered PCB biotransformation in rainbow trout. This study found that in higher water temperatures, rainbow trout biotransformed a greater amount of absorbed PCB to hydroxylated PCB metabolites, which has greater toxicity.
· Increased temperatures impact the ability of animals and humans to cope with toxicity, through changing metabolism and excretion processes. Temperature increases may initially increase metabolic removal and excretion of toxins; however, further temperature increases have been found to induce metabolic stress, which leads to greater toxin accumulation. Studies have noted these impacts in fish, such as Arctic char, where temperature linked metabolic stress results in enhanced mercury bioaccumulation. Temperature increases also impact overall growth rates and food intake requirements, which in turn impacts toxin bioaccumulation. An example is lake trout which grow less efficiently in higher temperatures, which is likely to result in greater bioaccumulation over the trout's lifetime. Similarly, a study has found that POP levels in common eiders is linked to temperature, with POP levels likely increasing during periods where greater food consumption and hence greater bioaccumulation occur.
· Suppressed immune systems in chemically compromised bodies are more susceptible to the effects of climate change such as extreme temperatures, severe storms, polluted water and food shortages, as well as stresses and diseases. Immunosuppression is caused by various hazardous chemicals across a wide range of species. For example, PCB and mercury exposure has been linked to reduced immune responses in humans, polar bears, beluga whales, seals and sled dogs. POPs and mercury have also been shown to suppress immune systems in fish.
· Changes in social and migratory behavior of animals due to changing sea-ice regimes or temperature regimes can affect dietary exposure to hazardous chemicals and pathogens: As noted above, changes in habitat choices and food sources have been linked to changes in mercury intake for sea-ice dependent mammals, such as beluga whales and seals. Changes in polar bear POP levels have been noted as their food sources have shifted from ice-bound seal species to open-water seal species, while changes in black-legged kittiwake mercury exposure has been linked to Arctic cod consumption, which is closely linked to sea-ice levels.



2.3 IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS

The impacts of climate change, including extreme temperatures, increased sea levels and sea level events,

flooding, heavy rainfall (leading to landslides) and development of conditions conducive to increased fires

have the potential to disrupt various classes of infrastructure that can in turn result in releases of hazardous

chemicals into the environment. Examples here include waste management activities and chemicals

production plants, storage facilities and transport infrastructure such as pipelines, containers and ships

(see Table 1). The extent of impact does, however, depend on the levels of appropriate adaptation actions

that are undertaken, and the extent to which such potential impacts are incorporated into design of such

infrastructure (IPCC, 2014c). It is recognized that infrastructure design is often based on past experience, and

many existing installations, constructed in the past, may not have addressed climate change issues. Climate

change is a new phenomenon with significant future uncertainty, . Thus, aside from issues of inadequate

or poor design and construction based on existing data, there is also the problem of adequately designed

installations that had not consider the events and uncertainty that climate change introduces.

2.3.1 DISRUPTION OF LANDFILL SITES AND OTHER WASTE MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS

Historically, landfill sites were often located within flood plains and low-lying coastal areas where land was cheaper due to flood risks, with one study suggesting that there are many hundreds of thousands of such landfills in such areas globally (Brand et al., 2018). Rising sea levels and flooding have the potential to erode and physically disrupt both general and hazardous landfill sites, which could result in release of wastes previously contained in these sites into the environment. Increased releases are as a combination of both leaching and erosion, although the latter has been suggested to be more significant of a threat than the former (Brand and Spencer, 2020). The challenge of avoiding releases from historical landfills is compounded by the fact that they were often poorly constructed with inadequate or no linings and leachate management systems, and have limited records on the types of wastes that were disposed of therein. These challenges still apply in many parts of the developing world (Brand et al., 2018; O'Shea, Cundy and Spencer, 2018).
Floods, heatwaves, droughts, windstorms and fires also all have the potential to damage waste management infrastructure and equipment other than landfills, as well as supporting infrastructure such as that required for power supply. Daily waste collection and processing activities could also be interrupted by extreme weather events (IPCC, 2014b; Dawson et al., 2018), including management of hazardous waste during such events.

2.3.2 FLOODING AND DISRUPTION OF MINES AND TAILINGS DAMS

Mining operations often dispose of process wastes in dumps and tailings dams. If these are properly planned, designed, constructed and managed both during operation and post-closure, releases of hazardous chemicals into the environment can be limited. If not, however, flooding, heavy rain and snow falls, landslides, and other events which may increase in frequency and intensity as a result of climate change, have the potential to disrupt this infrastructure, releasing heavy metals and other chemicals (Odell, Bebbington and Frey, 2018). Similarly, droughts can dry out tailings dams, allowing for increased transport of hazardous particulates by wind. Transport in water and air can occur over long distances, including across national boundaries.
As with landfill sites, dumps and tailings dams may historically not have been properly constructed, and still today in parts of the world insufficient provision is made to put infrastructure in place to ensure environmental protection, putting such installations at increased risks due to the impacts of climate change (UNECE, 2014). A further consideration relates to mining operations themselves that have not been properly remediated after mining has ceased. Water that enters into abandoned mining operations potentially leaches out hazardous chemicals, due to formation of acid mine drainage (AMD). When the mines are full, AMD can decant into the environment, impacting negatively on natural systems and infrastructure. The potential for generation of AMD will increase in areas where rainfall increases as a result of climate change, but will drop in areas where rainfall decreases (ICMM, 2013).
Countries like Papua New Guinea are using Deep Sea Tailings Disposal (DSTP) to dispose of mining wastes into the ocean (Vare et al., 2018)k. Research on these practices is limited, and there would be value in understanding how climate change can impact the viability of DSTP as an environmentally sound disposal method.



2.3.3 IMPACTS ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS
Climate change and extreme weather events have the potential to impact domestic and industrial wastewater treatment systems in a number of ways, with examples of such impacts already having been observed around the world (Kirchhoff and Watson, 2019). Flooding, fires and extreme weather events can damage wastewater treatment plant infrastructure. Droughts and fluctuating moisture contents in shrink-swell soils such as clays can cause cracking of sewer systems, and higher temperatures and droughts can result in increased pollutant concentrations, longer retention times, and sedimentation of solids, which in turn may increase corrosion of sewers. Increased rainfall can add to the load on wastewater treatment plants and sewer systems as stormwater penetrates these systems, causing overflows of untreated effluent into water bodies. Sea level rise can result in the increased salinity load on wastewater treatment systems (IPCC, 2014b; Dawson et al., 2016; Kirchhoff and Watson, 2019).
2.3.4 IMPACTS ON CHEMICALS AND ASSOCIATED FACILITIES
Natural events are already recognized as an important contributor to incidents at industrial facilities, including production plants and storage areas. The so-called ""natural hazard triggering technological"" (""NaTech"") risks, whereby environmental disasters such as floods or earthquakes trigger major accidents at industrial sites or other technological facilities, can be aggravated by increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change. These accidents place significant pressure on emergency response services, governments, businesses, industry and communities, both within and across country borders. An interrogation of industrial accident databases indicated that up to 5% of industrial accidents that impact facilities that process or store hazardous substances were triggered by natural events (Krausmann et al., 2011). Hurricane Harvey, which hit the United States coast near Houston, Texas, in August 2017 resulted in multiple leaks and industrial spills, polluting the local environment (Kiaghadi and Rifai, 2019). The extreme rainfalls experienced have been directly attributed to global warming (Van Oldenborgh et al., 2017). A further study identified 872 highly hazardous chemical facilities as being located within 50 miles of the hurricane-prone U.S. Gulf Coast alone, with approximately 4,374,000 people, 1,717 schools, and 98 medical facilities being within 1.5 miles of these facilities. As natural disasters become more severe and extreme weather events become more frequent, the public and environmental health risks of disruptions to these facilities grows (Anenberg and Kalman, 2019). A recent oil spill into in Siberia which resulted from collapse of a storage tank has been suggested to have occurred as a result of the thawing permafrost in the area10.

CHAPTER 3 Releases from chemicals production and use

3 RELEASES FROM CHEMICALS PRODUCTION AND USE
The global chemicals is inextricably linked to the entry of hazardous chemicals into the environment. It is also an important contributor to GHG emissions, being the single biggest industrial user of fossil fuels for both energy and feedstock purposes. It thus has an important role to play in contributing to meeting of the Paris Agreement, through both uptake of renewable energy alternatives and changes to chemicals processes and products. The organizational and institutional structure of the chemicals industry, which is currently highly integrated with and completely dependent upon the oil and gas industries, must be addressed as a fundamental issue to manage the range of environmental problems, ranging from air and water pollution to GHG emissions throughout the value chain. To this end, circular economy thinking (Box 2), Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) all offer opportunities for understanding the systemic nature of impacts associated with provision of products and services, thereby identifying opportunities for reducing these impacts.
BOX 2: THE ROLE OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY THINKING IN ADDRESSING GHG AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS RELEASES
The circular economy refers to an economic system which deviates from the current linear take-makewaste industrial model (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2019. The concept is based on three principles, being:
· Designing out waste and pollution through designing for circularity, eliminating waste and substituting materials;
· Reusing products and recirculating materials to retain the embodied energy; and · Regeneration of agricultural systems.
Circular economy approaches can make substantive contributions to both reducing GHG emissions and achieving climate targets, and to reducing releases of hazardous chemicals, through transforming the way goods are produced and used (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2019). For example, the textile industry is responsible for 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2e (in 2015), approximately 2% of the global carbon budget, discharges high volumes of hazardous chemicals into the environment, accounting for 20% of global industrial water pollution, and is a major contributor to ocean plastic (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017). Based on circular economy principles, there are several actions the textile industry could implement to reduce emissions and harmful waste products:
· Phase out harmful substances and microfibre releases, · Increase clothing utilisation, · Increase recycling, and · Make effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs.
These actions could be achieved through the adoption of technologies that capture microfibres when released unavoidably (phase out harmful substances and microfibre releases), scale-up short-term clothing rental (increase clothing utilisation), design and develop clothing and recycling technologies to be compatible (increase recycling) and move to renewable feedstocks from plastic-based fibres (make effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs) (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, 2017).
Through these actions, in addition to reduction of GHGs; the circular economy can achieve additional environmental and social benefits. These can include, but are not limited to, increased access to goods, increased mobility and connectivity and reduced air pollution and biodiversity loss. In addition, it can address resource scarcity, waste and pollution. Consequently, the circular economy has the potential to help achieve several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), contributing to at least 12 of 17 SDGs (mainly SDG 12 ­ responsible consumption and production) (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2019).
Other examples where circular economy thinking might be relevant to this current study include developing lighter, cheaper, more readily available and recyclable batteries, bioplastic derived from sugarcane combined with recycling and amino acid-enriched animal feed which results in a lower requirement for raw feed material and arable land (ICCA, 2019).

CHAPTER 3 Releases from chemicals production and use

3
LCT and LCA frameworks and tools are used to assess a product, process or service across all of the stages in its Life Cycle, from extraction of raw materials to processing, manufacturing, distribution, use, and recycling or final disposal. Furthermore, LCA allows for the quantification of a range of environmental impacts rather than focusing on a particular issue11. LCA has already been extensively applied to the chemicals sector towards improving environmental and economic performance as evidenced in the review articles produced by Santos, Barbosa-Póvoa and Carvalho (2019) and Fantke et al. (2020). Applying an LCT/LCA perspective to assessing the contribution of the chemicals sector to GHG emissions and hazardous chemicals releases (Figure 3) begins by considering the supply of raw materials inputs. Many of the inputs for chemicals production originate from the mining and minerals processing sector, including mercury, asbestos, lead, coal and fluorite for production of fluorine. Mining is energy intensive, requiring inputs of liquid fuels (largely diesel) and electricity, which lead to GHG emissions, mostly carbon dioxide. Energy consumption for mining and quarrying represents about 2.7% of global industrial energy use. There are substantial variations in regional contributions, with the sector representing 80% of total consumption in Namibia and Botswana and 50% in Chile (IPCC, 2014a). Coal mining is associated with methane emissions from coal seams. These occur in active, as well as in closed mines. Technologies are available, but not consistently deployed, to manage both. Mining and minerals processing has also long been responsible for releases of hazardous chemicals, notably heavy metals, from byproducts, wastes and abandoned sites. Mercury releases to terrestrial and freshwater environments from artisanal and small-scale gold mining were about 1,220 tonnes in 2015 (UNEP, 2019c).

Mercury, lead and other metals are further refined via pyrometallurgical processing, which requires further fossil inputs, giving rise to GHGs, and also results in generation of GHG emissions due to chemical reactions. Heavy metals are present in solid and liquid waste streams and air emissions from these processes, as are POPs produced through products of incomplete combustion.

Natural gas is the most widely used energy feedstock in the chemicals sector, followed by coal (IEA, 2020). Gas and coal not only provide energy sources for chemicals production, but also form the basic building blocks for many organic compounds, including compounds classed as hazardous chemicals. Leaks of natural gas, largely methane, occur along the gas supply chain, contribute to GHG emissions from the sector. Estimates suggest that between 1 and 5% of the total gas that is produced globally is lost as fugitive emissions along the supply chain (IPCC, 2014a). Abandoned gas wells are a significant further source of emissions from the natural gas sector (Boothroyd et al., 2016; Riddick et al., 2020).

During chemicals manufacture, GHG and hazardous chemicals emissions arise directly from combustion of fossil fuels (coal, gas, liquid fuels), from electricity that is supplied from fossil fuels, from non-energy uses of fossil fuels (i.e. fossil fuels used as chemical feedstocks) and as by-products of chemical reactions.

The chemicals sector contributed 15% of global industrial sector GHG emissions in 2010, a total of

approximately 10 Gt CO2e (Figure 4), while the industrial sector contributed 21% to global emissions in that

year (Figure 5). Direct CO2 emissions from primary chemical production12, including energy and process

emissions, were 880 Mt CO2 in 2018. Of these emissions, 622 Mt CO2 were associated with ammonia and

methanol production. The remaining 258 Mt CO2 was from production of high value chemicals, which are

used directly or are further processed or used to produce other products (IEA, 2020).

FIGURE 5: BREAKDOWN OF CONTRIBUTORS BY ECONOMIC SECTOR TO GHG EMISSIONS IN SOURCE: (IPCC, 2014a)
Whilst the discussion above focuses broadly on chemicals manufacturing, individual chemical processes, operating conditions, products and feedstock choices result in different GHG (as shown in Figure 6) and hazardous chemicals emission profiles. Examples include the following. Chlorine, a key input for the production of chlorinated organic products, including a number of the hazardous chemicals covered under the different conventions, is produced via electrolysis of brine solutions which is electricity intensive. Processes for producing vinyl chloride monomer have historically been coal-based and use mercury catalysts. In chlor-alkali production, the mercury cell process is one of three production methods, and represents both a potential source of mercury releases into the environment and a high user of electricity.
Some of the chemical products from primary chemicals production are used directly, while others are sent for further downstream processing and manufacture. In downstream industries, chemicals are used to produce plastics (discussed further below), textiles, electronics, furniture, mattresses and a wide range of other products. During processing and manufacture, GHG releases will be linked energy consumption, and there is potential for release of hazardous chemicals which many also have high Global Warming Potentials (GWP)13 from processes. The use phase of products gives rise to further releases of hazardous and high GWP chemicals. Pesticides enter the environment directly through application on land (Section 2.1). Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), which can be both toxic and have high GWPs, are used in the electronics industry for plasma etching of silicon containing materials in microelectronic and semiconductor manufacturing and cleaning of tools where silicon has been deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (IPCC, 2006b). HFCs, PFCs and fluorinated ethers (HFEs) are also used in a number of other sectors (Table 2) (IPCC, 2006c):
· Refrigeration and air-conditioning; · Fire suppression and explosion protection; · Aerosol propellants and solvents; · Solvent cleaning; · Foam blowing; · Sterilization equipment; and · Solvents for adhesive, coating and ink manufacture.
13 GWP is a metric developed to allow for comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. The GWP reflects how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWPs are presented for different time periods, for example 25 year or 100-year periods, which takes into account the longevity of the gas in the atmosphere.

CHAPTER 3 Releases from chemicals production and use

Release of compounds in certain applications is almost instantaneous (e.g. aerosol propellants, tracer research, magnesium manufacture), or instantaneous releases occur due to leakage during processing (e.g. solvent etching, solvent cleaning) (IPCC, 2006c, 2006b). In other applications (e.g. foam blowing, refrigeration), releases can be short term, or occur over multiple years. Finally, in applications such as fire suppression and refrigeration systems there can be long-term storage or ""banking"" of compounds. Here, compounds may be stockpiled for multiple decades, resulting in phased-out compounds being present for years after they are no longer produced or used. Compounds in these banks will slowly leak into the atmosphere (as described in Chapter 2) and may eventually be released in large quantities due to system activation (e.g. fire suppression system activation) or product end-of-life (e.g. scrapping of equipment). However, such banks can be effectively managed through incineration or other treatment routes.


In addition to direct releases in the use phase, chemicals incorporated into manufactured products can also enter the environment. Flame retardants, including a range of halogenated compounds, are commonly used in mattresses and textiles used in furnishings, aircraft and vehicles. These have been shown to volatilise during the use phase, with releases increasing as a function of temperature, suggesting that temperature increases linked to climate change could play a role in increasing these emissions (Oz et al., 2019).
Emissions from the end of life phase of chemicals are discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, GHG and hazardous chemicals that are associated with the chemical life cycle include those from road, rail and maritime transport at all steps in the value chain.
The case of GHG emissions from plastics is used to illustrate the application of LCT to the chemicals sector, given the growing importance of this environmental issue, and its relevance to the different conventions covered by this study. Impacts of plastic waste on the oceans is a headline environmental issue, with increasing recognition of plastics' impacts on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and even on human health. The impact of plastics on climate change has been less recognised, although recent studies have served to highlight the importance of looking at the climate impact of plastics over their life cycle, especially when taken in the context of the projected growth of the sector. If plastics continue their current growth trajectory, annual emissions across the plastics life cycle are predicted to reach 2.8 to 6.5 Gt CO2e by 2050; some 10 to 15% of the global carbon budget (CIEL, 2019a; Zheng and Suh, 2019; Shen et al., 2020).
GHGs are emitted at every stage of the plastics life cycle. The production of resins accounts for the largest share (see Figure 7). Resin production consists of the extraction and transport of fossil fuels, followed by refining (cracking of alkanes into olefins), and the polymerisation and plasticisation of olefins into plastic resins. Some 108 Mt CO2e per year are attributable to the extraction and refining of oil for plastic production, with a further 9.5 to 10.5 Mt CO2e estimated for production of plastic feedstocks in the US (from fracked gas) (CIEL, 2019b). Sources of greenhouse gas emissions include methane leakage and flaring, emissions from fuel combustion from energy consumed in the processes of drilling, refining and other chemical processes, and emissions caused by land clearing for wellpads and the laying of pipelines. In 2015, emissions from cracking to produce ethylene were around 200 Mt CO2e, equivalent to 45 million passenger vehicles driven for one year. These emissions are set to rise dramatically, with more than 300 new petrochemical

CHAPTER 3 Releases from chemicals production and use

plants being built in the US alone, primarily for the production of plastics and plastic feedstocks (CIEL, 2019b). Converting plastic resins into plastic products contributes the next largest share of greenhouse gas emissions, due to the large amount of energy consumed in these manufacturing processes (see Figure 7).

Managing plastics at end-of-life contributes around 10% to the life cycle GHG emissions of plastics.

Incineration accounts for the largest share, followed by recycling and landfill (Figure 7). Plastic products

made from recycled plastics have lower GHG emissions over their life cycle. Including the avoided

virgin polymer production (i.e. providing the associated carbon credits to recycling) decreases the

estimate life cycle emissions from the end-of-life management of plastics in 2015 from 161 MtCO2e to 45 MtCO2e (Zheng and Suh, 2019).

Incineration of plastic waste is set to grow dramatically in the coming decades, with emissions

from the incineration of plastic packaging - which account for 40% of plastic demand - estimated

at 16 Mt CO2e in 2015 (CIEL, 2019b). Furthermore, emissions from unmanaged plastic waste, that is, plastics that are littered or burnt in open dumps, are most often missed in GHG assessments of

plastics. To the order of 2.9 tonnes of GHG are released for every million tonnes of plastic burnt (the

same amount as when plastics are incinerated without offsets for energy recovery) (CIEL, 2019b).

Recent research suggests that plastic that ends up in the natural environment will continue to have

climate impacts as it degrades. Plastic at the ocean's surface continually release methane and other GHGs, with emissions increasing as the plastic breaks down further. Plastics on coastlines,

riverbanks and in other terrestrial environments were also found to release GHGs, at a higher rate

than plastics in the ocean (Royer et al., 2018). But far more concerning still is emerging evidence

that microplastics in the marine environment may interfere with the ocean's capacity to absorb

and sequester carbon. Although this has to date only been demonstrated at the laboratory scale,

microplastics are thought to reduce the ability of phytoplankton to fix carbon, as well as affect the

metabolic rates and reproductive success of zooplankton (responsible for transferring carbon to

the deep ocean) (CIEL, 2019a; Shen et al., 2020).

Mitigation strategies include a switch to bio-based plastics, where biomass feedstocks, such as corn and sugarcane, substitute the fossil fuels currently used to produce plastics. Whilst bio-based plastics offer a potential solution for mitigating the GHG emissions associated with fossil fuel extraction, it needs to be recognised that these systems have environmental and socio-economic impacts of their own, including an increase in the demand for arable land, water and agrochemicals to grow the feedstocks. Furthermore, emissions from downstream processes in many cases remain unchanged regardless of the primary feedstocks used in production. Increased use of renewable energy in the energy mix of the plastics supply chain will also mitigate GHG emissions in resin production and plastics conversion to a degree (although it will not mitigate process emissions). Increased recycling is the strategy most widely promoted for mitigating GHG emissions at end-of-life, recognising the need for controlling recycling of plastics containing hazardous constituents. Certain plastics, including older plastics and those used in electronics, may contain toxic organic and inorganic additives, which can be released at all stages of the plastics lifecycle, including during recycling, or be introduced into the recycled material (Hahladakis et al., 2018).

However, waste management strategies alone will not be effective in reducing plastic waste impacts (Borrelle et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020). A common thread in recent analyses is that aggressive and immediate implementation of multi-layered strategies and regulations are required, including those with a focus on reducing plastics production (CIEL, 2019a; Zheng and Suh, 2019; Shen et al., 2020).

4 WASTE MANAGEMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE
The waste sector is linked to releases of both hazardous chemicals and GHGs in a number of ways. Plastics waste has been discussed in Chapter 3, where it was highlighted that end-of-life management of plastics contributes around 10% to the life cycle GHG emissions of plastics, or 161 MtCO2e of emissions in 2015, from incineration, recycling and landfill. Plastic that is not properly managed at end-of-life can also have negative impacts on land and terrestrial ecosystems. Reducing volumes of plastic waste in circulation, and proper end of life management, including disposal, are thus required to minimise the multiple impacts. In recognition of the global importance of the plastics waste issue, a plastic waste partnership was established under the Basel Convention in late 2019 to mobilise action towards preventing and minimising generation thereof14.
Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) products contain lead, mercury and other metals, flame retardants and certain phthalates, that may be released into the natural environment during end of life management, particularly if the wastes are not processed or disposed of properly. Open burning presents a particular concern in this regard. In addition to being hazardous, many flame retardants used in electrical and electronic equipment have high GWPs. A total of 53.6 Mt, or an equivalent of 7.3 kilogram per capita, of e-waste is estimated to have been generated annually in 2019, up from 44.4 Mt in 2014. This figure is projected to rise to 74.7 Mt total, and 9 kg per capita, by 2030 (Forti et al., 2020), although estimates do vary between reference sources. A new partnership has been formed under the Basel Convention to support action on computing equipment15. Linked to this issue, discarded refrigeration and air conditioning equipment that is not managed properly can release high GWP refrigerants into the atmosphere.
Household wastes are identified as being relevant to this study, with hazardous chemicals releases and GHG emissions being dependent on the options used in their management16. When consigned to landfill, there is potential for degradation of the organic constituents of household waste to form methane, a high GWP GHG. GHG emissions from the waste sector (including waste and wastewater) contributed to the order of 2.9% in 2010, or 1.4 GtCO2eq. Management of hazardous health care wastes represents a major challenge in many parts of the world, if facilities are not available for proper disposal. BAT for health care wastes includes incineration, which produces CO2 emissions, although if coupled with energy recovery it can be used to offset fossil fuels demand. Box 3 illustrates considerations related to medical waste in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.
For many waste streams Environmentally Sound Management practices have been developed under the Basel Convention, with Technical Guidelines having been produced on topics such as management of plastic17, mercury18 and POP19 wastes and on specially engineered landfills and incineration on land20.

BOX 3: IMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR SOLID WASTE GENERATION

The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the demand for single use plastics (and other materials) as personal protective equipment (PPE) in both the healthcare sector as well as by individuals. While reusable textile masks are being encouraged for the general population, the demand for single use PPE by hospitals and healthcare facilities is still staggering: the WHO estimates that the monthly demand for single use masks is 89 million with a further 79 million examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles also required. To meet this demand requires a 40% increase in global production of PPE21. It is recognized that over time, however, innovative options are evolving to allow for reuse and recycling of PPE.

In some countries, the pandemic has also seen the stalling or even reversal of policies limiting the use of other single use plastic products, such as plastic grocery bags. Even though experts have tried to placate the public regarding the relatively low risks of Covid-19 transmission through single use items, the trend continues. There has also been a marked increase in demand for other household and medical products including cleaning chemicals and disinfectants, hand sanitizers, wipes and thermometers.

One of the climate change implications of increased demand for single used plastics and PPE is linked to GHG emissions released during production. GHG emissions from plastics production are discussed in Chapter 3. Production of other single use items will have similar energy and material inputs that give rise to GHGs. UNEP is committed to working with countries to maximize the circularity of their medical sectors and thus reducing demand for single use items. However, the challenge is keeping these environmental priorities in the forefront in an emergency situation where the focus has necessarily shifted to reducing the spread of the virus.

In addition to an increased demand for certain materials, the pandemic has also resulted in the

concurrent generation of infectious, sharps, chemicals and other healthcare-related wastes including

PPE, which in turn has given rise to mounting waste management challenges due to the volumes and

rate of generation. The challenges include the risk of an overwhelmed waste management sector,

which can lead to open dumping and the open burning or uncontrolled incineration of wastes. Open

dumping of infectious material can cause a public health risk, while inefficient burning and incineration

can release toxic emissions such as dioxins. A further challenge is the contamination of recyclable

streams with used PPE or other infectious materials or the decrease in source separation behavior,

which further puts strain on waste management systems.

Although challenging, it is important that the end-of-life treatment of wastes follows best practice guidance to avoid impacts on both human health and the environment, utilizing best available technologies (BAT) for their management. BAT/BEP at the national level can be identified through Sustainability Assessment of Technologies (SAT). The GHG implications and potential for hazardous chemicals releases for different waste management technology choices are explored in Table 3. Source separation of wastes is a critical component of the Covid-19 response to minimize cross-contamination of different waste streams.

Various guidance documents have been developed on waste management under the Covid-19 pandemic, including under the Basel Convention22 and UNEP23.

The preferred technologies and process routes for treating different waste streams depend on factors including compatibility between technology and waste type; local applicability and availability of the technology; cost; and public acceptability. Table 3 presents a summary of waste management options, waste streams to which the different options are suited, potential for generation or savings of emissions from these options, and potential for releases of hazardous chemicals. A breakdown of the percentage of waste treated via different disposal routes is shown in Figure 8, noting that there are significant differences between regions and between developed and developing countries.
Clearly the avoidance of waste is the best option for avoiding emissions of both GHGs and hazardous chemicals from the waste sector, and SDG 12 calls for substantial reduction of waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. The United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC) developed by UNECE and implemented in the European Union, African Union and many countries worldwide provides a framework for sustainable development of resources, which focuses on minimization of wastes (UNECE, 2018).

Generation: Waste collection vehicles typically run on fossil fuels, which give rise to CO2 Savings: Fuel and emissions savings can be achieved through smart routing of collection vehicles, use of transfer stations for long range transport and use of waste collection vehicles that run on clean fuels.

Transport vehicles are a recognised source of POPs

MSW, toxic, poisonous, plastics Not suited to: Flammable, explosive

Generation: Methane is generated in landfills through anaerobic decomposition of biodegradable waste constituents (mainly paper and food and garden wastes ­ the latter known collectively as putrescible waste). In well-managed sites methane may be captured (landfill gas capture) and either flared or used for electricity generation ­ converting it back into CO2. CO2 released from landfill sites is considered biogenic carbon (IPCC, 2006a). Savings: Recovery of energy from landfills can also offset fossil fuel requirements for power generation. Some slowly degrading carbon is locked up into landfill sites.

If landfills are not properly lined and covered and leachates are not captured and treated properly, there is potential for mobilisation and release of hazardous chemical constituents of the wastes into the environment (Weber et al., 2011; UNEP, 2013b).

MSW, infectious, certain chemicals, plastics, sewage sludge, waste wood, biomass Not suited to: Wastes without an organic component, wastes with high levels of mercury and other heavy metals

Generation: Emissions of fossil-derived CO2 from the combustion of plastics and some textiles (Shen et al., 2020) Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (IPCC, 2006a). CO2 emissions from combustion of biological wastes are considered biogenic (IPCC, 2006a). Savings: Incineration with energy recovery can offset fossil fuel usage and the associated emissions.

Potential for generation of dioxins and furans with release in waste gases, fly ash, bottom ash. Toxic metals contained in the waste stream will report to fly ash or bottom ash (UNEP, 2008, 2013b). Waste gases from incineration may also contain metals such as mercury or lead.

Good quality garden and food wastes that have been segregated at source

Mechanical biological treatment (MBT), where mixed waste is first mechanically separated and then undergoes a prolonged composting or digestion process which reduces the biodegradable materials to an inert, stabilised compost residue. Typically the compost, which cannot be used in agriculture or horticulture because of its poor quality, is then landfilled (Smith et al., 2001; UNEP, 2010).

Bulk MSW, or residual wastes enriched in putrescible materials after the removal of dry recyclables

Anaerobic Digestion (AD) produces a methane-rich biogas and compost product from source separated biological wastes. The biogas is collected and used as a fuel for electricity generation or CHP, while the compost is used in agriculture or horticulture applications. In AD, waste is digested in sealed vessels under anaerobic conditions.

Organic wastes with no toxic constituents

Potential for generation or savings of GHG emissions*

Potential for releases of hazardous chemicals

Generation: CO2 from organic waste is biogenic, while CO2 from the fossil fraction of tyres is not. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide Savings: Use of wastes for energy in such applications offsets the combustion of fossil fuels and their associated emissions.

Potential for generation of POPs during combustion if equipment is not operated according to strict guidelines. Potential generation from stockpiles. Hazardous metals contained in wastes will be found in final products or ash residues (UNEP, 2008)

Generation: CO2, methane and nitrous oxide can be released during composting. Methane emissions from composting are minimised through ensuring the compost remains aerobic through regular turning. Savings: Use of compost avoids emissions associated with the production and use of fertiliser that it displaces. Some of the carbon in compost is incorporated into stable humus in the soil

Should the feedstock contain hazardous chemicals, these can be leached out during the composting process, or during the use of the compost. However, good quality, uncontaminated organic material which is free of such components should have the lowest potential for containing hazardous chemicals (UNEP, 2013b).

Generation: CO2, methane and nitrous oxide can be released from MBT, depending on how it is managed. However MBT results in a significant reduction in methane forming potential of the final compost in the landfill compared with untreated waste.

Depending on the feedstocks, hazardous chemicals could be contained in the compost or leachate from the process.

Generation: Methane is produced in the anaerobic digester, although if the unit operates efficiently then the methane is captured and combusted, generating CO2. Some potential for leakage nonetheless remains. Nitrous oxide emissions are assumed to be negligible (IPCC, 2006a). Savings: Biogas from AD can offset fossil fuel usage and the associated emissions.

Ideally uncontaminated wastes should be used in AD. However if there is contamination with hazardous chemicals, these will report to either the compost or liquid outputs from the AD.

Potential for releases of hazardous chemicals

Generation: Energy (electricity and liquid fuels) is required as an input to many recycling processes, which gives rise primarily to CO2 emissions. Emissions of halogenated compounds with high global warming potentials from recycling of electrical equipment (for example as refrigerants and insulating foam) Savings: Recycling avoids energy and process GHG emissions associated with producing materials from primary resources (Shen et al., 2020).

Recycling of materials of unknown composition, including older materials containing now banned chemicals, can lead to risks and reintroduce contaminants into recycled products. Releases of halogenated compounds used as refrigerants and insulating foam during recycling. Burning of waste wire and circuit boards during e-waste recycling can give rise to PCDD/PCDF (UNEP, 2013b)

Chemical recycling

Chemicals suited to either open or closed loop recycling

Generation: Energy (electricity and liquid fuels) is required as an input to many recycling processes, which gives rise primarily to CO2 emissions. Chemicals being recycled that have high GWP could be released into the environment during the recycling process. Savings: Recycling avoids energy and process GHG emissions associated with producing chemicals from primary resources

Depending on the process being used, there is the potential for releases of chemicals into the environment. Recycling process may also result in production of residual waste streams.

Open burning of mixed wastes

Not a preferred waste management approach due to lack of control. Used in developing countries with limited formal waste management infrastructure

Generation: CO2, CH4, N2O, and particulate matter given off during combustion. Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (IPCC, 2006a).

Potential for generation of a wide range of hazardous compounds which may include mercury and dioxins depending on the waste composition, and as a result of incomplete combustion due to lack of control of combustion conditions.

* Biogenic CO2 emissions from waste management activities are not included in waste sector emissions in national greenhouse gas inventories, but are rather included in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. Reporting in both sectors would be considered double counting.

The calculation of emissions of GHGs and hazardous wastes arising from different processing routes depends on the location and wastes being treated. One estimate suggests that 1.6 billion tonnes of CO2e of GHG emissions were generated from solid waste treatment and disposal in 2016, driven primarily by open dumping and disposal in landfills without landfill gas capture systems. This figure represented about 5% of global emissions (Kaza et al., 2018). Johnke et al. (2000) estimates emissions to the order of 0.415 kg of CO2 per kg of waste is released during incineration, the technology used for 22% of the waste treated in high income countries. In low income countries to the order of 92% of waste is dumped (Kaza et al., 2018). At the same time, incineration gave rise to 8.9 to 32.3 tonnes of mercury in emissions in 2015, with other waste sector activities resulting in emissions of 120 to 223 tonnes of mercury in that same year (UNEP, 2019c). Waste fly ash can contain dioxin concentrations of up to 858 ng I-TEQ/kg (Dopico and Gómez, 2015).


5 GHG AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS MITIGATION
GHGs and hazardous chemicals, including unintentionally produced POPs and heavy metals, can be released from the same sources. Mitigation options or integrated policy measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may therefore also have positive benefits for reducing emissions of hazardous chemicals, and vice versa. However, the opposite also holds true: certain GHG mitigation technologies can give rise to an increase in hazardous chemicals production and/or releases, thus resulting in a trade-off between GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation. Co-benefits do, however, occur in more situations than do trade-offs (UNEP/AMAP, 2011).
Fossil heat and power generation, including from coal, fuel oil and natural gas, contributed to the order of 25% of global GHGs in 2010 (IPCC, 2014a). At the same time, combustion of fossil fuels results in emissions of both mercury and other heavy metals and unintentional POPs (Meij and te Winkel, 2007; UNEP, 2013b). Power generation from coal alone contributed 13.1% of total global emissions of mercury in 2015 (UNEP, 2019c). Efficient use of energy across all sectors is often the most cost effective way to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and hence emissions of GHGs and hazardous chemicals. In fossil fuel energy supply, high efficiency, low emission (HELE) coal-fired power plant technologies offer an alternative to conventional power stations through producing more power per unit of coal. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCUS) is a group mitigation technologies where CO2 from large point sources of emissions, including electricity generation and industrial processes, is captured, compressed and either used in a variety of applications (utilisation) or pumped into underground geologically stable reservoirs (storage), with many of the existing successful installations using deep sea oil and gas mining sites for storage. CCUS requires additional energy inputs of between 10% and 20% depending on the technology and configuration, which, when delivered by fossil fuels, can also result in both GHG production and an increase in heavy metals and hazardous organic compounds reporting to both the solid and the gaseous waste streams from power stations (Vasudevan et al., 2016). There are also concerns about risks associated with stability of underground storage reservoirs used for Carbon Capture and Storage.
A further transition alternative for mitigation of emissions linked to fossil fuel energy supply is to switch between fossil fuels. Emissions from combustion of natural gas are to the order of 60% of the GHG emissions of coal and 72% of the GHG emissions of fuel oil on a per TJ basis (IPCC, 2006a), recognising, however, that methane emissions from all along the gas supply chain can reduce the life cycle greenhouse gas benefits of gas over coal. Fuel switching can also result in reductions of emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-pdioxin (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF): emissions of these compounds from coal are 10 g TEQ/TJ of fossil fuel burned, from fuel oil 2.5 g TEQ/TJ and from gas 0.5 TEQ/TJ (UNEP, 2019d). Despite these benefits of natural gas, it needs to be recognised that a reduction in the global use of natural gas is necessary to achieve the emissions reductions needed to limit global temperature increases (Rogelj et al., 2018). Use of gas is required to peak and then fall to below current levels by 2050, and continue to decline In the second half of the century (IPCC, 2014a). Natural gas may thus only have a role as a bridging fuel from coal to renewables, and investments in gas infrastructure should take this consideration into account.
In combustion of fossil fuels, BAT/BEP guidelines for fossil fuel-fired utility and industrial boilers to minimize production of POPs propose that boilers be operated at high temperatures and under consistent combustion conditions, including adequate oxygen and mixing, to limit potential for formation of PCDD, PCDF, PCB and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) (UNEP, 2019d). High temperatures and optimised operating conditions have the co-benefits of limiting potential for production of black carbon, particulate matter that contributes to global warming24, and nitrous oxide (N2O), a high GWP GHG. While these and other mitigation options are available to the fossil fuels sector, it is recognised that globally there is a shift away from using fossil fuels towards renewable alternatives, which can achieve far greater positive outcomes in terms of reducing GHG mitigation and hazardous chemicals releases. Having said that, renewable technologies require various inputs from the mining sector, and can be considered hazardous wastes at end-of-life that need to be properly managed, due to inclusion of various heavy metals.

CHAPTER 5 GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation

Moving to other sources of emissions, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have historically been used in electrical transformers, capacitors and other applications, with potential for release into the environment when such equipment is damaged or improperly disposed of. Despite production of PCBs having stopped in many countries, legacy installations containing PCBs still exist. Work is underway in many parts of the world, including in developing countries25, to remove and dispose of PCBs in line with BAT/BEP and Environmentally Sound Management (ESM) practices, thereby avoiding unintentional releases into the environment. Replacement of old transformers has the co-benefits of GHG emission savings from electricity supply and distribution as new technologies are more energy efficient than their older counterparts.

Mercury-containing lamps have historically been used in outdoor, industrial and commercial applications and accounted for between 112 and 173 tonnes of mercury consumption in 2015 (AMAP/UNEP, 2019). Replacement of these lamps with more efficient LED lighting will lead to reduced demand for electricity and its associated GHG and hazardous chemicals emissions. It will also reduce demand for mercury and end-of-life disposal requirements for lamps. However, LEDs can potentially contain other heavy metals, including nickel, lead and arsenic, and so should also be properly managed at end-of-life.

Other processes, such as cement kilns, are a source of POPs, heavy metals and GHGs. Cement contributed to the order of 2.7% of direct global GHG emissions in 2010, representing to the order of 13% of industrial sector GHG emissions (Figure 4). At the same time, cement production contributes to the order of 11% of global mercury emissions (UNEP, 2019c). GHG mitigation options in the cement sector include increasing energy efficiency of plants, introducing clinker substitutes for cement production, the use of lower carbon fossil fuels, and use of wastes as fuel inputs. Energy efficiency options have clear synergies between GHG emission and POP reductions. The use of wastes as fuel substitutes can, however, result in increased hazardous chemicals production depending on waste and control measures that are implemented. Following BAT/BEP guidelines for use of wastes as fuels in the cement industry will minimize emissions of POPs, including PCDD, PCDF, PCB and HCB (UNEP, 2019d).

In addition to energy efficiency as discussed above, chemicals sector mitigation measures include process efficiency and replacing fossil fuel feedstocks, such as in the manufacture of ammonia using hydrogen produced from solar power (IEA, 2020). A shift away from fossil fuel inputs will have the synergistic cobenefits of reducing GHG emissions and reduction in unintentional POPs and releases of heavy metals, and reduction in hazardous waste generation. Alternative processes for production of chlor-alkalis are more energy efficient, and those that are used for vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production which do not use coal and mercury catalysts have lower GHG emissions and reduce mercury demand and releases into the environment.

Incineration is a waste management technology that can be used to destroy POPs, but can also result

in emissions of production of unintentional POPs and heavy metals reporting to flue gases and fly ash, if

not operated properly (see Chapter 4). Incineration also presents a GHG mitigation opportunity, in that it

reduces the methane generation potential of waste that would otherwise be committed to landfill, and when

coupled with energy recovery can offset requirements for fossil fuel energy recovery. Each technology

and installation thus needs to be assessed on a case-by-case basis (UNEP, 2013b). Further aspects of

the relationship between mitigation of GHGs and hazardous chemicals are found in the waste sector, as

discussed in Chapter 4.

Combustion of biomass for generation of electricity and heat is considered as CO2 neutral under many emissions accounting frameworks, although incomplete combustion of biomass can give rise to other GHGs, notably methane and nitrous oxide emissions, and other air pollutants, such as particulate matter, including black carbon. Furthermore, unintentional POPs can be formed during the process of biomass combustion, which report to the gas or solid waste streams along with biomass contaminants such as heavy metals, including mercury. BAT/BEP to reduce PCDD/PCDF emissions include controlling the quality of the fuel through removal of treated woods, non-virgin biomass and other waste, optimizing the combustion technology, and optimizing plant operation including air supply, mixing and residence time (GEF-STAP, 2009; UNEP, 2013b). Following these guidelines can also reduce methane and nitrous oxide GHG emissions.


CHAPTER 5 GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation

Wider considerations that need to be taken into account with respect to use of biomass include the need for sustainable land management practices, and potential impacts of growing biomass energy crops on adaptation potential, food security and preservation of ecosystems and biodiversity (IPCC, 2019b).
Secondary or recycled steel, copper, aluminium, zinc, and lead products represent a GHG mitigation option in the minerals sector, as secondary materials have lower GHG emissions than those produced via primary metal production. However, there is the potential for production of hazardous compounds, notably PCDD/ PCDF in these processes. BAT/BEP measures can help to minimize unintentionally produced hazardous chemicals from these processes (UNEP, 2019d). Also related to the mining sector, regulation of artisanal and small-scale gold mining can have the co-benefits of reducing emissions associated with deforestation and reduce mercury usage and releases into the environment (Diringer et al., 2019).
Renovation of older buildings to make them more energy efficient, and hence reduce their GHG footprint, can result in removal of asbestos sheeting which, if not managed and disposed of properly, can be released into the environment.
Table 4 presents a summary of findings of this Chapter in terms the mitigation opportunities for hazardous chemicals and GHGs, showing whether synergies and trade-offs exist with respect to mitigation.

Parties to the Minamata and Stockholm Conventions have requirements and obligations for preparing chemical inventories, and Parties to the UNFCCC are required to prepare GHG inventories. This Chapter explores the areas of intersection of the different inventory reporting requirements, towards seeking opportunities for harmonisation and alignment of data collection efforts to meet reporting requirements.
6.1 UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC)
Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are required to submit inventories of national GHG emissions by sources and removals by sink. Annex I parties, being industrialised countries and those that were in transition in 1992, must submit GHG inventories annually, and must take on board the outcomes of an annual extensive GHG inventory review process. Non-Annex I parties need only submit GHG inventories as part of their national communications (NCs) and biennial update reports (BURs), but do not have to submit separate stand-alone GHG inventories. The frequency of submission of their NCs and BURs depends on the support of international funds. For non-Annex I Parties, only BURs are subject to technical analysis, limited to transparency and completeness of information submitted, with the scope limited to providing an assessment of information and to identifying capacity building needs. The differentiated requirements for inventory preparation are, however, changing with the Paris Agreement making provision for an enhanced transparency framework whereby all parties are required to report GHG inventories based on common modalities, procedures and guidelines (MPGs) as set out by decision 18/CMA.1, with some flexibility in implementation for those developing country Parties that need flexibility in the light of their capacities and in particular small island developing states. Key elements of the MPGs are described in the table below (UNECE, 2017; UNFCCC, 2018).

Methodologies, parameters and data

Mandatory use of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, and any subsequent version or refinement of the IPCC guidelines agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties shall be used. Each Party is also encouraged to use the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands. (Annex, paragraph 20). Nationally appropriate methodologies may be used if they better reflect national circumstances and are consistent with the above IPCC guidelines (Annex, paragraph 22) Use of country-specific and regional emission factors and activity data is encouraged (Annex II, paragraph 24)

Time series consistency

To ensure time-series consistency, each Party should use the same methods and a consistent approach to underlying activity data and emission factors for each reported year.

Key category analysis

Each Party shall identify key categories for the starting year and the latest reporting year, including and excluding land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) categories, for both level and trend assessment, by implementing a key category analysis consistent with the IPCC guidelines

Uncertainty assessment

Each Party shall quantitatively estimate and qualitatively discuss the uncertainty of the emission and removal estimates for all source and sink categories, including inventory totals, for at least the starting year and the latest reporting year of the inventory time series. Each Party shall also estimate the trend uncertainty of emission and removal estimates for all source and sink categories, by including totals, between the starting year and the latest reporting year of the inventory time series, as provided in accordance with the IPCC guidelines, for both level and trend assessment. Those developing country Parties that need flexibility in the light of their capacities with respect to this provision have the flexibility to instead provide, at a minimum, a qualitative discussion of uncertainty for key categories, using the IPCC guidelines, where quantitative input data are unavailable to quantitatively estimate uncertainties, and are encouraged to provide a quantitative estimate of uncertainty for all source and sink categories of the GHG inventory (Annex, paragraph 29).


Requirement*
To report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs, expressed in CO2 e.q., the 100-year time-horizon GWP values from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, or 100-year time-horizon GWP values from a subsequent IPCC assessment report as agreed upon by the CMA are to be used (Annex, paragraph 37)
Estimates of emissions and removals are to be reported for all categories, gases and carbon pools considered in the GHG inventory throughout the reported period on a gas- by-gas basis in units of mass at the most disaggregated level (Annex, paragraph 47) Gases to be reported (CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)) Developing countries needing flexibility in the light of their capacities shall report at least (CO2, CH4 and N2O) as well as any of the additional four gases (HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3) that are included in the Party's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), or have been previously reported (Annex, paragraph 48) If reporting HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3, the actual emissions of the gases must be reported, providing disaggregated data by chemical (e.g. HFC-134a) and category in units of mass and in CO2 eq (Annex, paragraph 49) Emissions must be reported for the following sectors: energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF and waste, in accordance with the IPCC guidelines referred to above (Annex, paragraph 50) Information should be provided on the following precursor gases: carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), as well as sulfur oxides. (Annex, paragraph 51)
Each Party shall report a consistent annual time series starting from 1990. Developing country Parties that need flexibility in the light of their capacities have the flexibility to instead report data covering, at a minimum the reference year/ period for a country's NDC under the Paris Agreement together with a consistent annual time series from at least 2020 onwards (Annex, paragraph 57) The latest reporting year shall be no more than two years prior to the submission of the country's national inventory report. For developing country Parties that need flexibility in the light of their capacities, the latest reporting year can be three years prior to the submission of their national inventory report. (Annex, paragraph 58)
Each Party shall elaborate an inventory QA/QC plan in accordance with the IPCC guidelines and shall implement and provide information on general inventory QC procedures, as well as should apply category-specific QC procedures for key categories and for those individual categories in which significant methodological changes and/or data revisions have occurred. In addition, Parties should implement QA procedures by conducting a basic expert peer review of their inventories in accordance with the IPCC guidelines. (see Annex II, paras 34-36)

* ""Shall"" language refers to a mandatory reporting element in accordance with the provisions of the MPGs. SOURCE: (UNFCCC, 2018)
6
The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for GHG inventory preparation, along with the 2019 Refinement thereof, provide methodological guidance for reporting across all categories of emissions and removals, including energy; industrial processes and product use; agriculture, land use, land use change and forestry; and waste. The guidelines provide three tiers of reporting, which are progressively more demanding in terms of data requirements and analytical complexity.
· Tier 1 provides for use of default emission factors and other parameters as provided in the IPCC guidelines. It also allows for simplifying assumptions about some carbon pools.
· Tier 2 generally uses similar methodological approach as Tier 1 but applies country-specific emission factors and other parameters, and a higher level of disaggregation.
· Tier 3 employs higher-order methods such as country-specific models and direct measurements.
Uncertainty generally reduces when moving from Tier 1 to Tier 3, providing the data is available to apply the higher tier methodologies. Accordingly, it is good practice to keep enhancing the GHG inventory over time, moving from lower to higher tier estimates. Countries can use different tiers for reporting against different emissions categories and/or regions, within the same inventory, as more data may be available in some categories, and/or regions, than others.


The information required for inventory preparation depends on the source/sink category and the reporting tier. In general, however, calculation requires activity data and emissions factors. Examples of activity data include tonnes of coal or fuel burned, tonnes of products produced, waste deposited in landfill or areas of land cleared. Emissions factors are used to convert activity data into GHG emissions, and are expressed as, for example, kg of CO2 per terajoule of fuel burned.
6.2 STOCKHOLM CONVENTION
The Stockholm Convention requires ""development and maintenance of source inventories and release estimates"", and provides guidance documents for preparation of inventories for a wide range of individual POPs. A toolkit is provided for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs (UNEP, 2013b). The possible source categories for POPs are listed in Table 6.

In terms of approaches to developing inventories of POPs, a similar approach is used to that of GHG and mercury inventories. Activities which give rise to POPs are identified, levels of activity are determined and the relevant emission factors applied. Examples of activity data includes ""unit per year of product manufactured"" (e.g., steel, sinter, cement, pulp, compost, etc.) and ""feed material processed"" (e.g., municipal waste, hazardous waste, coal, diesel fuel, bodies cremated, etc.)"" (UNEP, 2013b).

6.3 MINAMATA CONVENTION

Articles 8 and 9 of the Minamata Convention introduce an obligation for each Party to establish and maintain emissions and releases inventories of mercury. Preparation of the inventory is required to be done as soon as practicable and no later than five years after entry into force of the Convention, that is by 2022 (Minamata Convention, 2013). Methodological guidance for preparing emissions inventories is provided in the guidance document adopted by the COP, which refers to the Toolkit to support inventory preparation26 (Minamata Convention, 2017). The Convention requires that emissions should be calculated for the following point source categories:
· Coal-fired power plants; · Coal-fired industrial boilers; · Smelting and roasting processes used in the production of non-ferrous metals; · Waste incineration facilities; and · Cement clinker production facilities.
The methodological guidance for preparing inventories of emissions in line with the Minamata Convention allows for multiple approaches to be used in establishing national mercury emission inventories. Ideally, an inventory should be based on direct measurement for the point source emissions identified above. Where data is sparse, other indirect techniques, such as engineering estimates or mass balance calculations, can be used. The UNEP toolkit for identification and quantification of mercury releases27 can support inventory compilation where no local approaches are available. The guidance also highlights that Parties that have developed a pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR) covering several pollutants are likely to have included data about point source mercury emissions, which provides a source of information for collation of national mercury inventories. As for GHG inventories, a combination of approaches can be used by a country.

6.4 OPPORTUNITIES FOR STREAMLINING INVENTORIES

Table 7 shows the common activity data under the frameworks for POPs, Mercury and GHGs. It can be

seen that there is a high degree of overlap in terms of the sources and categories of emissions. In addition,

the required activity data is often very similar. What is not shown in the table is the underlying data and

information that is either required in inventory compilation or is used for further analysis and reporting.

This relates to, for example, the location, capacity and technology of industrial facilities and power plants.

Activity data for inventory compilation is often available disaggregated by facility or location and is then

aggregated for use in the inventory calculations. Estimating mercury emissions also requires process-specific information as mercury can be released at various processing stages. For example, coal washing and ash

collected via air pollution control technologies.

Table 7 highlights the benefit in aligning and streamlining data collection to support the development of the various inventories. Alignment of inventories will also provide additional information for reporting or developing policy and targeted actions to mitigate emissions of GHGs or chemicals. The benefits of aligned data collection include optimising resources for data collection, reducing uncertainty in the data across inventories, ensuring consistency across reporting frameworks, and reducing investment requirements in both data collection and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC). It is recognised, however, that the level of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) varies between frameworks. The UNFCCC QA/QC requirements for GHG inventories are rigorous and advanced. This is in part due to the fact that the methodologies to calculate GHG emissions from activity data are detailed and tiered, as described previously. The QA/QC process for GHG inventories submitted to the UNFCCC is also formalised, and according to MPG, Parties should implement QA procedures by conducting a basic expert peer review of their inventories in accordance with the IPCC guidelines. For the Toolkit for Identification and Quantification of Releases of Dioxins, Furans and Other Unintentional POPs, guidance is given on appropriate QA and QC considerations. However, as the underlying methodology is simpler (the application of default emission factors to each source category), QA/QC requirements are less onerous. For mercury emissions, the guidance documents recognise that there ""are significant deficiencies in the coverage and quality of data in some areas"" (UNEP, 2019e). Given the high-level nature of the methodology to estimate mercury releases, no detailed guidance on QA/QC is provided, nor is there a requirement for a formal QA/QC process.
7 CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER ACTION
Climate change is irreversible, with the level of future global warming and associated climate related risks that will be experienced in the future depending on future levels of GHGs. If emissions can be constrained, and net zero global CO2 emissions achieved by around 2050, the level of global warming can be stabilised. However, regardless of the levels of future emissions, the planet is already committed to a degree of global warming, and there will be long lasting changes to atmospheric composition, oceans, the cryosphere, and some level of sea level rise.
With a change in the global climate, comes the potential for increased mobilization of hazardous chemicals from both primary and secondary sources, as well as impacts on the fate and transport of chemicals ­ with a trend largely (but not always) towards greater mobility and movement. Such behaviors have already been observed.
· Mitigating GHG emissions and hence future global climate change is a high priority not only for reducing the impacts of climate change on the planet, but also due to the benefit of avoiding increased movement and impacts of hazardous chemicals. The interlinkages between the two issues presented in this report thus provide additional support to the case for mobilizing resources to combat climate change.
· Waste and wastewater management infrastructure and operations, mine waste sites, and industrial facilities need to be designed to be resilient to future climate impacts to prevent hazardous chemicals releases. Historical sites need to be evaluated to determine remediation requirements and retrofitting of infrastructure to make them resilient to climate change. Waste minimization should be pursued wherever possible, with waste disposal being the last and least preferred option.
· Planning for hazardous chemicals management needs to take into account current and future impacts of climate change, to minimize the potential risks. Accounting for climate change in managing industrial/disaster risks also requires consideration of transboundary impacts thereof, and hence opportunities for international cooperation.
The chemicals sector is a significant contributor to GHG emissions and releases of hazardous chemicals, and is currently highly integrated with the fossil fuels industry. Opportunities exist at all stages of the life cycle for minimizing releases, with life cycle assessment presenting an important tool in ensuring that improving performance in one part of the materials value chain does not result in unacceptable unintended consequences elsewhere in the value chain, or shifting of environmental burdens from one impact category to another.
· Circular economy and life cycle approaches to design of systems, process and product design have the potential to simultaneously reduce potential for GHG and hazardous chemical releases (as well as other negative environmental externalities) associated with provisioning of goods and services to meet societal needs.
· Mining and minerals processing operations, which provide raw material inputs for many chemical production processes as well as renewable energy and energy storage infrastructure, need to apply Best Available Technology/Best Environmental Practices (BAT/BEP) to ensure energy efficiency and minimization of releases hazardous chemicals. Renewable energy rather than fossil energy should be adopted where feasible in the mining sector to reduce GHG and hazardous chemicals releases, or fuel switching from coal to gas should be evaluated where renewables are not feasible, recognizing that gas is a transition fuel which is not compatible with a net zero world.
· Primary chemicals production and downstream industries also need to apply BAT/BEP, towards reducing energy inputs, avoiding releases of unintentional hazardous chemicals and GHG emissions and minimizing waste generation Where available, process and product changes to reduce productionrelated releases should be implemented. As with mining and minerals processing, renewable energy and fuel switching can result in further benefits.
· Reductions in primary releases of hazardous chemicals in the use phase can be achieved by researching, developing and adopting alternatives to hazardous pesticides and other agricultural practices such as implementing integrated pest management; by implementing ""Design-for-Environment"" principles for manufactured products and by using low hazard, low Global Warming Potential chemicals in applications such as flame retardants, foam blowing and electronics.
· Policy and management approaches that focus on the plastics issue are often focused on the plastic litter problem. Awareness is, however, growing about the negative impacts of plastics across their entire life cycles, including GHG and hazard considerations. Plastics policy and management approaches should also be expanded to take circular economy and life cycle considerations into account.

CHAPTER 7 Conclusions and further action

Plastics, WEEE, household waste and health care wastes, among other waste streams, all have potential for releases of GHG emissions and hazardous chemicals into the environment, both as a result of their chemical composition, and through management thereof. A wide range of treatment options, each with different GHG and hazardous chemicals emissions profiles, have been identified.

· Reducing demand for materials and circular economy approaches can help reduce waste generation across the economy.
· BAT/BEP, Basel Convention Technical Guidelines and ESM guidelines should be applied as appropriate to identify, design and implement appropriate technologies for management of different waste streams, towards limiting releases of both GHGs and hazardous chemicals. What is deemed appropriate and feasible will vary between locations.

There are numerous synergies between GHG and hazardous chemicals mitigation options. An understanding and communication of such opportunities can increase support for implementing mitigation opportunities. Trade-offs do, however, also exist, and understanding these allows for avoiding situations where mitigation of GHGs increases emissions of hazardous chemicals, or vice versa. Some examples of mitigation synergies and trade-offs include:

· Across all sectors and applications, adoption of BAT/BEP technologies and approaches, and

improving technologies and approaches over time, will help to minimize releases of both hazardous

chemicals and GHGs, and ultimately move towards being consistent with pathways aligned with

net zero CO2 emissions. · Coal is a substantial contributor to both GHGs and mercury emissions, as well as to releases of

other hazardous chemicals. Where feasible, reducing coal usage through a transition to low carbon

energy in the energy sector and to alternative industrial feedstocks will thus contribute substantially

to reducing GHGs, mercury and other hazardous chemical releases, with associated benefits for

air quality and public health.

· Shifting from other fossil fuels apart from coal to renewable energy will also contribute positively to

reducing GHG and hazardous chemical releases.

· Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) can result in significant reductions in carbon dioxide

emissions from both the energy and industrial sectors, and is considered to have an important role to

play in meeting global emission reduction targets, particularly in hard to decarbonize sectors. CCUS

can, however, have a significant energy penalty and hence lead to increased impacts associated

with energy supply to meet additional energy requirements. This should be taken into account when

evaluating these technologies.

· Chemical process efficiencies and shifts to alternative feedstocks and alternative products can

reduce both GHGs and hazardous chemicals. These should be sought out and implemented as

soon as possible.

· The cement sector is a significant emitter of both GHGs and hazardous chemicals, with a number of

opportunities for mitigation that are being pursued to varying extents around the world, that should

be supported. However, use of waste as fuel can result in increased hazardous chemicals releases

if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed.

· Production of metals from recycled material has significantly lower GHG emissions that from primary

processes and should be implemented where feasible. These processes can, however, release

hazardous chemicals if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed.

· Replacing mercury lights with LEDs reduces electricity demand, and reduces demand for mercury

and end-of-life management impacts of mercury containing lamps. Phasing out of mercury lamps

is thus desirable. However, LEDs do potentially contain other heavy metals, including nickel, lead

and arsenic, and so should also be properly managed at end-of-life.

· Biomass represents a low carbon energy source, although combustion of biomass can release

hazardous chemicals if BAT/BEP approaches are not followed. Furthermore, production and use

of biomass for bioenergy can have benefits and negative impacts linked to land degradation, food

insecurity, livelihoods and other environmental and sustainable development goals, with the impacts

being dependent on a range of context-specific considerations.

· Addressing artisanal and small-scale gold mining will reduce mercury exposure for mine workers

as well as emissions to the environment, while simultaneously addressing GHGs associated with

land clearing that typically accompanies these activities.

CHAPTER 7 Conclusions and further action

Finally, there are potential opportunities for streamlining development of GHG and hazardous chemical inventories given commonalities in the activity data required for calculation of emissions of a wide range of releases.
· Collection of data could be coordinated by establishing appropriate national and regional data management systems for common data. This will contribute to reducing data uncertainty, reducing personnel and other resource requirements and costs, and reduce areas of misalignment.
· Similarly, systems and processes for QA/QC can be coordinated between the different inventories, thereby reducing resources required for compilation.
During the course of the study it was highlighted that, although a wide range of information is available in the open literature on specific topics or regions, insufficient information is available to provide a full quantitative and coherent assessment of all the interlinkages between climate change and hazardous chemicals use and releases.
· There is a need for generation of further relevant information and data on the links between climate change and hazardous chemicals to be gathered through targeted studies in areas less comprehensively studied in the open literature. Examples of such areas include groundwater, freshwater systems, pesticide usage projections and desertification. A comprehensive needs assessment is required to identify specific R&D target areas.
This report presents a comprehensive technical review of the literature on report on climate change and hazardous chemicals management, towards identifying a set of opportunities for simultaneously addressing these two critical elements of the broader sustainability challenge. It is hoped that the information presented here will guide the development and implementation of cost-effective strategies, institutional capacity, enforcement mechanisms and other components of an enabling environment to address these issues at the global, regional, national and local levels, thereby supporting the concurrent implementation of the multitude of treaties that are already in place.

CHAPTER 7 Conclusions and further action

UNFCC-2020-8.txt,"United Nations Climate Change Annual Report 2019   Chapter Title Scope of this report This report encompasses the key achievements under the UNFCCC intergovernmental process and the activities of the secretariat, particularly the impacts of those activities in support of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. A note on terminology In this publication, ""UN Climate Change"" refers collectively to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC or Convention), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, and their bodies, institutional arrangements and organs, including the secretariat. Foreword by António Guterres United Nations Secretary-General  The year 2019 saw some evidence of increased ambition to address climate change, such as the commitments made at the United Nations Climate Action Summit convened in September, the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund and the many other activities covered in this report. But these steps were simply overwhelmed by two overarching realities: the continued intensification of the pattern of destruction and losses associated with climate change, and a lack of decisions on key elements of the Paris Agreement implementation guidance needed to fully unlock its potential.  the initiatives launched at the 2019 Summit, along with significant additional actions from State and non-State actors. Leaders are rightly focused on saving lives and livelihoods, and on easing the devastating economic and social impacts of COVID-19. But, as we strive to recover better, we must steer our world onto a more sustainable and inclusive path that tackles climate change, protects the environment, reverses biodiversity loss and ensures the long-term health and security of humankind.  The best available science from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the World Meteorological Organization and academic institutions continues to show that going beyond a 1.5 °C increase in average surface temperature will lead us to catastrophic disaster and extreme weather events. The United Nations Environment Programme's Emissions Gap Report 2019 warned that unless global greenhouse gas emissions fall by 7.6 per cent each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will not put itself on track towards the goals of the Paris Agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the postponement of COP 26 until 2021, but the climate emergency endures, and 2020 remains the year in which countries are slated to submit new or enhanced nationally determined contributions, in which mitigation and finance commitments made in past years will be assessed, and in which we need to start seeing tangible outcomes from  In that context, climate-related actions can help guide our recovery, from investing in green jobs and ending subsidies for fossil fuels, to avoiding bailouts for polluting industries and taking climate risks and opportunities into account in all financial and policy decisions. We are already seeing positive signals by a number of governments and businesses that are aligning stimulus packages with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I am stressing that we simply cannot go back to pre-COVID-19 assumptions and practices, and I am calling on major emitters in particular, to invest far more in a better, more sustainable future. The postponement of COP 26 must not mean the postponement of climate action. Countries must still, as a matter of urgency, raise ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance. That means setting a course to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. It means ending support for industries that have no place in our energy future, and which are no longer economically credible as   Foreword by António Guterres  the cost of renewable energy continues to plummet. It means creating the millions of jobs that are needed in the new sectors of sustainable growth: resilient infrastructure, clean mobility, net zero buildings, renewable energy, and zero deforestation food systems. It also means ensuring financing, beginning with the fulfilment of the mobilization of USD 100 billion per year for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. We cannot allow the heavy and rising debt burden of the most vulnerable countries and other developing countries to be a barrier to their ambitions.  This UNFCCC annual report sets out achievements as well as challenges to enhanced climate action. I hope that it will be a spur to the collective action we need at this pivotal moment. As we mark the seventy-fifth anniversary of the United Nations, international cooperation and multilateralism remain the only way forward. I trust that the UNFCCC membership and all stakeholders will work to recover better, together.  Message from Patricia Espinosa UNFCCC Executive Secretary  The COVID-19 outbreak began as we were preparing this annual report. When attempting to reflect on the past year, I could only think of the present and the future. As the world faces the pandemic and its implications for economies and societies, a significant climate change agenda lies ahead and must be a component of all post-pandemic recovery plans. As Secretary-General Guterres has said, we must take into consideration when designing and implementing such plans the need to turn recovery into an opportunity to promote a greener, safer and healthier future for all. The UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement provide, together with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a solid foundation for such recovery. The transparency arrangements under the Convention and the Paris Agreement represent the gold standard for greenhouse gas emission reporting, and UNFCCC institutions and workstreams constitute the most comprehensive set of arrangements in the world for facilitating efforts by governments and nongovernmental actors to address climate change. At COP 24 in Katowice in 2018, governments adopted the rules for the Paris Agreement, the toolbox for its full implementation. Action happening around the world demonstrates that these tools are useful: 186 Parties have submitted their first nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, more than 90 countries are preparing national adaptation plans, the clean development mechanism has facilitated more than 8,000 emission reduction projects, the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action is catalysing a new era of ambition among non-Party stakeholders, and more than 17,000 actors have shared their projects on the NAZCA global climate action portal. An incredible amount of work remains. We have a climate  emergency. Despite progress, never has the gap between climate reality and climate action been wider; never has the divide between the global climate negotiations and the demands of society, in particular youth, been deeper. This is not subjective; it's a fact ­ one consistently backed by scientific evidence and civil society voices. And this is understood by millions of people around the world, who are becoming increasingly frustrated with the pace of change and demanding that leaders do more to reduce emissions. Unfortunately, owing to COVID-19, many UNFCCC meetings, including SB 52 and COP 26, cannot take place as planned in 2020. The secretariat has nonetheless adapted to the limitations and impacts imposed by the pandemic to ensure continuity in the crucial work on climate change. We are committed to continuing to innovate in supporting our Parties and stakeholders. 2020 must still be the year of ambition and implementation. Parties will be submitting new or revised nationally determined contributions, which must be highly ambitious if we are to succeed in holding global temperature increase below 1.5 °C. We must turn the global recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak into an opportunity, and nationally determined contributions can help the world to ""recover better"". Climate change is threatening the survival of humanity. But addressing global challenges like COVID-19 can give us the strength to stay on the path of multilateralism and collective action: no group or nation can do it alone ­ we have to work together. We look forward to working with the current and incoming COP Presidencies ­ Chile, and the United Kingdom in partnership with Italy ­ and all other Parties and stakeholders to ensure continuity in our urgent work ahead.   CLIMATE CHANGE A PLANETARY EMERGENCY   Chapter I | Climate change: a planetary emergency  The world's climate is changing at an unprecedented pace. Since the industrial revolution, humans have been emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thus changing the planet's climatic balance. Today these gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and the ocean. According to the IPCC, a 1.5 °C increase in global average surface temperature is a limit beyond which climate change will have devastating consequences. Climate change is inherently global. Greenhouse gases affect climate around the world, no matter where or by whom they are emitted. Many human activities are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, including the production and consumption of energy and the clearing of forests to create fields. By disrupting economies, livelihoods and the ecosystems on which we all depend, climate change threatens current and future generations. Climate change affects everyone, but those who suffer the most ­ the poorest and most vulnerable people in every society ­ are the least likely to have the means to adapt to its impacts. We are collectively responsible for addressing climate change. We must accelerate the pace and increase the scale of our response, and make this coming decade one of global action on climate change.  The world today is 1.1 °C warmer than in pre-industrial times. The consequences of this warming are enormous, as seen in the increase in intense floods and fires and extreme weather events of the past decade. Rising sea levels, retreating ice caps and dying coral are the most visible impacts of a warming planet. Just as humans suffer from extreme change, so do ecosystems. Temperatures have risen so quickly that myriad species, already weakened by habitat loss or pesticide overuse, cannot adapt to new conditions quickly enough. The United Nations estimates that 1 million species are on the brink of extinction owing to human activity. Climate change is contributing to the massive loss of animal, insect and plant species and the spread of diseases to higher latitudes. We need to alter our course before it is too late. We need to make drastic changes to the way we produce, consume and source our energy. We need to protect ecosystems so that they stay healthy and resilient against climatic stresses. And we need to accept that while we might not yet understand the full extent of future changes to the climate, there is enough scientific certainty to warrant sweeping action, particularly when faced with the threat of large-scale and irreversible damage. Fighting climate change is also crucial to sustainable development. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which include climate action (Goal 13), are shared by all 193 Member States of the United Nations and reflect humanity's highest aspirations for development.   Chapter II | Who we are  The UNFCCC secretariat, also known as UN Climate Change, is the United Nations entity supporting the global response to climate change. Preventing dangerous human interference with the climate system is the ultimate objective of the Convention. The secretariat empowers governments, organizations, businesses and individuals to achieve this objective and build a climate-neutral, climate-resilient world. The well-being of humanity and sustainable development are at the heart of climate action. The UNFCCC has near universal membership (197 Parties) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris Agreement, whose aim is to keep the global average temperature rise this century below 2 °C, or preferably 1.5 °C, above pre-industrial levels. It is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and its Doha Amendment, adopted in 2012. The secretariat is located in Bonn, Germany. Its 390 staff, who come from over 100 countries, represent diverse cultures and have varied professional backgrounds. Since 2016, the secretariat has been led by Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa. While the secretariat in its early years focused on facilitating intergovernmental climate negotiations, today it supports a complex architecture that serves to advance the implementation of the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.  The secretariat plays a crucial role in putting into practice the transparency and accountability arrangements for climate change reporting. Transparency and accountability foster trust for implementation. The secretariat works with countries on building technical expertise and capacity, developing national climate change plans and strategies both on mitigation and adaptation, facilitating access to finance, sharing knowledge and technology, and operating the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. It also provides legal oversight for the implementation of the Convention and policymaking support. The secretariat convenes and mobilizes thousands of stakeholders and coalitions and provides a forum for designing science-based climate policies and programmes. The secretariat generally organizes a minimum of two negotiating sessions each year. The main session, where the COP, the CMP and the CMA meet, is held in November or December each year. In addition to these conference sessions, throughout the year the secretariat organizes many meetings and workshops for the constituted bodies and expert groups that it serves.  Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the UNFCCC  The secretariat was established in 1992, when countries adopted the Convention. Two years later, the Convention entered into force, and the first COP was held in March/April 1995. Among the successes of the Convention has been the creation of a set of international rules, guidelines and institutions to help countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to climate change. Great strides have been made in building resilience to climate change, as well as in leveraging policy, technology, knowledge and funds to fight its devastating impacts. Thanks to the efforts of Parties, technical experts, scientists and other stakeholders, the UNFCCC has built a robust framework for global climate action and mechanisms for reporting on national commitments. The potential for ramping up ambition is in place. To celebrate this milestone in international climate policy, an event, ""25 Years of the UNFCCC"", was held on the margins of the United Nations Climate Action Summit in September 2019. The celebratory event showcased the work done by Parties and stakeholders on climate change.  The last 25 years have been a time of challenges and opportunities, with disappointments matched by some incredible successes. Responding to climate change with global collaboration  Climate change affects all aspects of human life and life on the planet. Because nearly all human activities contribute to it, climate change is interconnected with many other global challenges and the responses to them. Cooperation between the secretariat, international organizations and other stakeholders ensures common direction, increases the efficiency of these responses and avoids solutions in one area becoming problems in another. The UNFCCC collaborates with numerous United Nations organizations to pool resources and convening power. The United Nations and other international organizations collaborate to provide expertise and technical and financial support to Parties so that they may effectively implement the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, as well as other global agendas.  The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and other global agendas has increased the need for close cooperation and coordination within the United Nations system as their means of implementation are interlinked. The secretariat helps countries to enhance their climate efforts, and thus contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, thereby making a real difference in communities around the world. The secretariat strives to amplify the voices of indigenous peoples and women, who, for different reasons, are at the forefront of the fight against climate change but are often left out of decision-making processes. The secretariat also mobilizes non-State actors as well as individuals through, among other initiatives, the technical examination process, the Nairobi work programme, Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action and Climate Neutral Now.  Chapter III | The year in review Strengthening action and mobilizing support  In a typical year, the UNFCCC, through its constituted bodies, mechanisms and work programmes, strengthens mitigation and adaptation action and mobilizes support. In parallel, countries conduct negotiations to refine the international rules for climate action. The year's work culminates in the COP, where Parties adopt decisions and guide further work. The global climate effort also moves forward at major  conferences connected to work under the UNFCCC thanks to the scientific community and the community of global climate stakeholders. This section outlines how the secretariat's programmes of work advanced and intersected to move us towards our common goals, and describes the efforts by the secretariat in 2019 to streamline its operations and to better prepare for the challenges ahead.  Mitigation Never have we needed to step up action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as much as today. Guided by the need for greater global collaboration and transparency in combating climate change, the secretariat supports all Parties in their efforts to measure and assess emission levels, reduce emissions and design ambitious targets for keeping the temperature rise below 1.5 °C.  Preparing nationally determined contributions In 2019, the secretariat helped countries prepare new or updated nationally determined contributions to be submitted in 2020. It did this by organizing regional expert workshops for the Caribbean and the Pacific, attended by 60 experts, and three regional dialogues ­ in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean ­ in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme. The events served as a platform for countries to exchange experience and lessons learned in preparing nationally determined contributions and to identify needs for technical support for doing so. The secretariat also provided advice and direction to the NDC Partnership and to the United Nations Development Programme and other United Nations agencies on enhancing and implementing nationally determined contributions.  making steady progress in conserving and protecting forests and are starting to reap numerous benefits ­ financial as well as environmental. Since 2014, the secretariat has assessed the progress of 45 developing countries in tackling deforestation. On the basis of their success, four countries have been granted financing amounting to USD 229 million from the Green Climate Fund. Seven countries assessed their forest levels with the support of the secretariat and published on the Lima REDD+ Information Hub their results in avoiding carbon dioxide emissions through reduced deforestation and forest degradation and through forest conservation. Over the past seven years, the emission of 6.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide has been avoided through forest conservation.  Conserving forests for the climate Forests are a carbon sink, so forest conservation is a major contributor to reducing net carbon emissions. While deforestation continues to be a significant global challenge, countries engaged in REDD+ activities are  Preparing Parties for a new international framework for reporting The enhanced transparency framework established under Article 13 of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and further developed in the Katowice climate package in   2018 is an important vehicle for tracking, through the submission and review of biennial transparency reports, the progress of Parties on their nationally determined contributions, as well as for tracking support. The framework informs the global stocktake ­ a periodic review of the implementation of the Paris Agreement aiming to assess collective progress in achieving the purpose and goals of the Agreement ­ and is a key mechanism for enabling higher ambition by all Parties. The foundations on which Parties are preparing for the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement are the Convention processes of international consultation and analysis and international assessment and review, for biennial update reports. In 2019, the secretariat launched efforts to help Parties prepare to implement the enhanced transparency framework. The Consultative Group of Experts, with the support of the secretariat, developed the Technical handbook for developing country Parties on preparing for implementation of the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement for this purpose. In addition, the secretariat compiled frequently asked questions on the operationalization of the enhanced transparency framework. Supporting countries in reporting In 2019, the secretariat processed national communications from 20 developing countries (including the first national communications from two of the least developed countries), biennial update reports from 24 developing countries and national inventory reports from 10 developing countries. By December 2019, a total of 30 developing countries had submitted national inventory reports and 55 had submitted biennial update reports. Assessing the impact of the implementation of response measures In 2019, the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures held its first two meetings, established its rules of procedure, and made recommendations on analysing the positive and negative impacts of the implementation of response measures. In 2019, the secretariat supported Parties in raising awareness about existing tools for assessing such impacts, and in maximizing positive and minimizing negative impacts. This enabled significant improvements in knowledge among the 150 participants in those two meetings.  UNFCCC technical support for reporting and transparency In 2019, the secretariat provided technical support to Parties in the following areas: > Implementing the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement > Designing institutional arrangements to support measurement, reporting and verification > Preparing national communications and biennial update reports The secretariat also: > Provided guidance to facilitate the clarity and transparency of nationally determined contributions > Facilitated knowledge-sharing and the exchange of lessons learned by countries in preparing nationally determined contributions > Produced training materials, including a workbook on national greenhouse gas inventories aimed at small island developing States and the least developed countries Expert training support by the secretariat focused on: > Publishing a greenhouse gas data report > Institutionalizing data management for national greenhouse gas inventories > Developing sustainable national greenhouse gas inventory management systems > Using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories > Implementing quality assurance of greenhouse gas inventories and building sustainable national systems > Reviewing and analysing greenhouse gas inventories, national communications, biennial reports and biennial update reports > Developing methodologies for constructing greenhouse gas baselines and monitoring emissions from transport > Conducting technical analyses of the biennial update reports of developing countries  Adaptation Greater efforts are required to adapt to the impacts of climate change and to protect people and the planet. The UNFCCC interacts with governments and partners in searching for ways to increase developing countries' capacity to adapt. This year in adaptation was marked by the secretariat's provision of support to countries for developing their national adaptation plans, the work of the Adaptation Committee on climate finance, the enhancement of partnerships under the Nairobi work programme and the work on comprehensive risk management under the Warsaw International Mechanism.  Supporting countries in developing national adaptation plans In 2019, the Least Developed Countries Expert Group began assisting those least developed countries that face challenges in formulating national adaptation plans. It worked with 18 least developed countries through the Open NAP initiative, which helps countries produce their first plan by 2020 or soon after. The participation of the Green Climate Fund and various United Nations organizations has provided a strong foundation for this initiative. The technical support provided by the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and partners to improve access by countries to the Green Climate Fund for preparing their national adaptation plans has yielded positive outcomes. Also jointly supported by the secretariat and the Expert Group, more than 130 developing countries and almost all of the least developed countries are taking steps to prepare national adaptation plans, and more than 70 countries are at various stages of accessing the Green Climate Fund's readiness support for this purpose. Five countries submitted completed national adaptation plans in 2019. Financing for adaptation The Adaptation Committee in 2019 stepped up its work on financing for adaptation. This work included conducting the technical examination process on adaptation, which focused on adaptation finance, including from the private sector, and seeking input from Parties to identify capacity-building needs in accessing funding. The secretariat supported this work on financing adaptation by preparing technical and strategic background papers and by assisting the  Committee in showcasing progress. To allow the Adaptation Committee to maintain its high impact in the face of decreasing financial resources, the secretariat facilitates the Committee's communications and outreach activities, building on existing partnerships, including those under the Nairobi work programme. Adaptation events in 2019 > NAP Expo 2019, held in Songdo, Republic of Korea, brought together over 400 participants and 30 organizations and programmes on the topic of raising adaptation ambition by advancing national adaptation plans. During the Expo, more than 100 Green Climate Fund secretariat staff assisted country teams with their national adaptation plans. A technical session was held under the Nairobi work programme on how to use metrics and indicators for measuring the adaptation progress of vulnerable communities, groups and ecosystems. > The 2019 Adaptation Forum, also held in Songdo, focused on engaging the private sector in adaptation planning processes, including national adaptation plans. The outcomes of the Forum were published in an online report and an outreach document. > The Adaptation Committee held an event to launch its flagship report 25 Years of Adaptation Under the UNFCCC, which offered a comprehensive overview of the adaptation architecture and its evolution under the UNFCCC since 1994. The event also featured other constituted bodies reflecting on the progress on adaptation to date, and on ways to build on that progress.  Transforming knowledge into action The Nairobi work programme is the UNFCCC knowledge-to-action hub for adaptation and resilience. Under the programme, nearly 400 partners with diverse knowledge and expertise work to close knowledge gaps and meet needs for adaptation. In 2019, new alliances were formed under the Nairobi work programme with regional academic institutions, organizations and networks to help address knowledge gaps in the Andean subregion, Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Hindu Kush Himalayan subregion, Indian Ocean island countries and the North Africa subregion. A paper on existing knowledge and knowledge gaps in the area of oceans and adaptation was co-produced with a specialized group of experts under the work programme. Partnering to reduce disaster risk In 2019, the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism focused on developing comprehensive risk management approaches to  building the long-term resilience of countries, vulnerable populations and communities. The Executive Committee established a technical expert group with several aims related to comprehensive risk management: enhancing the coherence of efforts, mobilizing further support in 2020­2021 and identifying capacity-building needs. The Executive Committee also updated a compendium on comprehensive risk management for practitioners and policymakers. The secretariat partnered with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction to promote coherence between adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The partnership involved conducting regional workshops and providing support to countries that are co-producing plans for adaptation and disaster risk management. This work will continue in 2020, with plans to expand direct support to at least 20 countries. A partnership with the Group on Earth Observations was also established; one of its objectives is to explore the application of remote sensing to adaptation assessment and implementation.

Natura Cosmetics is a winner of the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards for its work to measure and reduce emissions across its value chain, from the extraction of raw materials to the production and distribution of its products.  18 Climate finance Ensuring quick access to adequate finance that supports countries in tackling climate change is essential. Economists have warned that inaction will be far costlier than action in the long term.  The secretariat supported negotiations on a wide range of climate finance topics throughout 2019 and continued to assist developing countries in assessing the priority of their adaptation, mitigation, capacity-building and financial needs through the Needsbased Finance project. The Standing Committee on Finance, with support from the secretariat, continued its work on preparing the technical report on the Fourth Biennial Assessment and Overview of Climate Finance Flows, and initiated  work on the first-ever report on determination of the needs of developing country Parties, agreeing on the outline of the report and strategic outreach activities related to it. The Committee also convened its 2019 Forum, the topic of which was climate finance and sustainable cities. Over 130 participants attended the Forum to share their insights; participants represented municipal and national governments, global city networks, financial institutions, bilateral agencies, international organizations, United Nations agencies, think tanks and civil society.  Photo by Jason Mulikita for REEEP  Accessibility of low-cost technology for renewable energy and energy efficiency is key to achieving transformation in developing countries and emerging markets. The Beyond the Grid Fund is a winner of the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards for its work on helping create a viable, risk-free market environment for investors and businesses in Zambia.   Technology Innovation in technologies that can be applied to improving climate resilience and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is key to achieving the purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement. Access to these technologies, in terms of both transfer and finance, is also key.  In 2019, the secretariat continued to work with the Technology Executive Committee on identifying policy options, practices and technologies with high mitigation potential and on producing recommendations for ways to move forward with mitigation. Technology needs assessments by developing countries are an important source of information on climate action. The technology support and implementation unit of the secretariat continued to support climate action in developing countries and to share success stories through its events and  brochures, as well as its climate technology projects database, which lists more than 50 projects supported by the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment Facility or the Climate Technology Centre and Network. The Climate Technology Centre and Network fulfilled 63 requests for technical assistance from developing countries. Other activities of the Centre included conducting knowledge-sharing workshops, providing support to local innovation projects, facilitating networking and assisting in technology needs assessments.

Electricians without Borders is a winner of the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards for its work in helping countries make vital health infrastructure more resilient to disasters, while mitigating climate change. 20 UN Climate Change | Annual Report 2019   Capacity-building  The UNFCCC capacity-building efforts are at the heart of its work on adaptation, mitigation, technology and climate finance. In 2019, the secretariat focused on improving its capacity-building activities through better coordination, systemic planning and continuous evaluation.  In 2019, the Paris Committee on Capacity-building made great strides in improving the coordination of capacity-building activities among various stakeholders; providing technical guidance; building climate change related capacity; and boosting awareness-raising, outreach and knowledge-sharing. The Committee also compiled and summarized problems, constraints, lessons learned and needs related to reporting by developing country Parties. The capacity-building activities conducted in 2019 were guided by the Strategic Plan for Stakeholder Engagement, Communications and Resource Mobilization and built on past experience on capacity-building to yield results across all UNFCCC work areas. The Paris Committee on Capacity-building Network forms a central part of the efforts under this strategic plan.  > A technical workshop on gender capacity-building for the constituted bodies, which resulted in the development and endorsement of a gender mainstreaming standard for the Paris Committee on Capacity-building > Three workshops on agriculture and climate change held under the Koronivia joint work on agriculture > Various technical workshops and events that fostered cooperation and the exchange of information and best practices among international organizations and Parties on emerging law and policy issues and gaps under the Paris Agreement Improving through continuous evaluation  Examples of capacity-building activities organized by the secretariat include: > The 8th Durban Forum, which focused on strengthening the support of scientific institutions on the implementation of nationally determined contributions in developing countries and led to regional capacity-building events in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific  Gathering feedback and using it to improve activities and services was an indispensable part of the secretariat's capacity-building efforts in 2019. Ex post assessment of meetings and online surveys were used to gather feedback. The findings suggested using partnerships to address financial and institutional barriers and implementing a systemic approach to avoid the duplication and reduce the fragmentation of capacity-building efforts.  Carbon markets  The clean development mechanism enables governments, organizations, businesses and individuals to buy carbon credits from projects that reduce carbon dioxide emissions, thus lowering their carbon footprint. Carbon markets enable both the financing of clean development and reductions in emissions while implementing new solutions and technologies continues to pave the way for a full transition to a net zero carbon world.  The clean development mechanism continued to deliver results throughout 2019. Its Executive Board held four meetings, while the Methodologies Panel and Accreditation Panel each organized three meetings. A number of Parties implemented policies that use the clean development mechanism to meet emission reduction targets. The public can also contribute to reducing its carbon footprint: individuals and corporations can access the voluntary cancellation platform, an e-commerce service of the clean development mechanism registry, to offset their own emissions or support clean development mechanism projects. In 2019, a total of 95 participants attended the twentieth meeting of the Designated National Authorities Forum to learn about the clean development mechanism, climate finance and regional support available, and to exchange views on regional collaboration, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and the roles of designated national authorities.  Since COP 22 in 2016, the secretariat has supported jurisdictions considering carbon pricing. The Collaborative Instruments for Ambitious Climate Action initiative applies participatory processes and conducts studies and workshops on carbon pricing to help institutions gain the knowledge and capacity they need to tackle climate change. In 2019, the initiative concluded its first phase, during which it supported 18 jurisdictions on four continents. As a result, in 2019, Panama finalized its guidelines for its registry of greenhouse gas emissions, the Dominican Republic validated its first study on the potential for domestic carbon pricing and Pakistan launched its new national committee on carbon markets at COP 25. To support climate action in international aviation, the secretariat engaged with the International Civil Aviation Organization secretariat to exchange information on mechanisms established under the Kyoto Protocol and work under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and other developments under the UNFCCC, so as to assist in development and implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.  COP 25  COP 25 was held in Madrid under the Presidency of Chile. Moving the COP from Santiago to Madrid Moving COP 25 from Santiago to Madrid in less than one month was immensely challenging. Nevertheless, thanks to the tireless collaboration of the Governments of Spain and Chile, the secretariat and the operator of the IFEMA ­ Feria de Madrid venue, as well as to the solidarity, support and resources of Parties, the conference started on schedule. In order to make the COP happen, the secretariat carried out a practically endless list of tasks under extreme pressure, including: > Coordinate the work of numerous vendors for the fit-out of the new venue > Set up plenary halls, pavilions and meeting rooms > Make security arrangements > Install audiovisual equipment > Redo protocol arrangements > Reroute shipments from Santiago to Madrid > Rebook travel and hotels for staff > Reconfirm attendance, side events and exhibits > Rearrange catering and banking services > Rerun the accreditation process for local non-governmental organizations > Recruit and train new local staff and volunteers > Facilitate local transport Key outcomes of COP 25 COP 25 ended with key achievements in adaptation, mitigation and climate finance, including decisions that support research, innovation and collaboration in the areas of agriculture, capacity-building, coastal areas, ecosystems, oceans and technology. At the COP, the Technology Executive Committee approved its four-year workplan ­ which has a special focus on gender mainstreaming ­ for implementing the technology framework adopted at COP 24 in Katowice. Parties agreed to the six-year workplan (2020­2025) of the forum on the impact of the  implementation of response measures and the Katowice Committee of Experts on the Impacts of the Implementation of Response Measures. COP 25 brought gender equality and the empowerment of women to the fore by adopting the enhanced Lima work programme on gender and its five-year gender action plan (2020­2024), and gave indigenous peoples a stronger voice through the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, finalizing its two-year workplan (2020­2021). In response to the continued need of countries for capacity-building, Parties at COP 25 extended the work of the Paris Committee on Capacity-building until 2024. In a key decision, Parties agreed on a second periodic review in 2020­2022. The review will enhance Parties' understanding of the long-term goal and scenarios, and assess the aggregate effect of steps by Parties towards the goal. The COP also concluded its work on the pre-2020 stocktake and agreed to hold a round table to inform the second periodic review. The COP 25 Presidency, supported by the secretariat's communication efforts with governments and international agencies, pushed for greater ambition on climate action, encouraging nations to review and enhance their nationally determined contributions. As a result, 121 Parties, 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors joined the Climate Ambition Alliance, committing to working towards net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, and 114 nations pledged to enhance their climate action plans in 2020. Continuing work on carbon market and non-market approaches Despite Parties falling short of agreeing on issues related to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement and on the launch of cooperative instruments ­ essential tools for enhancing the efficiency of mitigation efforts and increasing finance for adaptation ­ most technical issues relating to the market-based and non-market approaches under Article 6 were resolved in 2019. COP 26 will be tasked with sealing the deal on Article 6.   Chapter III | The year in review  Key events at COP 25 The secretariat supported the Presidencies of COP 24 and COP 25 with the preparatory and intergovernmental meetings held in the lead-up to and during the conference, allowing hundreds of representatives of governments, civil society, academia and business to take part in a wide range of events, including: > The highly successful Capacity-building Hub, co-organized by the Paris Committee on Capacity-building and 65 partners > A high-level leadership dialogue on turning the tide on deforestation, at which seven heads of United Nations organizations discussed the importance of forests for mitigating climate change and ways of collaborating to slow deforestation > A high-level meeting of the Nairobi Work Programme on the topic of oceans, coastal areas and ecosystems > A forum on climate finance strategies for the implementation of nationally determined contributions, which was attended by ministers and senior officials involved in the Needs-based Finance project > A ministerial high-level event on Action for Climate Empowerment, organized by the secretariat in partnership with the Governments of Chile and Spain, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization, and the members of the United Nations Alliance on Climate Change Education, Training and Public Awareness > An event convened by the Adaptation Committee and partners celebrating indigenous and local adaptation to a changing climate > An event convened by the Warsaw International Mechanism task force on displacement, which showcased the second phase of the task force's work on integrated approaches to averting, minimizing and addressing displacement related to the adverse effects of climate change A space for youth Powerful youth movements galvanized action in 2019 like never before. Connected, informed and with their future at stake, young people are at the forefront of climate action. COP 25 gave youth a space for creative expression through the screening of the winners of the fifth Global Youth Video Competition. Over 400 videos were received from 114 countries, showcasing young people's inspiring climate actions. The three winners in 2019 were Callie Broaddus, United States of America, for her film ""Reserva: The Youth Land Trust""; Raquel Gaião Silva, Portugal, for her film ""Ocean Alive""; and Rafael Forsetto and Kiane Assis, Brazil, for their film, ""What Is Agroecology?""

Conference participants sampled plant-based and nature-friendly food and drinks provided by Impossible Foods and Thai­German culinary start-up Whapow. Innovation consultancy Innosensi offered participants a multi-sensory dining experience ­ ""From root to flower"" ­ to demonstrate first-hand the concept of sustainable and waste-free dining.  COP 25 sustainable food initiative Sustainable practices in the food industry and climate-friendly dietary habits are essential to achieving the purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, the secretariat convened several key events to focus the world's attention on food system transformation. At the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, the secretariat hosted an expert panel followed by tasting experiences to foster discussion on climate change and sustainable diets and to showcase innovative climate-friendly food products. At COP 25, an event on innovation in food systems convened world experts to present the latest efforts to integrate food into climate solutions.  The demand for sustainable and healthy food options at UNFCCC conferences was confirmed by a survey organized by the secretariat after COP 25. In 2019, moving the COP from Chile to Madrid in a very short time imposed logistical limitations. Nevertheless, efforts were made to offer balanced and climate-friendly catering options, to ensure sustainable transport of food, and to reduce food waste. The secretariat remains committed to responding to such demand in future conferences, and will engage with all countries and stakeholders to facilitate global efforts towards more sustainable food systems.  Pursuing ambition  Supporting the COP 25 Presidency In the context of the vision of the COP 25 Presidency to raise ambition while balancing mitigation and adaptation, the secretariat supported a wealth of initiatives, including five high-level ministerial events to raise ambition and engage sectors such as agriculture, energy, finance and science. Additionally, the secretariat provided support to the ministerial dialogue on adaptation ambition organized by the Presidency and two other events pertaining to pre-2020 implementation and ambition as well as global climate action. United Nations Climate Action Summit The secretariat provided significant support to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the COP 25 Presidency for the United Nations Climate Action Summit. The Summit culminated in the widely joined Climate Ambition Alliance, which gained further members at COP 25. Across the nine tracks of the summit, 40 initiatives were launched to build and sustain momentum and showcase how the real economy is moving towards net zero by 2050. The initiatives were led by 22 institutions from the United Nations family and brought together 80 supporting institutions from a wide range of stakeholders ­ public and private institutions, government and civil society. After the Summit, the initiatives were documented on the UNFCCC NAZCA Platform and in the Report of the Secretary-General on the 2019 Climate Action Summit.  Ahead of the Summit, the secretariat issued the publication Climate action and support trends ­ a summary and analysis of climate action based on national reports submitted under the UNFCCC process ­ and co-authored with the United Nations Development Programme the publication The Heat Is On: Taking Stock of Global Climate Ambition ­ a detailed review of nationally determined contributions. Regional climate weeks Regional climate weeks offer a unique opportunity to keep capacity-building at the heart of the climate dialogue. In 2019, the UNFCCC held three regional climate weeks: Africa Climate Week in Accra, Ghana; Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week in Salvador, Brazil; and Asia-Pacific Climate Week in Bangkok, Thailand. They brought together more than 10,000 participants from national governments, cities, municipalities, academia and civil society and chief executive officers of corporations, to address the climate emergency. Almost 100 regional and international organizations conducted workshops, thematic sessions and side events at the regional climate weeks. The events represented more than 600 hours of discussion on best practices for national climate plans, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and global climate action. Each climate week delivered key messages to the United Nations Climate Action Summit on solutions for regional challenges.   Strengthening the science-policy interface  Believing in the power of science-based decision-making, the secretariat works to ensure that Parties are kept abreast of the latest scientific research.  The science and review team of the secretariat engaged with the scientific community, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization, in supporting the  national adaptation plan process, providing evidence to feed into high-level dialogues and informing the work of the UNFCCC constituted bodies.  Scientific publications in 2019 The IPCC produced two special reports in 2019: Special Report on Climate Change and Land and Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. It also refined the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to help countries improve their inventories. The World Meteorological Organization's key findings of the 2018 Statement on the State of the Global Climate were presented at COP 25. The Statement provides an overview of the global climate and highlights significant weather and climate trends as well as global and regional weather events.  If all existing international and local initiatives deliver on their goals, we would be able to limit global warming to 2 °C by 2030. A significant gap would still remain to achieve the 1.5 °C goal. More action is needed, now.  Earth observation: a powerful tool for climate science The 2019 Earth Information Day, held at COP 25, provided Parties and other stakeholders with an up-to-date picture of the state of the global climate, updates on the implementation of Earth observation and an outlook on how systematic Earth observation can inform policy, support risk assessment and guide decision-making on adaptation and mitigation. Placing science at the forefront of the global climate effort Joining forces with the IPCC, the UNFCCC co-organized events for policymakers aimed at providing them with a better understanding of the latest climate change science, including the IPCC's two special reports published in 2019.  Mobilizing stakeholders and extending partnerships and outreach Climate change is a global threat that requires a global response from all sectors of society. No nation can tackle climate change on its own, and no government can realize the full potential of its national climate change commitments without the contribution of businesses, not-for-profit organizations, multilateral organizations and citizens. In 2019, the secretariat stepped up its work on mobilizing and partnering with a wide variety of individuals and organizations with the aim of raising global ­ and local ­ climate ambition.  Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action The Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action was launched at COP 22 in 2016. The Partnership aims to encourage collaborations among State and non-State actors ­ international coalitions, initiatives, businesses and organizations ­ in mobilizing resources to lower emissions and increase resilience to the impacts of climate change. The key outcomes of the Partnership in 2019 were: > The publication of the Yearbook on Global Climate Action, an assessment of actions taken by regions, cities, businesses and civil society showing how individual action is instrumental in moving the world forward in closing the emissions gap > The development of a set of Climate Action Pathways that suggest a vision for 2050 as well as transformational actions and milestones for 2020, 2030 and 2050 on the path to full implementation of the Paris Agreement in key thematic areas such as energy, industry, transport, human settlements, water, land use and resilience to the effects of climate change. The pathways present a forward-looking approach to Parties and non-Party stakeholders working together in each thematic area > An increase in the number of non-State actor announcements of action in the global climate action portal (NAZCA) to over 20,000 > The organization of dedicated climate action tracks at the regional climate weeks to both highlight opportunities and identify recommendations for the United Nations Climate Action Summit  Our partners are good examples of cooperation to drive change towards and collectively strive for a climate-neutral world. Ovais Sarmad, UNFCCC Deputy Executive Secretary   Climate Neutral Now Climate Neutral Now is an initiative aimed at engaging organizations, companies and individuals in becoming carbon-neutral. In 2019, Climate Neutral Now attracted 239 new signatories, bringing the total to 355. New partners, such as the Development and Climate Alliance from Germany, Real Betis Balompié football club from Spain and Doconomy, a Swedish fintech company, are leading the fight for a carbon-neutral future and are encouraging others to follow. A number of government-led projects in Australia, Europe and Latin America fall under Climate Neutral Now, and private companies and several sectoral organizations, including in the events, travel and tourism sector, are also involved in the initiative. An external evaluation of the initiative revealed it to be a strong tool for promoting climate action, including through the use of certified emission reductions under the clean development mechanism. Climate Neutral Now is seen as an established brand recognized by many stakeholders. The initiative has been instrumental in developing the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action and the Sports for Climate Action Framework. Advocating for high-level action The COP 25 high-level champions for climate action ­ Tomasz Chruszczow from Poland and Gonzalo Muñoz Abogabir from Chile ­ engaged with Parties and non-Party stakeholders to encourage them to maximize their contribution to the UNFCCC process. By the end of 2019, the champions had taken part in approximately 200 meetings and speaking engagements, guided the activities of the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action, including development of the Yearbook on Global Climate Action and the Climate Action Pathways, and helped shape the inputs of non-Party stakeholders to the United Nations Climate Action Summit. Generating momentum for change The secretariat's Momentum for Change initiative ­ which recognizes solutions to climate change that also address wider economic, social and environmental challenges ­ shines a light on global climate action by citizens, organizations, businesses, schools and governments. In 2019, under the initiative 670 entries for the United Nations Global Climate Action Awards were received and the 15 most innovative and impactful actions worldwide were selected in four focus areas.  Mobilizing financiers  Art for climate  During 2019, the secretariat provided coordination services to the International Finance Corporation's Technical Working Group, which brings together over 25 multilateral development banks and other international financial institutions to work on standardizing greenhouse gas accounting methodologies and approaches across a wide range of economic sectors. The secretariat provided the group with background materials on its prioritized topics, facilitated discussion among members of the group and presented state-of-the-art work on this area.  A growing number of international artists are drawing inspiration from climate change. Their climate art ­ including sculpture, theatre and music ­ has connected a global audience to climate change on a deeply emotional level. Several artists produced climate-inspired art installations for display at COP 25 as part of an initiative that will continue throughout 2020.  Technical expert meetings in 2019 Technical expert meetings aim at enhancing action prior to 2020. They are organized by the UNFCCC, its subsidiary and constituted bodies, and guided by the High Level Climate Champions. In 2019, meetings were held on the following topics: > Adaptation finance, including the private sector > Circular economy solutions and innovation in water and energy management for the agri-food chain > Decentralized solutions for smart energy and water use in the agri-food chain > Off-grid and decentralized energy solutions for smart energy and water use in the agri-food chain.

Sewing a sustainable future The fashion industry is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which come both from textile manufacturing, processing and transport and from the use and disposal of finished products. Some challenges in the sector include a lack of transparency in the supply chain, a lack of capacity of supply chain actors to take climate action and a lack of financial instruments or incentives that would enable manufacturers to invest in clean, energy-efficient production. The secretariat convened the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, an industry-led initiative created in 2018 to drive the fashion industry to net zero emissions by 2050. By the end of 2019, 120 brands, retailers, suppliers and supporting organizations had joined the Charter and thereby committed to transforming the industry across its supply chain. In  recognition of its important role in driving the world of fashion towards climate action and sustainability, the Charter won the British Fashion Council's inaugural Award for Positive Change in 2019. Racing to the finish line The Sports for Climate Action Framework is a secretariat-led initiative launched in 2018 that invites sports organizations to unite behind the Sports for Climate Action Principles and work with communities in moving towards net zero emissions by 2050. Participating sports organizations also work on climate-neutrality plans, raise public awareness of climate action and reduce the environmental impact of sporting events. There are 115 signatories to the Framework, including the International Olympic Committee, international and national sports federations, and many small organizations. Addressing cross-cutting issues  Climate change disproportionately affects the most vulnerable people in every society ­ those who are socially or economically disadvantaged, and those who are marginalized. Guided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development principle of leaving no one behind, the UNFCCC has committed to fully integrating the voices of indigenous peoples and women into its processes.  Our vision is a climate-resilient world for all, which brings together diverse people, their knowledge systems and their values.  Amplifying indigenous voices Engaging indigenous peoples and local communities in climate action is an immense opportunity to enrich work under the UNFCCC. Indigenous peoples have a holistic view of the environment and human well-being, and respect intergenerational dialogue. This approach has helped transform interactions with nature from being exploitative to being restorative, and will enhance climate action and ambition and bring about value-based climate policies. In 2019, the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform and its Facilitative Working Group became fully operationalized. The objective of the Platform is to integrate traditional practices into the UNFCCC process and make a space within it for airing the concerns of indigenous peoples. The Facilitative Working Group of the Platform has 14 members ­ half of them are representatives of Parties and half are representatives of indigenous peoples organizations. This membership composition helps the Working Group in its work on averting, reducing and addressing climate change in a holistic way. At the Bonn Climate Change Conference in June, the secretariat convened a partnership-building dialogue on the Platform's work.  Including women in the response to climate change Climate change impacts on women and men often differ owing to existing gender inequalities arising from power imbalances, discriminatory laws and customs, and biased control of and access to resources. Yet the gender and climate change nexus is still poorly understood. Parties and organizations are increasingly engaging in gender mainstreaming. Some countries have started conducting gender analyses when preparing their plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to climate change and enhancing community resilience. Gender is also increasingly being mainstreamed across the UNFCCC process and in the work of the secretariat. In 2019, six constituted bodies ­ the Advisory Board of the Climate Technology Centre and Network, the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism, the Executive Committee of the Warsaw International Mechanism, the Facilitative Working Group of the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform, the Standing Committee on Finance and the Technology Executive Committee ­ agreed to ensure that they would consider gender in all their work. In its 2019 report on gender and climate change, the secretariat reported on progress in integrating a gender perspective in constituted body processes. Gender mainstreaming activities of the secretariat in 2019 included: > Establishing a virtual collaboration space where national gender and climate change focal points can exchange information and experience > Establishing a network of senior women delegates to encourage peer-to-peer support of female negotiators > Bringing additional female negotiators from developing countries to COP 25. > Launching a toolkit for designing gender-responsive national adaptation plans > Conducting a gender and climate change workshop at the fiftieth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation that highlighted the broad range of actions taken by Parties, organizations and the secretariat in implementing the Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan These activities demonstrate how the Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan, together with the secretariat's efforts to raise awareness of gender and climate change, stimulated a positive shift towards gender-responsive climate policy and action. The work on gender culminated in the adoption of the enhanced Lima work programme on gender and its gender action plan at COP 25.  For decades and decades, progress has been conceived ignoring women, no less than half of humanity. Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain  Considering climate-related risks to human security and social stability An event on climate-related risks to social stability in the context of law and governance presented the latest research on the effects of climate change on emerging risks to human security and social stability. It also gave information on the support the United Nations system can provide in policymaking and developing effective responses to social instability due to climate change.  Building resilience to climate change through adaptation has a number of co-benefits, including women's empowerment, improved nutrition and better health for poor communities. Campaign for Female Education Young Women's Grassroots Climate Action in Africa is a winner of the 2019 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards.  secretariat fit for the future  In 2019, the secretariat embarked on organizational reform, extended its global networks and strengthened its partnerships, invested in forward-looking information technology infrastructure and data management, and implemented a wide-reaching online communication strategy that will enable it to better serve Parties and non-Party stakeholders. Beginning in 2018, the secretariat undertook a thorough review of its organizational structure, operations and use of resources in order to determine how it can best support the needs of Parties and non-Party stakeholders in the global transformation needed to achieve the purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement. The review concluded in early 2019 with recommendations for both structural and nonstructural change. As a result, the secretariat commenced an organizational change exercise that ran throughout 2019 and will continue in 2020 to ensure a fit-for-purpose secretariat with a collaborative and results-driven culture. This exercise encompasses implementing both a new organizational structure and non-structural initiatives that will enhance the secretariat's leadership, performance management and organizational culture.  Achievements of the secretariat's work on organizational change in 2019 included: > Implementing a new organizational structure that enables coherence around mandated activities, collaboration across multiple areas of expertise, adaptation to changing political realities and the forging of effective relationships with diverse stakeholders > Conducting a leadership development programme, including workshops on supervisory skills and change management, which has been completed by 96 per cent of supervisors > Establishing the Network4Change, a broad network of colleagues focused on enhancing the secretariat's culture of collaboration and knowledge-sharing Building a global support structure The secretariat continued to support activities around the world through its six regional collaboration centres: Asia and the Pacific; Caribbean; Eastern and Southern Africa; Latin America; Middle East, North Africa and South Asia; and Western and Francophone Africa.   In 2019, the regional collaboration centres co-organized 17 events on capacity-building and on the clean development mechanism, which were attended by 600 stakeholders. Government representatives were briefed on the status of climate negotiations, new tools for enabling climate action and for measurement, reporting and verification, and the latest developments under the clean development mechanism. Project experts received tailored technical support for implementing their projects and guidance on monitoring and using certified emission reductions. The regional collaboration centres also provided support to 275 clean development mechanism projects and programmes of activities, responded to 243 technical queries and promoted certified emission reductions for voluntary carbon offsetting.  Relevant, up-to-date and accessible data are instrumental to inform dialogue as well as to identify areas for improvement and approaches to overcome potential gaps.  Implementing the Paris Agreement and supporting COP 25 through partnerships The secretariat worked with several key partners from the private sector and civil society throughout 2019 to advance the implementation of the Paris Agreement and to support COP 25. COP 25 partners led a variety of initiatives, including eco-friendly credit cards that track and offset emissions, affordable solutions for generating and transmitting renewable energy, strategies for companies to transform themselves into `climate-positive' enterprises by reducing their emissions, a digital campaign to raise awareness of climate change, and the promotion of electric vehicles and cycling. The secretariat values the support of its partners as a critical contribution to its work. The secretariat's 2019 partners included fintech company Doconomy, Facebook, GEIDCO (Global Energy Interconnection Development and Cooperation Organization), Iberdrola, IKEA, Lorenzo Quinn and Halcyon Art International, Qlik, Visa, What Design Can Do and the World Travel and Tourism Council. Making connectivity faster, better and more secure To better serve Parties and improve the capacity, security and speed of its information technology infrastructure, the secretariat in 2019 invested in consolidating its climate data centre, putting in place processes for inter-organizational data sharing ­ such as sharing programme, project and financial data with the Green Climate Fund and contributing climate data to the data repositories of other United Nations entities ­ and rolling out cutting-edge collaboration tools and a virtual meetings platform. In 2019, the secretariat continued to ensure that the systems and tools for the reporting and review of climate change data and information are up to date and that relevant information is shared in a way that is most helpful to Parties and other stakeholders as well as the public. The secretariat upgraded all the modules of the greenhouse gas data interface so that data reported by Parties align with the latest UNFCCC reporting guidelines and are updated three times a year. Evolution of the secretariat's information technology infrastructure is the means of positioning the secretariat as the trusted source of all climate data, facilitating collaboration and data analysis with remote teams, and enabling greater participation in meetings while reducing the travel ­ and carbon footprint ­ of Parties and other stakeholders.   Chapter IV | Moving forward  In 2019, the world witnessed a string of devastating climate events, carbon dioxide levels continued to rise and ice caps to melt, and we reached the highest sea level ever recorded. Failure to address climate change will only exacerbate future impacts, yet most countries are neither responding to the call for ambitious action nor preparing at the pace science indicates is required. Efforts are being constrained by lack of resources, by different expectations and understanding of ambition, by complexity and by the wide variety of interests involved. It seems 2020 will be far from what had been envisaged. As this report goes to print, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues, endangering countless lives and jeopardizing the progress of many countries over the past three decades in poverty reduction, women's rights and child health. The pandemic risks diverting attention and funds from the climate crisis at a time when they are sorely needed, including for the secretariat. The looming global economic crisis and the changing priorities of countries might profoundly affect the global climate effort. Various economic sectors face an existential risk from COVID-19, limiting the opportunities for climate action. At the same time, the widespread lockdown and other public health measures have required the secretariat to work and organize meetings in a largely virtual environment while postponing climate conferences. It is against this backdrop that the UNFCCC is working towards achieving its objectives for 2020. The positive global momentum must continue While fighting the pandemic is the world's priority, we must do all we can to keep the climate momentum going. While we certainly need to do more to curb the global rise in emissions, five years of global summits and engagement have helped drive a rapid increase in the number of initiatives and commitments, reaping positive results. As outlined in this annual report, many countries have announced their targets for carbon neutrality and are working on stronger nationally determined contributions. The Green Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund have received additional capital for climate finance. A surge in initiatives and commitments from all over the world occurred in 2019. Commitments made by individuals and businesses have massive potential to help countries achieve their goals, and these commitments hint at the possibilities of  transformational action ­ working together across sectors, borders and other divides. This potential was reflected in the global climate action portal (NAZCA), which at the end of 2019 listed over 20,000 climate actions from nearly 15,000 actors. There is growing awareness by civil society, especially youth, of the need to act on climate change. Channelled properly, this massive push for action can encourage Parties to increase ambition. Countries will need to make bolder science-based commitments at COP 26, through their nationally determined contributions, to collectively meet the goal of keeping the global average temperature rise below 1.5 °C. We cannot postpone these commitments any further. These commitments must be accompanied by a full mobilization of all levels of governance and non-State actors in all sectors. Parties should also meet their Cancun pledges for emissions reductions in 2020. Predictability and clarity in the provision, mobilization and delivery of the climate finance goal of USD 100 billion by 2025 will be key to providing assurance that developed countries are continuing to take the lead in mobilizing funds for the climate crisis, and that the new global goal takes into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. COP 26 is tasked with finalizing both the technical work on transparency and the design of the market-based and non-market mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. After 2020, the transparency arrangements and market mechanisms of the Paris Agreement will become fully operational, and the first five-year cycle of the Paris Agreement, encompassing nationally determined contributions, reporting and the global stocktake, will be completed. In the long term, the success of the global fight against climate change will depend on ensuring that this becomes a positive cycle of increasing both action and ambition. The secretariat is ready to play its part The secretariat is gearing up its efforts to support the global call to action. Its restructuring efforts will continue in 2020 to enable the organization to better respond to governments' requests for support and proactively address emerging needs. In fulfilling its promise of leaving no country behind, the secretariat will increase its provision of capacity-building and technical support to developing country Parties and consolidate institutional arrangements so that knowledge and skills are retained in countries over time.  The secretariat will also increase its outreach to Parties, international organizations and the public to push for greater climate ambition and enhance the transparency of reporting on climate action. It will work with governments and agencies to raise awareness of the importance of ambition and fully support governments' efforts to increase ambition. The secretariat will also work with coalitions, organizations and initiatives on key sectors to raise climate ambition and enhance sustainable development. Using technology and online tools, the secretariat will continue to expand its capacity to securely collect, store and disseminate climate data. Its information technology infrastructure will also be used to reduce the organization's carbon footprint and to adapt to the social distancing measures required during the COVID-19 crisis, allowing for more virtual meetings, online participation and social media engagement.  An increasingly young audience is following the UNFCCC, particularly on social media, such as Instagram. In an effort to reach more people and communicate climate science to non-technical, multilingual audiences, the secretariat will strive to better use its website to make key messages more accessible and in different languages, while also providing easy access to technical documents. In an ever-changing media landscape, the secretariat will focus on showcasing the climate action of non-Party stakeholders so as to inspire others to do their part in building a net zero carbon future. As the scope of work under the climate change regime continues to expand, more resources will be necessary to allow the secretariat to support Parties in achieving their climate change commitments.  Chapter V | Financial performance The UNFCCC is financed by payments from Parties to the Convention, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement; fees received for services provided by the organization; and voluntary contributions from Parties and other donors. 2019 financial performance "
WB-2020-11.txt,"Public Disclosure Authorized  Public Disclosure Authorized  >>> Preface Climate change is a grave threat to global development and shared prosperity. Its impacts are expected to intensify even as the world responds to the COVID-19 crisis. The poor and most vulnerable will be the worst affected. Climate change poses particularly difficult challenges for policy makers. It demands action across all sectors of the economy and across all of society. Action to address climate change requires coordination among multiple governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders. The extended time frame over which climate change unfolds requires a capability to plan, implement, and sustain a credible commitment to increasingly ambitious policies over multiple political cycles. There will be winners and losers. Policies will often be contested. To address these challenges, countries need effective institutions. National framework legislation on climate change can help put these institutions in place. It can enshrine stable and ambitious targets, create mechanisms for realizing these targets, and ensure proper oversight and accountability. It can provide a voice for not only those living today but also future generations. More than 30 countries have already adopted climate change framework legislation, and others are in the process, including some with World Bank support. Framework legislation can provide the means for countries to realize the commitments made in their Nationally Determined Contributions and long-term strategies. We hope the 12 key principles for framework legislation laid out in this guide will contribute to building back better by helping countries to lay a solid foundation for climate-smart development that creates new jobs and markets, boosts economic growth, and provides a safer, cleaner environment for all.  >>> Summary Sheet What are the benefits of adopting climate change framework legislation? What key elements should such legislation address? What questions should officials in ministries of economy, finance, and planning and other central government agencies have in mind when reviewing such legislation, and what examples can be followed? This Reference Guide to Climate Change Framework Legislation aims to help policy makers understand the benefits of legislating on climate change and establishes 12 key elements to assess framework laws. These elements, and accompanying questions, are contained in the table below. The table is followed by more detailed supporting information, expanded country examples, and an assessment of existing national framework legislation against the questions.1 1. For questions, comments, or more detailed advice please contact Nicholas Menzies (Senior Governance Specialist), nmenzies@worldbank.org. WORLD BANK REFERENCE GUIDE TO CLIMATE CHANGE FRAMEWORK  Does the law enshrine emissions reduction targets for 2050 and include a net zero target (ideally by 2050 or shortly thereafter)? Does the law specify objectives for adaptation? · 2050 net zero targets are included in climate laws in Chile (draft law), Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden (2045), and the United Kingdom; and in executive acts in Costa Rica, Fiji, and the Marshall Islands. · Singapore has legislated a long-term adaptation target of a 10-fold increase in desalination capacity to meet 30 percent of long-term water needs by 2060.

Such legislation typically sets national long-term decarbonization and adaptation objectives and establishes the institutions and processes needed to meet those objectives (World Bank 2015). Although having a comprehensive law that addresses both decarbonization and adaptation has some benefits, some countries have addressed these two areas through separate legislation. Specific policy measures are usually defined in subsidiary regulatory instruments such as sector-specific laws. This Reference Guide to Climate Change Framework Legislation is intended to help stakeholders design effective and comprehensive laws. The guide is primarily aimed at institutions at the center of government--presidencies, prime ministers' offices, and ministries of planning and finance--which play a leadership role in policy issues that require a whole-of-government response, such as climate change. The guide is also aimed at specialized climate change and environmental agencies that play an important role in sponsoring climate change legislation and policy. Finally, the guide will be useful to legislators as well as the civil society organizations that engage with government and the legislature in the design and implementation of climate change policy. The guide can be used to stimulate discussion during the process of drafting climate change framework legislation. The guide does not present a model law.3 Every country has its own environmental, economic, social, legal, and institutional context that has to be considered in the design of any framework law. Framework legislation should avoid overlapping with existing legislation, creating ambiguity, notably in areas such as public finance, disaster risk management, and intergovernmental relations. Decision makers will need to consider whether a new framework law or revision of existing laws, or a combination of those, will be more effective in developing institutional mandates. The reference guide identifies 12 key elements of effective climate change framework legislation. The summary sheet sets out guiding questions for each element and summarizes country examples. The text below explains the rationale for each element, lays out the design considerations, and provides country examples in boxes. Readers should consider the relevance of country examples in the context of their own countries. The key elements are interdependent and not sequential: the guide does not prescribe a specific process or order for addressing the elements. >>> Rationale and Scope of Climate Change Framework Legislation Framework legislation supports the achievement of national decarbonization and adaptation goals. Decarbonization is the process of reducing net carbon dioxide emissions to zero. The term is used in this guide in place of mitigation, the term that appears in much domestic legislation and the Paris Agreement, because decarbonization better captures the policy objective. Decarbonization requires proactive policies to restructure economic activity and reorganize land use along four fronts: decarbonization of energy sources, electrification, increased energy efficiency, and preservation and increased use of natural carbon sinks. All countries, developed and developing, will need to decarbonize their economies if they are to deliver sustainable, resilient, and inclusive growth. Adaptation is action to prevent or minimize adverse impacts of climate change by strengthening the resilience of households, businesses, and the public sector and their ability to take advantage of opportunities that may arise. All countries, developed and developing, will need to adapt to respond to the significant impacts of climate change. Framework legislation sets the long-term direction of climate strategy, providing a credible commitment to the continuity of climate objectives across political mandates.4 Decarbonization and adaptation require investments with long lead times, extending well beyond electoral mandates. Households and businesses will need to be confident that policies will remain stable over many years if they are to invest in and change their behavior in line with national climate change objectives. Legislation strengthens countries' commitment to policy continuity because it is more difficult to change than executive policy instruments such as decrees, regulations, plans, and strategies. Legislation can be enforced through judicial and other forms of review. The legislative process entails broad stakeholder engagement, deliberation, and debate, which can help build long-term commitment. In many countries, climate change framework legislation is aligned with commitments laid out in the context of the Paris Agreement.  Climate change framework legislation and the COVID crisis The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives around the globe and shaken economic systems. As governments rush to respond to the crisis, there is a risk that longer-term issues, such as climate change, will lose political support and funding. Climate change framework legislation protects policies from abrupt shifts in priorities when crises arise and guides the crisis response and the design of policies for a sustainable recovery.  Framework legislation guides the behavior of markets in line with national climate change objectives. Efficient markets are those that encourage businesses and households to adapt their economic activities to reflect the economic and social costs of activities and exposure to risks, such as those that contribute to climate change. For example, efficient markets invest in low-carbon, energy-efficient technologies and methods of production, distribution, and consumption. The public sector can improve market efficiency by providing information, regulating economic activities, creating tax incentives, and changing public spending priorities. Carbon pricing, introduced through carbon taxes or greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trading schemes, is an effective tool for influencing the behavior of businesses, households, and the public sector because it increases the market price of goods and services in proportion to the GHG emissions used to produce and deliver them. In order to deliver progressively deeper cuts in emissions, businesses, households, and public entities should expect carbon prices to increase over time. The credibility of long-term increases in the price of carbon is undermined when pricing policies are reversed. Framework legislation can protect carbon pricing instruments against such reversals and set expectations for long-term increases in carbon prices that result in decarbonization. Framework legislation lays out the institutional arrangements for the formulation and implementation of  climate change policy. It defines the competencies of public institutions and sets out structures for the integration of climate change in the policy-making process. An effective framework law will describe and assign the governance functions related to climate change. It will promote collaboration and avoid ambiguous and overlapping institutional mandates. In some countries, climate change framework legislation adds to the mandates of existing institutions. In others, the framework legislation creates new institutions as part of an integrated system. In most countries, new institutions are required to cover the expert advice, coordination, and consultation functions (elements 6, 7, and 8). Framework legislation will establish timelines for these institutions to be put in place and comply with their mandates. Framework legislation ensures an appropriate balance between predictability and flexibility. Legislation must ensure continuity if it is to represent a credible commitment to national climate change objectives. At the same time, countries need to ensure flexibility in the design of policy instruments to accommodate changing circumstances--new scientific evidence, technological change, and international agreements--and progress in implementation. Such adjustments should not reopen debate on long-term targets. This balance is achieved though design elements described in this guide such as long-term targets, expert advice, monitoring and reporting, and oversight (elements 1, 6, 11, and 12).  Examples of institutional frameworks for climate change Mexico's General Law on Climate Change of 2012 establishes the National System on Climate Change (SINACC). This system includes the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change, the Consultative Council on Climate Change, and the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change. SINACC provides for the participation of state governments, associations of municipal governments, and representatives of the Mexican Congress. The law establishes the Coordination for Evaluation to assess the impact of national climate change policy. Further work is needed to clarify institutional mandates and provide guidance to sectoral ministries (Averchenkova and Guzman Luna 2018). Peru's Framework Law on Climate Change of 2018 establishes an institutional framework for a coordinated response to climate change, including definition of the mandates of the Ministry of Environment, sectoral agencies, and regional and local authorities; establishment of a High Level Commission on Climate Change to propose policy measures; and creation of the National Climate Change Commission to monitor implementation. In the United Kingdom, the key governmental institutions responsible for dealing with climate change had been established prior to the adoption of the Climate Change Act of 2008. The role of the Act was to define the overall duties and powers of the government with respect to climate policy, establish an independent advisory body (the Climate Change Committee, or CCC), and clarify the mandates of key agencies, including the ministries in charge of climate policy, devolved administrations, and the CCC. The law mandates existing institutions; the Department Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy; and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to coordinate climate change mitigation and adaptation (respectively).  This guide establishes 12 elements to assess the scope of proposed climate change framework legislation. Two of these elements cover the definition of strategic objectives for climate change policy through national-level long-term targets (element 1) and the translation of these long-term targets into intermediate and sectoral targets (element 2). Four of the 12 elements cover the institutions and processes for policy development, namely risk assessments, strategic planning, and policy instruments (elements 3, 4, and 5) and the provision of independent expert advice (element 6). Four elements  cover functions related to policy implementation, namely mechanisms for horizontal and vertical coordination among the key government agencies (element 7), engagement with stakeholders outside of government (element 8), enhancing the role of subnational levels of government (element 9), and financing implementation of the law (element 10). The final two elements put in place arrangements for policy evaluation and enforcement, namely measurement, review, and verification (element 11) and oversight (element 12). >>> Elements Element 1: Long-Term Targets Climate change framework legislation should establish long-term targets that set the strategic direction of a country's efforts to decarbonize and adapt to climate change. Achievement of decarbonization and adaptation goals requires huge structural changes in economic activity that will take place over decades. Long-term targets allow policy makers and planners to identify the decarbonization and adaptation pathways that are most compatible with a country's development goals. Long-term targets signal the direction, pace, and extent of structural change needed to achieve climate change goals and guide the response of the public sector, businesses, and households. Presentation of long-term targets in framework legislation helps ensure continuity and commitment to ambitious goals. Decarbonization-- Emissions reduction target for 2050 and a net zero target Framework legislation should set country decarbonization targets for 2050 and a net zero target that are aligned with--or more ambitious than--the country's commitments under the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement's goals are to keep global warming below 1.5­ 2oC, with all economies reaching peak emissions and declining as soon as possible, to achieve global net zero emissions in the second half of the century (Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, UNFCCC, 2015).5 The Paris Agreement requires developed countries to continue taking the lead by adhering to economywide absolute emissions reduction targets expressed as a reduction below the level in a specified base year. Developing countries are encouraged to move, over time, toward economywide emissions reduction or limitation targets, in light of different national circumstances. Some developing countries have set absolute targets, while others express targets in relative terms. Relative targets include emissions reduction below a business as usual level as well as intensity targets, with reductions in GHG emissions expressed per unit of gross domestic product or per capita. Absolute emission targets provide greater clarity on the intended outcome and the direction of travel. They are also easier to monitor than most relative targets. The 2050 and net zero targets should be informed by the latest scientific data on the level of effort required at the global level, national emissions reduction scenarios, and domestic capabilities and opportunities to achieve deep decarbonization. The choice of the base year and targets should be sufficiently ambitious to stimulate structural change and decarbonization. Independent expert advice (see element 6) can support the government in determining the appropriate long-term target.  Net zero emission targets Some countries have established the time frame for achieving net zero emissions in law, including Sweden by 2045; and Denmark, France, Germany, New Zealand (for all greenhouse gases except biogenic methane), Norway, and the United Kingdom by 2050. Chile and Spain, as well as the European Union as a whole, have provisions for net zero targets in their draft climate and energy transition laws. Other countries have net zero targets established in executive acts, including Finland by 2035 and Costa Rica, Fiji, Marshall Islands, and Portugal by 2050.  Adaptation targets Countries should consider defining national long-term objectives for adaptation through their climate change framework legislation. The Paris Agreement sets a qualitative global goal of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience, and reducing vulnerability to climate change. Countries have defined a national long-term goal or vision for  adaptation that is aspirational, qualitative, or quantitative or a combination of all three.6 Quantifiable targets tend to focus on specific policy areas or adaptation in particular sectors, such as disaster risk management, coastal protection, flood-proofing, land preservation, water management, and climate-resilient buildings and infrastructure.  Adaptation targets Kenya's Climate Change Act of 2016 sets open-ended objectives for building resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity; formulating programs and plans to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of human and ecological systems; and mainstreaming and reinforcing disaster risk reduction within strategies and actions of public and private entities. Mexico's General Law on Climate Change establishes a long-term objective of reducing the vulnerability of the country's population and ecosystems to the adverse effects of climate change, as well as creating and strengthening national capacities to respond to climate threats. Singapore has legislated a long-term adaptation target of a 10-fold increase in desalination capacity to meet 30 percent of long-term water needs by 2060.  Element 2: Intermediate and Sectoral Targets  Intermediate and sectoral targets guide implementation in line with national long-term targets. Intermediate targets serve as milestones, helping policy makers and planners keep decarbonization and adaptation strategies on track. Sectoral targets break down the contribution of economic sectors and actors to the achievement of national targets. Countries may set intermediate and sectoral targets in framework legislation itself or specify the mechanism by which these targets will be set at a future date through subsidiary legislation or regulation. Intermediate targets Framework legislation should provide for intermediate targets that are consistent with the achievement of 2050 emissions reduction, net zero, and adaptation targets. The intermediate targets will determine the trajectory toward long-term goals. Trajectories can front-load decarbonization in earlier years or back-load it closer to 2050. The choice of trajectory will depend on the relative costs and benefits of different strategies. Front-loaded intermediate targets send a signal of commitment and allow stakeholders to plan a phased, orderly approach to decarbonization and adaptation over an extended period. However, front-loaded intermediate targets will tend to bring forward the costs of decarbonization and adaptation. The Paris Agreement establishes a five-year cycle of increased ambition in emissions reduction--the ""ratchet""--and a periodic stocktaking to assess global progress. For the second round of NDC submissions due in 2020, countries were requested to formulate 2030 emission targets, setting a new emission objective if the previous  NDC contained a target for 2025, and an updated and more ambitious target if the previous one was for 2030. Midterm targets set in national legislation should be consistent with, or more ambitious than, those communicated in the country's NDC. Some climate legislation prohibits future reductions in ambition. Carbon budgets can be used to translate long-term targets into intermediate emissions reduction targets. A carbon budget sets the total quantity of greenhouse gases that can be emitted over a specified time frame. The carbon budget is progressively reduced in each period to ultimately reach the 2050 emissions reduction and net zero targets. First implemented through the United Kingdom's Climate Change Act, carbon budgets have subsequently been used in climate and energy transition legislation in Scotland, France, and New Zealand. Carbon budgets allow countries to monitor their progress toward long-term targets. Future carbon budgets can be reduced to compensate when an economy fails to meet its intermediate target. Long-term adaptation objectives also should be broken into intermediate targets. These intermediate targets may be defined in terms of enhanced adaptive capacity, strengthened resilience, and reduced vulnerability. Intermediate targets enable stakeholders to track progress toward long-term goals and make periodic course adjustments. The targets should be in line with the latest global and national climate change risk assessments (which should be reviewed at least every five years) and adjusted accordingly.  Intermediate emissions reduction targets The 2030 emissions reduction targets established in law vary in their form and ambition. Mexico has set target reductions 22 to 36 percent below business as usual; Denmark has established an absolute emissions reduction of 70 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Rather than specifying midterm targets, the United Kingdom's Climate Change Act establishes a statutory process for setting five-year carbon budgets guided by a net zero 2050 target defined in the legislation (updated in 2019 from 80 percent below 1990 levels). Each carbon budget determines GHG emissions allowed within a five-year period and is set 12 years in advance by the government, based on the advice of an independent body (the Climate Change Committee) and approved by Parliament. Setting carbon budgets 12 years in advance orients the targets toward long-term objectives, rather than short-term political priorities, and allows enough time for the private and public sectors to plan compatible investments. This mechanism has proved an effective way to plan decarbonization. France has also introduced a carbon budget approach in its Energy Transition Law of 2015 and the Energy and Climate Bill of 2019. The budgets are set for 5, 10, and 15 years in advance. Germany on the other hand breaks down its national emissions pathway to 2030 into annual objectives for its main economic sectors. Mexico's General Law on Climate Change does not adopt a concrete mechanism for intermediate emissions targets but specifies that future amendments to emissions targets should be toward greater ambition. Intermediate adaptation targets Tonga's legislation establishes an adaptation target for all coastal communities to be protected by 2035. Vietnam's law set a public awareness target--that over 10 percent of the population and over 65 percent of public employees and servants would understand climate change and its impacts by 2010. Through executive regulation it further sets an objective for at least 90 percent of socioeconomic development plans to have integrated disaster risk management and climate change adaptation by 2030.  Sectoral targets Framework legislation should provide guidance on the contribution of key sectors to decarbonization and adaptation targets. Some countries include specific sector emissions reduction targets in their framework legislation (France, Germany, and Mexico). In other countries, framework legislation mandates sectoral ministries to develop specific decarbonization and adaptation targets or requires sectoral adaptation targets to be set in subsidiary legislation (Samoa, Tonga, and Vietnam). The choice of approach will depend on political economy considerations. Agreement on the division of effort among sectors can be contentious, given that decarbonization and adaptation will entail costs as well as benefits. Adoption of the framework legislation and the national  long-term target may be expedited by deferring sectoral targets to subsequent legislation or other policy documents. This approach also allows greater flexibility in determining how best to achieve intermediate and long-term targets, adjusting the level of ambition for each sector to take into account changing circumstances and technological innovation. Where sectoral targets are deferred to subsequent or subordinate legislation, framework legislation should lay out a transparent process for stakeholders to arrive at sectoral targets, with deadlines and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance. Legislation regarding sectoral targets should clarify the role of regulatory and supervisory institutions in setting and monitoring these targets.   Sectoral targets for decarbonization and adaptation France's Energy Transition Law sets a range of specific targets for the energy sector, such as increasing the share of renewable energy and reducing the share of nuclear and fossil fuel energy, as well as targets for deployment of hydrogen. This increased policy certainty took more than 150 hours of parliamentary debate and 5,000 amendments (Rüdinger 2018). The United Kingdom adopted a flexible approach by putting into law the institutional infrastructure and mechanism for getting to a long-term target through the system of carbon budgets (discussed above), rather than specifying targets for each five-year period and sector upfront. The framework law also mandates a UK-wide climate change risk assessment, followed by adaptation plans every five years. Germany breaks down its 2030 national emissions pathway into annual objectives for the main economic sectors. The law assigns responsibility (with some flexibility) for achieving these annual emission budgets to the respective ministries. Progress is reported by sector, and gaps can trigger short-term action plans for additional reductions. Samoa's development strategy of 2016 requires that 100 percent of its new buildings be climate resilient by 2020.  Element 3: Risk and Vulnerability Assessments  Framework legislation should require the government to publish information on climate-related physical risks and vulnerabilities. Physical risks arise from changes in agroclimatic zones and ecosystems and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Climate forecasts and models can assess physical risks and their temporal and spatial impacts. Vulnerability assessments explore the social and economic impacts of climate change. Governments are well placed to consolidate and communicate this information, drawing on the work of scientific research and specialized technical institutions, such as meteorological, agricultural, forestry, and land use planning services. Communicating information on physical risks and vulnerabilities to public entities, households, and businesses helps them make informed decisions about how to deal with future climate change impacts and to take these risks into account in their decision making. Framework legislation can require periodic updates of risk and vulnerability assessments in line with science and other evidence. Framework legislation may require public entities to prepare territorial or sectoral risk and vulnerability assessments as part of the planning process.  Policy makers should consider the strengths and weaknesses of established risk assessment processes and institutions before introducing changes and should ensure consistency across framework and specialized legislation. Framework legislation can require government, businesses, and financial institutions to publish information on economic risks related to climate change and decarbonization. This requires an assessment of both the physical risks of climate change and the transition risks of decarbonization. Transition risks arise as a result of changes in technology, regulation, and market conditions as economies decarbonize. Exposure to physical and transition risks will have a significant impact on the value of assets. Access to information about these risks will help markets reflect their actual costs in asset prices. Economies can then allocate public resources and funding more efficiently by taking their climate change risk exposure into account. The Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has published recommendations for disclosure of these climate-related risks.  Risk Assessment The United Kingdom's Climate Change Act of 2008 mandates the government to produce a comprehensive, UKwide climate change risk assessment every five years, which is to be followed by a set of national adaptation plans. In 2012, Colombia's Law 1523 created the National Policy and System of Risk Management, with the objective of identifying, monitoring, and analyzing risks related to climate change; preparing measures to address emergency situations; establishing relevant financial instruments; and developing a comprehensive communication and stakeholder engagement system. This law preceded the adoption of climate change framework legislation, Law 1931, in 2018. The climate change framework law specifies that the national and territorial risk management plans required under Law 1523 should incorporate actions to foster knowledge generation and reduce risk and vulnerability to climate change. It also mandates the government to develop guidelines for disaster risk management plans. In 2015, France introduced legislation on mandatory climate change­related reporting for asset owners and asset managers. In 2016, the Dutch central bank DNB announced that it was taking steps to monitor and mitigate climate risk. In 2019, Spain included mandatory climate-related risk disclosure in the draft text of its proposed Energy and Climate transition law. In 2019, the European Commission adopted Disclosure Regulation EU/2019/2088, which sets out rules for financial firms and advisers to report on sustainability risks and adverse sustainability impacts. A proposed regulation on creating a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, the Taxonomy Regulation, will establish an EU-wide framework for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. Member States will apply the regulation in public measures, standards, and labels for financial products or corporate bonds.  Element 4: Climate Change Strategies and Plans  Framework legislation should require public institutions to prepare climate change strategies and plans to achieve long-term, intermediate, and sectoral targets. National and sectoral strategies and plans guide implementation and encompass adaptation and decarbonization. They lay out the policy measures that public institutions will undertake, and they allocate resources, set targets, and assign responsibility for the achievement of those targets. In some cases, adaptation and decarbonization objectives are to be addressed through distinct, specialized planning instruments. In some framework legislation, adaptation and decarbonization are integrated within the same planning instruments. Strategies and plans may have various time horizons, such as long-term plans that are aligned with intermediate and long-term climate change targets; development plans for a period of five to 10 years; and plans aligned with government electoral mandates. The scope of strategies and plans also differs, encompassing (a) economywide plans that set the broad direction for government policy across all sectors and across the national territory usually led by central government planning or finance  agencies; (b) sector-specific plans usually led by sectoral ministries; and (c) territorial plans prepared by subnational administrations. Framework legislation can mandate that stand-alone climate change strategies and plans be developed or require integration into existing national strategies and plans. Some countries mandate in their framework legislation that sectoral ministries must develop specific decarbonization and adaptation plans (Colombia, Kenya, and the United Kingdom). Although dedicated climate change strategies and plans allow institutions to address policy issues in detail, there is a risk that such instruments will be too abstract and fail to take into account other, potentially competing, national and regional development objectives. Effective implementation of climate change strategies and plans requires that the institutions integrate climate change policy in routine planning instruments, such as development plans, sector plans, and the annual budget process. Framework legislation can mandate the integration of climate change policy in these instruments.  Strategies and plans Colombia's law mandates each sectoral ministry to prepare comprehensive sectoral climate change management plans to identify, evaluate, and guide the incorporation of climate change actions in the policies and regulations of the respective sectors. It also mandates measures at the territorial level (regional and territorial development plans) and in the national communications, national inventories, and biennial update reports. Kenya's Climate Change Act of 2016 mandates the cabinet secretary to formulate a National Climate Change Action Plan, to be updated every five years, with an implementation review conducted every two years. In addition, the law empowers the coordination body, the National Climate Change Council, to impose climate change obligations on private entities and stipulates investigation, monitoring, and enforcement powers. In Mexico, adaptation provisions were strengthened in 2018 through the amendment to the General Law on Climate Change mandating adaptation planning and a government review of adaptation strategy every six years.  Framework legislation can mandate institutions to build capacity for planning their response to climate change. Countries recognize that institutions and key stakeholders lack  the information and experience needed to respond to climate change. Capacity building includes investments in training for public officials, educational programs, and research.  Capacity building Kenya's Climate Change Act requires the cabinet secretary to establish accredited training programs on climate change. The act also provides for research on climate change, and the collation and dissemination of information to the national and county governments, the public, and other stakeholders. Mexico's law mandates a process for the development of technical and institutional capacities and measures to promote training, education, access to information, and communication among the population. Bulgaria's Climate Change Mitigation Act states that revenues generated from the sale and exchange of assigned amount units by the Bulgarian government can be used to finance educational measures, research, and administrative capacity. India and South Africa, through their Disaster Management Acts, mandate training and capacity-building initiatives to provide appropriate staff and agencies with necessary capabilities.  Element 5: Policy Instruments  Framework legislation authorizes public institutions to use policy instruments--information, regulation, taxation, and public spending--in support of national climate change goals. Some climate change framework laws establish policy instruments in the law itself (France) or list specific measures to be adopted (Mexico's and Spain's draft law). Others require the government to establish the policy instruments through subsequent legislation or regulation and set timelines for this to be done (United Kingdom). Specification of policy instruments in the framework legislation offers greater certainty regarding the means by which the long-term targets will be achieved. If this approach is followed, framework legislation should provide for flexibility in the adjustment of policy instruments to meet changing needs and developments in technology, without reopening debates that would allow backsliding on the targets. Deferring the detailed design of policy instruments to specialized legislation and regulations allows greater flexibility in choosing policy instruments to achieve the objectives of the legislation. Complementary legislation may also be necessary for specific sectors, such as finance, agriculture, transportation, energy, urban development, and industry, or to integrate climate change considerations in policy, planning, and budgeting functions and routines. Policy instruments for decarbonization Framework legislation may identify the principal policy instruments that will be used to achieve intermediate and long-term emissions reduction and net zero targets.7 These policy instruments will typically include a combination of the following: · Carbon pricing incorporates the social cost of GHG emissions generated during the production, delivery, and disposal of goods and services into the prices that consumers pay. It does that by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and introducing carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, charges, and rebates that reward emissions reductions and penalize emissions. Carbon pricing is the most effective tool (though rarely enough alone) to promote decarbonization because public entities, businesses, and households will drive changes in production, distribution, and consumption as they seek to increase efficiency. · Information measures can raise awareness and the capability of public entities, households, and businesses to  reduce emissions and decarbonize processes. Instruments can include access to information about government decarbonization policies and programs, access to scientific and technological information, communication campaigns, and interventions to promote behavioral change. · Regulation encompasses rules, standards, and enforcement arrangements that limit and guide the activities of households, businesses, and public entities in line with decarbonization objectives, such as the following: energy efficiency and fuel source standards; energy pricing and tariffs; land use zoning, planning, and regulation; regulation of markets for natural assets-- water, land, and forests--to ensure that they consider the value of ecosystem services these assets provide; reporting standards for GHG emissions and exposure to GHG-related risks in credit risk rating and stress tests; and use of financial products such as green bonds. · Programs can support emissions reductions through public spending, including public infrastructure investments that reduce emissions and increase sequestration of GHGs (such as electrification of public transport and reforestation); transfers and subsidies that support emissions reduction activities; and investment in emissions reductions by households, businesses, and public entities, such as grants to households to finance home energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy technologies. · Fiscal measures that promote emissions reductions include tax expenditures; provisions that reduce tax liability through exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, preferential tax rates, or deferral of liability (such as lower VAT rates for energy efficient lightbulbs); and feebates (such as charges levied on vehicles using fossil fuels and exemptions for electric vehicles). · Fiscal management practices can align resource allocation across the public sector with emissions reduction and net zero targets. Practices include climate budgeting, reporting on public expenditures that positively and adversely affect climate change objectives, assessment of fiscal risks related to decarbonization, and climate-informed management of public investment, including the use of shadow pricing of carbon during appraisal of public investments.    Decarbonization policy instruments France's framework Energy Transition Law of 2015 includes a carbon tax and CO2 performance standards, and Spain's draft climate and energy transition law lists specific measures to be adopted (for example, 2040 ban on certain combustion engine vehicles and e-mobility infrastructure obligations for fuel suppliers). Mexico's law authorizes the government to introduce a carbon tax and emissions trading scheme (without specifying the details). In the United Kingdom, the Climate Change Act of 2008 focuses on the processes to determine and deliver policies through carbon budgets rather than prescribing a particular policy instrument. The government is required by law to outline the key policies in its report on the proposed actions to meet the carbon budget. The law's main provision on policy instruments gives the national agencies the power to regulate emissions trading schemes and to introduce financial incentive schemes for waste, without specifying what these should be. Kenya's Climate Change Act of 2016 empowers the coordination body, the National Climate Change Council, to impose climate change obligations on private entities and stipulates investigation, monitoring, and enforcement powers.  Policy instruments for adaptation Framework legislation may identify the principal policy instruments that will be used to achieve intermediate and long-term adaptation targets.8 Policy instruments will strengthen the resilience of public entities, households, and businesses to current and future climate change. These instruments typically include a combination of the following measures: · Information measures are used to raise awareness and the capability of public agencies, households, and businesses to adapt to climate change. They may include access to information on government climate risk and vulnerability assessments, access to scientific and technological information, communication campaigns, and interventions to promote behavioral change. · Regulation encompasses rules, standards, and enforcement arrangements that limit and guide the activities of public agencies, households, and businesses to help them adapt to climate change. Instruments include building codes, land use zoning, and spatial planning regulations that that are aligned with assessments of physical risks, and regulation of financial products (such as insurance) and markets to ensure that physical risks are reflected in pricing. · Programs can use public spending to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience of households, businesses, and public agencies, such as the following: public investments in land and water management (such as protected areas and flood and drought management infrastructure); services that raise awareness and provide access to information (such as agricultural extension services); subsidies for households, businesses, and public entities (such as subsidies to promote reforestation, removal of  households and businesses from vulnerable locations, and use of insurance products); and fund transfers to households to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable. · Fiscal measures to promote actions by businesses and households that reduce their vulnerability can include tax expenditures and provisions that reduce tax liability through exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit, preferential tax rates, or deferral of liability (such as tax benefits for businesses that relocate from vulnerable areas and for reforestation and protection of privately owned woodlands). · Fiscal management practices that reduce vulnerability align resource allocation across the public sector with resilience objectives, including the following: climate budgeting, reporting on public expenditures that are aligned and adversely affect climate change objectives, systematic assessment of macrofiscal risks related to extreme weather events and long-term environmental change, and the application of climate vulnerability assessments in the design and appraisal of all programs and projects. Framework legislation will typically complement specialized legislation or regulations for disaster risk management and disaster response. In many countries, legislation on disaster risk management precedes the adoption of framework legislation. Framework legislation can later integrate disaster risk management provisions in the overall climate change architecture (as in Colombia). Disaster risk management requires specific institutional arrangements and policy instruments that are best addressed in specialized legislation.    Adaptation policy instruments The United Kingdom's Climate Change Act of 2008 includes an overarching adaptation framework that establishes a process of information generation and adaptation planning. The law mandates the government to produce a comprehensive, UK-wide climate change risk assessment every five years, which is to be followed by a set of national adaptation plans. Progress on preparedness for climate change is evaluated biannually by an independent advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, which has a dedicated adaptation subcommittee. The Philippines' Climate Change Act of 2009 recognizes the country's vulnerability to climate change and the need for adaptation. The act creates a comprehensive framework for integrating climate change with disaster risk reduction in policy formulation, development plans, poverty reduction strategies, and other development tools. In 2012, Colombia's Law 1523 created the National Policy and System of Risk Management, with the objective of identifying, monitoring, and analyzing risks related to climate change; preparing measures to address emergency situations; establishing relevant financial instruments; and developing a comprehensive communication and stakeholder engagement system. This preceded the adoption of climate change framework legislation (Law 1931), in 2018. The climate change framework law specifies that the national and territorial risk management plans required under Law 1523 should incorporate actions to foster knowledge generation and reduce risk and vulnerability to climate change. It also mandates the government to develop guidelines for disaster risk management plans.   Element 6: Independent Expert Advice  Framework legislation should establish the government's use of independent expert advice on climate change policy. While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides a comprehensive assessment of the science of climate change and the policy response at the global level, it does not provide advice on countries' targets and policy proposals, nor does it assess countries' progress in implementation. Country-level independent expert advisers bring science, research, and evidence to the policy-making process. They can focus on the long-term objectives, enhancing credibility and reinforcing continuity of policy choices in the face of short-term partisan political priorities (Averchenkova, Fankhauser, and Finnegan 2018; Averchenkova, Fankhauser, and Finnegan 2020). This is often achieved by setting up an advisory body whose members are typically appointed by the government, or in some cases by the legislature. Experts are usually academics and technical specialists. In some cases, the advisory body may include the private sector and  civil society. Framework legislation will typically require the advisory body to review and comment on climate risks and vulnerabilities, targets, policy initiatives, and implementation reports. Climate advisory bodies may complement or work alongside existing entities, such as national risk boards, which address climate change in the context of a wider range of environmental, social, and economic risks (World Bank 2013). Advisory bodies may have a budget that allows them to play a proactive role, commissioning research and evaluations of specific policies. In some cases, framework legislation requires the government to respond to the advisory body's recommendations and comments. Ideally, the advisory body and its communications with the government are published. This strengthens the accountability of the policy process. Advisory bodies will usually draw on experts from national institutions. Where the requisite expertise is not available domestically, advisory bodies may be able to draw on experts in other countries and international institutions.  Climate change advisory bodies In Mexico, independent advice is provided through the Consultative Council on Climate Change (C3). A permanent consultative body, C3 comprises representatives from civil society, the private sector, and academia. C3 recommends studies and policies, proposes adaptation and mitigation goals, and promotes stakeholder participation. C3 does not have a designated budget and its members operate on a voluntary basis. The law designates the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change as the entity for coordination of scientific research on climate change and the provision of technical and scientific assistance to the Ministry for the Environment. In Costa Rica, Decree No. 40615 creates the Scientific Council on Climate Change as an independent consultative body of academics, researchers, and experts to advise the government on climate science and technological development. The council is attached to the Climate Change Directorate of the Ministry of Environment and Energy and prepares reports at the request of the ministry, as well as having the authority to express itself on relevant matters. The UK Climate Change Committee plays a critical role in maintaining political commitment to climate goals and adherence to the Climate Change Act. The committee comprises eight experts from academia, business, civil society, and politics, with an adaptation subcommittee of six members. The act requires the committee to recommend emissions reduction targets to Parliament, advise the government on setting carbon budgets, and assess progress made in meeting them. The act requires Parliament to have access to the committee's advice and obliges the government to respond to the committee's recommendations, so that government cannot ignore their advice. The committee has an effective public communications function, and its advice is regularly referred to in the media.    Element 7: Coordination Mechanism  Framework legislation should establish mechanisms to coordinate a whole-of-government response to climate change across the process of policy development, implementation, and evaluation. Coordination is required horizontally, between agencies at each level of government, and vertically, across national, regional, and local tiers of government. Coordination is achieved through the alignment of actors around long-term targets for decarbonization and adaptation (element 1); intermediate and sectoral targets (element 2); and national, regional, and sectoral strategies and plans (element 4). Institutional arrangements can support these policy and planning processes. In some cases, climate change is addressed by an existing coordination body, typically a planning committee, where climate change policy and planning are addressed alongside other development priorities. More often, framework legislation establishes a  dedicated coordination body for climate change. This body should comprise representation at a senior level (typically head of agency), so that it has the authority to direct agencies' management and marshal financial and technical resources needed for policy development, planning, implementation, and monitoring. This can best be achieved where an agency from the center of government--such as the presidency, planning, or central finance agency--chairs the coordination body. Where the coordination body is chaired by an environmental agency, the framework legislation may need to provide the agency with adequate authority over other government agencies, such as through a clearance function for strategies, plans, policies, and monitoring reports. Framework legislation will typically mandate the frequency of meetings and the participation of relevant agencies and allocate human and financial resources needed to support coordination activities.  Coordination mechanisms Kenya's Climate Change Act 2016 established a National Climate Change Council, chaired by the president, as an overarching national climate change coordination mechanism and the lead agency in charge of climate change plans and actions. The act outlines specific duties for all state ministries, departments, and agencies; establishes a climate change directorate to lead implementation; and appoints a senior official to coordinate the mainstreaming of climate change into sectoral strategies. The council reports on implementation of climate change duties and functions each year. Mexico's law designates the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change (CICC), chaired by the cabinet secretary, as the coordination mechanism among the federal ministries. The Consultative Council on Climate Change is the permanent consultative body of the CICC, providing for participation of state governments, associations of municipal governments, and representatives of Congress. Bulgaria's Climate Change Mitigation Act of 2014 authorizes the Ministry of Environment and Water to lead coordination of climate action, with ministers in the cabinet serving as a coordination entity. The ministers must consult with the Ministry of Environment and Water on funding, must draft sectoral policies, and may appoint experts to assist them with their respective obligations and duties.   Element 8: Stakeholder Engagement  Framework legislation should put in place mechanisms for engagement with stakeholders outside of government, including civil society and the private sector. Stakeholder engagement should be addressed as part of the development, negotiation, and passage of framework legislation itself (as well as amendments). Framework legislation should institutionalize ongoing engagement with stakeholders to support the development of sectoral plans, policies, and instruments; monitoring of results; and identification of gaps or unintended negative consequences. Stakeholder engagement helps build a shared understanding of climate change risks and vulnerabilities, enables debate around policy options, generates information from differing perspectives, tests reactions to policy initiatives, and promotes consensus around the policy response. Effective processes for  engaging stakeholders have clear objectives, are inclusive and transparent, enable dialogue between stakeholders, and have feedback loops so that stakeholders are informed about how their inputs are used (or not used). Participation in the stakeholder engagement process should encompass a wide range of private sector, academic, civil society, and local community interests. Framework legislation typically constitutes a forum, council, or assembly to facilitate debate. Framework or subsidiary legislation may provide for specific forums to address sectoral, regional, or local issues. Special consideration should be given to groups that would otherwise have limited voice in the policy process and may be adversely affected by climate change and by policies, such as indigenous peoples, minorities, and low-income communities.  Stakeholder engagement Colombia's framework law on climate change set up the National Council for Climate Change as a permanent consultation body to ensure effective coordination between the government and unions, civil society, the Congress, and academia. Ireland has created a Citizens' Assembly on climate change, and Costa Rica has created a Citizen Advisory Council and Citizen Consultative Council on Climate Change. In Mexico, the law requires the Inter-Ministerial Commission on Climate Change to make available on the web a detailed annual report on the general state of the climate; the results of evaluations of the National Climate Change Policy; and promotion of civil society's participation in planning, implementation, and oversight of policy. Peru's Framework Law on Climate Change provides for the rights and participation of indigenous stakeholders.  Element 9: Subnational Government  The role of subnational government in framework legislation will be shaped by the institutional arrangements and functional responsibilities of national and subnational governments as defined in the constitution and organic legislation. The scope for national government to regulate the policy process and dictate policy will typically be greater in states where subnational  governments are administratively subordinate to national government, as in unitary states, compared with states where subnational government is autonomous, as in federations. In all states, there will be functions that are the sole jurisdiction of national or subnational government and functions that are shared. Within these bounds, framework legislation can clarify the responsibility of subnational government to tax, regulate,    and spend in the implementation of climate change policy and delegate specific roles and mandates of central government to subnational authorities. Framework legislation may require subnational governments to set targets, prepare plans and strategies, and report on implementation. Where subnational governments are required to set decarbonization and adaptation targets, some flexibility will be needed to respond to local conditions and allow subnational administrations to set higher levels of ambition than the national government. Strategies and plans may be dedicated to climate change or require the integration of climate change policy in routine planning instruments, such as development plans, land use plans, and the annual budget process. Institutional arrangements may be put in place to facilitate coordination across tiers of government, while allowing them flexibility to respond to local conditions. Framework legislation should provide subnational governments with the means and incentives to decarbonize and adapt within their areas of competence. The policy instruments used by national government to empower and engage subnational government typically include a combination of the following: · Information to raise awareness and the capability of subnational governments may include territorial climate risk and vulnerability assessments and the underlying data, scientific information, and technological research on decarbonization and adaptation. Subnational governments also can be required to publish territorial climate risk and vulnerability assessments, climate change policies, strategies, and plans and report on their implementation.  · Regulations encompass rules, standards, and enforcement arrangements that limit, guide, or empower subnational government to regulate in line with national climate change policy, including through building standards and codes; land use zoning and spatial planning regulations; and regulations on functions assigned to subnational authorities such as transport, energy, waste, water, and land use management. · Programs can promote decarbonization, reduce vulnerability, and increase resilience of households, businesses, and public agencies through grants and transfers that finance investments and services implemented by subnational authorities. · Fiscal measures at the subnational government level can promote decarbonization, reduce vulnerability, and increase resilience, for example, through mandates to raise green taxes and charges. Such measures assign social costs using a ""polluter pays"" principle (such as traffic congestion charges) or recover the cost of protecting assets against the physical risks of climate charge (such as variable property taxes). · Fiscal management practices that reduce vulnerability align resource allocation across the public sector with decarbonization and resilience objectives. For example, they can require local authorities to report on public expenditures that undermine climate change objectives; publish assessments of the fiscal risks related to extreme weather events and long-term environmental change; and apply climate vulnerability assessments in the design and appraisal of all programs and projects.  Subnational governments In China, the central government sets a national target, which is allocated downward to provinces. The performance management system is used to incentivize action by subnational officials. Mexico's General Law on Climate Change mandates Mexico's 32 states and 2,475 municipalities to develop local mitigation and adaptation programs and provides for their representation in the National Climate Change System. Colombia's framework law requires regional, municipal, and district authorities to incorporate climate change management into their development and land management plans. The United Kingdom's Climate Change Act mandates that the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland create their own policies and implement national targets, even though there are no provisions for councils, cities, and the English regions. Scotland and Wales have adopted their own climate change laws and policies, which draw upon and interact with the Climate Change Act. The act also creates a common analytical resource in the form of the Climate Change Committee to assist in the development and implementation of regional policy frameworks.   Element 10: Financing Implementation  Framework legislation should require national government to address climate change risks and policy objectives in the preparation of its public financial management instruments. The principal instruments include macroeconomic and fiscal risk assessments; medium- and long-term fiscal and budget frameworks; the identification, appraisal, and selection of programs and investment projects; annual budget documents; budget execution reports; and financial statements. Medium- and long-term fiscal planning and predictability in the allocation of resources is critical. It allows public entities to plan and finance long-term structural changes in infrastructure and economic activity, and it communicates the government's policy commitment to businesses and households. Detailed arrangements for  how climate change risks and policy objectives should be reflected in these instruments is best addressed in subsidiary regulations. Several framework laws require governments to address climate change in their annual budget process. Climate change considerations can also be taken into account outside of the budget process, for instance by requiring fiscal risk assessments and program and project appraisals to assess physical and transitional risks during project preparation. Publication of information on public finances and climate change will inform debate on policy priorities. Framework legislation may require government to publish assessments of climate-related physical and transition risks and details of the proposed allocation and application of funds in support of climate change policies.  Budget policy Sweden's climate change law explicitly states that climate and national budgetary policies should be aligned and requires that investment-related impacts be explicitly taken into account in its four-year climate plan. It also requires that the annual government report on climate action be connected to its budget bill, strengthening the link between the two. France's law requires that its annual implementation report be connected with the budget bill. The report contains information on dedicated public and private funds and calculates the gap to the required volumes. Germany's climate law links to the annual budget process through an overview on progress by sector and includes information on the cost of purchasing external credits to meet EU climate target obligations. The law also includes an obligation to assess the impact of federal and state investments on climate targets. Spain's draft law envisions the allocation of a determined share of the annual budget to climate-related purposes.   Framework legislation may establish dedicated funds to finance climate change initiatives. The source of funds and criteria for the application of funds should be specified in the framework legislation, together with the fund's governance, reporting, and oversight arrangements. Good practice in public expenditure management discourages the use of dedicated funds because they fragment the resources available to government and create inflexibility in allocation of resources in support of a policy objective. The rationale for the creation  of a climate change fund is strongest where the fund will be financed from resources that have been mobilized specifically to achieve climate change­related goals, for example, taxes that have been earmarked for climate change activities. Use of a segregated climate change fund can increase confidence that funds will be used for the purposes intended and so help overcome political resistance to new, additional taxes and charges (World Bank 2014).  Climate Change Funds Mexico's climate law refers to market-based mechanisms to achieve its targets and establishes a Climate Change Fund to attract and channel public, private, national, and international financial resources to support the implementation of actions to combat climate change. The provisions related to the fund outline the major sources of its assets (domestic budget, donations, international finance, taxes, and other charges) and allowable expenses. Paraguay's National Law on Climate Change of 2017 creates a Climate Change Fund under the Environment Secretariat. The secretariat oversees public and private funds directed toward mitigation and adaptation. Brazil's Law 12.144/2009 and Decree 7.343/2010 establishes the National Fund on Climate Change to develop technologies for mitigation, research, project and inventory systems and methodologies, and reduction of emissions from deforestation and land use change. Bangladesh's Climate Change Trust Fund Act of 2010 created the Climate Change Trust Fund as a designated mechanism to fund actions to address the adverse impacts of climate change. The trust fund draws on various sources, including state budget and foreign aid. Tuvalu's Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund Act of 2015 establishes a fund to finance the provision of vital services to combat climate change and natural disasters. Guatemala's framework law of 2013 creates a National Fund for Climate Change to finance risk management plans, programs, and projects for adaptation, mitigation, enhancement of capacities, payment for ecosystem services for carbon sinks, water production and protection, and more.   Element 11: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification  Measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems should generate the information needed to track progress toward national climate change targets, support the national policy-making process, and monitor compliance with international commitments.9 MRV systems inform the review, revision, and evaluation of targets, risk assessments, strategies and plans, and policy instruments (elements 1­5). MRV systems also support independent expert advice, coordination, stakeholder engagement, and oversight (elements 6­8 and 12). The data generated through MRV systems can serve a broader developmental purpose. It can contribute to independent research, raise awareness, and facilitate debate on climate change policy. The data can help businesses assess markets and identify investment opportunities.  Framework legislation should regulate arrangements for MRV. Typically, framework legislation will define the broad categories of information that the government will gather; empower government to gather information from across the public sector, from businesses, and from households; require the government to publish periodic reports on the implementation and impact of climate change policy; and provide public access to data with appropriate data protection safeguards. Framework legislation may assign institutional responsibility--standard setting, consolidation of data, and verification of information provided by third parties--to a specialized MRV entity given the technical complexity of the information.  Measurement, reporting, and verification Mexico's General Law on Climate Change creates a transparency framework and mandates the government to develop a registry of GHG emissions and short-lived climate pollutants from mobile and stationary sources, as well as develop regulations determining what sources need to report to the registry; the methodologies for calculating emissions; and the system for monitoring, reporting, and verifying emissions. The law also imposes penalties for noncompliance with the requirements to submit information and provides for an annual national report on climate change. The law further contains provisions for the periodic and systematic evaluation of the national climate change policy to be carried out at least every two years. The United Kingdom's Climate Change Act mandates the secretary of state to publish guidance on measurement of GHG emissions. It requires the government to develop guidance for reporting authorities on how to measure and report on the impacts of climate change. The government is required to report every five years on the risks of climate change to the United Kingdom, and publish a program setting out how these impacts will be addressed. Tunisia has adopted an MRV system for its nationally appropriate mitigation action, using both ex ante and ex post calculations of emissions, financial flows, and energy use, which are updated annually. South Africa uses its National Climate Change Response Database to allow users to access relevant information on mitigation, adaptation, and other projects throughout the country. The system highlights the country's progress in reaching its emissions reduction targets and allows for more informed decision making. Colombia has created a National Registry of Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, which includes a National Registry of Programs and Projects for the Reduction of Emissions due to Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Colombia uses units of GHG reductions or removals as part of a voluntary mechanism in lieu of a national carbon tax. It has developed a publicly accessible online platform to track finance on decarbonization and adaptation projects (Bravo Cordoba 2018). 9. The element Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) fulfills an obligation of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to inform the Conference of the Parties of the actions they have taken or envisage they will take to implement the Convention. Developing country parties are required to measure GHG emissions and removals by sinks; emission reductions and enhancement of removals associated with mitigation actions compared to a baseline scenario; progress in climate change mitigation and adaptation, achievement of sustainable development goals and co-benefits; and finance, technology and capacity-building support received. Reporting entails submission of national communications every four years and biennial update reports (BURs) every two years. Verification may be undertaken through national systems and through international consultation and analysis. Countries must communicate their domestic arrangements for MRV (United Nations Climate Change Secretariat 2014).   Element 12: Oversight  Framework legislation should mandate oversight of implementation. Oversight encompasses verification of executive compliance with obligations under the law. Framework legislation typically requires the executive branch to submit periodic reports to the legislature. It may also require the executive to submit proposals to adjust its strategies, plans, and policies if it fails to meet, or is at risk of failing to meet, targets specified in legislation. The legislature's oversight considers the inputs from independent expert advice; stakeholder engagement; and measurement, reporting, and  verification (elements 6, 8, and 11). Expert advisory and stakeholder consultative bodies may be required to report directly to the legislature to ensure their independence from the executive branch. Supreme audit institutions may be mandated to conduct periodic compliance and performance audits of government climate change policy and report back to the legislature (INTOSAI 2010). Courts can provide an independent mechanism for interested parties to bring cases seeking compliance with the framework law.  Oversight Colombia's framework climate law requires the president to present to Congress a consolidated report on the country's progress in complying with the Nationally Determined Contribution a year before the report is due to be provided to the UNFCCC. Kenya's law requires the cabinet secretary (minister) for environment and climate change to report biannually to the parliament on the status of international and national climate commitments and on progress toward achieving low­ carbon, climate-resilient development. The law also provides broad standing for citizens to bring claims before the Environment and Land Court in response to actions that have adversely affected, or are likely to affect, mitigation and adaptation efforts. The United Kingdom's model creates strong parliamentary oversight of both policy development and implementation. The Climate Change Act requires the secretary of state to report to Parliament with an annual statement on GHG emissions. The independent advisory body, the Climate Change Committee, is mandated to prepare an annual report on the status of implementation of the carbon budgets and an assessment on whether the government is on track to meet the budgets. Progress reports on adaptation are prepared by the committee biannually and are also presented to Parliament. The secretary of state has a duty under the law to present to Parliament a detailed response to the committee's reports, with clear timelines specified in the act. This regular reporting keeps climate policy on the parliamentary (and thus public) agenda and ensures transparency and accountability for progress, with the main incentive for compliance being the threat of judicial review. Strong parliamentary oversight and the requirement for the government to respond to the committee's advice set the UK accountability framework apart from many other countries and ensure greater effectiveness of the independent body. In July 2020, the Supreme Court of Ireland ruled that the government's 2017 national mitigation plan fell short of the required action to meet the target contained in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act of 2015 (the target being an 80 percent reduction of 1990 levels by 2050). The legal action was brought by a civil society organization. In reaching its decision, the court took note of the views of an independent expert advisory body established under the act. The court ordered the government to submit a more specific national mitigation plan that covers the whole period to 2050. Given that the mitigation targets had been established in law, the court rejected arguments that climate policy was a matter for the government alone to determine.   >>> Application of Key Elements in Existing Framework Laws This guide applied the questions in the summary sheet to national climate change framework legislation to assess the incidence of the elements across the laws (figure A.1) and the integration of the elements in the framework law of each country (figure A.2) based on the specific framework law reviewed rather than on how the element is addressed through the regulatory framework overall. An element was determined to be either integrated, somewhat integrated, or not integrated into the relevant framework law based on the summation of answers to each question (yes, no, or partial), and the number of questions under each element (see appendix A for more detail). The purpose of this analysis is to provide an overall view of the incidence of the 12 elements and offer a snapshot of examples for countries to use to guide the development of new or updated climate legislation. The purpose is not to rate individual country legislation. In some countries the elements may not be relevant. In some countries the elements may be addressed in other regulatory instruments which were not covered by this analysis. The elements that appear most frequently in climate change framework legislation are Measurement, Reporting and Verification (element 11), Climate Change Strategies and Plans (element 4) and Policy Instruments (element 5) which are integrated or somewhat integrated in more than 80 percent of the laws. The elements that appear least frequently are Long-Term Targets (element 1), Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (element 3), and Intermediate and Sectoral Targets (element 2), which are integrated or somewhat integrated in less than half of the laws.

ACRONYMS v   The Adaptation Principles: A summary  Climate change is causing risks and pressures that increasingly force societies to rethink their priorities and principles for achieving societal well-being and economic development. Proactive and robust actions are crucial to safeguard the continued potential of sustainable development. If prioritized according to countries' objectives, needs, and risks, such actions can help reduce and manage climate risks, accelerating development and poverty reduction.  This guide aims to help ministries of finance or economy--who oversee the wider economic system-- approach adaptation challenges. It does not go into detailed adaptation strategies at sector level; rather, it focuses on concrete macro-economic-level actions. These actions reflect universal principles for effective climate change adaptation, though the relative importance and sequence of these actions will differ by country.  SUMMARY  The actions pertain to six principles of climate change adaptation, which correspond to common policy domains (figure S.1): 1 Ensure development is rapid and inclusive and offers protection against shocks 2 Facilitate the adaptation of firms and people 3 Adapt land use and protect critical public assets and services 4 Help firms and people cope with and recover from disasters and shocks 5 Anticipate and manage macroeconomic and fiscal risks 6 Prioritize, implement, and monitor interventions   This guide contains practical tools, concrete examples and other information to guide decision makers through the principles of adaptation and help governments formulate effective strategies that enable their societies to thrive in a time of climate change. These include:  SCREENING QUESTIONS >> to identify the most urgent and effective actions to increase climate resilience and guide the selection of the priorities.  TOOLBOXES >> offering concrete quantitative examples of how these questions can be answered using commonly available data and methods.  INDICATORS AND TARGETS >> to monitor and evaluate progress towards the objectives mandated by a national adaptation strategy. Annex 1 lists proposed indicators or targets, though the list is not exhaustive and other options are available.  COVID-19 SPOTLIGHTS >> providing information on how the current health and economic crisis changes the priorities and preferred solutions for building resilience and adapting to climate change.  A common theme to each of the policy areas and proposed actions is the large uncertainty on future climate change, especially at the local level, and future vulnerabilities. The direct implication is the need to design adaptation and resilience strategies in a risk management and continuous learning framework. This means avoiding measures that are designed for a precise scenario of the future, instead prioritizing interventions that are robust and flexible, and can be adjusted over time as more information becomes available.    Lay the foundations for adaptation through rapid, robust, and inclusive development LEAD MINISTRY: Finance/economy Policies to reduce poverty and catalyze robust economic development are most effective for reducing vulnerability to climate change. Poverty and the lack of access to basic services--including critical infrastructure, financial services, health care, and social protection--are strong predictors of vulnerability to climate change. No targeted adaptation strategy can be successful without eradicating extreme poverty and ensuring high-vulnerability populations have the financial, technical, and institutional resources they need to adapt. ACTION F.1 >> Increase economic productivity and growth, while keeping buffers for shocks Recommendations to improve economic growth and accelerate development have been widely studied and advocated elsewhere, so it is not a focus in this document. But without appropriate economic and social policies, targeted adaptation measures alone cannot reduce vulnerability to climate change in a significant manner. Macroeconomic stability and the usual buffers against shock also improve countries' ability to deal with unexpected shocks or stresses, including climate-related ones. ACTION F.2 >> Ensure that economic growth is inclusive It is vital that nobody is left behind. And while rapid development usually reduces poverty and therefore extreme vulnerability to climate change, it can also hide large heterogeneity across regions or socioeconomic groups. Ensuring smallholder farmers have resilient livelihoods and all populations have access to infrastructure services (such as sanitation) and risk management tools (such as savings accounts, health care coverage, and social protection) is the most efficient way of reducing the long-term impact of climate change and natural disasters. Toolbox A--in the main text of this guide--offers examples of how to explore these dimensions using commonly available data and specialized indicators, such as the University of Notre Dame Adaptation Initiative's ND-GAIN Index or the World Bank's Socioeconomic Resilience Indicator. While good development and the eradication of extreme poverty can do much to reduce future climate change impacts (and short-term disaster losses), additional adaptation and resilience actions can also be beneficial and highly cost-effective. This guide therefore also covers four priority areas for action. SUMMARY  PRIORITY AREA 1 >> Facilitate the adaptation of people and firms LEAD MINISTRY: Economy The good news is that private actors have an incentive to increase their resilience and adapt to climate change. However, they face a range of obstacles, from the lack of information and behavioral biases to imperfect markets and financial constraints. Governments need to minimize these obstacles to maximize the economy's adaptive capacity and prevent (as much as possible and desirable) climate change impacts and natural disasters. ACTION 1.1 >> Assess disaster and climate risks, and make the information available Governments must ensure the information people need to adapt to climate change and manage natural risks is widely accessible, free (or cheap enough), and in a simple format that decision makers can use. People and firms need information on many kinds of threat--those from natural hazards, threats to human capital and key sectors, and cross-border threats, including risks linked to food prices. One important consideration relates to uncertainty on future climates and the likelihood of various natural hazards. When deciding how to communicate climate change information to the public, governments must ensure they communicate the large uncertainty around future climate change impacts, and not only one ""most likely"" scenario. ACTION 1.2 >> Clarify responsibilities and align incentives with adaptation and resilience objectives To ensure that private actors--households and firms--are making the right decisions to manage climate change and natural disasters, governments should clearly establish responsibilities and liabilities in law, and communicate these to all actors. Private actors should be informed about the extent of disaster protection provided by public investments and infrastructure. For example, in the Netherlands, the level of flood protection that the government is required to provide to the population is legally defined, so individuals and firms can decide where to live and invest, and what additional flood management measures they need to invest in. And when private firms provide public services--such as electricity supply-- then regulation is needed to define risk management responsibilities in a way that aligns private actors' incentives with public interest (including in the case of force majeure) (figure S.2).   ACTION 1.3 >> Facilitate access to technologies through trade policies and investments in research and development Effective adaptation will depend on countries being able to draw on the best available technologies for mitigating climate change impacts, especially in the agriculture and health sectors. But there are many obstacles--from traditional knowledge spillover and lack of capacity to trade barriers--that impair access to and adoption of technologies. International patent registrations show that innovation in adaptation is not growing as a share of total innovation (figure S.3) and is concentrated in high-income countries and a handful of middle-income countries. Transfers of this innovation are also insufficient, with almost no transfers to low-income countries, where needs are likely the largest. This suggests the need for countries to support all types of innovation--from high-tech solutions to institutional and process-based innovation--with a focus on local needs, and to facilitate technology transfers with appropriate regulations, trade policies, and capacity-building investments. ACTION 1.4 >> Ensure financing is available to all, and provide direct support to the poorest and most vulnerable people High upfront costs or affordability issues may stop private actors from implementing effective solutions. Even if these costs are more than compensated in the long term by avoided impacts and losses, the lack of financing can be a serious obstacle for credit-constrained firms and households. And in the absence of external support, hundreds of millions of people in or close to poverty will be impacted by climate change and have limited ability to respond and adapt. Direct support through social protection or subsidies for resilience-building interventions can play a key role in reducing their vulnerability. Toolbox B--in the main text of this guide--reviews methodologies to identify the most at-risk population due to the combination of poverty and vulnerability.   ACTION 1.5 >> Facilitate structural change in the economic system Climate change will affect latent comparative advantage. For example, it will make some countries less productive in certain types of agriculture, to the benefit of others; it will also cause the decline of some sectors and the growth of others. Governments need to manage and facilitate economic transition, deal with coordination issues, and ensure social consequences are minimized. In practice, however, the risk is that an important sunset sector (one that is bound to lose competitiveness in coming years and decades) becomes non-profitable exactly when the country needs to be making large investments to boost another sector. Experience from regions where coal mining or heavy industries disappeared in Europe shows how difficult it is to manage a successful transition, especially when a region has a narrow economic base, is isolated geographically, and has a population with limited skills and investment capacity. Governments have various options for addressing this situation: » Support sunrise sectors and activities to maximize their development potential. Climate change may create new comparative advantages in some countries, and those where key sectors will be negatively affected must prepare to capture the opportunities climate change creates. However, if these comparative advantages face obstacles such as high upfront capital investments, increasing returns to scale, or network effects, then a country may struggle to turn such latent advantages into growth and economic opportunities. Several studies offer guidance on how industrial policies can help transform latent comparative advantages into real economic opportunities, especially if countries face the risk of a low-productivity trap. » Manage sunset sectors and activities to facilitate a smooth transition. Some economic sectors may be strongly affected by climate change, with significant implications for jobs and tax revenues. For example, some agricultural production may become non-competitive or unsustainable, snow-based tourism may disappear from low-altitude mountains and summer destinations may become too hot to attract tourists. Targeted policies can help declining industries better manage the drop in activity (for example, by ensuring the least productive firms close first). This may be costly, but it can be justified by distributional considerations or the desire to smooth a transition. » Support economic diversification to hedge against climate risks. Diversifying away from narrow economic bases is key to reducing vulnerability to climate change and other technological or preference shocks, including those caused by decarbonizing the world economy. But it is also desirable for governments to diversify their economy to accelerate economic growth. SUMMARY  PRIORITY AREA 2 >> Adapt land use plans and protect critical public assets and services LEAD MINISTRY: Economy, planning, investment, or infrastructure Beyond direct support to households and businesses, governments have a transformative role to play in ensuring their country, their economy and their citizens can adapt to climate change. This is particularly the case to ensure the adaptation of important public assets and infrastructure systems such as power systems, roads, water and sanitation, and essential services such as health care, education, safety and security. Urban and land use plans also influence massive private investments in housing and productive assets, so it is vital these adapt to evolving long-term climate risks to avoid locking people into high-risk areas. ACTION 2.1 >> Identify critical public services and assets Critical public services such as energy, water, health care, civil protection, and education need to take a thorough approach to assessing and managing climate risks. Not only can their reconstruction be costly; they also provide critical services which people's well-being depends on. For a systematic risk and vulnerability assessment, governments must develop inventories of key public assets, including primary health care facilities, hospitals, and schools. Assessing the resilience of service delivery in critical sectors can also be a useful exercise. In networked systems, such as transport or power systems, the criticality analysis described in toolbox C--in the main text of this guide--can help governments identify the most important assets or system components, to invest more resources in their resilience (figure S.4). ACTION 2.2 >> Design and implement a government-wide strategy to increase the resilience of infrastructure and public assets There is a consensus among experts that governments have a key role to play in ensuring the resilience of critical infrastructure and that they should adopt a whole-of-government approach. Infrastructure disruptions in developing countries are estimated to cost firms more than $300 billion and households over $90 billion each year. But if countries have the right data, risk models, and decision-making methods available, the incremental cost of building the resilience of infrastructure assets is small--only around 3 percent of investment needs.   The main challenge to making infrastructure more resilient is thus not primarily a financing one. Rather, it is a question of governance and the ability to make and enforce good decisions, designs, operations, and maintenance. One priority is focusing on the early stages of infrastructure system development: designing regulations, producing hazards data and master plans, or the initial stages of asset design (toolbox D in the main text of this guide). This is when small, lowcost investments can significantly improve the overall resilience of infrastructure systems, generating huge benefits. The other priority is improving maintenance. As well as increasing the vulnerability of infrastructure assets, poor maintenance also increases infrastructure investment needs by 50 percent in the transport sector and more than 60 percent in the water sector. Using an infrastructure asset management system to ensure proper maintenance, utility companies can better manage their operations, reduce operational costs, and boost resilience.   ACTION 2.3 >> Revise land use and urban plans to make them risk-informed Land markets are powerful tools for driving new construction in a way that efficiently meets population needs. However, they are also imperfect, and often fail to fully internalize climate change and natural hazards. In some countries, land markets are even dysfunctional, with most of the population living in dwellings that have informal arrangements and no land use or urban planning. As a result, developments often occur in risky areas, especially when developers do not carry the cost of future climate change impacts. Land use regulations can help by ensuring that new development takes place in safe areas or those that can be easily and cheaply protected. They can also avoid unchecked urban development that leaves too little porous green space, further increasing runoff and flood risk. Where possible, governments should mandate local authorities to revise their land use and urbanization plans, using hazard maps that consider climate change (toolbox E in the main text of this guide). Choices around the localization of power, water, sanitation, and transit infrastructure guide spatial development and influence land use, land use intensity, land values, and employment and population densities (figure S.5). Planners can use infrastructure master plans and new investments to guide urban growth towards safe zones. Risk-sensitive land use and urbanization plans must also abide by construction norms and building regulations. The quality of construction and the role played by building regulations are key determinants of climate resilience. In places with little capacity to create and enforce risk-sensitive land use and urban plans, alternative approaches include allocating the riskiest land such as flood zones to non-residential use--for example, by creating urban parks to minimize the risk of encroachment.   PRIORITY AREA 3 >> Help firms and people manage residual risks and natural disasters LEAD MINISTRY: Interior or environment While effective risk mitigation can go a long way in reducing losses and damages, some natural shocks are too extreme and intense to be prevented. Governments must develop strategies to ensure that when disasters do occur, people and firms can cope without devastating long-term consequences, and can recover quickly. ACTION 3.1 >> Save lives (and money) with hydromet, early warning, and emergency management systems Weather forecasts enable the anticipation of and preparation for extreme events, and timely evacuation can save thousands of lives. Preparation reduces physical damage and economic losses--for example, shuttering windows ahead of a hurricane can reduce damage by up to 50 percent. The benefits of providing universal access to early warning systems globally have been repeatedly found to largely exceed costs, by factors of at least 4 to 10. There is also a set of good practices to ensure that early warnings are communicated properly so that people can act upon them and that shelters meet communities' needs. This includes considering gender issues, access for people with disabilities, and how to organize shelters in times of epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19. ACTION 3.2 >> Provide all firms and households with risk management instruments Helping households cope with and recover from shocks requires a holistic and flexible risk management strategy with a range of policy instruments appropriate for different disasters and affected populations. Poorer and richer households have different needs and can be supported with different instruments (figure S.6).  ACTION 3.3 >> Develop the insurance sector, building on public-private partnerships Domestic disaster insurance markets can be an effective channel for developing the resilience of disaster-exposed households and businesses. Governments can use their own resources to support domestic insurance markets and reach households and businesses with insurance products, realizing their policy goals of expanding the population's financial resilience to disasters. The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool and the Mongolian Livestock Insurance Pool are good examples of public-private partnerships that have substantially increased insurance penetration at the local level. But developing insurance markets is challenging, particularly in low-income environments. Where insurance is not compulsory, pick-up rates remain low. This includes high-income countries, even where insurance is heavily subsidized.    ACTION 3.4 >> Build a social protection system and make it responsive to shocks For the poorest households, savings are often not an option, and high transaction costs and affordability issues make access to private insurance challenging. These households need well-targeted and easily scalable social safety nets. Adaptive social protection systems have proven to be critical for channeling resources to those who are most in need due to climate stresses. Based on existing social protection systems, adaptive systems can respond quickly to disasters or slow-onset climate crises by: » Scaling up or providing additional resources to regular beneficiaries--for example, in Fiji, all beneficiaries of the Poverty Benefit Scheme received exceptional transfers after Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016 » Scaling out or providing support to additional beneficiaries during bad times or years--for example, the number of beneficiaries of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program depends on rainfall. Toolbox F--in the main text of this guide--discusses methodologies to estimate the benefits (and benefit-cost ratios) of investing in adaptive social protection systems, taking beneficiary vulnerability into account. It is important to design post-shock or postdisaster support in a way that does not disincentivize adaptation to long-term trends. For example, support to areas that are increasingly affected by drought should not lock people in place, especially if the trend is expected to worsen over time. Instead, postdisaster support should help people change activity or migrate if that will improve their prospects.   A few months into the COVID-19 crisis, almost all countries have boosted their social protection systems to help their populations manage the pandemic and the consequences of needed containment measures. If designed and implemented sustainably, and if efforts are maintained over the long term, any improvements made during the current  crisis could improve all social protection systems' capacity to scale up quickly and efficiently next time countries are affected by a major shock, including climate-related shock. This includes, for example, creating and maintaining household registries and electronic payment mechanisms.    ACTION 3.5 >> Help firms develop business continuity plans and financial preparedness Individual firms' ability to cope with a shock and continue to produce in the aftermath of a disaster depends on many factors, but they can do a lot to become more resilient. The usual recommendation is to identify threats, assess risks, and consider mitigation options. This allows firms to invest in prevention--for example, by adding a generator in case of power outage, investing in movable flood protection, or even elevating critical equipment. It also helps them prepare for residual risk. Preparing business continuity plans (BCPs) can ensure a firm's management and workers know what to do in case of disaster, to maintain or restore production as fast as possible. BCPs should consider a firm's full supply chain and include issues that may affect suppliers (or suppliers' suppliers) and clients. Other things to consider include financial issues, such as how to manage a drop in sales, increased supply prices, or the urgent need to replace expensive pieces of equipment. Access to contingent credit lines and appropriate insurance are among the many tools that firms can include in their BCP. ACTION 3.6 >> Be prepared to build back better after a disaster with contingency plans and financing When a disaster hits and old or low-quality assets are destroyed, countries can build back better, under improved building norms, thereby improving both productivity and resilience. But this does not always happen, often because the urgency to reconstruct leaves little time and few resources to rethink the design or spatial footprint of cities and infrastructure. Building back better depends on the ability to plan and implement the reconstruction process efficiently, or on the existence of plans prepared before the crisis occurs.   PRIORITY AREA 4 >> Manage financial and macrofiscal issues LEAD MINISTRY: Finance The impact of climate change on the economy will affect activity and tax revenues, and strong impacts on major sectors (especially exporting ones) can affect a country's trade balance and capital flows. The combination of these factors may result in new risks for macroeconomic stability, public finances and debt sustainability, and the broader financial sector. Governments will need to manage these risks, considering the many channels involved (figure S.7). However, the macro-level impacts of climate change are extremely uncertain, and all quantified assessments should be considered as a partial approximation and used in a way that considers both this uncertainty and the possibility of surprises.   ACTION 4.1 >> Include contingent liabilities from natural disasters and environmental shocks in the planning and budgeting process Contingent liabilities only materialize if a certain event occurs--for example, if a flood damages roads, the government is responsible for repairing them. Including contingent liabilities in the budget planning process and making them part of the deliberation will ensure that authorities cannot ignore climate and disaster risks. Assessing risks for public finance should include: » Explicit contingent liabilities, which are relatively easy to estimate and based on public asset and infrastructure inventories (toolbox G in the main text of this guide). For example, if the state owns the public roads, it is responsible for fixing them. » Implicit contingent liabilities, which are linked to other forms of commitment. For example, governments will provide humanitarian and financial resources to support populations that are affected by a disaster or small and medium enterprises that cannot cope with the shock without going bankrupt. This expectation or political commitment creates an implicit liability that is more difficult to estimate (toolbox F in the main text of this guide). » Tax revenues, which also fall during a disaster, increasing the funding gap. For example, in 2018, Argentina lost an estimated $1.5 billion in tax revenue, mostly due to reduced export tax revenues after a severe drought in 2017. Tax revenue estimates are even more uncertain, as they depend on GDP impacts that are difficult to measure and anticipate with models (toolbox H in the main text of this guide).   ACTION 4.2 >> Develop a financial strategy to manage contingent liabilities, combining multiple instruments When a disaster or another environmental shock hits, there are urgent financial needs related to emergency response and humanitarian support to affected populations (Priority Area 3) and longer-term recovery and reconstruction costs, which can have a strong impact on public finance. In parallel, tax revenues often drop during the crisis and recovery phase. As a result, governments and local authorities can struggle to finance postdisaster response and reconstruction, while liquidity constraints can also affect their short-term response. Regardless of their origin, the most robust way to manage unexpected shocks is maintaining fiscal space in normal conditions, with manageable structural deficit and debt levels. It is also preferable to have a reasonably diversified and resilient tax collection system. Various instruments--such as contingent credit lines, insurance and catastrophe bonds, regional risk-sharing facilities, state contingent debt instruments and international aid--are available to cover the contingent liabilities created by natural hazards and other environmental risks. None of these instruments can meet all the needs, so a combination of tools is preferable (figure S.8). Some can cover short-term liquidity needs, while others are better for larger, longer-term reconstruction needs. Some are better placed for frequent, low-intensity events, while others can better manage massive shocks. It is also important to consider that instruments differ in terms of cost, timeliness, transparency, and predictability. As well as needing specific tools to address resource mobilization in postdisaster situations, the urgency and chaos of the situation creates specific challenges on the expenditure side. These need to be considered through a disaster-sensitive public finance management system.  ACTION 4.3 >> Anticipate and plan for long-term macroeconomic impacts Climate change will provoke other long-term changes in tax revenues and spending needs, with additional implications for economic growth and public finances. It is important for governments to understand these risks and construct an appropriate response strategy. They can use macrofiscal risk assessments as a standalone analysis, such as with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Climate Change Policy Assessments, or embed them into other long-term, macrolevel assessments. Two joint World Bank-IMF diagnostics can include disaster and climate risk: the Debt Sustainability Analysis, which can include macrofiscal risks of climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation plans; and the Financial Sector Assessment Program, which can include climate and disaster risks in the financial sector assessment, especially in stress testing exercises. Whichever approach governments use, looking at long-term effects will mean exploring long-term growth impacts, their consequences on public finances, and the uncertainty of possible assessments. Here, again, it is important to consider both revenue and spending. If, for example, a large part of a country's tax revenues come from export duty on a small set of vulnerable commodities, the country is highly exposed. Likewise, if sea level rise will require large investments in coastal defenses, the cost could threaten the position of public finances. Toolbox I --in the main text of this guide--reviews the methodologies available for such assessments. It also stresses their limitations, which need to be considered in decision making.   ACTION 4.4 >> Communicate and mitigate the disaster and climate risk exposure of the financial sector and pension systems One role of the financial system is to help the economy manage risks. But a history of financial crises has shown that it can also magnify the impact of a shock, if this shock exceeds the financial sector's capacity. Governments must therefore assess their financial system's ability to absorb climate shocks, to ensure it can play the role of adaptation facilitator and not create a crisis (see toolbox J in the main text of this guide, for example, on stress testing approaches). Climate change and natural disasters can impact the financial sector balance sheets through four overlapping channels: » Operational risk, such as damages to financial infrastructure » Market and liquidity risk, such as brutal changes in asset valuations » Credit risk, including shocks that adversely affect borrower repayment capacity or lower collateral prices » Underwriting risk, including errors in pricing of (re)insurance liabilities. Transparency alone could help reduce future losses. Information on firms' exposure to disaster and climate risks can help investors and decision makers adjust investments and portfolios to reduce exposure and future losses. Transparency on disaster and climate risks, as advocated by the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures,1 would also send a strong signal to firms' management that this is a topic of concern for investors, creating an incentive for all firms to manage their long-term risks better. Regulators could also consider imposing appropriate requirements to ensure firms' risk management approaches adequately capture investment risk profiles regarding natural hazards and other adaptation-relevant climate risks. Authorities can set out regulatory guidance or supervisory expectations to enhance firms' responses to these risks and actively monitor their implementation by integrating climate risk into existing regulatory frameworks. They should aim to address all aspects of firms' governance, risk management, and disclosure practices.   Prioritization, implemention, and monitoring progress LEAD MINISTRIES: Finance/economy and ministry or agency in charge of climate change (often environment) To effectively implement and assess these actions, governments must not only prioritize actions to make them compatible with available resources and capacity; they must also establish a robust institutional and legal framework, and a consistent system for monitoring progress. The objective is to ensure that all government departments and public agencies adopt and mainstream the adaptation strategy in all their decisions, and that governments continuously monitor and evaluate the impact of their decisions and actions, so they can address any challenges and adjust their actions accordingly. ACTION A.1 >> Create a strong institutional and legal framework, with appropriate stakeholder involvement The policy actions discussed in this report require an appropriate institutional and legal framework. Indeed, climate change framework laws can be crucial for formulating short-and long-term climate change targets--for example, most climate change framework laws have a ""knowledge"" or ""data"" component, which can help ensure that climate change-related information is available to public and private decision makers (Action 1.1). To ensure that climate change is properly addressed, a strong institutional framework is also needed, that: » Adapts the mandates of existing ministries, agencies, or institutions » Creates new agencies or committees when necessary (for example, water management agencies at the watershed level) » Establishes an overarching coordination body to ensure stakeholder involvement at each stage of the adaptation and resilience process, from strategy design to implementation and monitoring.   ACTION A.2 >> Design an adaptation and resilience strategy with prioritized actions Once they have established the appropriate institutional and legal framework, governments can design their adaptation and resilience strategy, with precise interventions, investments, and policies. No country has the capacity and resources to implement all possible measures and interventions for increasing resilience. So, prioritizing interventions is one of the adaptation strategy's (and the finance ministry's) main roles, as this will ensure the efficient use of limited resources. Multiple tools are available for prioritization, from traditional methods for appraising investments to more holistic approaches that account for societal benefits and uncertainty (see toolbox K in the main text of this guide and an illustration in figure S.9). The latter are crucial, as some interventions that may not be justified on the basis of pure economics are essential to protect communities from catastrophic risks. Overall, prioritization methodologies enable decision makers to identify a concrete subset of interventions that are most likely to deliver large net benefits. While some of these will target short-term priorities, they should also align with long-term plans and objectives--for example, governments should ensure COVID-19 recovery programs align with long-term growth objectives (spotlight S.2).  SPOTLIGHT S.2 >> COVID-19 A stimulus and recovery package that builds resilience  To accelerate recovery once the COVID-19 health emergency is under control, many governments are planning to introduce massive stimulus packages. These can be improved by considering not only the short-term needs for jobs and economic activity, but also actions to boost the resilience and sustainability of future development paths. Governments can use a sustainability checklist, for example, to screen potential projects, policies, and measures for inclusion in a stimulus package. Checklists should include:  » Short-term questions, such as: How many jobs will be created? Over which timeline? » Long-term questions, such as: Does the intervention enhance the long-term growth potential (for example, by improving the population skillset)? Does it make the economy and population more resilient? Does it facilitate the transition to a zero carbon economy and contribute to protecting and building natural capital? The key objective is to maximize short- and long-term gains through a careful selection of interventions.  ACTION A.3 >> Set concrete sector-level targets to guide implementation by line ministries Transport, energy, water, environment, social protection, and other ministries will implement and fund most adaptation and risk reduction interventions, and local authorities will also be important players. To allocate responsibilities, an adaptation and resilience strategy can set sector-level targets for 2025 or 2030, leaving detailed policy implementation for achieving the targets to the relevant ministries. The main text of this guide provides a list of potential indicators that can be used to set these goals. Having a representative body such as parliament approve a list of targets could significantly improve ownership and accountability and strengthen the strategy's authority. It could also help institutionalize a formal and regular reporting process (Action A.6). ACTION A.4 >> Screen all public policies and expenditures for disaster and climate risks, and align them with adaptation targets Adaptation measures can only be cost-effective if all investments and planning decisions consider climate-related risks in their design. To mainstream adaptation measures in this way, governments must systematically screen relevant policies and expenditures--even those without an explicit adaptation or climate rationale-- to avoid any negative effects on adaptation objectives. One priority is improving public investment management (PIM) to include specific actions and controls that will ensure public investments are consistent with adaptation strategy objectives and consider disaster and climate risks. The ultimate goal is mainstreaming climate change considerations in PIM across all institutions and all projects. Multiple tools are readily available to help governments conduct such a screening process. These include the World Bank Group's climate risk screening tools, which help project development teams assess possible climate change or disaster risks to their project and identify interventions for reducing risks and increasing resilience.   ACTION A.5 >> Allocate appropriate funding to the adaptation strategy Once an adaptation and resilience strategy has been prepared, it needs to be appropriately funded. A small dedicated adaptation budget may be needed, especially for monitoring and evaluating progress. However, most of the funding needs are for sectoral interventions--for example, more resilient roads, investments in irrigation, financial protection instruments, and so on. To fund such interventions, governments can create dedicated funds with the mandate of funding investment in resilience or climate change measures (adaptation and/or mitigation). But it may be preferable to integrate adaptation and resilience funding into sectoral budgets, rather than create dedicated budgets. For example, funding investments to increase resilience in the transport system through the transport infrastructure budget would ensure investments in the transport system and in transport resilience are consistent and synergetic. Budget tagging and expenditure reviews (toolbox L in the main text of this guide) can help track resources spent on adaptation and resilience, even when they are integrated in general budgets. ACTION A.6 >> Track progress over time, and review and revise the strategy Adaptation and resilience strategy can be further strengthened as new challenges and insights become apparent over time. Continuous tracking of progress indicators can highlight specific sectors in which implementation lags behind. If milestones are missed, implementation challenges--such as capacity or resource constraints, or coordination failures between implementing bodies--may become apparent that were not accounted for in the initial strategy design. Flexibility in the adaptation strategy would allow course corrections and adjustments to be programmed as integral elements of the strategy, rather than being regarded as admissions of failure. Such strategy revisions are also likely to become necessary as new challenges and risks arise--for example, the COVID-19 pandemic forced governments to reevaluate their approach to emergency management. Scientific advances and technologies are also likely to become available, enabling actors to implement actions in more targeted, cost-effective ways.   The Adaptation Principles: Introduction  Climate change is causing risks and pressures that increasingly force societies to rethink their priorities and principles for achieving societal well-being and economic development. Proactive and robust actions are crucial to safeguard the continued potential of sustainable development (GCA 2019). If prioritized according to countries' objectives, needs and risks, such actions can help reduce and manage climate risks, and accelerate development and poverty reduction.  This guide aims to help ministries of finance or economy--who oversee the wider economic system--to design national strategies for climate change, adaptation, and resilience. It does not go into detailed adaptation strategies at sector level; rather, it spells out concrete macro-economic-level actions to help countries' socioeconomic systems adapt to the challenges of climate change. These actions reflect universal principles for effective climate change adaptation, though the relative importance and sequence of these actions will differ by country.    Climate change impacts--and therefore the benefits of adapting to them--are often far in the future and uncertain in magnitude and even in nature. But this guide emphasizes that interventions dedicated to adapting to long-term climate change can also make countries more resilient to today's shocks and hazards. Despite the uncertainty around future climate change, most of the interventions highlighted here are robust, in the sense that they will deliver benefits independently of the exact manifestation of climate change. So, while policy design needs to manage and consider long time horizons and uncertainties, these are not obstacles to designing and implementing robust and efficient adaptation and resilience strategy. This guide is organized in sections that cover various policy domains, starting with the foundations (rapid and inclusive development). It then focuses on four priority action areas in turn, with recommendations on allocating responsibility and actions that governments can implement. The guide concludes with recommendations for prioritizing, implementing, monitoring, evaluating, and regularly reviewing an adaptation and resilience strategy. The annexes provide examples of indicators that governments can use to define policy targets or track progress over time and how to use indicators to identify policy priorities. Throughout the guide, there are practical tools, concrete examples and other information to guide decision makers through the principles of adaptation and help governments formulate effective climate change adaptation strategies that enable their societies to thrive in a time of climate change.   TAKING ACTION >> Tools for formulating effective climate change adaptation strategies  Screening questions >> Identify and tailor actions Every country faces a unique set of opportunities and risks. Some may have already achieved impressive progress in implementing climate change adaptation measures in certain sectors, but less so in others. Designing a climate change adaptation strategy will require decision makers to carefully evaluate their country's unique set of risks and past achievements in adaption, to identify priority measures. The screening questions in this guide will help decision makers identify the most urgent and effective actions that can help increase climate resilience, and tailor them to their country's specific needs and circumstances.  Toolboxes >> Evaluate risks and opportunities How should a country evaluate its unique climate risks and socioeconomic vulnerability? A wide range of data sources and analytical tools exists to help decision makers quantify risks and make informed planning and investment decisions, even in the face of uncertainty about the long-term implications of climate change and socioeconomic trends. The toolboxes in this guide highlight key quantitative indicators and the main analytical approaches that can be applied to address these questions. These tools are also essential for answering the screening questions to guide future actions.  Sample targets and indicators >> Monitor and evaluate progress A national adaptation strategy can only be effective if it is implemented consistently, and its progress is monitored continuously. A range of indicators can help governments assess their implementation progress. The good news is that the majority of such indicators are based on socioeconomic data that most countries already collect. Monitoring the indicators can help a government to not only track progress, but also adjust and improve its strategy as new insights are won. The concrete indicators proposed in this guide can help decision makers monitor and evaluate progress towards the objectives mandated by a national adaptation strategy.  COVID-19 >> Explore how the pandemic changes response The COVID-19 pandemic has created a major financial and economic crisis, though it is still too early to evaluate its magnitude, duration, and implications. Governments across the world have started to respond to COVID-19, through emergency strengthening of health care and social protection systems. They are also likely to implement large recovery and stimulus package to hasten the recovery. After the crisis is over, this response is bound to leave countries with even larger debts. The COVID-19 spotlights in this guide explore how the current context of health and economic crisis changes the priorities and preferred solutions to build resilience and adapt to climate change, over the short, medium, and long term.  inundations: Rapid, robust, and inclusive development is the first priority  LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance  Poverty--in terms of income and access to financial and public services--is one of the main reasons why countries and people are highly vulnerable to climate change (Hallegatte et al. 2016b). Together, these factors determine to a large extent how people can manage climate change and the accompanying risks. For example:   » Many smallholder farmers in low-income countries have low incomes, few savings and little diversification. This makes them highly vulnerable to losing crops to drought, floods, or pests. Their savings are often in livestock, housing, or some other material form, which can be lost in a natural disaster. » Many cities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) lack basic infrastructure to cope with climate-related risks and provide the services the population needs to manage these risks. For example, many informal settlements lack basic drainage infrastructure, have congested and vulnerable road networks, and poor-quality housing, leaving inhabitants vulnerable to high temperatures, floods, or landslides. » Many people in LMICs have limited access to health care or constrained health coverage, so any disease--whether related to climate stresses and shocks or not--can push them in poverty. With the expected impact of higher temperatures on many water or vector-borne diseases, better access to health care will help reduce social vulnerability. Development and poverty reduction are therefore extremely effective adaptation options. With climate change impacts expected to increase rapidly over the next decades, getting people out of poverty-driven climate-vulnerability situations is urgent. As climate shocks become more frequent, experience shows that poor people can be trapped in a vicious cycle of disaster loss, lack of capacity to recover, and reduced resilience when the next shock strikes. Only rapid and inclusive development can ensure that nobody is left behind.  TAKING ACTION >> Screening questions Identify actions to lay the foundations for climate-resilient societies  A strong, robust, and inclusive economy can lift everyone, and thus increase people's capacity to manage risks and cope with shocks. But in which areas could further progress be made? The following questions can help decision makers identify shortcomings and guide them towards the actions needed to strengthen the foundation of resilient societies. ACTION F.1 >> Rapid and robust development Is the economy fulfilling its potential in terms of productivity and economic growth? Does the macroeconomic system have appropriate buffers against unexpected shocks? Could include: sustainable public and private debt levels; foreign currency reserves ACTION F.2 >> Inclusive development Is economic growth inclusive? Could include: growth in income among the bottom 40 percent; income of the bottom 20 percent; fraction of population living on less than $1.90 a day Are farmers' productivity and income growing?

So, although all the recommendations in this section aim to ensure consistent and inclusive growth, they are also relevant for climate change adaptation. Recommendations to improve economic growth and accelerate development have been widely studied and advocated (see, for example, IMF 2014), and typically include: » Good governance, with the right institutions and rule of law, macroeconomic stability, and low barriers to entry for new products and firms, to make sure people have the right incentive to invest and create jobs with a conducive business environment  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators » Average productivity growth » Economic growth » Debt-to-GDP ratio » Structural deficit  » Investment in human capital, including health and education, to ensure everyone can achieve their potential and contribute to development and growth  » Investment in efficient infrastructure and trade networks, to increase productivity and benefit from domestic and international trade.  Economies are more resilient if they have buffers that can be mobilized in case of unexpected shocks. This includes keeping fiscal space in case of unexpected spending needs or drop in revenues, but also a manageable level of private debt and currency reserves.   ACTION F.2 >> Ensure that economic growth is inclusive LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance Although economic growth usually benefits the poor (Dollar et al. 2013), rapid economic growth can hide large heterogeneity across regions or socioeconomic groups (Ravallion 2016). Since vulnerability to climate change is highest among the poorest, inclusive economic growth that benefits the poorest will be most efficient in terms of reducing the impact of climate change and natural disasters. Three aspects are particularly important: smallholder farmers' livelihoods, access to infrastructure services--for example, sanitation services in poor urban neighborhoods--and access to risk management tools such as savings accounts, health care, and social protection. Toolbox A offers concrete quantitative examples of how these dimensions can be explored using commonly available data and specialized indicators, such as the University of Notre Dame Adaptation Initiative's ND-GAIN index or the World Bank's Socioeconomic Resilience Indicator. Improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers Smallholder farmers in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as they directly depend on climate conditions--for example, for irrigation--and because their seeds and species may not be adapted to future climate conditions. In modeling estimates, the impact of climate change on agriculture has the biggest effect on poverty, through reduced yields or increased food prices (figure 1).   Climate-smart agricultural practices can increase productivity and resilience (Cervigni and Morris 2016). But making practices more productive and resilient requires a major shift in land, water, soil nutrients, and genetic resource management to ensure more efficient resource use. Crop improvement, smarter input use, strengthening crop resistance to pests and diseases, and reducing post-harvest losses can contribute to sustainable agricultural intensification, increasing food production (Beddington 2010; Tilman et al. 2011). Innovation is needed to increase yields, and all farmers--even poor ones--must broadly adopt new techniques that result from innovation. Helping rural households enter nonagricultural occupations can also reduce their vulnerability to climate change. For example, combining cash transfers with other diversification interventions, such as vocational training or productive investment grants, helps households diversify their income sources and become more resilient to drought (Macours et al. 2012). Achieve universal access to infrastructure services Globally, the infrastructure gap continues to be large: 940 million people lack access to electricity; 663 million have no access to safe drinking water; 2.4 billion lack adequate sanitation facilities; and 1 billion live more than one kilometer away from an all-season road. Uncounted numbers cannot access work and education opportunities because transport services are unavailable or unaffordable. Providing universal access to reliable infrastructure services is central to increasing public health and welfare, thus ensuring sustainable economic development. To achieve ambitious poverty reduction and sustainable development goals in a resilient and low-carbon way, countries must continue to invest in infrastructure  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Poverty headcount or change in poverty headcount (last five years) » Growth in income of bottom 40 percent » Average income of farmers » Percentage of farmers with access to fertilizers or improved seeds » Average share of household budget spent on food and beverages  » Access to modern energy, improved water, or sanitation » Number of power or water outages per year » Share of population with a bank account, health care coverage or covered by social protection » Total social protection spending » Number of conflict-related deaths in the last year    development. How much they need to spend depends not only on their goals, but also on the efficiency with which they pursue them (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). In LIMCs alone, new infrastructure could cost 2­8 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)--that is between $640 billion and $2.7 trillion--a year, depending on how much electricity they want to make available for universal access, the technologies they use for sanitation, the policies they put in place to limit urban sprawl or redirect transport demand toward public transit and trains, the subsidies they give for irrigation, and so on. Accelerate financial inclusion, access to health care, and social protection coverage Boost financial inclusion: People use financial instruments, notably their savings, to smooth consumption and limit the effects of income shocks (Kinnan and Townsend 2012; Morduch 1995). However, most households--and almost all poor households--have no or little savings in financial form. Instead, poor people often save in kind, with livestock or housing investments, which tend to be more affected by natural hazards than financial savings. Access to credit allows households to finance otherwise unaffordable risk reduction and climate change adaptation investments, and loan repayments are often less than households pay in ongoing repairs or coping with climate change impacts. After a shock, a lack of access to finance is a significant obstacle to recovery and reconstruction, slowing down the return to normalcy and prompting people and firms to rebuild as fast as possible at the expense of quality (Benson and Clay 2004; Hallegatte and Dumas 2009). Accelerating financial inclusion--particularly ensuring that poor people have access to financial products that meet their needs and have small transaction costs--would therefore enhance adaptation and risk management (World Bank 2013). At the same time, further action could support the positive impacts of remittances on resilience. In 2014, the global burden of remittance transfer costs stood at 6.8 percent of overall transfers. Costs tend to be highest in sub-Saharan Africa, where they average 9 percent (Ratha et al. 2020).2 This partly reflects limited competition among service providers. The United Nations Open Working Group on Sustainable Development has proposed reducing remittance costs to 3 percent, which would translate into more than $20 billion annual savings for migrants. Commonly available technologies such as instant mobile phone money transfers could help streamline processes and reduce transaction costs.  SPOTLIGHT 1 >> COVID-19 Strong health care systems are vital  The current crisis linked to COVID-19 illustrates the need for stronger health care systems that can quickly detect emerging diseases and promptly react in the case of an epidemic. There are clear synergies with building the population's resilience to health-related climate change impacts. We can expect significant investments in health care systems in the next few years to improve  the world's ability to manage epidemics and new diseases, and there is an opportunity to ensure that these new systems are designed to swiftly identify emerging diseases due to climate change and provide a prompt, appropriate response. In the context of ""One health"", the need to respond quickly to emerging diseases also applies to diseases affecting animals and livestock.  Improve health care and universal health coverage: Climate change is expected to increase the burden of disease. For example, higher temperatures will affect vulnerable elderly and infant populations and the incidence of water-borne diseases, diarrhea, and some vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria will increase. The World Health Organization estimates that 100 million people fall into poverty each year paying for health care (WHO 2014). Financial risk protection varies widely, and out-of-pocket health expenditures are extremely high and variable for people in low-income countries. Improving health care coverage and lowering out-of-pocket expenses would help the poor manage catastrophic health expenditures, efficiently reducing both poverty and the health impacts of climate change (Jamison et al. 2013). Countries can provide health coverage at all income levels, but context and implementation challenges will determine the optimal path they take. Whichever this is, insurance coverage alone is not enough. Improving health care systems-- through staff training, vaccination programs, information campaigns, access to rapid diagnostic kits and drugs for treatment--  is essential. With significant investments over the next 20 years, low-income countries can raise their health care levels to match the best middle-income countries today (Jamison et al. 2013). Create strong social protection systems: Savings, borrowing, and insurance have their limits, particularly in the poorest households. Social protection programs therefore have a key role to play, but 55 percent of the world population is not covered by any program today (ILO, 2017). Even if they are not designed to protect people against natural disasters and cannot be adjusted or scaled up in response to a shock, social protection programs can increase the share of income poor households receive from transfers, improving their resilience to localized shocks.   In Bangladesh, the Chars Livelihood Programme protected 95 percent of recipients from losing their assets after the 2012 floods (Kenward et al. 2012). And in Mexico, beneficiaries of Prospera--the national cash transfer program previously known as Oportunitades or Progresa--are less likely to withdraw their children from school after a shock (de Janvry et al. 2006). In the United States (US), non-disaster programs such as Medicare and unemployment insurance automatically increase their support to affected populations after a hurricane makes landfall (Deryugina 2017). Post-disaster support through non-disaster programs is also more than five times larger than the dedicated transfers that follow federal disaster declarations. Ensure adaptation strategies include support for people in conflict zones, who are particularly vulnerable Even in countries with rapid economic growth, entire regions or communities can be left behind due to political or armed conflicts, or exclusion based on ethnicity or religion. Such regions or communities are likely to become hotspots of vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change, with potential consequences for the rest of the country through migration or unrest. Adaptation strategies should ensure that development and progress reach excluded and conflict-ridden areas and communities. F O U N D AT I O N S  TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox A A simple indicator-based analysis to identify priorities for action  If the socioeconomic context and development trends do not help reduce people's vulnerability to climate change, it is unlikely that targeted intervention can make a big difference. A simple analysis based on available indicators can help identify which socioeconomic trends are problematic from a climate change vulnerability perspective, and therefore identify promising opportunities for change. Annex 2 provides some examples of how widely available indicators, such as the World Development Indicators, can provide insights on possible policy priorities to ensure that development contributes as much as possible to adaptation and resilience. For example, figure A.1 shows that Mongolia lags other countries at similar income level in terms of access to improved sources of water, suggesting the existence of opportunities to build  the population's resilience in this sector. Feyen et al. (2020) provide an indicator-based analysis to look at the correlation between exposure and vulnerability to disasters and climate change, and macrofinancial risk indicators generated by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). This analysis highlights that most countries that are heavily affected by disasters or expect to be strongly affected by climate change already face significant macrofiscal risks. Figure A.2 illustrates this correlation with disaster losses and public debt risks. It is also possible to use some of the indicators recently developed to measure socioeconomic vulnerability or resilience. These have different scopes, focuses, strengths and weaknesses. But most allow users to first explore aggregated indicators (such as resilience or vulnerability) and then explore disaggregated indicators (such as farmer productivity or  Initiative): An ND-GAIN score measures a country's preparedness for climate change, including but going beyond natural hazards, and depending on its readiness and vulnerability. It measures a country's vulnerability by assessing its exposure, sensitivity, and capacity to adapt to the negative effects of climate change, looking at six sectors: food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure. It measures a country's readiness by assessing its ability to leverage investments and convert them into adaptation actions, looking at economic, governance, and social readiness. » World Risk Index (UN University and University of Bonn): This index measures the vulnerability of 171 countries to natural disasters. It is composed of four main indicators: exposure to natural hazards; susceptibility, which depends on socioeconomic conditions; coping capacity, which depends on preparedness, governance, and security; and adaptive capacity related to future natural events. » Global Climate Risk Index (GermanWatch): Published annually, this index analyzes the extent to which countries have been affected by weather-related losses, including storms, floods, and heat waves. The index is populated with data from Munich Re's NatCatSERVICE and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), among others.   The World Bank developed the Socioeconomic Resilience Indicator, now available in 149 countries (figure A.3). Socioeconomic resilience is defined as a country's or population's ability to cope with and recover from direct damages caused by natural disasters. It is estimated with a simple model of how households can manage disasters, and estimates of direct disaster impacts (UNISDR 2015). For each country, it provides an estimate of socioeconomic resilience and risk to wellbeing. Socioeconomic resilience depends on three main dimensions: » The difference in exposure and vulnerability between richer and poorer people: if poor people are more exposed or vulnerable, the same economic loss in absolute terms will have a bigger impact on their well-being » Access to tools and instruments to manage the shock, such as remittances, savings, emergency borrowing, insurance, and social protection » The government's capacity to respond and support the population.  Because the indicator is based on a model, it can also be used to estimate the benefits of various interventions, in all the covered countries. For example, figure A.4 shows the benefits of 11 different policy interventions in terms of reduction in asset and well-being losses in Malawi.  The same reduction in asset losses--of, say, $1,000-- reduces well-being losses more if the beneficiary is a poor household, for whom $1,000 is a lot. Similar estimates are available for all countries on the World Bank platform (Hallegatte et al 2016b).  Priority Area 1: Facilitate the adaptation of people and firms  LEAD MINISTRY: Economy  Adaptation is not the sole responsibility of the government. All private actors--households and firms--have an incentive to minimize the impacts of climate change on their own well-being or productivity. The government's role is to ensure that all actors, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, can access the resources they need to adapt to climate change and maximize the efficiency of the adaptation process. Three main constraints prevent private actors from taking adaptation actions: access to data and technologies, access to financing instruments and resources, and the need to coordinate with other actors. The latter is a challenge in the absence of public action or facilitating institutions such as business associations.   TAKING ACTION >> Screening questions Identify actions to enable firms and people to adapt  People need to be empowered to take effective adaptation and risk management decisions. But do they have the information, tools, and resources they need? The firms that provide goods, services, and jobs also need to adapt so they can offer people sustainable and resilient livelihoods. Are they on track to do so? The following questions can help decision makers identify shortcomings and guide them towards the actions needed to enable firms and people to adapt.  ACTION 1.1 >> Data and information Have comprehensive climate and risk assessments been completed? Could include: hazard maps for the most important threats are publicly available Is the uncertainty on current and future risks publicly communicated? Should include: several contrasted scenarios for possible future climate change are available to inform on uncertainty in climate projections Can all economic actors and public agencies access data on natural risk at an affordable cost and in a practical format? Could include: open risk data repositories are available  ACTION 1.2 >> Responsibilities and incentives Are roles and responsibilities for disaster and climate risk management clearly defined? Could include: presence of a designated disaster management authority; a disaster risk management framework law is passed, clarifying responsibility and liabilities Does the country have institutions and agencies in charge of managing shared resources? Could include: watershed agency is established to share water across various users Do private actors know the level of residual risk they are exposed to, or the level of protection offered by public infrastructure and instruments? Could include: maps of residual flood risks, accounting for public flood defenses, are available    ACTION 1.3 >> Technology and innovation Has the government addressed trade barriers that limit the use of essential technologies? Could include: average tariff on disaster management technologies or goods Are policies in place to actively support adopting or developing new technologies for resilience? Could include: existence of--and investment in--an agriculture extension program  ACTION 1.4 >> Financing and support to the poorest and most vulnerable people Can private actors access adequate financing for adaptation-related investments? Is the government providing specific financing instruments to facilitate people's investments in adaptation and risk reduction? Could include: volume of financing in windows targeting climate change adaptation Has the government identified and started supporting the most vulnerable population groups, whose poverty prevents them from adapting to climate change?  ACTION 1.5 >> Strategic structural transitions Does the government have policies in place to actively manage the strategic decline of sunset sectors? Could include: skills retraining schemes; social protection Is the economy diversified, rather than being concentrated in one sector that may be vulnerable? Could include: share of exports in one agricultural commodity Does the country have a diversification strategy, based on either assets--such as investments in education--or active industrial policies?  Have actions been taken to mitigate the most severe impacts of climate change?  Do vulnerable groups have access to affordable financial instruments that can help them manage risks and reduce their vulnerability? Could include: total amount of resilience support to poor vulnerable communities    ACTION 1.1 >> Assess disaster and climate risks, and make the information available LEAD MINISTRY: Environment (or disaster risk management or climate change agency) Governments need to ensure the information people need to adapt to climate change and manage natural risks is widely accessible, free, or affordable, and in a simple format that decision makers can use. They can assess needs from firms or households, for instance using surveys. In Turkey, IFC and EBRD (2013) show, for instance, that 76 percent of firms lack information on technological solutions for adapting to climate change, and 78 percent lack access to financial instruments to implement them. Data and knowledge on future climate change and climate change impacts have a public goods nature, and private actors will tend to underinvest, in the absence of public support. Information needs and technical capacity also differ across actors--for example, between a national power utility and a household--so different information platforms and tools are required. Ideally, rather than simply provide information, the data platform will support decision making. People and firms need information on: » Threats from natural hazards: The first step is identifying spatially disaggregated threats from natural hazards, including floods, storms, and landslides. Global datasets and models can give all countries a rough indication of the spatial distribution of disaster and climate risks. These include the simple metrics for the 11 types of natural hazards recorded in the ThinkHazard database3 or the climate change scenarios collected in the Climate Change Knowledge Portal.4 Several providers offer more detailed information from global models.5 Maintaining consistent geo-referenced records of past disasters and investing in risk data and models--such as hydrological models, maps of flood hazards and digital elevation models--is vital. Countries can then use these hazard maps to assess risks by combining them with exposure maps of the population and assets and vulnerability models that describe impacts or damage to people and assets. There are many examples of natural risk assessments, such as the UNDRR's Global Assessment Report (UNISDR 2015), the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) country profiles,6 and other, more detailed assessments. » Threats to human capital: It is important to consider the effect of climate change on health and productivity, especially for people whose livelihoods depend on outdoor tasks. It is well documented that higher temperatures lead to lower labor productivity (Hallegatte et al. 2015). With climate change scenarios projecting that summers may exceed   50ºC in several regions, the macroeconomic impacts on productivity are likely to become significant in many countries (Heal and Park 2016).7 It is also well documented that natural disasters leave victims with mental health issues that can make it difficult to return to a normal life, even after physical recovery (Berry et al. 2010). Mental health challenges have a major and direct impact on quality of life, while the cost of mental health care and effects on labor productivity have financial and economic implications. » Threats to key sectors: To analyze possible effects on agricultural production, tourism, or infrastructure service delivery, a first step is identifying which of the main production or employment sectors are most sensitive to climate variability. There are many tools to then estimate how climate change could affect productivity. For example, the AgMIP data portal8 offers many agriculture scenarios, based on multiple climate and crop models. For energy demand and generation or water availability, the Climate Change Knowledge Portal4 has country-averaged indicators and geospatial information to serve as an input for such assessments. The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Inter-comparison Project's dataset9 also provides indicators for physical impacts such as water availability and impacts on water-borne diseases, other health issues, coastal flood risks, fisheries, ecosystems, and permafrost, which is important for infrastructure design in cold regions. Countries can use such analyses to estimate the economic costs of climate change to these sectors--for example, whether rising water scarcity will increase the cost of water provision or whether energy demand for air conditioning will increase energy costs.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Number of weather or hydrological observation stations operational in the country » Real-time availability of hydromet observations » Time series of hydromet observations are freely available » Percentage of country covered by high-resolution digital terrain model or hazard maps for current and future risks, with multiple scenarios  » Risk assessment for main economic sector done and publicly available, including opportunities where competitive advantage may improve » Data platform providing easy access to hazard and climate change scenario data » Guidance materials and methodologies available to users on how to access and include disaster and climate information in decision making    » Cross-border threats, including risks linked to food prices: Some impacts of climate change will affect regions and countries indirectly. For example, a place where crop yields increase can still be a net loser if yields increase even more in another place, thus diverting investments and jobs. Import costs can also grow in response to productivity losses, so North Africa and the Middle East, which rely heavily on food imports, are particularly exposed to the impact of climate change on global food markets. Identifying future climate change impacts therefore needs to go beyond direct, localized effects and think more broadly about global consequences and their implications. Countries can start investigating indirect threats by listing their main imports and exports, identifying those that are most sensitive to climate change--like agriculture and forestry--and those that play a key role. For example, countries might import a large share of domestic consumption or export a large share of production. If exports are sensitive, there is a risk of a drop in external income; if imports are sensitive, there is a risk of higher import prices. Both can threaten the trade balance and macroeconomic stability (see Priority Area 4). Many countries have created specific processes for generating and disseminating this information to the public. For example, the United Kingdom (UK)'s Climate Change Act 2008 mandates the government to produce a comprehensive, nationwide, climate change risk assessment every five years, followed by a set of national adaptation plans.10 The Climate Change Act also creates a common analytical resource in the form of the Committee of Climate Change to help develop and implement regional policy frameworks. Similarly, Costa Rica's Scientific Council on Climate Change is an independent consultative body of academics, researchers and experts to advise the government on climate science and technological development.11 The council is attached to the Ministry of Environment and Energy's Climate Change Directorate and prepares reports at the ministry's request. It also has the authority to express itself on relevant matters. One important consideration relates to uncertainty on future climates and the likelihood of various natural hazards. While uncertainty does not prevent action to reduce risk and build resilience, it impacts on which action to implement. It is preferable to avoid any action that would deliver benefit only if future risks and climate change are exactly as expected based on current models and data, and favor instead robust interventions that deliver benefits in a broad range of possible futures (see toolbox K for methodologies). In thinking about how they communicate climate change information to the public, governments need to ensure they highlight the large uncertainty around future climate change impacts and do not focus on a single ""most likely"" scenario. Doing so could give households and firms overconfidence in these scenarios and choosing   the adaptation options that work best in them. This could have catastrophic outcomes if future climate change differs from the ""most likely"" scenario. While there is an understandable temptation to provide a single simple scenario to make it easier for users to access climate information, it could lead to maladaptation and higher, not lower, vulnerability. Figure 2 illustrates this challenge for Senegal, where some climate models project an increase in annual precipitation while others project a decline. A robust adaptation action must provide benefits in both possible scenarios.   ACTION 1.2 >> Clarify responsibilities and align incentives with adaptation and resilience objectives LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance  Private actions to manage climate change and natural disasters may be impaired by an unclear allocation of responsibilities. Firms and populations in a flood zone may assume that flood management is the responsibility of the local or national government, so they do not need to make their own investments to reduce risks or adapt to climate change.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  To ensure households and firms are making the right decisions, governments should clearly establish responsibilities and liabilities in law and communicate these to all private actors. In the Netherlands, the  » Law allocating responsibilities and liabilities for disaster risk management and climate change impacts passed  government is responsible for providing protection from floods, but only up to a certain level. It publishes simple maps outlining residual flooding risks despite the flood defenses. These maps help all private actors decide where to buy a house or build a factory, the construction standards they should implement and the levels of financial preparedness they will need. Allocating responsibilities may require significant  » Target level of residual risks published and made publicly available--for example, through residual flood risk maps » Specialized agencies to manage water sharing at the watershed level established  institutional and legal reforms. In 2012, Colombia's  Law 1523 created a national risk management policy  and system to identify, monitor and analyze risks related to climate change,  prepare measures to address situations of emergency, establish relevant financial  instruments, and develop a comprehensive communication and stakeholder  engagement system.12 This law preceded the adoption of framework climate change  legislation (Law 1931) in 2018, which specifies that the national and territorial risk  management plans required under Law 1523 should incorporate actions to foster  knowledge generation and reduce risk and vulnerability to climate change. It also  mandates the government to develop guidelines for disaster risk management  plans.  Countries must also recognize that they may not have the right incentives in place for private actors to adapt (Hallegatte and Rentschler 2015; World Bank 2013). This is generally due to coordination or governance failures. Coordination failures tend to arise from lack of policies to help independent actors coordinate their actions.    For example, if multiple actors are interdependent, it may not be profitable for a single actor to invest in resilience, unless all actors do (Kunreuther and Heal 2003). In a world of interconnected supply chains, it may not make sense for a single producer to build their own resilience to floods if they know the production process will be interrupted by a lack of supplies or transport. Governance failures are usually linked to ill-designed regulations and institutions. In some cases, agencies are put in charge of managing a problem that they do not have adequate resources for or are better managed at a larger spatial scale. In some cases, small municipalities are put in charge of disaster risk or water scarcity management when these challenges would be managed more effectively at agglomeration or watershed levels. In other cases, public agencies or regulators that are best placed to manage risks either do not have the mandate to do so, or have overlapping mandates with other institutions, which can create conflicts and inefficiencies. This problem is particularly acute for infrastructure systems--especially when service provision is ensured by private and public actors, for example through public-private partnerships (PPP). If the responsibilities for managing risks from climate change and natural hazards are not carefully and explicitly assigned to the various parties involved--for example, the builder, the operator, the state, and the user--then it is unlikely that adequate risk reduction measures will be implemented. In the aftermath of a disaster, governments usually provide people, firms, and infrastructure owners and operators with support. But the mere possibility of public aid after disasters can create moral hazards, which to some extent can discourage risk management and the purchase of insurance. However, providing support during and after a crisis is a central government mission, and no government should withhold such support just to avoid moral hazard, especially when basic services--such as electricity, water, and transportation--are at stake. Instead, effective risk management should rely on governments designing a consistent set of regulations and financial incentives to align the interests of infrastructure service providers with the public interest (figure 3). First, for each hazard and infrastructure system, governments or regulators need to define a minimum standard of resistance--that is, a hazard intensity below which the service should not be disrupted. For example, road agencies are responsible for ensuring that all roads can cope with a rainfall event that has a certain annual probability of occurrence. Second, they need to define in a measurable and quantified manner the level of acceptable risk--or force majeure--that is, the level at which disruptions and damages have to be tolerated, because avoiding them would be too expensive or technically impossible. Beyond this level, the risk from a natural hazard is usually supported by the public sector (through a force majeure clause). Below this level, at least part of the risk needs to be supported by the private service provider, to align the provider's interest with the public interest. One way of achieving this is by penalizing an infrastructure operator for disruptions--for example, penalizing electricity utilities for extended power outages due to storms, with fees corresponding to the social cost of such disruptions. However, coordination issues also occur between private actors. A survey in Tanzania highlighted that, when firms cannot deliver on time, delays are predominantly caused by supply chain and infrastructure disruptions--rather than problems with production (figure 4). In such cases, there are few incentives for firms to invest in their resilience, thus locking the overall economic system into a low-resilience equilibrium. While this situation may improve over time as economic growth provides more resources to build resilience, governments can use targeted policies to support and accelerate the process. This includes signaling a target level of resilience that actors can use to calibrate investments (Hallegatte et al. 2019). Reviewing existing subsidies to remove the ones that favor excessive risk taking is also crucial. For example, poorly designed construction subsidies that make housing more affordable can attract construction onto low-value, high-risk plots and increase the share of buildings in flood zones, while poorly designed agriculture subsidies can incentivize excessive irrigation in situations of water scarcity or lead to deforestation. Even strong, targeted actions and investments to adapt to climate change are unlikely to be effective if they are undermined by non-aligned measures that create or increase climate risks. When and where subsidies are necessary to maintain access to basic needs and fight poverty, they can often be redesigned to minimize negative impacts on resilience and risk-taking--for example, by making agriculture subsidies independent of quantities produced. Private actors can sometimes transfer disaster and climate risk to others. This happens, for example, when developers sell flood-prone houses at prices that do not fully internalize the flood risks (Bin and Polasky 2004; Holway and Burby 1990). Imperfect land markets and a lack of hazard risk data can incentivize people to build in at-risk areas, unless public intervention--such as mandating to inform potential buyers with hazard information or regulating construction in at-risks areas-- discourages them from doing so. Public action may also be necessary to manage damages and externality from private adaptation actions, particularly when it comes to shared resources like water. For example, adaptation in agriculture can lead to unsustainable water use that threatens long-term underground reserves or ecosystem health (Damania et al. 2017). In such cases, governments may have to adjust operational rules for hydropower dams and manage difficult trade-offs between the needs for energy generation, irrigation, and recreational activities, while preserving enough flow to ensure healthy ecosystems. In another example, air conditioning use can threaten power system reliability and lead to higher outdoor temperatures in cities (Stone et al. 2010; Silva et al. 2010). In one case study, Viguié et al. (2019) simulated the effect of more frequent and hotter heat waves on air-conditioning in Paris, France. To maintain all buildings at 23°C, they projected an average increase of 1.134 terawatt-hours in final annual energy consumption. The extra energy consumption from cooling during a heat wave corresponds to 81 percent of the city's average daily electricity consumption for offices and housing. This additional demand represents a significant challenge and can lead to outages, especially in places where power systems are already under strain and struggle to keep pace with growing energy consumption. Air conditioning systems also release hot air outside of buildings. This increases outdoor temperatures, impacting not only on outdoor thermal comfort, but also on indoor comfort in dwellings without air conditioning (and for homeless people). In all these cases, authorities should develop appropriate regulations to ensure adaptation by one actor is not at the expense of others.   ACTION 1.3 >> Facilitate access to technologies through research and development investments and trade policies LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance, with environment/infrastructure Effective adaptation will depend on countries being able to draw on the best available technologies for mitigating climate change impacts, especially in the agriculture and health sectors (GCA 2019). New technologies, improvements in crop varieties, smarter input use, and methods to strengthen crop resistance to pests and diseases and reduce post-harvest losses could all help tackle food security challenges (FAO et al. 2015; Beddington 2010; Tilman et al. 2011). Improved crops and more efficient water and soil use can increase farmers' incomes and their resilience to climate shocks (Cervigni and Morris 2016). Developing and adopting higher-yielding and more climate-resistant crop varieties and livestock breeds is one way to make agricultural systems more climate-resilient (Tester and Langridge 2010). For example, a randomized control trial in Orissa, India found that a flood-resistant rice variety yielded 45 percent more than the most popular variety at the time (Dar et al. 2013). However, a recent global analysis of adaptation-related patents highlighted the following three key challenges (Glachant et al. 2020): » Innovation for climate change adaptation--at least in proportion of total innovation--has not increased over time (figure 5), even though identified needs have arguably increased significantly. » Innovation for adaptation occurs primarily in high-income countries and in a handful of middle-income countries. Analysis of international patents suggests that not only are there close to no patented innovations in low-income countries, but patented innovations from middle- and high-income countries are not transferred to these countries (table 1).  » Adoption of available new technology in low-income countries is often slow and limited. For example, high transport costs and poor distribution systems mean that fertilizer application remains low in Africa (Gilbert 2012). Other barriers to the widespread adoption of new technologies include cultural issues, a lack of information and education, and implementation costs. In some cases, technologies, goods, or services that could support adaptation are difficult to import, due to a lack of internal capacity or trade policies and barriers. Policy change may be the most efficient way to help people access adaptation-related technologies, since developing domestic technologies and producers can be long and costly.   TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Share of farmers using improved crops and climate-smart practices » Share of research and development (R&D) or percentage of patents related to climate change adaptation » Total amount invested in R&D on adaptation-related or resilience-related challenges  » Amount invested by the public or private sector in R&D on adaptation-related or resilience-related challenges » Average tariff applied to imports of resilience-related technologies    ACTION 1.4 >> Ensure financing is available to all, and provide support to the poorest and most vulnerable people LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance, with social affairs/social protection Adaptation--preventing and reducing future losses due to climate change--makes economic sense, and private actors are incentivized to contribute to it. However, high upfront costs may stop them from implementing effective solutions. Even if these costs are more than compensated in the long term by avoided impacts and losses, the lack of financing can be a serious obstacle for credit-constrained firms and households. Financial inclusion and a well-managed, stable financial system are important for increasing an economy's adaptive capacity. However, ensuring that financial solutions are accessible to all may require specific measures such as mobile banking to access savings and credit possibilities in rural households. Financial inclusion alone may not be enough to allow the poorest households to invest in managing risks or coping with shocks, so, governments must take a role and responsibility in this. Poor people are disproportionally affected by climate-related shocks and stressors. Not only are they more exposed and invariably more vulnerable to climate-related shocks; they also have fewer resources to adapt to climate change. Poor people tend to invest less in preventing and mitigating the adverse effects of natural hazards and climate change. In China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, wealthier households are more likely to invest in proactive adaptation measures (Francisco et al. 2011).  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Number of firms/people accessing dedicated financing instruments such as guarantees, subsidized loans » Total borrowing for adaptation through dedicated windows » Most vulnerable populations and communities (occupations, localizations, poverty, ethnicity, and so on) identified and information published  » Share of poor and vulnerable population receiving support for adaptation » Total subsidy/spending targeting poor and vulnerable populations to support adaptation action  In the absence of external support, hundreds of millions of people in or close to poverty will be impacted by climate change and have limited ability to respond and adapt. Governments are widely considered to be responsible for supporting vulnerable populations and helping them adapt to external stressors, such as climate change. Multiple instruments can help with this, from direct cash transfers to reduce poverty to targeted subsidies for efficient irrigation equipment or air conditioning. But they all require governments to first: » Identify the populations that are most vulnerable to climate change and least able to adapt » Identify the impact channels through which they will be affected » Design policies to support their ability to cope with and adapt to these impacts (toolbox B). Social safety nets targeted to poor households can be complemented by activities focused on climate adaptation and mitigation. Such safety nets have seen a dramatic expansion across the developing world over the last decade, involving conditional and unconditional cash transfers or, where appropriate, in-kind benefits. There are three main types of safety net intervention that support household adaptation and mitigation to climate change. 1. Regular cash transfers that build household resilience to climate-related shocks and worsening livelihood conditions by facilitating livelihood diversification, building savings, and avoiding negative coping strategies. 2. Reinforcing these cash transfers with accompanying measures focused on various development objectives such as economic inclusion and increases in productivity, human capital formation and climate adaptation that are typically delivered through social workers, community organizations and in partnership with civil society organizations. Explicitly climate-adaptive measures that can amplify the impacts of cash transfers on household resilience include: » Behavior change interventions with information on timing of rainy and lean seasons or which crops to diversify out of or into » Savings interventions to generate a buffer to absorb climate shocks or enable investments in adaptation or livelihood portfolio adjustments » Skills training and coaching to support livelihood diversification   » Early childhood development, nutrition and health interventions focused on raising household and community capability to manage the impact of climate shocks on child development, nutrition, or food security. 3. Public works--where beneficiaries provide community services or build assets for cash or in-kind benefits--as part of adaptive social protection. As well as promoting adaptation by providing cash to beneficiaries, such initiatives have potential for climate mitigation through climate-sensitive works like reforestation, irrigation, combatting soil erosion, and water security, and by generating community assets that tackle the root causes of climate change vulnerability in a community. Governments can layer these three social safety net instruments for additive impact. Regular cash transfers--whether conditional or unconditional--are the foundation to help households navigate the impacts of climate change. Adding accompanying measures that explicitly focus on climate resilience can reinforce their climate-adaptive potential in specific areas, as can public works. For example, such initiatives can be concentrated in areas, households or communities that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. All these interventions can be made ""shock-responsive"", triggered by covariate climate shocks like droughts and floods to support an expanded number of affected households and communities in the event of a climactic shock. See Action 3.4 for more on shock-responsive social protection. TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox B Identifying climate change impacts on poor populations and poverty and defining priorities for action  Poor people are more vulnerable to environmental scarcity, stresses, shocks, and climate change impacts (Hallegatte et al. 2015). Economic models based on national accounts--such as computable general equilibrium (CGE) models--can underestimate this vulnerability. However, dedicated analysis of poor people's situations, based on household surveys or microsimulations, can help identify vulnerability hotspots and opportunities for high-return interventions. This toolbox presents two complementary approaches, with examples from Burundi, Georgia, and Tanzania, to illustrate how countries can better inform policies.  Microsimulation and household-level analyses Hallegatte et al. (2015) use the World Bank's International Income Distribution Data Set, a global database of household surveys describing the distribution of income and occupations in 92 countries. Using microsimulation techniques, they projected the evolution of these households until 2030, driven by demographics, socioeconomic change, and climate change, to identify which impacts are most important for poverty outcomes in the 92 countries. Illustrating the results in Burundi and Georgia, figure B.1 shows that climate change is expected to have a larger impact in Burundi for each metric. For example, income is predicted to drop by 4 percent in Burundi and 2.5 percent in Georgia by 2030. The biggest impact in Burundi will be the change in food prices, while in Georgia, it is labor productivity. Governments can use this type of analysis alongside the simpler indicator-based approach proposed in toolbox A to identify priorities for adaptation to minimize the impact of climate change on poverty and poor people.  Dedicated household surveys Household surveys can be highly effective to better understand the risks and challenges faced by a specific population in a specific context. Collecting household-level data on income levels and disaster risk allows researchers to study exposure, disaster loss, and recovery capacity in relation to poverty. For example, Erman et al. (2019) collected a representative dataset on income levels and flood risk from households in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania--such as how many people are affected by flooding, how they are affected, the mechanisms and tools they use to recover, and how effective these are--to understand the extent of the challenges and potential solutions. Surveys can provide both spatial and socioeconomic information to help identify vulnerability hotspots, which in turn can inform targeting and policy design.   ACTION 1.5 >> Facilitate structural change in the economic system LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance  Climate change will affect latent comparative advantage. For example, it will make some countries less productive in certain types of agriculture, to the benefit of others. It will also cause the decline of some (sunset) sectors and the growth of other (sunrise) sectors.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  The challenge is the combination of long-term uncertainty with timing constraints. With perfect foresight, an economic system would move away from sunset sectors and progressively invest in sunrise sectors, moving jobs, opportunities, and profits with minimal losses. In practice, however, the risk is that the sunset sector becomes non-profitable exactly when large investments are required to boost another sector. Experience from regions where coal mining or heavy industries disappeared in Europe shows how difficult it is to manage a successful transition, especially when a region has a narrow economic base, is isolated geographically, and has a population with limited skills and investment capacity. In France, unemployment is still higher than average in areas where coal mines were closed decades ago (figure 6).  » Strategy to manage the decline of negatively affected sectors published, or to support the development of non-affected or positively affected sectors published » Share of GDP, employment or exports in sectors expected to be negatively or positively affected » Measure of economic diversification--for example, number of exported products--or latent diversification  There are few success stories of fully satisfactory economic rejuvenation outcomes in mono-industry coal mining towns. While economic diversification and rejuvenation is an objective shared by many regions, coal mine closures often mean the loss of the main regional employer. That dramatically reduces overall re-employment potential for workers and exposes the risks of a narrow economic base. The compounding effect is significant. Rejuvenating local economies in coal-dependent regions is a complex challenge and can fail, even with good intentions and enough funds. For example, the UK targeted various forms of regional aid at several of its main mining areas to foster job creation. This included a program of coalfield site reclamation and redevelopment that disbursed more than £600 million between 1996 and 2007 (World Bank Group 2018). British coal mining regions have received European Union (EU) support, both through its standard structural funds and specific programs like the RECHAR program, which deployed    more than £250 million over 10 years. Despite this, decades after the UK's major waves of mine closures, labor market impacts can still be felt, especially in areas where difficulties are entrenched, such as South Wales. Mobility support for workers to relocate out of mono-industry coal mining towns may sometimes represent a better option.    Support sunrise sectors and activities to maximize their development potential Climate change may create new comparative advantages in some countries, and those where key sectors will be negatively affected must prepare to capture the opportunities created by climate change. However, if these latent advantages face obstacles such as high upfront capital investments, increasing returns to scale, or network effects, then a country may struggle to turn them into growth and economic opportunities. Several studies offer guidance on how growth-enhancing policies can be indispensable for turning latent comparative advantages into real economic opportunities, especially if countries face the risk of a low-productivity trap (Harrison and Rodriguez-Clare 2009; Rodrik 2004). To realize a latent comparative advantage, governments may need to solve coordination failures within and across sectors to develop new activities--for example, by supporting interdependent sectors (Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Pack and Westphal 1986; Okuno-Fujiwara 1988; Murphy et al. 1988). Although a changing climate may make one region suitable for producing a new agricultural product, for this to be profitable, farmers will need to invest in new equipment or seeds and have access to adequate supply chains and markets. Without public actions to create relevant markets or invest in the necessary infrastructure to facilitate access, it may be impossible for individual producers to shift to a new product. In this context, governments can seize opportunities by identifying potential new comparative advantages -- for example, through exchanges between government organizations and the private sector (Rodrik 2004; Harrison and Rodríguez-Clare 2009). In some cases, such as agriculture, tourism, or energy, a latent comparative advantage can be observed in advance, justifying a targeted industrial policy.    Manage sunset sectors and activities to facilitate a smooth transition Some economic sectors may be strongly affected by climate change, with significant implications for jobs and tax revenues. For example, some agricultural production may become non-competitive or unsustainable, snow-based tourism may disappear from low-altitude mountains and summer destinations may become too hot to attract tourists. Targeted policies can help declining industries and better manage the drop in activity (for example, ensuring that the least productive firms close first). Although this may be costly, it can be justified by distributional considerations or a desire to smooth a transition and lessen the impact on welfare and social stability. Governments have long used policies to create regional balance, jobs, and activity where unemployment is higher or the population poorer, or to smooth economic transitions. Labor markets are seldom flexible; structural economic changes or trade liberalization often lead to a rise in unemployment, as skill and institutional issues prevent workers from moving from sunset to sunrise sectors. After trade liberalization displaced workers from Brazil's de-protected industries (Muendler 2010; Menezes-Filho and Muendler 2011), it took several years for the growth sectors to absorb them (see Porto 2012). The social costs of such a transition may justify transient support to declining industries to allow time for retraining and to shift workers toward growing sectors. Japanese industries used this approach to make the transition toward high-productivity, high-skill industries more socially acceptable (Peck et al. 1987). Lessons from the trade adjustment literature suggest that it is more efficient to subsidize employment in growing sectors than support workers in declining industries (Porto 2012). Governments can either support firms in sunrise sectors to enable them to absorb sunset sector workers more rapidly, or directly support workers through social safety nets and retraining schemes. Support economic diversification to hedge against climate risks Diversifying away from narrow economic bases is key to reducing vulnerability to climate change and other technological or preference shocks. But there are also pure short-term economic reasons for diversifying the economy. When successfully accomplished, export diversification has yielded benefits and has often been associated with higher levels and stronger resilience of GDP growth (Hesse et al. 2008). This success is driven by the wider range of higher value-added products that provide a hedge against single-commodity price volatility and the development of sectors that have greater technological spillovers. Yet, as evidenced by many stalled attempts, diversification can be challenging. And while diversification appears unambiguously positive in low- and middle-income countries, the most advanced economies seem to benefit instead from export specialization.   There are different ways of supporting the diversification of an economy (Gill et al. 2014). The traditional form supports new activities downstream of existing specialization that use the same skills and competencies. This includes, for example, oil-producing countries focusing on energy-intensive industries and agriculture-dominated economies focusing on agrobusiness. Another option is diversifying an economy's production factors by investing in better education, new skills, knowledge, and natural capital to make countries less dependent on a narrow set of assets. This, in turn, makes them less vulnerable to direct impacts on these assets--such as where water scarcity leads to a decline in agricultural land productivity--or indirect effects on their productivity--for example, where lower tourism flows reduce the revenues derived from pristine beaches. Intangible assets like knowledge and human capital are important for building competitive economies that are more flexible, adaptable, and resilient to a wide range of external shocks. Governments can promote diversification through: » Public investments in health and education, innovation and institutions, and natural asset protection » Effective policies to support the reallocation of economic resources to new activities, such as labor market policies to overcome constraints on mobility or barriers to the entry of women in the workforce, and access to finance » An appropriate incentive framework based on a clear, transparent, and predictable business and investment climate » Policies to reduce specific market and institutional failures, such as the lack of access to knowledge about new products, technologies, or international standards » Investments in infrastructure and coordinated policy reforms to reduce trade costs.   SPOTLIGHT 2 >> COVID-19 Stimulus and recovery program and economic diversification  The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a major economic crisis, and many governments will be preparing recovery and stimulus packages to help their economy restart when the virus is under control. Depending on their design, these packages can support or impair diversification and resilience. In particular, when governments provide direct support to firms-- either through subsidized or guaranteed loans or bail-out grants--there is a risk that this support will go primarily to incumbents, while younger firms in new sectors or deploying new technologies get no support and go bankrupt. Governments should therefore review stimulus packages to ensure that they do not reinforce specialization in sectors that are in decline, have limited growth prospects, or are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts.  Some countries are going further and using the bail-out of affected firms to encourage a transition in favor of other policy goals. For example, in 2008/2009 many countries supported their automobile industry to favor low-emissions (especially electric) cars. Today, the government of France is helping Air France with a 7 billion subsidy in exchange for environment-related commitments, such as reducing CO2 emissions from domestic flights by 50 percent by 2024, and sourcing 2 percent of its fuel from sustainable sources by 2025. Similar commitments are possible in favor of resilience. For example, many utilities have received exceptional government support to weather the COVID-19 crisis; governments could tie this support to renewed and tightened commitments regarding the reliability and resilience of power or water systems.   Priority Area 2: Adapt land use plans and protect critical public assets and services  LEAD MINISTRY: Economy, planning, investment, or infrastructure  Certain adaptation actions cannot be implemented by private actors and will require direct public action. These include protecting or adapting assets that are owned by the government or other public entities, those that are privately owned but designed, built or operated following strict public regulations and guidance that leave little room and few incentives for private actors to act, and those that are considered to be government responsibility. The latter typically include assets within the health, education, security, and safety sectors. Public action is also important for including climate change in land use or coastal management plans, which constrain and drive private investments in infrastructure and buildings and can serve as coordination mechanisms for private actors. This dimension of adaptation and resilience also tends to involve decisions and investments with long lifetimes, as many infrastructure assets are designed to last for more than 50 years. At the same time, the spatial patterns created by infrastructure and land use plans are almost irreversible. As a result, it is important to consider even climate change impacts that are only expected over the long term in today's decision making. Including long-term impacts means decision makers must carefully consider uncertainties and prioritize solutions that are robust (deliver benefits in a large range of possible futures) and flexible enough to be adjusted when new information is available.  TAKING ACTION >> Screening questions Identify actions to strengthen the resilience of public infrastructure and critical services  While the actions of individuals can go a long way in adapting to a changing climate, they are not enough. People's resilience to climate change depends on the resilience of their cities, and of the critical infrastructure systems and public services they rely on. Have governments taken adequate measures to ensure that spatial and urban planning is risk-informed and climate-smart? Are their measures sufficient to ensure that lifeline infrastructure systems and essential public services are equipped to handle the impacts of climate change? The following questions can help decision makers identify shortcomings and guide them towards the actions needed to strengthen the resilience of public infrastructure and critical services. ACTION 2.1 >> Public services and infrastructure Does the government have a geo-referenced inventory of government assets? Should include: hospitals; schools; fire and police stations; infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges, and electricity generation; and so on Did the government identify critical services and assets that need to be protected or strengthened in priority? Could include: criticality analysis of transport or energy systems; stress testing of hospital systems Have the authorities assessed and addressed the risks to public service and infrastructure assets? Could include: risk assessments of critical infrastructure and public services; risk-informed asset maintenance  ACTION 2.2 >> Strengthening new assets and infrastructure Does the government have standards and norms that account for criticality of assets and exposure to natural hazards? Are they adjusted regularly to respond to climate change? Should include: hospitals; schools; fire and police stations; infrastructure assets such as roads, bridges, and electricity generation; and so on ACTION 2.3 >> Risk-informed land use and urban planning Is risk-informed land use and urban planning legally required and consistently enforced? Could include: long-term plans supported by laws; enforcement mechanisms; strategic retreat options Are nature-based solutions and ecosystem services an integral part of a country's risk reduction strategy? Could include: systematically conducted environmental risk assessments; restoration and preservation of protective ecosystems Are areas that are impossible or too costly to protect in the long term identified and known by the public? Is risk information available to buyers of land or buildings? Could include: long-term maps with areas that are expected to benefit from protection investments published    ACTION 2.1 >> Identify critical public services and assets LEAD MINISTRY: Economy, planning, investment, or infrastructure  Critical public services such as energy, water, health  care, civil protection, and education need thorough climate risk assessment and management. Not only can their reconstruction be costly; they also provide critical   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox C Using criticality analyses to identify key infrastructure vulnerabilities and gaps in services and networks  Criticality analysis is an important tool for identifying the most important infrastructure assets and their vulnerability, and to prioritize those interventions that will give the largest benefits. As part of its climate vulnerability assessment, the government of Fiji applied this approach to the transport system. The sector contributes approximately 12 percent to Fiji's GDP and receives around 30 percent of the government's annual capital budget. It is therefore not realistic to expect a large increase in spending in this sector: it is more important to improve the efficiency of spending. Using an asset database coupled with modeling tools developed by the World Bank, a criticality analysis of Fiji's road network aimed to identify the transport assets that were most likely to result in high economic losses if  damaged. For each component of the road network, the analysis estimated the number of trips that would become impossible in case of failure of or damage to the asset and assessed additional travel distances and extra costs to the road user for trips that would remain possible. The components that would cause the largest impacts on the whole network if damaged are considered ""critical"". A similar study was performed for the Tanzanian road network and its vulnerability to floods. The study evaluated the consequences in different supply chains of disrupting each road infrastructure asset for various durations. The main conclusion was that the most critical transport infrastructure assets differ across supply chains. Figure C.1 shows the possible effects of a one-week road disruption on household consumption and  unique transmission line can be excessively vulnerable in case of storm, regardless of the robustness of this line. Similarly, the inability to detect emerging diseases in one region can make an entire country (or the whole world) more vulnerable. So, system-level analysis is important. It should not only consider which links, assets, or services can be strengthened, but also which additional links, assets, or services can be created to build redundancy and resilience. The Fiji Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) identified 125 projects in 10 sectors that would build the country's resilience (table 2). These were based on the national development priority and strategy, as stated in its 5- and 20-year development plans, and the identified climate change risks. After prioritizing the projects for implementation, the government can translate the list of priorities into an investment plan for public asset and infrastructure,13 with costings and identifying responsible public agencies. Different agencies can then use this plan to prepare their work program and budget requests, alongside their many other missions and responsibilities, and the Ministry of Finance can use it to estimate additional financing needs for climate change adaptation (see Priority Area 4 and Spotlight 4).  Assessing the resilience of service delivery in critical sectors can also be a useful exercise. This includes using a scenario-based approach to discuss responses in health care, public school, or social protection systems. It is particularly useful in the health care sector, which plays a key role after a natural disaster, especially in the event of massive casualties (Tariverdi et al. 2019). The same applies for social protection systems, which need to be stress-tested to ensure they can deliver post-disaster support to affected populations. For example, electronic transfers may be impaired if large areas are without power. And because schools are often used as shelters, it is important to plan so they can reopen quickly to ensure children do not miss out on education for prolonged periods.    ACTION 2.2 >> Design and implement a government-wide strategy to increase the resilience of infrastructure and public assets LEAD MINISTRY: Economy, planning, investment, or infrastructure More resilient infrastructure is good economics, but a governance and financing challenge The lack of resilient and high-quality infrastructure can impose substantial costs on firms and households. Infrastructure disruptions have indirect costs for households, as their impact on company productivity reduces jobs and wages. They also have direct costs through reduced consumption and well-being. Such disruptions are estimated to cost firms in developing countries more than $300 billion and households over $90 billion each year (Hallegatte et al. 2019). The incremental cost of increasing the resilience of newly constructed infrastructure assets depends on the sectors and assets in which countries are investing, but it remains small in all cases if the right data, risk models, and decision-making methods are available. For example, increasing the resilience of the assets that are exposed to hazards would increase investment needs in power, water and sanitation, and transport in low- and middle-income countries by $11­65 billion a year (figure 8). Although not negligible, it represents only 3 percent of infrastructure investment needs and less than 0.1 percent of LMIC GDP. At the global level, this would not affect current infrastructure affordability challenges. But country-level analysis has shown that the cost will be much higher for countries with high exposure to climate change and natural hazards (see, for example, Government of Fiji and World Bank 2017).  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Strategy to manage critical assets and infrastructure is approved and published » Agency in charge of coordinating resilience of critical assets and infrastructure is created and operational » Asset management systems with evidence-based maintenance plans are in place » Construction standards for infrastructure and building are updated, accounting for local hazards and criticality, and enforcement mechanisms are in place  » Expected recovery time for critical infrastructure systems--power, transport, water--after a major event » Revised legal framework to allocate risks across stakeholders, including in PPPs and buildings » State-owned enterprises have included climate change in their strategy and decision making   What are the returns on investment for increasing the resilience of exposed infrastructure to natural disasters? If projects are well selected, designed, and implemented (see Action A.2), the World Bank's Lifelines report suggests that investing $1 in making infrastructure more resilient avoids, on average, $4 in socioeconomic losses (Hallegatte et al. 2019). In total, building all new infrastructure assets in a more resilient way would bring a net benefit of $4.2 trillion over the full lifetime of the new infrastructures. The urgency of investing in better infrastructure is also evident. With massive infrastructure investment taking place in developing countries, the stock of low-resilience assets is growing rapidly, which will only increase the costs of natural hazards and climate change. The median cost of delaying action by one year is $100 billion. Although investing in resilience is good economics, financing these investments is not necessarily easy. While each $1 spent brings back $4, only a fraction of these $4 is in the form of avoided repair costs. Most is in the form of avoided disruption costs, which are difficult to capture and monetize to finance more investment in resilience. More resilient infrastructure also requires effective and proactive operation and maintenance, which has both technical and governance challenges, from the need to monitor each asset continuously to the fact that budget cuts are too often managed by postponing maintenance, with high long-term costs. Improving decision making and governance with the right institutions Table 3 shows five recommendations and 15 concrete actions for infrastructure resilience, based on Hallegatte et al. (2019). Different countries take different approaches to infrastructure resilience, but common principles have been widely applied. These principles, discussed in detail in the Organisation for Economic Co-    operation and Development's Good Governance for Critical Infrastructure Resilience (OECD 2019), are consistent with typical recommendations on the governance of risks (see, for example, Renn 2008; Wiener and Rogers 2002; World Bank 2013). There is a consensus among experts that governments have a key role to play in ensuring the resilience of critical infrastructure and should adopt a whole-of-government approach. Sectoral ministries and agencies and the ministries responsible for resilience to hazards and threats need to oversee and work with local authorities in infrastructure services delivery and regulation. This goes right down to municipality level, which are responsible for supplying drinking water and managing urban transit and transportation in many countries.   The most common solution for improving the coordination of risk management is to place an existing multi-ministry body (or, if necessary, a new body) in charge of information exchange, coordination, and perhaps implementing risk management measures (World Bank 2013). The body in charge of critical infrastructure can be given special powers to collect information, perform assessments, impose certain actions and ban others. For example, the recent Australian Security of Critical Infrastructure Act, aimed at protecting the country from sabotage and espionage, mandates the creation of a registry of critical infrastructure assets. It also gives the minister of the Department of Home Affairs the right to request information about these assets to determine whether any risk to national security is associated with an asset. The minister can impose or prohibit certain actions if there is ""a risk of an act or omission that would be prejudicial to security"". A body in charge of infrastructure resilience needs to be appropriately staffed and funded. However, it cannot, and should not, replace the regulatory bodies in charge of sectors, which should be a priority in low-capacity countries. Various decisions or regulations need to be coordinated across sectors, but their design and practical implementation are better conducted by each sector regulator to ensure consistency with other regulations and prevent conflicts. In practice, implementation will vary, depending on whether the regulation of an infrastructure sector is carried out directly by the government, by an independent agency, or through a contract (Eberhard 2007). Priorities for action The main challenge to making infrastructure more resilient is not primarily a financing one; rather, it is an issue of governance and the ability to make and enforce good decisions, designs, operations, and maintenance. The first priority is focusing on the early stages of infrastructure system development--designing regulations, producing hazards data and master plans-- or the initial stages of asset design (see toolbox D and Action A.2 for discussions on how to incorporate resilience considerations into public investment management). At these early stages, small investments can significantly improve the overall resilience of infrastructure systems and generate very large benefits. For example, changing the location of new infrastructure during the initial stages of a project can reduce risk levels. But mobilizing resources during the early stages of project preparation is particularly challenging as preparation budgets tend to be small. This makes it difficult to conduct adequate risk assessments, even if they can generate massive savings over an asset's lifetime. When resources become available to do a serious analysis of risk levels and mitigation options, the smart solutions (such as moving a road) are no longer available. The only solutions available during the latter stages of a project are strengthening and hardening, which come at a much higher cost. Doing risk   assessments early could help achieve resilience at a much lower cost. It is also important to remember that future climate impacts are highly uncertain, and robust solutions that perform acceptably in a large range of possible futures are preferable to solutions that are optimal for the ""most likely"" scenario but could lead to catastrophic outcomes in case of surprises. The second priority is improving maintenance (Hallegatte et al. 2019). Poor maintenance can increase infrastructure investment needs by 50 percent in the transport sector and more than 60 percent in the water sector (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). An analysis of OECD countries suggests that each additional $1 spent on road maintenance saves, on average, $1.50 in new investments, making better maintenance extremely cost-effective (Kornejew et al. 2019). Utility companies can use an infrastructure asset management system to ensure proper maintenance and better manage their operations. Such a system would include an inventory of all assets and their condition, as well as the strategic, financial, and technical aspects of managing the assets across their life cycle. This would help companies move away from a reactive approach toward an evidence-based, preventive maintenance schedule. In many countries, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will be key players when it comes to implementing resilience in strategic industries and the energy, water, transport and communications sectors, as they are responsible for much of the public investment in these areas. As shareholders, governments can require SOEs to incorporate specific resilience objectives, targets, and indicators in their statements of corporate intent or performance contracts. Corporate governance arrangements mainstream these reforms through dedicated board subcommittee and other specialized units addressing climate change risks across activities and investments. Governments can support these efforts through training and capacity building for officials responsible for SOE oversight and management. The World Bank Group's SOE leadership training toolkit integrates climate as a crosscutting dimension and can be leveraged and customized to include country and sector-specific risks and opportunities to address climate risks and resilience. Guidance is also available from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which has issued 11 recommendations across the four core elements of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets to help firms think through and report on climate change.14 The task force website and good practice handbook provide many examples of companies that are applying these recommendations. Governments should also develop a legal framework and institutional structure to ensure that disaster resilience is incorporated into PPP projects. Many governments have a disaster risk framework and a PPP framework, but the two rarely interact. Even in Japan, where PPPs are well developed and natural hazards well managed, guidelines for including resilience in PPPs exist, but are not mandatory. Incentives for operators to incorporate resilience in their assets depend on the contract type, P R I O R I T Y A R E A T W O  with ""build, operate, transfer"" models creating a stronger incentive than ""build, transfer, operate"" models. However, they can be weakened by excessively broad force majeure clauses, which transfer the risk from the private to the public sector. When they are too broad, these clauses reduce the incentives for actors to build and operate an infrastructure asset in a way that considers low-probability risks. Force majeure clauses in contracts are essential for establishing PPPs at a reasonable cost and can be designed to minimize any negative impacts on incentives for resilience. One solution is to include a quantified definition of force majeure for each event category and define it as applicable only in extreme cases. Ideally, a third party would decide whether the return period15 or intensity of an event was enough to trigger the force majeure clause. The contract can then determine the allocation of risk in terms of both missed revenues and restoration costs, ensuring that the private operator always bears a significant share of the cost. Mandatory or non-mandatory insurance could also ensure the sustainability of services, protecting the private operator against losses while minimizing costs to the public sector and maintaining the incentive to build more resilient assets and systems. Operators can also be required to prepare business continuity plans (BCPs) for every likely hazard (see Action 3.5). PPP design must consider context-specific factors, including the maturity of the PPP market, the risk tolerance of private sector players, and other risk factors such as vulnerability to commodity price shocks. These factors will determine how much risk they can transfer to private operators, creating trade-offs for government between incentivizing resilience and mobilizing private sector finance. When the private sector is unable to bear the risks from natural hazards, it becomes even more important to use alternative tools, such as strong construction codes and procurement rules.   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox D Regulations, codes, and standards  Well-designed regulations, codes, and procurement rules are the simplest approach to enhancing the quality, reliability, and resilience of infrastructure services. In the most widely applied solution, governments define the level of service expected from public or private infrastructure providers and apply it through: » Procurement rules, when the asset is publicly owned--for example, roads » Market regulations, when private actors provide services such as electricity » Contractual engagements--for example, through performance indicators for procuring and monitoring PPPs Regardless of the financial model, strong procurement rules and appropriate performance indicators in tender processes can ensure a minimum level of service and reliability. Although countries can define construction codes and regulations based on existing international standards, those at different income levels-- or with different preferences in terms of reliability--will want to design regulations and codes that are adapted to their needs. With climate change and other long-term environmental trends, standards and codes need to be revised regularly. According to Vallejo and Mullan (2017), approximately one-third of OECD countries are revising at least one mandatory national infrastructure standard to account for climate change adaptation, but similar processes are lacking in low-and middle-income countries. Sweden, for example, updated its road drainage standard in 2008, introducing a climate  safety factor to cope with the anticipated increase in rainfall due to climate change. Similarly, the European Commission mandated the Centre Européen de Normalisation to include climate change in the European civil engineering technical standards (the Eurocodes), especially for transport and energy infrastructure (European Commission 2014). Several national standards organizations have produced risk management guidelines that include climate change and resilience considerations for infrastructure (British Standards Institution 2011; Council of Standards Australia 2013; US National Institute of Standards and Technology 2015). And in 2015, the International Standards Organisation (ISO) created an adaptation task force to develop standards for vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning, and adaptation monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (ISO 2015). Quality control and enforcement of construction codes is particularly important. Miyamoto International (2019) points out that enforcing construction codes and standards is costly and more challenging than defining them. Enforcement in the infrastructure sector requires a robust legal framework and strong regulatory agencies to monitor construction and service quality and performance and reward and penalize service providers based on their performance. Many regulators lack the resources and capacity to enforce existing construction codes. As a result, expensive infrastructure systems may be designed with inappropriate materials or technologies, leading to high longterm costs.    ACTION 2.3 >> Revise land use and urban plans to make them risk-informed LEAD MINISTRY: Interior, planning, investment, infrastructure, or environment Land markets are powerful tools for driving new construction in a way that efficiently meets population needs. However, they are also imperfect, and often fail to fully internalize climate change and natural hazards (Bin and Polasky 2004; Holway and Burby 1990). In some countries, dysfunctional land markets mean that most of the population lives in informal dwellings with no land use or urban planning. So, developments often spring up in risky areas, especially when developers do not carry the cost of future climate change impacts. Agglomeration externalities and long building and urban infrastructure lifetimes mean that new developments are also largely irreversible. When a neighborhood is urbanized, it is likely to remain so forever, even if it requires massive protection or adaptation investment. Land use regulations can help by ensuring that new development occurs in places that are safe or can be easily and cheaply protected. They can also avoid unchecked urban development that leaves too little porous green space, further increasing runoff and flood risk (Lall and Deichmann 2012). But implementing risk-based land use plans remains challenging and countries need strong institutions that can ensure these plans are enforced. In most of the world today, risk-sensitive land use plans face strong political economy obstacles and are rarely enforced (World Bank 2013). Where land rights are mostly informal, introducing climate and disaster risks in land use planning would require the government to first build the right institution, legal framework, and information systems. Mandate land use and urban planning to accounts for long-term risks In areas with rapid urban growth, smart risk-informed planning is crucial to reduce long-term risks and adaptation costs. Land use plans need to account for climate risk and avoid guiding urban growth into high-risk zones. Designating high-risk zones as unsuitable for human settlement can avoid costly and politically challenging relocation decisions. Using simple geographic information system approaches, governments can identify ""good"" land for infrastructure development that is safe and close to opportunities, jobs, and existing network infrastructure (toolbox E). One option for government is to mandate local authorities to revise their land use and urbanization plans, based on hazard maps that take climate change into   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox E Using geospatial information to identify priority land for urbanization  Risk-informed urbanization planning can help accommodate Fiji's growing urban population while limiting the increase in natural risks. In 2016, Nadi Town, Fiji's third-largest urban center, had a population of around 52,800 and was growing at the relatively rapid rate of 2.5 percent a year, driven by tourism, transportation, and high-value real estate developments. So, it sought to identify areas for future settlement and infrastructure investment that would minimize exposure to natural risks and development costs (Government of Fiji and World Bank 2017). Planners used digital elevation models and flood maps as a first screen to identify areas that might be suitable for further development. Figure E.1 shows the areas of Nadi that are highly exposed to coastal and river   floods in red, blue, and orange; those that are at high or extreme risk of flood in a 100-year return-period flood risk map are purple; developed areas are gray; and areas with steep slopes are white. The light pink areas are potentially suitable for future development, although further studies are required to confirm this simple assessment, and more investment in drainage could make some of the flood-prone, low-lying areas suitable for development. The exercise identified about 4.3 square kilometers that were not developed within the town boundary (see inset). With additional investment to improve drainage, this land could be a priority for future development. With future densities of 10­15 dwellings per hectare (based on today's values), this area could host 4,300­6,500 households. In view of Nadi's backlog of about 2,000 units and its growth rate of 300 new households a year, this land could accommodate the town's urban growth for 8­15 years. Over the longer term, town planners should consider areas beyond the town boundary. This could be combined with expanding the boundary. More than 45 square kilometers are available close to Nadi, but outside the town boundary. This area could accommodate 45,000­70,000 households, enough to manage rural-urban migration for several decades. Using this land, however, would require addressing issues of land tenure and ownership and expanding networks, especially for water and sanitation.    account. Colombia's framework law, for example, requires regional, municipal and district authorities to incorporate climate change management into their development and land management plans.16 Governments can also create financial incentives for local authorities to consider climate change, by linking the revision of plans with financial support for risk reduction projects or other initiatives. In France, the PPP for natural disaster insurance (the CatNat system) offers different deductibles for municipalities that have designed and implemented a flood management plan and consider flood risk in the building permit approval process (Przyluski and Hallegatte 2012). Risk-sensitive land use and urbanization plans must also abide by construction norms and building regulations. The quality of construction and the role played by building regulations are key determinants of climate resilience. Behavioral and market failures--for example, a lack of awareness of risks or the challenge of verifying whether a building is built to standard--affect the resilience of buildings and justify public action in creating and enforcing standards. The world will see the construction of one billion new dwelling units by 2050. With current practices, this may lead to a rapid increase in risk. And yet this growth creates an opportunity for inexpensive reductions in risk through appropriate building regulations. Appropriately designed new buildings can be made disaster-resistant for a small fraction (5­10 percent) of the cost of construction. However, retrofitting vulnerable structures may require major expenditure, in the range of 10­50 percent of building value. Infrastructure localization decisions drive urbanization patterns and expose populations and assets to risks (Baum-Snow 2007a, 2007b); they should therefore be coordinated with land use and urban plans. Planners can use infrastructure master plans and new investments to guide urban growth towards safe zones. Choices  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Percentage of country/ municipalities with revised land use or urbanization plans that include current and projected hazards » Share of population living in (or relocated from) high-risk areas, fragile buildings or retrofitted fragile buildings » Strategy for or specific regulations on the use of nature-based solutions approved  » Areas impossible or too costly to protect against climate change impacts identified and communicated to the public » Regulation mandating the provision of climate and hazard information to buyer in real estate markets  around the localization of power, water, sanitation, and transit infrastructure guides spatial development and influences land use, land use intensity, land values, and employment and population densities (figure 9). Typically, transit-oriented development investments have a unique ability to influence community resilience because they inherently lead to concentrations of people and businesses around transit stops (Salat and Ollivier 2017). For example, the location of a new road corridor will probably determine where new settlements are built. If these investments are not made strategically, considering information on an area's exposure to natural hazards, the outcome could be an increase in vulnerability to disasters. FIGURE 9 >> Urbanization in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, closely follows the major public transport lines Source: NASA MODIS Imagery 2002­2013 for built-up area and OpenStreetMap for primary and trunk roads. With land use, early action is more efficient. Once a neighborhood has reached a critical mass, relocating households becomes difficult. Once high-risk areas are developed and inhabited, they may require costly protection investments, which are often unaffordable in lower-income economies. The estimated cost of the Netherlands' fifth Delta Program, which aims to improve national flood safety and fresh water supply, is 20 billion. The cost of the new flood protection system in New Orleans--a city of fewer than one million inhabitants--is about $15 billion. The reason these protection systems are so costly is partly due to having to meet rigorous design and construction standards and undergo perfect maintenance. Defense failure can lead to much larger losses than would have occurred in the absence of protection (Hallegatte et al. 2013). In places with little capacity to create and enforce risk-sensitive land use and urban plans, other approaches may be mobilized, such as allocating the riskiest land to non-residential use. In many places, flood zones or wetlands can be transformed into urban parks, to minimize the risk of encroachment. Explore the implications of climate change for internal migrations and regional economic impacts Not all regions or areas of a country will be affected in the same way. Some will be affected more than others, and some--such as higher elevation areas in hot countries--may gain at least a comparative advantage.  The Groundswell report explores this question, focusing on three regions--SubSaharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America--that together represent 55 percent of the developing world's population (Rigaud et al. 2018). It projects that, without concrete climate and development action, just over 143 million people (around 2.8 percent of these regions' population) could be forced to move within their own countries by 2050 to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges.  (Bagley et al. 2014). Protecting ecosystems can therefore help countries reduce exposure to natural disasters. In 2015, a flood risk assessment in Colombo, Sri Lanka, considered the deep uncertainty around the city's hydrological conditions and vulnerabilities to compare the economic consequences of floods with and without local wetlands (Hallegatte et al. 2019). While it is impossible to predict future flood risks in the city with any certainty, the study revealed that the economic consequences of floods would exceed 1 percent of Colombo's GDP every year--a level of risk the authorities consider intolerable--in the scenarios where all the city's wetlands disappear. As well as offering protection, ecosystems also provide income sources. To protect these incomes from the impacts of climate change, the main option is reducing non-climate stresses on ecosystems to make them better able to cope with changes in environmental conditions. Conservation and ecosystem-based strategies are critical for making ecosystems more resilient and protecting the resources on which many poor people in rural areas depend. Healthy ecosystems are generally quite resilient, so protecting them and restoring degraded lands can increase their ability to withstand climate-related disturbances. Consider strategic retreat when risk reduction is impossible or unaffordable As the impacts of climate change intensify--through rising sea levels or increasingly frequent flooding--authorities should consider a managed retreat or relocation of people. While some areas can afford to invest in costly physical protection infrastructure such as extensive sea dike systems, the risks involved can also make such an approach unviable or unaffordable in the long run. Adaptation and resilience investments that are efficient over the short term can also prove costly over the long term by promoting maladaptation through the creation of new or higher risks. For example, although incremental coastal protection investments may offer short-term relief, they also lock future urban, economic, and population growth into high-risk areas, requiring multiple followup protection investments, which may one day become unaffordable. Lower-income areas and economies may prefer a well-managed retreat from areas with excessive risk over cycles of continuously increasing risk and expenditure. People have long used temporary migration as part of their coping mechanisms to manage natural disasters and climate variability (Rigaud et al. 2018). But long-term permanent migrations can be more difficult to manage, have much larger financial, cultural and psychological costs, and pose unprecedented ethical questions. Retreat and relocation strategies require careful consultation, planning, and compensation, in line with social safeguards--and relocating large populations while preserving livelihoods is costly. Decisions regarding retreat and relocation are always complex, and rely on more than economics. Fairness, the political context, and a government's ability to manage the negative impact of relocation and support affected populations are all important considerations. In some extreme cases, the long-term viability of entire countries has been questioned. This is especially so for small, low-lying, highly vulnerable islands facing sea level rise. However, there is no definitive answer to whether adaptation to long-term climate change is technically, economically, and politically possible in all countries, and what is possible will often depend on the instruments the international community provides to support highly vulnerable countries. Nevertheless, an adaptation intervention or strategy has to be sustainable over the long term. Interventions that simply postpone the negative consequences of climate change for a few decades may lead to maladaptation and higher costs in the long run.   Priority Area 3: Help firms and people manage residual risks and natural disasters  LEAD MINISTRY: Interior or environment  No matter how much private actors and governments try to reduce people's exposure or make their assets more resistant to natural hazards and climate change, they cannot reduce risk to zero. Disasters will continue to inflict damage, so it is vital to supplement actions on exposure and vulnerability with improvements in people's ability to cope with unavoidable shocks. A government's first function is ensuring disaster management instruments are available to all firms and households--for example, through insurance regulations. And since ensuring safety and security and managing emergencies and crises is one of their main functions, governments also have an important role to play in ensuring that all private actors cope with and recover from disasters and climate impacts, using tools ranging from social protection to emergency response and humanitarian interventions. TAKING ACTION >> Screening questions Identify actions to cope with and recover from unavoidable shocks  While effective risk mitigation can go a long way in reducing loss and damage, some natural shocks are too extreme and intense to be prevented. Governments need strategies to ensure that when disasters do occur, people and firms can cope without devastating long-term consequences and recover quickly. The following questions can help decision makers identify shortcomings and guide them towards the actions needed to manage residual risks.  ACTION 3.1 >> Early warning systems Do people have universal access to effective early warning systems for natural hazards? Should include: effective communication channels; warnings with clear recommended actions Is the country prepared to manage large-scale evacuations? Should include: adequate and inclusive shelters; evacuation plans ACTION 3.2 >> Strategy to manage residual risks  ACTION 3.3 >> Insurance and other financial instruments Are financial services equipped to provide people with accessible services in postdisaster situations? Could include: readiness of financial sector to provide access to savings, loans, and remittances in a disaster aftermath Do households and firms have access to disaster insurance? Are these services affordable? Could include: penetration rate of disaster insurance among households and firms; ratio of premium to expected claim amounts  Does the country have a comprehensive strategy for managing residual climate and natural risks? Should include: economywide strategy to manage residual risks and disasters; households and firms have access to necessary financial instruments to manage small and big shocks    ACTION 3.4 >> Adaptive social protection  ACTION 3.5 >> Business continuity plans  Are households covered by a social protection scheme that can provide postdisaster support? Should include: stress-tested systems that can deliver payments in a postdisaster context--for example, if power is interrupted Does the country have a registry of potential beneficiaries, in case of major disasters, and the ability to make quick transfers to them? For example: in Kenya, all householders in the regions covered by the Hunger Safety Net Programme are registered and have a bank account on file to ensure quick transfers  Are firms required to prepare business continuity and contingency planning? Could include: regulation, tax incentives, or technical support available to develop such plans Does the government have contingency plans to support affected firms? Could include: tax relief, reconstruction subsidies, or emergency loans  ACTION 3.6 >> Capacity to build back better Are postdisaster recovery and reconstruction plans designed to avoid long-term lock-in of risk? Could include: not developing areas that may be prohibitively expensive to protect in the long term Are plans in place to build back stronger, faster, and fairer after large-scale disasters? Could include: pre-contracting debris removal tasks; procurement agreements for essential services    ACTION 3.1 >> Save lives (and money) with hydromet, early warning, and emergency management systems LEAD MINISTRIES: Interior and environment Weather forecasts enable the anticipation of and preparation for extreme events, and timely evacuation can save thousands of lives. The value of preparedness was illustrated by two intense cyclones in the Bay of Bengal that occurred 14 years apart. Cyclone 05B in 1999 caused massive devastation, killing more than 10,000 people, and destroying housing and public infrastructure in the state of Odisha, India. Fourteen years later, Cyclone Phailin, with wind speeds of 200 kilometers an hour, made landfall in Odisha on October 12, 2013. This time, the story unfolded differently. After 72 hours, the official death toll was 38 persons, less than 0.4 percent of the death toll in 1999, and close to one million people had been evacuated to cyclone shelters, safe houses, and inland locations in Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. This success was the result of years of effort by the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority and the government of Odisha, which built disaster risk mitigation infrastructure, established evacuation protocols, identified potential safe buildings to house communities, and, most importantly, worked with communities and local organizations to set up volunteer teams and local champions who knew what needed to be done when the time came to act. Early warning systems can save lives when they effectively communicate information, using simple messages and practical advice on how to react to warnings. The European Meteoalarm system provides an example of a simple information system to warn people and inform them of required actions.17 Reaching the people who need to act before a disaster can be done using mobile phones or internet, but also with volunteers who are well connected and trusted in their communities. Other important recommendations include ensuring shelter designs meet the needs of communities, taking into account gender issues and access for people with disability.18 Preparation also reduces physical damage and economic loss. Preparing a house before a hurricane (by shuttering windows, for example) can reduce damage by up to 50 percent (Williams 2002). In the case of floods, households can prepare by moving goods to the second floor of buildings, moving vehicles outside the flood zone, protecting important documents and valuables, disconnecting electricity and gas supplies, unplugging electric appliances, and installing water pumps. Studies show that when the Elbe and Danube flooded in Europe in 2002, 31 percent of the population in flooded areas implemented such preventive measures   (Kreibich et al. 2005; Thieken et al. 2007). The timing of the flood warning was critical: the businesses that were able to protect their equipment or inventories were those that received the warning early enough. One study estimates that a warning issued 48 hours before a flood can reduce overall damage by more than 50 percent (Carsell et al. 2004). The benefits of providing universal access to early warning systems globally have been repeatedly found to largely exceed costs (GCA 2019; World Meteorological Organization et al. 2015; Hallegatte 2012; Hallegatte et al. 2016b). One study estimated that investing in early warning systems could generate about $13 billion a year in avoided asset losses and well-being gains equivalent to $22 billion (Hallegatte et al. 2016b). Despite considering only asset losses and not human lives that could have been saved, this estimate is much larger than previous assessments. Although no solid estimate exists for the cost of providing such a service globally, a back-of-the-envelope calculation is about $1 billion a year (Hallegatte 2012). This confirms that investing in an early warning system makes economic sense, even without considering its main benefit: the lives that can be saved (World Bank 2013). Although early warning and prevention systems cannot avert all damages, they can help ensure that emergency services are ready to act, and possibly pre-positioned so that they can act more quickly and efficiently. Early warning systems must be interconnected with emergency management systems, including health care, fire, police, civil protection, and the army, who can support a response to major disasters.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Daily weather forecasts are produced by the hydromet agency and an easy-to-communicate alert system is in place » Communication channels are in place to efficiently communicate early warnings to the population and emergency services » Average error in early warning (both missed events and false alarms) » Share of population with access to early warning systems or covered by evacuation plans » Average distance to closest shelter  » Capacity of shelters or emergency services--for example, number of emergency medical service units, and trained health emergency professionals » Duration communities can operate safely and independently--for example, water and food storage and medical supplies » Number of disaster drills performed per year   ACTION 3.2 >> Provide all firms and households with risk management instruments LEAD MINISTRY: Economy or finance, with social affairs or protection  Helping households cope with and recover from shocks requires a holistic and flexible risk management strategy with a range of policy instruments appropriate for different disasters and affected populations. Poorer and richer households have different needs and can be supported with different instruments (figure 11).  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  Revenue diversification and basic social protection can  help households at all income levels cope with small shocks, while remittances make people less vulnerable to income shocks. Financial inclusion helps poor people save in ways that are less vulnerable to natural hazards than in-kind savings, such as livestock and housing; it also diversifies risk. But when shocks are larger, these instruments will not be enough, and additional tools will be needed. For relatively wealthier households, financial savings will help, and access to borrowing can help them rebuild quickly. But there are limits to what savings and access to borrowing can achieve, and borrowing can create a debt trap that poor households struggle to escape. Insurance products can provide protection against rare shocks at a lower cost than savings or borrowing. A  » Overall strategy to manage residual risks and disasters is prepared and approved » Coordination mechanisms between the various preparedness actors are in place--for example, ministries or agencies for crisis management, social protection, food security and agriculture, finance » Fraction of the population covered by at least one financial instrument to cope with shocks--for example, insurance, social protection, or access to emergency borrowing  study of the Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand  in 2011 shows that insurance helps firms bounce  back after a shock (Poontirakul et al. 2017). Over the  medium term, a firm with business interruption insurance is significantly more  likely (by some 15 percentage points) to have enhanced productivity and improved  performance after a disaster.  Social protection systems, which are usually implemented to reduce poverty and help people manage idiosyncratic shocks such as accident and health issues, can also provide support in postdisaster situations. To increase their efficiency in postdisaster situations, some countries have implemented adaptive social protection systems that respond to shocks by either expanding the list of beneficiaries (Ethiopia or Kenya) or increasing transfers to existing beneficiaries (Fiji).  ACTION 3.3 >> Develop the insurance sector, building on public-private partnerships LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  Domestic disaster insurance markets have proven to  be an effective channel for developing the resilience of disaster-exposed households and businesses. The Turkish Catastrophe Insurance Pool and the Mongolian  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  Livestock Insurance Pool are good examples of PPPs.  Both the Turkish and Mongolian governments use  their domestic insurance markets to reach households  and businesses with insurance products, realizing  their policy goals of expanding the population's financial resilience to disasters. Both partnerships have substantially increased insurance penetration at the local level. But developing insurance markets is challenging, particularly in low-income environments. Where insurance is not compulsory, pick-up rates remain low. Even in the US and Italy--high-income countries with subsidized insurance against floods or earthquakes-- less than 30 percent of homeowners are covered. The  Mongolian Livestock Insurance Pool scheme started  in 2005 and covers more than 10,000 herders. But  despite its success, pick-up rates remain relatively low, at less than 15 percent  of herders in covered areas. There are many reasons for low pick-up, including  high costs, affordability issues and behavioral biases (Kunreuther et al. 2013). But  while affordability issues, magnified by large transaction costs, are a problem in  developing countries, weak institutions and a lack of trust also play a role. A lack  of robust data--which insurers need to assess potential risks--is another frequent  problem in developing countries.  Index-based insurance refers to products for which payments are not based on observed losses. Instead, they are based on when a physical variable--for example, a rainfall deficit, wind speed, or area-based yield--or another index exceeds a predetermined threshold, regardless of the existence of loss. For example, a farmer will receive a predefined insurance payment if rainfall falls below a minimum threshold over a one-month period. Index-based insurance schemes have major advantages over traditional contracts, including: » Reduced transaction costs because losses do not need to be measured    » Encouraging individuals to still take preventive measures because the payout does not depend on losses or actions taken to reduce risks--in other words, reducing moral hazard » Simple and objective payment decisions, which make it easier to enforce contracts. But index-based insurance also suffers from basis risk--the difference between payments contract holders receive and the losses they suffer. This means that they may receive a payment and lose nothing; but they could also receive nothing and have large losses, which would be catastrophic for those close to subsistence level. So, when exploring index-based insurance products, it is important to: » Invest in high-quality indices that aim to minimize basis risk » Ensure the contract holder fully understands the limitations of the index » Explore the possibility of covering large groups--for example, a community or an agriculture cooperative--which makes the basis risk smaller and easier to manage.  ACTION 3.4 >> Build a social protection system that is responsive to shocks LEAD MINISTRY: Social affairs or social protection Ensure that social protection systems can be scaled up in case of disaster For the poorest households, savings are often not an option, and high transaction costs and affordability issues make access to private insurance challenging. These households need well-targeted and easily scalable social safety nets.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  Adaptive social protection systems have proven to be critical for channeling resources to those who are most in need due to climate stresses. As shown in Figure 12, adaptive systems can respond quickly to disasters or slow-onset climate crises through: » Vertical expansion: Scaling up or providing additional resources to regular beneficiaries--for example, all beneficiaries of Fiji's Poverty Benefit Scheme received exceptional transfers after Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016. » Horizontal expansion: Scaling out or providing support to additional beneficiaries during bad times or years--for example, the number of beneficiaries of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program depends on rainfall.  » Stress test of existing systems completed, including delivery mechanisms » Contingency plan to scale up social protection systems developed and approved » Delivery mechanism in place, such as bank accounts for all households in registry » Share of population covered by social protection or in social registry, including potential beneficiaries in case of scale-up  Some systems combine scaling up and out. Kenya's shock-responsive cash transfer Hunger Safety Net Programme, for example, has disbursed about $8 million to some 180,000 households (900,000 people) in response to drought. The government also used the program to provide aid before a drought hit in 2015, when El Niño increased the likelihood of lower rainfall. As well as raising awareness of the impending shock, this gave people the resources they needed to prepare for it.  Ethiopia's innovative adaptive Productive Safety Net Programme has been found to reduce the impact of drought in rural households. A study measuring the impact of drought on farmers' consumption in 2005 and 2011 found that a 10 percent loss of crops through drought led to a 2 percent reduction in consumption. But people    covered by the program only experienced a 1.5 percent reduction, suggesting that the safety net reduces the impact by a quarter on average (Porter and White 2016).   Population  Strengthen social protection systems, especially delivery systems and pre-arranged finance Adaptive social protection requires more administrative and financial resources than regular social protection systems. A recent World Bank report (Bowen et al. 2020) identifies several priorities and investments that go above and beyond business as usual for regular social protection. Generated by the unique demands of building household resilience to systemic shocks, these priorities fall into four building blocks: » Programs: To be adaptive, social protection systems need to build resilience by supporting preparedness, coping, and adaptation. This includes actions before and in the immediate aftermath of disasters or environmental shocks. » Data and information: The design and implementation of social protection systems must be underpinned by data and information. This also needs to be easily available to respond quickly after a disaster, when timeliness is critical and data collection is difficult. » Finance: To be scaled up when required, social protection systems must have resources available--both of their own and in coordination with the Ministry of Finance. For a timely and effective delivery, these resources must be pre-arranged.    » Institutional arrangements and partnerships: Multi-sectoral institutional arrangements and partnerships--especially between government and humanitarian crisis management agencies--are critical for an efficient response. The use of modern tools and systems can make delivery systems more flexible, able to react quicker, and more resilient to shock, ensuring their reliability during a crisis. To make adaptative social protection systems possible, governments must ensure that: » The social registry is sufficiently inclusive and includes more than the ""regular"" social protection beneficiaries. These registries can build on unique and universal identification systems (with appropriate oversight and accountability to make sure it is used for the correct purpose). » Electronic/digital payment mechanisms are robust enough to get cash to households even during a crisis, when power may be out for extended periods and roads may be cut for even longer. Investing in such systems will raise the adaptation potential of social safety nets, and may facilitate the delivery of international aid and humanitarian support, as seen in the Philippines (Hallegatte et al. 2016b). An adaptation and resilience strategy can include provision to ensure that new and existing social protection systems are designed or retrofitted to do more to boost resilience. Spotlight 3 discusses the opportunity to design social protection investments to respond to pandemics such as COVID-19 so they build long-term resilience in affected countries. Ensure resilience measures support long-term adaptation and do not lock people into a place or activity Support to people after shocks or disasters should be designed in a way that does not disincentivize adaptation to long-term trends. For example, support to areas that are increasingly affected by drought should not lock people in place, especially if the trend is expected to worsen over time. Instead, postdisaster support should help people change activity or migrate if that will improve their prospects. Social protection schemes need to maintain incentives to invest in long-term adaptation to economic and environmental changes. Poorly designed social safety nets can reduce the incentive for people to quickly adapt and change occupation or activity when the first effects of climate change appear (Chambwera et al. 2014). This problem is not new or specific to climate change, and efforts are already under way to ensure that social protection is a facilitator of, and not an obstacle to, longterm change and adaptation. This includes facilitating migration (Brown et al. 2013; Bryan et al. 2012) or making benefits more portable if recipients decide to move to capture better opportunities (World Bank Group 2015).   SPOTLIGHT 3 >> COVID-19 Exiting the COVID-19 crisis more resilient than before?  A few months into the COVID-19 crisis, almost all countries have boosted their social protection systems to help their population manage the pandemic and the consequences of needed containment measures (Gentilini et al. 2020). However, this experience has shown that existing systems are not always designed to quickly increase the number of beneficiaries or deliver exceptional transfers to usual beneficiaries. Interventions in most countries include determining which additional beneficiaries need to be covered; executing the transfers through existing or new delivery mechanisms; and financing the cost of these transfers.  If designed and implemented sustainably, and if efforts are maintained over the long term, any improvements made during the COVID-19 crisis could improve all social protection systems' capacity to scale up quickly and efficiently next time countries are affected by a major shock, including a climate-related one. This includes, for example, creating and maintaining household registries and electronic payment mechanisms. TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox F Assessing the benefits of higher resilience and designing resilience-building instruments  One challenge in designing and advocating for resilienc-ebuilding tools like adaptive social protection is that they do not yield measurable benefits in terms of reduced asset or economic losses. But although insurance, social protection, and remittances do not reduce direct damage from a disaster, they can significantly reduce impacts on societal well-being (Hallegatte et al. 2016b). It is possible to use alternative metrics--such as the number of people falling into poverty, full recovery time, or wellbeing losses--to assess and compare initiatives that reduce asset losses or increase socioeconomic resilience. These include building dikes and providing insurance to atrisk populations. By expanding the range of policies they consider to reduce disaster impacts, decision makers can create cheaper, more efficient, and more equitable policy packages.  An analysis of Sri Lanka's social protection system found that--in the case of a 1-in-50year flood in Rathnapura--a top-up equivalent to one month of regular transfers to all recipients of the Samurdhi cash transfer program would have a benefit-cost ratio of 2.6, and would cost $1.2 million (Walsh and Hallegatte 2019). More targeted approaches reduce the budgetary cost of the top-up and increase the benefit-cost ratio, mostly by reducing the inclusion error (figure F.1). The same study also investigated using a new proxy means testing (PMT) score to support poor households affected by floods, calculating benefits and costs across the range of PMT scores. The analysis suggested that the marginal benefit of adding recipients exceeds the marginal cost, up to a PMT score around 950 (figure F.2). This type of analysis can help guide the design of postdisaster support systems and ensure the most efficient use of limited resources after a shock.   ACTION 3.5 >> Help firms develop business continuity plans and financial preparedness LEAD MINISTRY: Economy  Individual firms' ability to cope with a shock and  continue to produce in the aftermath of a disaster depends on many factors; still firms can do a lot to become more resilient (Rose 2009). The general  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  recommendation is to identify threats, assess risks, and  consider mitigation options. This allows them to invest  in prevention--for example, by adding a generator  in case of power outage, investing in movable flood  protection, or even elevating critical equipment. It also helps them prepare for residual risk.  » Fraction of firms with BCPs or disaster insurance coverage  Preparing a BCP can ensure a firm's management  » Number of area-based BCPs  and workers know what to do in case of disaster to  maintain or restore production as fast as possible.  For example, Japan's policy and institutional framework for industry resilience,  the Basic Disaster Response Plan, requires companies to recognize the role they  are expected to play when disaster strikes, understand their own risk from a  natural disaster, implement risk management and develop a BCP to minimize  the consequences of shocks. The 2012 Japan Revitalization Strategy sets BCP  establishment targets for 100 percent of large firms and 50 percent of small and  medium enterprises by 2020.  BCPs usually include operational recommendations on:  » How to proceed if critical supplies cannot be procured  » How to maintain activity if people have to work from home due to damages to the firm facility  » What to do if there is no internet or other form of telecommunication  » How to manage the needs of workers personally affected by the disaster through injury, loss of friends or relatives, or loss of home.  BCPs should also consider the full supply chain and include issues that may affect suppliers (or suppliers' suppliers) and clients. They can also consider financial issues, such as how to manage a drop in sales, increased supply prices, or the    urgent need to replace expensive equipment. Access to contingent credit lines and appropriate insurance are among the many tools that firms can include in their BCP. Firms or facilities may find it easier to establish an area-based BCP to manage disaster impacts by collaborating and pooling their resources to reduce costs-- for example, by sharing emergency power generation. Since the 2011 earthquake in Japan, which caused large production disruptions, several firms have come together to redesign their evacuation protocols and emergency communication procedures and develop new shared backup solutions for critical utilities. This can require an authorizing legal and regulatory environment, so government, competition regulators and other authorities may need to support such efforts. BCPs can be designed by performing stress tests and exploring ""what if"" scenarios to identify bottlenecks and vulnerable points (Chopra and Sodhi 2004). Firms should update plans regularly, incorporating lessons from any new disasters or disruptions (Hamel and Valikangas 2003). They also need sophisticated data management. After the 2011 earthquake, Toyota created a new database, Rescue, for the inventories held by 650,000 suppliers worldwide. It uses this information to locate available resources and prevent bottlenecks in production processes when suppliers are affected by a shock. ACTION 3.6 >> Be prepared to build back better after disasters, with contingency plans and financing LEAD MINISTRY: Economy, planning, environment, investment, or infrastructure  Public assets--from energy and transport infrastructure  to schools and hospitals--are highly exposed to disasters, so contingency plans and financing are required to ensure the rapid and efficient reconstruction or repair  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  of these systems after a disaster. And since schools are  often used as shelters in case of evacuation, they usually  need modifying before they can accommodate students  again, which also requires preparation and finance.  One common recommendation is for each sector to prepare the equivalent of a business continuity and reconstruction plan to follow in a disaster aftermath. Such plans are also important inputs into the financial component of the response, since they should provide an estimate of required resources. See Action 4.1 for a discussion on contingent liability. When a disaster hits and old or low-quality assets are destroyed, public and private sector reconstruction can  » Resilient recovery and reconstruction plans ready for implementation, with revised land use and standards » Pre-approved contracts for emergency interventions (such as debris removal) or reconstruction (such as road repairs) approved, with enhanced standards  help countries build back better under improved building  norms, thereby improving their productivity and  resilience postdisaster. Often, this does not happen--  usually because the urgency to rebuild leaves little time and resources to rethink the  design or spatial footprint of cities and infrastructure. Building back better depends  on a country's ability to plan and implement the reconstruction process efficiently;  having pre-prepared plans, developed ahead of a crisis, is extremely useful.  There are some encouraging cases. After the 2009 Victoria bushfires in Australia, the authorities successfully implemented measures to build back better, with improved land use planning and structural design (Mannakkara et al. 2014). In Mexico, the government has initiated innovative financing arrangements under its natural disasters fund, Fondo de Desastres Naturales (FONDEN), to incentivize investment, build back better, and relocate housing to lower-risk areas (Tanner and Rentschler 2015).  Replacements for destroyed capital can be more resilient and better adapted to current and future needs, and use the most recent technologies, which have higher productivity. Upgrading capital can involve:    » For households, rebuilding houses with better insulation and heating systems, allowing for energy conservation and savings » For companies, replacing old production technologies with new ones-- for example, computer-based management files instead of paper-based systems » For government and public agencies, adapting public infrastructure to new needs--for example, replacing destroyed schools with larger or smaller buildings according to demographic evolutions. A more productive economy can compensate for capital losses in an event aftermath, increasing the pace of technical change and representing a positive consequence of disasters. Several studies mention this ""productivity effect"" (Albala Bertrand 1993; Benson and Clay 2004; Hornbeck and Keniston 2017). Although it cannot turn natural disasters into desirable events (Hallegatte and Dumas 2009), the productivity effect can reduce overall impacts on economic growth and well-being. The potential benefits of building back stronger and using more recent and productive technologies provide a strong incentive for introducing policies and tools that help ensure the highest quality reconstruction. For both private and public sectors, useful policies and tools--which must be in place before disaster hits for their benefits to be realized--include: » Contingency plans and a clear allocation of reconstruction responsibilities » Financial protection through insurance or social protection systems » Financial inclusion with access to credit to finance the reconstruction » Updated construction norms and performance standards to apply to the reconstruction » Access to information and knowledge on how to implement modern solutions and technologies. Building back better does not only depend on financial resources; countries must also have the ability to efficiently plan and rebuild. The experiences in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake revealed that a lack of technical expertise and raw materials in the disaster location can make building back better difficult in practice (Kijewski-Correa and Taflanidis 2012). However, with good advance planning and preparation, recovery efforts can build back not only stronger, but also faster and more inclusively (Hallegatte et al. 2018).  Priority Area 4: Manage financial and macrofiscal issues  LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  Climate change impacts--whether through slow changes or shocks--and the adaptation actions that households, firms, and investors take can influence macroeconomic aggregates such as GDP, trade balance, inflation, or public debt (figure 13). They may also lead to changes in asset values or financial risks that are large enough to threaten the stability of the financial system (Carney 2015; Campiglio et al. 2018). Because they have macro-level implications, climate and disaster risks cannot be managed by individual households, firms, or investors alone. There also needs to be public action, especially in assessing, monitoring, and regulating financial and macrofiscal risks. This is particularly challenging due to the massive uncertainty around how to measure or model the macroeconomic impacts of natural disasters and climate change. Decision makers should therefore consider uncertainty when designing adaptation and resilience strategies, which need to be both robust, so they deliver benefits in the wide range of possible futures, and flexible, so they can be adjusted as new information becomes available. TAKING ACTION >> Screening questions Identify actions to mitigate financial and macrofiscal risks  Through its impacts on people and firms, climate change has the potential to cause system-wide impacts on economies. Are countries and governments well prepared to manage the fiscal and financial shocks alongside the longterm structural changes that climate change could bring? The following questions can help decision makers identify shortcomings and guide them towards the actions needed to mitigate financial and macrofiscal risks.  ACTION 4.2 >> Mitigating macroeconomic impacts Are the possible long-term macroeconomic impacts of disasters and climate change assessed and planned for? Is the uncertainty properly considered? Should include: implications for GDP and long-term debt sustainability, in multiple scenarios  ACTION 4.1 >> Financial protection strategy Does the government have an assessment of contingent liabilities associated with different natural hazards? Does the government have contingency plans and financing instruments that can mobilize the resources needed to respond to a shock? Could include: postdisaster public finance management (PFM) assessment; clear earmarking; defined accountabilities; targeting  ACTION 4.3 >> A resilient financial system Have climate stress tests of the financial system been conducted, and potential shortcomings addressed? Should include: publicly disclosed stress tests of banks, insurers, institutional investors, and pension funds; regulations to mitigate financial sector risks Have regulators and financial supervisory authorities assessed the vulnerability of the financial system and introduced specific recommendations or regulations? Could include: large firms and investors reporting annually on their exposure to climate and disaster risks  ACTION 4.1 >> Include contingent liabilities from natural disasters and environmental shocks in the planning and budgeting process LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  Contingent liabilities only materialize if a certain event occurs. For example, if the roads are damaged by flood, the government is responsible for repairing them. There are two types of contingent liability:  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators  » Explicit contingent liabilities are relatively  easy to estimate, based on public asset and  infrastructure inventories--for example, if the  state owns the public roads, it is responsible for fixing them.  » Risk to public assets and corresponding contingent liabilities assessed  » Implicit liabilities are linked to other expectations or forms of commitment and are more difficult to estimate--for example, governments are expected to support populations affected by  » Emergency and social protection spending needs and corresponding contingent liabilities assessed  disaster and provide humanitarian and financial resources. The first step, then, is to include these contingent liabilities in the budget planning process and make them part of the deliberation (World Bank 2013; OECD and World Bank 2019). This ensures that climate and  » Explicit and implicit contingent liabilities quantified and included in budget documents » Risk to GDP and tax revenues estimated and included in budget documents  disaster risks cannot be ignored. The Bhutanese budget  process, for example, includes natural disasters (Nu  225 million/0.1 percent of GDP) and climate change impact (Nu 20 million/0.01  percent of GDP) in its fiscal risk assessment matrix (implicit contingent liabilities).  Sweden's Climate Act explicitly states that climate and national budgetary policies  should be aligned and requires investment-related impacts to be explicitly  considered in the four-year climate plan.20 It also requires the annual government  report on climate action to be connected to the budget bill, strengthening the link  between them. France also requires its annual report on climate change policies  to be connected with the budget bill.21 The report contains information on public  and private funds dedicated to climate change policies and calculates the gap to the  necessary volumes required.  One major challenge, dramatically illustrated by the COVID-19 crisis, is the need to consider the possibility of multiple simultaneous crises--for example, when    a hurricane affects a region already struggling with an epidemic--and cascading crises, which occur when one crisis, such as a long drought, triggers another crisis, magnifies social tensions or leads to conflict and violence. While a fully probabilistic assessment of compounding risks may be excessively complex, using a few scenarios with multiple crises may highlight some vulnerabilities and liabilities that are not apparent if each possible threat is considered independently. First dimension: public and private asset reconstruction costs Facing these liabilities when they materialize, governments need to bridge the funding gap to cover both the immediate response--providing emergency food, water, blankets, tents, medical care--and the recovery and reconstruction stage, which includes repairing roads, buildings and so on (toolbox G). These two funding needs have different constraints and priorities: for the emergency response, timeliness is critical, but amounts are relatively limited, and the cost of capital is less important. For reconstruction needs, amounts are often large, and the cost of capital becomes a critical consideration. Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the Fiji government's explicit contingent liability from public asset and infrastructure reconstruction, and its additional financing needs for social expenditure in response to tropical cyclones. Figure 15 shows the costs of providing social protection at various return periods and two levels: similar to the government's response to the 2016 Tropical Cyclone Winston and another, wider and stronger response. Governments can use analysis like this to calculate the finances needed to respond to future disasters and decide on the best source of financing for various needs.   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox G Assessing potential (direct) damages from natural hazards  There are a few databases with records of past disasters and their human and economic consequences. The most used is EM-DAT,22 curated by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at Belgium's Université catholique de Louvain. Other institutions have created similar datasets, including the UN-DRR's DesInventar,23 reinsurer MunichRe's NatCatSERVICE,24 and reinsurer SwissRe's Sigma.25 These datasets allow quick estimates of current country-level risk levels. But it is important to use historical and economic datasets with care. They tend to be incomplete, especially for low-income countries and moderate intensity disasters. They also use different definitions and thresholds--for example, for what is considered a disaster--and provide economic estimates based on different methodologies and covering different scopes. Some cover only direct costs, while others cover direct and indirect costs. Also, socioeconomic and climate trends make natural hazards non-stationary, and risk assessments based on historical data cannot provide  precise estimates of future risks (McCarl et al. 2008). Governments should create their own monitoring system and keep records of every disaster. These should cover the nature and location of each event as well as all available information on its consequences, with harmonized methodologies and scopes if possible. There are recommendations on how to set up such a system elsewhere (see, for example, OECD 2016). To assess future disaster risks and their economic implications, governments should use simulation modeling to estimate the direct risk to assets and economic activity (usually expressed as average annual losses). A range of approaches are available for this, from simple, cheap options to complicated and expensive ones, including: Relying on global estimates: For example, the United Nations Disaster Office for Disaster Risk Reduction's 2015 Global Assessment Report (UNISDR 2015) and its risk and disaster data platforms26 provide country-level assessment for earthquake, storms, and floods.    Making relatively simple assessments using existing data, combining: » Global hazards maps, such as those recorded in the ThinkHazard platform3 » Remote sensing-based estimates of exposure, such as the approach proposed in Gunasekera et al. (2015) » Vulnerability curves, which are available from various sources, including academic papers and engineering documents. The GFDRR country profiles provide examples of simple risk assessments, with  estimates of direct damages for different hazards and reporting periods in many countries.6 Figure G.1 illustrates the risk assessment for Saint Lucia. Developing a full country catastrophe model: This is a longer and more expensive exercise involving primary data collection--for example, on the exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure. Commercial modeling firms have developed such models in countries with developed insurance markets, but low-income countries do not usually use them.  With each of these approaches, it is possible to restrict the assessments to public assets, either by using a public asset inventory or a simple rule of thumb on the fraction of assets that are government-owned. This would allow governments to assess the risk to public assets, which will correspond to the reconstruction needs they will be directly exposed to. This work can build on Action 1.1, which recommends creating hazard maps and datasets, and Action 2.1, which recommends creating an inventory of public assets, including their value and exposure to natural hazards and climate change impacts.   Second dimension: impact on tax revenues As well as affecting spending needs, disasters cause tax revenues to fall, increasing the funding gap. For example, following a severe drought in 2017, Argentina lost an estimated $1.5 billion in tax revenue in 2018, mostly due to reduced exports (Secretaria de Ingresos Publicos, 2019). The impact on tax revenues depends on the indirect effects on GDP and economic activities, so it is much more challenging to assess than spending needs and contingent liabilities. Toolbox H discusses tools for estimating the GDP impact of natural disasters, ranging from simple rules of thumb to full modeling options. Governments can use these estimates as inputs when designing appropriate policy response strategies. They can then mobilize traditional instruments and approaches to link the potential impact on GDP to a drop in tax revenues. The impact of a disaster on GDP can differ enormously from its direct impacts-- that is, the cost of repairing or replacing damaged assets. Impact on GDP will depend on how damage to assets and interruptions to economic activity translate into reduced output and value added. It will also depend on the stimulus effect generated by reconstruction and government responses. Because GDP includes components that cannot be directly observed through a transaction--such as the value of services provided by owner-occupied dwellings or public roads-- measuring the GDP impact of disasters is difficult and subject to large uncertainties. One important finding in both empirical and theoretical literature is that the impacts of natural disasters on GDP are nonlinear--in other words, doubling the direct damages does more than doubling the GDP impact. They are also context-dependent, particularly in respect to the pre-existing macroeconomic situation. Figure 16 illustrates the GDP losses caused by hurricanes of increasing intensity in the US state of Louisiana, based on a modeling study. GDP losses due to hurricanes  are almost null until direct losses reach a certain threshold--in this case, around $50 billion--because the lost output due to damages is compensated by the increased demand from post-shock reconstruction. But GDP losses increase rapidly beyond this threshold.   Direct losses ($, billions)  This nonlinearity in the impact of disasters on GDP is largely explained by constraints on reconstruction: the loss of output at one point in time increases more or less linearly with capital losses, but reconstruction takes longer for bigger shocks (toolbox H). This increases the cumulative loss of production nonlinearly with the amount of capital losses, while the benefit from reconstruction increases only linearly with asset losses. Such nonlinearity is fully consistent with empirical studies showing that the impact of disasters on GDP is only detectable for the largest ones. Modeling the duration of reconstruction is therefore critical. In a simple model with no financial and technical constraints on reconstruction, damages can be repaired within weeks or months. The capital losses from Hurricane Katrina in the US state of Louisiana in 2005, for example, only represent a couple of weeks of investment in the US. But reconstruction takes much longer, for financial, regulatory, and technical reasons: » Financial: In many countries, local infrastructure reconstruction is paid for by central government but carried out by local authorities. Budgetary processes can take months to transfer the resources, slowing down reconstruction. Private actors--firms and households--may also be unable to mobilize enough resources to rebuild straight away, often deciding to repair their homes and factories in phases, spreading the cost over years.  P R I O R I T Y A R E A F O U R 1 » Regulatory: After a large shock, reconstruction requires long-term planning, particularly if the goal is to build back better. For example, governments or local authorities may decide not to rebuild in the most at-risk areas, but this would require a political process that can take several months. In the absence of pre-approved contracts and specific PFM arrangements (see Action 4.2), procurement can also delay reconstruction by months or more. » Technical: Reconstruction increases demand in specific sectors that have capacity constraints. For example, removing debris after a hurricane can take a long time because heavy equipment is scarce, and repairing houses can take years because skilled workers--such as roofers or carpenters-- are missing. Supply constraints are often visible through sectoral inflation in the construction sector's wages and prices. This is referred to as ""demand surge"" in the insurance industry (figure 17). These three types of constraint explain why reconstruction after major disasters can last 5 to 10 years, magnifying the impacts of a shock on total GDP and consumption. If disaster impact analyses do not consider these constraints, they will underestimate the effect on macroeconomic aggregates. Similarly, the impact of disasters on GDP is magnified if the shock occurs during a phase of rapid growth, when all production capacities are already used. Disasters that happen during a recession, however, tend to have a smaller impact on GDP, because it is easier to mobilize resources that were idle before the shock to fund the reconstruction process (Hallegatte and Ghil 2008). For example, Hurricane Andrew's impact on Florida in 1992 was damped by the low level of activity at the time of the shock: half the workers in the construction industry were out of the work and could be mobilized for the reconstruction effort, creating jobs and income with little crowding out effect (West and Lenze 1994).  TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox H Measuring the macroeconomic impact of disasters and implications for public finances  This toolbox explores some of the tools governments can use to estimate the possible impact of a disaster, based on the direct damages it causes. These include: empirical estimates, based on past disasters; a simple modeling approach linking direct damages to GDP impacts; and multi-sector models representing the full impact and linkages across sectors. Empirical estimates A first option is relying on past disasters and using econometric techniques. For example, a Central American study found that a one standard deviation increase in a hurricane's intensity leads to a 0.9­1.6 percent decrease in total per capita GDP growth and a 3 percent decrease in total income (Ishizawa and Miranda 2016). Governments can use such estimates to anticipate the possible impact of future disasters, including their nonlinearity. A global study found that disasters in the top decile of magnitude result on average in an almost  3 percent reduction in GDP per capita; but this goes down to 0.8 percent for those in the top 20 percent (figure H.1) (Felbermayr and Gröschl 2014). The long-term impacts of natural disasters on growth remain controversial. Some studies have suggested that natural disasters have a positive influence on longterm economic growth (Albala Bertrand 1993; Skidmore and Toya 2002), while a meta-analysis of more than 750 estimates found that the impact is short-term, and longterm per capita GDP returns to its original growth path (Klomp and Valckx 2014). However, other studies have found that the negative impacts of natural disasters can exceed 10 percent of GDP. For example, von Peter et al. (2012) found that a typical natural disaster causes a 0.6­ 1.0 percent drop in long-term economic growth and results in a permanent output loss of two to three times this magnitude, with higher estimates for larger natural disasters. Hsiang and Jina (2014) found that a 90th percentile event reduces per capita income by more than 7 percent after two decades, ""effectively undoing 3.7 years of average development"". Comparing the situation of Kauai island after Hurricane Iniki with the situation of unaffected Hawaiian islands, (Coffman and Noy 2012) found that, 18 years after the event, Kauai's population was 12 percent smaller than it would have been without the hurricane, and its aggregate per capita income and employment were proportionally lower. Cavallo et al. (2013) found that, while the largest disasters--those in the 99th percentile--have some long-term impacts on growth, this disappears entirely when controlling for political change. In other words, the long-term impact only happens when the disaster is followed by political instability. This suggests that the secondary impacts of natural disasters through political instability and conflicts could play a major role in determining their long-term effects. Limits in measuring the impact of natural disasters on GDP: One important note of caution on using empirical studies based on historical GDP time-series is that they are likely to underestimate the impact of disasters on economic output. Statistical agencies measure GDP based on many data sources, but they mostly rely on actual economic transactions--such as the sales of goods and services. To calculate real GDP, however, they have to also include economic outputs that cannot be measured  through transactions--such as the value of public education, public road use, and housing services provided by owner-occupied dwellings. Most developing countries use household surveys to estimate the economic value of the services provided by owner-occupied dwellings, even if there is no transaction associated with them. But these surveys are undertaken unregularly. When a hurricane damages a large share of the housing stock, the quantity of housing services drops, but there is no updated household survey to measure this impact. In parallel, the value of housing services may increase-- reflecting scarcity--but this effect is not always measured, or can blocked by regulation on rents or other factors. Caribbean Central Bank data estimate that services from owner-occupied dwellings in Dominica dropped by 21 percent in 2017. Even accounting for possible changes in prices, it is unclear whether this is a good measure for the impacts of hurricane Maria: of the 31,348 homes comprising the Dominican housing stock, approximately 4,700 (15 percent) were identified as destroyed, some 23,500 (75 percent) were estimated to have incurred partial damage, and 3,135 (10 percent) were considered unaffected by the event. Similarly, road transport outputs were estimated to have remained stable (rising from EC$78 to EC$79 million), in spite of EC$380 million in damage to roads and bridges (Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica 2017).  Modeling the impacts of a disaster on GDP Looking beyond past events, governments need to rely on modeling. It is not possible to estimate the impact of a natural disaster on GDP or economic growth by simply reducing the stock of capital in an unchanged growth, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE), or macrostructural model. These models have been developed to explore shocks that are different from natural disasters and will underestimate GDP losses, unless they are specifically adapted for this task. Channels of impact and rule-of-thumb estimates: Most models assume that capital is one homogeneous commodity that can be instantaneously reallocated toward its most productive use, hence the decreasing returns with the last unit of capital being the least productive.27 But in reality, the remaining stock of capital after a disaster is not optimally allocated. For example, the roads that remain usable are not the most important roads with the most traffic, the buildings that are still habitable are not the ones hosting the most important businesses, and so on. It is possible to reallocate a large share of capital over the medium term--for example, with the most productive firms moving to the habitable buildings. But it is almost impossible to reallocate most of the capital in the short term. The result is a drop in capital productivity, on top of the decrease in capital stock. Empirical studies confirm that disasters reduce both the stock of capital and total  factor productivity (TFP) (Bakkensen and Barrage 2018; Dieppe et al. forthcoming).  To capture these effects, Hallegatte and Vogt-Schilb (2019) propose a modeling approach in which output losses are estimated as the product of capital losses by the average (not the marginal) productivity of capital. This is the expected loss if disaster impacts are purely random and there is no reallocation of capital after the disaster (an assumption that is valid over the short term, at least). It is equivalent to a situation in which the disaster reduces the stock of productive capital by the cost of damages and leads to capital misallocation, which reduces TFP, with an impact on output that is twice as large as the impact from the capital stock decrease. In an intermediate case, with some reallocation of capital after the disaster--for example, where production equipment is moved to non-affected facilities--the impact on TFP would be lower.  This approach leads to the following rules of thumb for making a quick assessment of potential GDP impacts. With discounting at a rate ,  the average productivity of capital in the country, T the expected reconstruction time, and K the monetary value of asset losses, the net present value (NPV) of output losses can be estimated as:  K Y=  +1/T  And the NPV of consumption losses is equal to:  C=  K   +1/T  +1/T  The average productivity of capital  can be estimated as the ratio of GDP and the value of the capital stock (as measured, for example, in the Penn Table using a permanent inventory method). With standard model calibration, the average productivity of capital is approximately three times the marginal productivity of capital. Duration of recovery and reconstruction: The duration of reconstruction (the variable T) plays a key role in these estimates. Consider first a case where all losses are repaired instantaneously by reducing consumption and directing all unconsumed goods and services to reconstruction investments. This is a scenario where reconstruction capacity is infinite, and T is equal to zero. In this case, there is no output loss because all asset damages are instantaneously repaired. There are, however, consumption losses, since consumption has to be reduced to rebuild, and this reduction is equal to the reconstruction value--that is, the replacement cost of damaged capital. In that case, the NPV of consumption losses ( C ) is simply equal to the reconstruction cost. With unchanged prices, this is equal to the pre-disaster value of damaged assets K. Consider now another case with no reconstruction, in which output losses are permanent and all output losses are absorbed by reduced consumption, but no share of income is used for reconstruction. In that case, consumption losses are equal to output losses  (with no reconstruction), and T is equal to infinity. The loss in consumption at T0 is equal to K, and the NPV (discounted at the rate ) of consumption losses is (/)K. Consumption and well-being losses are thus larger (by a factor around 3) than the value of lost assets in a no-reconstruction case. Multisector modeling of GDP impacts There are also more sophisticated approaches that better capture the interplay between sectors or regions (for a recent review, see Okuyama and Rose 2019). Some models are based on the input-output (IO) linear assumption, in which producing one unit in one sector requires a fixed amount of inputs from other sectors, and prices do not play any role (see, for example, Brookshire et al. 1997; Haimes and Jiang 2001; Okuyama and Rose 2019). Even though the IO model is originally demand-driven (see, for example, Oosterhaven 1988; Cochrane 2004), it is commonly used to model disasters that are largely supply-side shocks. Extensions of IO models have been used to include supply constraints and production dynamics within IO-model disaster assessments (for example, Okuyama and Rose 2019; Hallegatte 2008; Hallegatte 2013). The IO approach is based on the idea that the production system is fixed in the short term, and local production capacity is constrained by existing capacities, equipment, and infrastructure. Other models are based on the CGE framework, which assumes that changes in relative prices balance supply and demand (Rose and Liao 2005; Rose et al. 2007). In this framework, there is no rationing in the economic system and markets remain at equilibrium. In CGE models based on the Cobb-Douglas or constant elasticity of substitution function, production technology is not fixed and there is short-term input substitution. In other words, when one input is scarce, production can continue, using less of this input and more of others. Economic losses caused by a disaster are smaller in a CGE than an IO setting. In reality, it is likely that IO models are pessimistic in their assessment of disaster output losses, because the economy is flexible even over the short term--for example, maintenance can be postponed, workers can do more hours to cope with the shock or production can be rescheduled (Rose et al. 2007). It is also likely that CGE models are optimistic, even in the long run, because prices have stickiness and cannot adjust perfectly,28 because  substitution has technical limits that are not always adequately represented in production functions, and because their aggregation at sector level makes it difficult to capture the impact of supply chain effects (Hallegatte 2013). These models remain limited and cannot capture all relevant mechanisms. In particular, they lack an explicit representation of network-shaped industries, such as electricity, water and transport. Hallegatte et al. (2019) provide estimates and methodologies to assess the consequences of disruptions in networked infrastructure, including electricity, water and sanitation, and transportation, and find that the indirect losses linked to infrastructure disruptions can be significant. The models described here also underestimate economic impacts due to their aggregation level, representing economic sectors--that is, thousands of businesses located in different places--as unique producers. Such a framework assumes that all businesses from one sector suffer the same direct impacts from disasters; in  other words, that impacts are homogeneously distributed among the businesses from each sector. Considering the multiplicity of producing units, their locations and explicit supply chains would allow for a much more realistic representation of natural disaster consequences. Modeling exercises suggest this approach would lead to higher estimates of disaster output losses, not least because they would take into account indirect impacts in locations that are not directly hit by the disaster (Henriet et al. 2012; Colon et al. 2019; Inoue and Todo 2019). Firm-level studies also suggest that the vulnerability of firms can vary significantly depending on their position in the supply chain (Barrot and Sauvagnat 2016; Colon et al. 2019; Kashiwagi et al. 2018). Overall, modeling supply chains and their role in propagating shocks can be complex and data intensive. However, even if simplifying assumptions need to be made, acknowledging and quantifying their roles can be crucial to understanding the true economic cost of climatic shocks.    ACTION 4.2 >> Develop a financial strategy to manage contingent liabilities, combining multiple instruments LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  When a disaster or another environmental shock hits, there are immediate financial needs related to emergency response and humanitarian support for affected populations (Priority Area 3) and longer-term recovery and reconstruction costs, which can have a strong impact on public finance. In parallel, tax revenues often drop during the crisis and recovery phase. As a result, governments and local authorities often struggle to finance postdisaster response and reconstruction, while liquidity constraints can also affect their short-term response. Noy and Nualsri (2011) found that developing countries conduct pro-cyclical fiscal policy as a result of natural disasters, thereby decreasing debt but increasing the negative economic impacts of disasters. The resource mobilization challenge in a postdisaster situation therefore requires specific financial solutions, which need to be arranged in advance to be readily available when a disaster hits (figure 18). These financial solutions must obey four core principles: » Timeliness of funding: Some funds are necessary right away, but not all resources are needed at once » Appropriate delivery mechanism: How funds are disbursed and how they reach beneficiaries is as important as where the money comes from  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators » Percentage of explicit and implicit contingent liabilities covered by reserve funds, contingent credit lines, insurance products or similar instrument » Disaster escape clause in budget processes approved » Process for managing inflow of international aid in place in case of major disasters, including using existing financial instruments to coordinate delivery » Post-Disaster Public Financial Management and Engagement Framework (PD-PFM Review) conducted and approved » PD-PFM principles and processes approved  » Disaster risk layering: No single financial instrument can address all risks  » Based on data and analytics: As described in toolboxes G and H, it is important to quantify risk to build a sound risk financing strategy.  Disaster risk financing and insurance bring together disaster risk management, fiscal risk and budget management, public finance, private sector development, and social  protection. While the private sector is an important partner to provide analytics and financing solutions, strong stewardship by the ministry of finance in coordination with other public agencies is crucial to successfully advance this agenda. The World Bank Group's operational framework for risk financing (figure 18) starts with thorough risk assessments like those described in toolboxes G and H to quantify a government's contingent liabilities. Based on these assessments, governments can build a financial strategy by following the risk layering approach. The urgency and chaos of a postdisaster situation also create specific challenges on the expenditure side, which need to be considered through a disaster-sensitive PFM system. Revenue and resource mobilization solutions Most countries have budget contingencies of 2­5 percent of government expenditure to contend with all shocks, not only natural hazards. However, this is often not enough for responding to natural hazards and many governments-- especially small island states--cannot afford the reserves they need to respond to major events (IMF and World Bank 2018). Vietnam, for example, has been hit several times by cyclones in November, when the year's contingency budget had already been fully exhausted (Mahul and Ghesquiere 2010). Various instruments are available to cover the contingent liabilities created by natural hazards and other environmental risks (Mahul and Ghesquiere 2010; Clarke and Poulter 2014; Clarke and Dercon 2016). They include: » Fiscal space, diversified and resilient tax collection, and reserve funds: Regardless of their origin, the most robust way to manage unexpected shocks is maintaining fiscal space in normal conditions, with manageable structural deficit and debt levels. It is also preferable for the tax collection system to be reasonably diversified and resilient. For example, a government funded primarily by export duty on a small set of agricultural commodities is exposed in case of drought. A strong macrofiscal situation makes it easier to manage surprises and access external financing in case of liquidity constraint. However, in countries with automatic fiscal adjustment systems--for example, where deficits cannot exceed a certain threshold--governments can add specific escape clauses in case of disaster, allowing them to respond quickly to emergency needs. It is also useful to have reserve funds in case of shocks, to enable an immediate response to an event. In the Philippines, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Fund finances a range of disaster-related expenditures but cannot disburse rapidly in response to Sustainable financial protection requires reducing underlying drivers of this risk. It complements risk reduction by managing residual risk which is not feasible or not cost-effective to mitigate. It also creates incentives to invest in risk reduction and prevention by putting a price on risk and clarifying risk ownership.  Risk assessments for financial protection quantify potential diaster impacts based on historical and simulated data. This often requires investments in the necessary underlying hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data. It also includes building an effective interface between the policy maker and underlying technical models. PRE-DISASTER  Assess risks  Reduce underlying risk  Arrange financial solutions  Deliver funds to beneficiaries  POSTDISASTER Resources should reach beneficiaries in a timely, transparent, and accountable fashion. This requires effective administrative and legal systems for the appropriation and execution of funds for the government budget, insurance distribution and settlement (often through private channels), as well as social protection programs.  Effective postdisaster response and recovery rely on access to sufficient and timely resources. This includes: · Arranging the required financial resources for the government to meet its contingent liabilities · Developing catastrophe risk and agricultural insurance markets, building on public-private partnerships · Developing rules and arranging financing instruments for scalable social protection  a crisis. So, the government created the Quick Response Fund to focus on emergency response. However, Typhoon Yolanda raised questions about the adequacy of the Quick Response Fund volume and the process for replenishing it if it is emptied by a major event or a series of smaller disasters. The country has since developed additional instruments to protect its public finances. Mexico created FONDEN as a budgetary tool to rapidly allocate federal funds for rehabilitating public infrastructure affected by disasters. Evidence shows that FONDEN has significant benefits, increasing local GDP postdisaster by 2­4 percent, with a benefit-cost ratio estimated conservatively between 1.52 and 2.89 (de Janvry et al. 2016). However, its reserve funds have limited capacities and are not designed to cope with rarer, more extreme events. » Contingent credit lines: In 2007, the World Bank introduced Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Options (Cat-DDOs), a new financing instrument that gives countries that are eligible to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) access to budget support in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Compared to private sector alternatives, this instrument is financially attractive for middle-income countries, even in the absence of subsidy, because it builds on the size of the IBRD balance sheet and available liquidity. The same instrument is now also available to low-income countries, with a subsidy component, through the World Bank Group's International Development Association. In both cases, the instrument allows low-cost contingency loans to be rapidly disbursed if a state of emergency is declared; so, it can help governments finance emergency interventions and the upscaling of social protection. Other institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, have since introduced similar instruments. Cat-DDOs have proven to be an effective instrument for implementing disaster risk management strategies and supporting postdisaster responses. » Insurance and catastrophe bonds: Mexico's FONDEN contingency fund leverages private sector financing as part of a strategy that combines risk retention and risk transfers. In 2006, FONDEN issued a $160 million catastrophe bond to transfer Mexico's earthquake risk to the international capital markets. This was the first parametric catastrophe bond issued by a national government. Even though they are costly, these financial schemes can disburse funds rapidly; more rapidly than would be possible with public budgets. And by predefining payout rules for allocating postdisaster support, formal insurance and financial products can reduce political economy biases (Clarke et al. 2016b).   » Regional risk-sharing facilities: The Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility pools disaster risk across 16 countries. The world's first regional catastrophe insurance facility, it uses parametric insurance to give participating governments quick, short-term liquidity to finance responses and early recovery in the case of major earthquakes or hurricanes. The Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI), African Risk Capacity, and South Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (SEADRIF) are more recent examples of donor-supported regional mechanisms that offer quick-disbursing, index-based coverage against tropical cyclones and earthquakes. In response to Cyclone Pam in March 2015, PCRAFI rapidly gave Vanuatu $1.9 million to support immediate postdisaster needs. Although this payout was small compared with total losses and reconstruction needs--estimated at $184 million--it was eight times bigger than the government's annual emergency relief fund and seven times bigger than the annual insurance premium, which is largely subsidized by international donors. » State contingent debt instruments: Some countries include disaster clauses in their sovereign bond contracts, to enable changes in debt service payments in the event of an exogenous natural disaster. In Grenada, for example, the hurricane clause is designed to provide cash flow relief at a critical moment after a natural disaster event, enabling the government to redirect funds intended for debt service to more immediate needs. The clause provides for deferred payments for up to two payment periods, and there is no nominal principal or interest rate reduction. The deferred interest payment is capitalized, and the deferred principal payment is distributed equally on top of the scheduled payments until final maturity. Key features of a hurricane clause include a verifiable trigger event measured by an independent entity and a maximum number of triggers. Grenada uses parametric measures for events and the maximum number of triggers is three (Asonuma et al. 2017). » International aid: When a country exceeds its capacity to cope with a disaster, international aid and humanitarian emergency measures can be critical. On average, emergency foreign aid covers only a small percentage of total economic losses stemming from a disaster (Becerra et al. 2013). As well as being slow, it also remains highly unpredictable, making it difficult to include in contingency and reconstruction plans. Nevertheless, it is useful for countries to prepare clear systems for screening and processing international aid offers before disasters occur, so they can quickly channel any offered resources to those in need (for an example of this in the Philippines, see Hallegatte et al. 2016b, chapter 5).  However, none of these instruments can meet all the needs on their own, so a combination of tools is preferable (figure 19). Their value can be assessed in various dimensions (GFDRR and World Bank 2014), including: » Financial costs and benefits: Different instruments have different costs for providing the same post-disaster $1. These often depend on the amounts at stake--for example, transaction costs can make small portfolios expensive--but extremely large contracts are also expensive because the risk taker needs large (and liquid) financial reserves. » Volume: Some instruments, such as reserve funds, are efficient when the amounts covered remain relatively small, but there are limits to the size of these funds and opportunity costs can grow quickly, especially in countries with limited resources and large investment needs. » Timeliness: The speed with which an instrument can deliver postdisaster finance depends on the process and the size of the product. Government reserve funds are the quickest, since the money is readily available, and the use of soft triggers means that contingency funds can be disbursed in a matter of days. Indemnity-based insurance (when the pay-off depends on losses) is the slowest, as it requires lengthy damage assessments. » Discipline: Some instruments, like insurance, require strict contracts that provide discipline in terms of when and how resources are available and can be used. Others, like reserve funds, are more difficult to protect from opportunistic behaviors. The trade-offs in these different dimensions mean that a package of tools is more efficient than a single instrument. Expensive instruments, such as reinsurance, can be a useful component of this package, allowing governments to meet immediate needs after a major event, or providing discipline in the use of the large financial resources needed after a big shock. Some tools are better for covering the (relatively small) short-term liquidity needs for managing a crisis; others are better for larger, longer-term reconstruction needs. Some are better for frequent, low-intensity events, while others are better for managing massive shocks. Figure 19 provides a schematic view of the adequacy of these instruments for hazards of different magnitudes and probability and for different time horizons. Clarke et al. (2016a) provide a framework and methodology for designing a multi-instrument strategy. The optimal choice will vary by country. Figure 20 illustrates how different financial instruments can be combined for financing the shock-responsive scalability component of Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Programme (Clarke et al. 2016a). More specifically, it shows the average cost of different combinations of instruments as well as the cost for 1-in-5 and 1-in-30-year events.  Expenditure-side challenges and solutions The value of mobilizing financial resources depends on the ability to spend them quickly and efficiently. Adaptive social protection is useful here because it ensures that all the systems and decision-making rules and procedures are in place before a disaster hits. For other emergency spending and reconstruction finance, timeliness requires an adapted PFM system and good contingency plans--for example, with pre-approved contracts to accelerate the procurement of urgent tasks such as debris removal.  Public spending in postdisaster situations faces specific challenges, due to the urgency of needs and the direct effects of disasters on normal government functioning. April and Sutherland (2019) provide an overview of the core principles of the PD-PFM Review.   One of the values of contingency plans and instruments--including those on the spending side, such as adaptive social protection--is that they allow for careful design before a crisis. This ensures that all due processes can be followed and rapid execution during an emergency (Hallegatte and Rentschler 2018). In the absence of advance preparation, governments--and ministries of finance in particular--face difficult trade-offs between respecting due process and providing swift support provided to the population. This often results in a delay in support provision (see case studies in Hallegatte et al. 2015), which can be very costly for the affected population (Clarke and Dercon 2016).    ACTION 4.3 >> Anticipate and plan for long-term macroeconomic impacts LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  Action 4.2 focused on the most efficient and cost-effective response to a single disaster as an independent event. But climate change will increase the frequency of such events, affecting the cost and benefits of these financial tools and their impact on public finance and debt. Climate change will also provoke other longterm changes in tax revenues and spending needs, with additional implications for economic growth and public finances. It is important for governments to understand these risks and construct an appropriate response strategy. However, it is also essential to keep in mind that current tools and knowledge do not allow for precise and reliable estimates of future macroeconomic impacts. Different approaches lead to radically different results and all methodologies ignore many possible climate change impacts. Macrofiscal risk assessment can be a standalone analysis (such as with the World Bank­IMF Climate Change Policy Assessments) or embedded into other long-term, macro-level assessments. At least two such assessments--both joint World Bank-IMF initiatives--have already started to include climate considerations, such as disaster and climate risks:  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators » Sector-level adaptation plans collected, harmonized, and costed, and an estimate of public adaptation spending needs produced » Long-term plan to diversify tax revenues away from vulnerable sectors approved » Climate and disaster impacts included in debt sustainability assessment or financial sector assessment program » Share of tax revenues originating from high-vulnerability sectors  » Debt Sustainability Analysis,29 which can include macrofiscal risks of climate change impacts, and mitigation and adaptation plans  » Financial Sector Assessment Program,30 which can include climate and disaster risks in the financial sector assessment, especially in stress testing exercises.  Whichever approach governments choose to use, looking at these long-term effects will mean exploring long-term growth impacts and their consequences on public finances. Explore the possible impact on long-term GDP growth Building on sector-level assessment and analyses of physical risks, modeling   exercises can aggregate the possible impacts of climate change to estimate total impacts on macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, debt level, or trade balance, allowing governments to consider and plan for these longer-term effects (toolbox I). The use of macroeconomic models, which are necessarily simpler in their representation of sectoral impacts, should be reserved for informing macroeconomic decisions, such as long-term debt sustainability. Considering the complexity of the issue and the many channels through which climate change can affect macroeconomic variables, results will always be highly uncertain. Many factors that can affect macroeconomic variables are difficult to model, and there is often little consensus on how best to do it (Bolton et al. 2020; Stern 2013; Pindyck 2013). Results should therefore be treated with a lot of caution and never be used as forecasts. When it is possible to work at sector level and with simpler models--for example, to design a government-wide financial protection strategy--it is preferable to use the simpler models, even if they do not include all possible feedbacks. For macroeconomic issues that require aggregation at macroeconomic level, it is recommended to use multiple scenarios, to cover uncertainty in climate change impacts as much as possible. It is also important to consider that GDP impacts do not fully capture the severity of climate change impacts and cannot be used directly in a cost-benefit analysis of climate policies (IPCC 2014; Dennig et al. 2015; Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017; Hallegatte at al. 2016a). There are several issues around using usual economic aggregates--and GDP in particular--as the unique metric for climate change damages: » GDP does not measure consumption or societal well-being. Disasters-- hurricanes in particular--can increase GDP growth and reduce wellbeing, if increased risk leads to more precautionary savings (Bakkensen and Barrage 2018). Increasing investment in and consumption of defensive expenditure--for example, by building dikes and using air conditioning--may increase GDP without increasing societal well-being. » Long-term averages are not a good measure of the impact of repeated shocks. In the US, a small decrease in productivity across all regions and sectors or one Katrina-like disaster per year can lead to the same 1 percent loss of GDP. But the latter has a bigger impact on well-being, as losses are concentrated on a small population. » National or regional aggregates can miss impact on the poorest. A major impact on poor people is compatible with small impacts on GDP (Hallegatte et al. 2015, 2016b; Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017) because in   most countries, poor people represent a tiny share of income and wealth. If climate change impacts are concentrated on the poor, then GDP may not be an appropriate measure, and other metrics may be preferable (see also toolbox K). Evaluate impacts on tax revenues, spending needs, and public debt sustainability Tax revenues: By impacting economic growth in some sectors, climate change will impact tax revenues. These risks are particularly large if the tax base is very narrow--if, for example, it is concentrated on a few commodity exports. Governments can simplistically estimate the impact of changes in GDP, trade, and employment on tax revenues by assuming a linear relationship between value added and tax revenues. Or they can use a more realistic representation of the tax system, applying different rates onto different income sources and sectors. For local communities, tax revenues are partly linked to land values, either because a tax is raised when there is a transaction or because property taxes are indexed on home values. Estimating the impact of climate change on these taxes would require a detailed spatial analysis of expected local-level climate change impacts. Based on expected impact on tax revenues, a government may want to explore options to diversify the tax base. For example, introducing value-added, income or capital gain taxes can make tax collection less sensitive to the impacts of disaster and climate change on one major sector. Since adjusting the tax system takes time and is always sensitive, it is preferable for governments to explore and act on these issues before their revenues start to decline due to climate change impacts. Additional expenditure and adaptation needs: Climate and disaster impacts affect public expenditure in two ways. When sudden shocks--for example, a major natural disaster--destroy capital and production, governments need to spend significant amounts on supporting the population and funding reconstruction. They also need to make additional public investments to adapt infrastructure and other public assets and help private actors adapt. It is difficult to estimate the amount needed to adapt to climate change (often referred to ""adaptation needs""). This is partly down to definitional issues, as there is no easy way to separate development needs--such as providing universal access to improved water and sanitation--from adaptation needs. Some studies have focused on the incremental costs that result from climate change, accounting for the fact that natural disasters and climate change make some investments more expensive. Hallegatte et al. (2019) estimate that low- and middle-income countries will need to invest $11­65 billion a year to increase the resilience of their infrastructure systems (water and sanitation, power, transport).   At least two-thirds of these costs are for infrastructure assets that are typically funded by the public sector. This represents only 3 percent of total infrastructure investment needs in these countries. Other estimates lump development and adaptation needs together. Fiji, for example, will need up to F$9.3 billion (almost 100 percent of GDP) in investments over the next 10 years to strengthen its resilience to climate change and natural hazards for decades to come (table 4), but many of these investments would have been required even in the absence of climate change.    Many countries have included adaptation actions in their nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement (Hallegatte et al. 2018). Fifty countries (totaling 2.4 billion people) have provided an estimate of the cost of the adaptation component of their NDC, with a time horizon going from today to 2050, depending on the country. However, NDC adaptation components are generally poor and, as such, do not form a rigorous basis for estimating national adaptation needs and priorities. Total adaptation costs in the 50 available NDCs add up to $39 billion a year, with annual per capita costs ranging from $0.29 (Burundi) to $594 (Namibia). This huge difference across countries arises from the NDC design process rather than any difference in vulnerability or adaptation needs. The average per capita cost is $16 a year. Assuming that these estimates are consistent with actual needs--a strong assumption, considering how simple and partial most NDCs are, especially in their adaptation component--the global adaptation need would be approximately $115 billion a year.    And while solid estimates have been produced for some sectors (such as coastal protection), there is great uncertainty in others (such as agriculture) (Chambwera et al. 2014). Global estimates are based on methodologies that can provide orders of magnitude but are too simple to provide a solid basis for a country-driven policy response. Long-term considerations and impact on debt: Reduced revenues and increased expenditure are likely to lead to higher debt levels. There is empirical evidence that debt increases after natural disasters (Lis and Nickel 2010; Melecky and Raddatz 2011). Gerling (2017) also found that the impact of disasters on deficit and debt is driven more by governments' response in terms of spending and tax rates, than by the impact of the disaster. High debt leads to higher interest rates and lower credit scores. This results in higher budget deficits and causes debt to increase further, creating a vicious cycle that threatens debt sustainability (Borensztein et al. 2009; Koetsier 2017). High debt also discourages private investment and constrains fiscal flexibility. More specifically, looking at debt default, Klomp and De Haan (2015) showed that investors see natural disasters as an adverse shock that makes government debt less sustainable and may eventually trigger a sovereign default. And Klomp (2017) shows that the probability of a sovereign debt default increases by about three percentage points after major earthquakes and storms. Trade balance: When countries depend on climate-sensitive sectors for exports, climate shocks can have negative impacts on their trade balance. In Argentina, the 2017 drought damaged exports, as production in the oilseeds sector--which represents around one-third of Argentina's total exports--fell by 13 percent the following year. The total value of primary exports decreased by 5.4 percent, as the 11.2 percent fall in quantities was partially compensated by an increase in prices (Argentina has such a large market share in the soybean market that it can influence global prices). Sudden shocks in the trade balance can force countries to increase their capital imports, which can damage interest rates and credit scores. Planners can use different tools to anticipate the implications of the macroeconomic impacts of climate change on deficits and debt levels. This includes simple growth models--as used by the IMF to investigate long-term impacts on GDP and public debt in various climate change scenarios (figure 22)--or the World Bank's Macro-Fiscal Model. This macrostructural model is widely used by central banks and ministries of finance to explore long-term scenarios including climate change impacts and help include climate considerations into long-term debt sustainability assessments. Based on these findings and acknowledging the uncertainty around GDP and debt projections, governments can start identifying long-term strategies to minimize risks. Such strategies can range from making changes in tax revenues or government spending to ensure long-term sustainability or developing or supporting sectoral targeted action plans to reduce the sources of these risks.  TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox I Identifying the impacts of climate change on GDP  Although many assessments look at sectoral impacts of and adaptation options for climate change, few are economywide. This is directly due to the challenges of modeling all sectors and then aggregating results into an economy-wide model without losing the complexity of the sector-level results. The literature proposes two main approaches. Integrated assessment models Following up on initial work (Nordhaus 1994; Tol 2002), a few integrated assessment models estimate the impact of climate change on economic growth, GDP, and other economic variables. For example, Dellink et al. 2019, use models based on simple damage functions, calibrated on sectoral studies to provide estimates in large regions to 2060 (figure I.1). While these models provide useful benchmarks and can  identify the channels through which climate change can affect GDP growth--for example, by comparing impacts through agriculture and impacts through labor productivity--they also have limitations (as also shown in toolbox B with a focus on poverty). First, integrated assessment models do not represent all important mechanisms. They are missing many important channels through which climate change can affect growth. For example, climate change may affect access to micronutrients, which would have implications on children's physical and cognitive development and future labor productivity. There is also evidence that disasters have most impact on economic growth when they create political instability or conflicts (Cavallo et al. 2013). However, neither of these are included in any current model.   Second, and most importantly, their results depend on strong assumptions about sector and country adaptation capacity. Indeed, a physical change-- say, a rise in sea level--may or may not lead to more floods, depending on whether a city regularly upgrades its flood defenses. While it is possible to model physical impacts based on physical laws, the ability of institutions, agencies, firms, and households to respond to changes in environmental conditions is more difficult to predict over the long term. So economic outcomes often depend more on hypotheses of adaptation capacity and performance than on physical climate change impacts.31 Finally, several papers have flagged that the response in terms of savings and investments can be as important as direct climate change impacts in determining  effects on growth (Fankhauser and Tol 2005; Bakkensen and Barrage 2018). The cumulative effect of individual disasters can also lead to tipping points in the economic system, especially when disasters wreak more damage than the economy can efficiently cope with (Hallegatte et al. 2007b). As a result, the way the models endogenize economic growth (for example, with exogenous or endogenous technical change) and represent behaviors (for example, with optimal investment responses and perfect foresight or myopic behaviors) is critical in determining final results. The macroeconomic modeling debates are therefore also relevant for assessing the macroeconomic cost of climate change. Empirical studies Other approaches are based on empirical studies (see, for example, IMF 2017; Burke et  al. 2015; Hsiang et al. 2017; Kahn et al. 2019). These analyses use past changes in temperature and precipitation such as year-to-year changes in average temperature or more granular indices and their measured impacts on GDP or GDP growth to anticipate future impacts of climate change. Figure I.2 shows the effect a 1oC increase in temperature has on GDP, using such an approach. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are different from those of modeling approaches. One advantage is that, being based on historical data, it includes all channels of interaction between temperature and precipitation changes and GDP. But it has other limitations (Kolstad and Moore 2020). Because it uses year-to-year changes to extrapolate decadal changes, it can overestimate or underestimate impacts.   Overestimating happens because adaptation options like upgrading infrastructure systems are available in the long term, but not the short term. The difference between short- and long-term impacts and the role of adaptation to evolving climate conditions has been a topic of intense debate (Kolstad and Moore 2020). Deryugina and Hsiang (2017) have shown conditions under which the economic impact of a marginal change in short-term weather is equal (at the first order) to the impact of a marginal change in long-term climate (in which case, adaptation is a second-order mechanism). However, these conditions are very restrictive: adaptation options need to be defined over a continuum (no discrete options ) and local economies need to be optimally adapted to their current climate, at each point in time used for calibration. These assumptions appear unrealistic in the context of rapidly evolving climate, so there may be a significant gap between short- and long-term impacts. In efforts to explore the impacts of longer-term changes in climate conditions, other authors have applied econometric techniques to past changes in climate over decades (15 years in the case of Dell et al. 2012), finding impacts that are relatively similar to short-term impacts.  Underestimating happens because some activities, ecosystems or economic sectors may be able to cope with one bad year but will not be able to adjust to permanent change. Most studies also only consider temperature and precipitation, so this approach does not capture correlated or more complicated changes such as shifts in extreme event frequency and intensity. Nor do they include other types of impact, such as long-term sea level rise. Finally, simultaneous changes in multiple climate variables may lead to impacts that are different from the sum of independent changes. By definition, this approach cannot include any impacts that did not already occur in the past, which means that it does not consider some of the most worrisome climate change impacts. Work in climate sciences to identify climate analogues--or find a climate today that is similar to the climate expected tomorrow in Location X--has concluded that many of the future climates simply do not exist today. For example, even if one can find a place that has in 2020 the temperature one will find in Barcelona in 2100, it will not have the same precipitation patterns (Hallegatte et al. 2007a). Also, empirical studies cannot include the effect of unprecedented temperature levels, a possible collapse  in local biodiversity and ecosystems, or reaching physiological limits when temperatures exceed certain thresholds. Figure I.2 suggests that there will be significant benefits in high latitudes, but it is unclear whether the analysis captures the negative impacts--such as wildfires and new forest pests in Canada and Russia, the need to retrofit infrastructure built on melting permafrost and extreme heat waves in cities-- that are also expected there. Finally, the approach remains sensitive to the specification, which explains why different analyses have led to different results. Whether studies assume that climate change will affect GDP levels (temporary shocks) or GDP growth (permanent shocks that will accumulate over time) is particularly important. Burke et al. (2015), for example, assume that the effect of climate change on GDP is permanent and cumulative, affecting growth rates and not GDP levels, which largely explains the large magnitude of the impact they project for the end of the century. Overall, using empirical analyses to assess climate change impacts beyond the next few decades, when changes are no longer expected to be marginal, should be done with great care.   ACTION 4.4 >> Communicate and mitigate disaster and climate risk exposure of the financial sector and pension systems LEAD MINISTRY: Finance  One role of the financial system is to help the economy manage risks. But a history of financial crises has shown that it can also magnify the impact of a shock, if this shock exceeds the financial sector's capacity (World Bank 2013). Countries must therefore assess their financial system's ability to absorb climate shocks, to ensure it can play the role of adaptation facilitator and not create a crisis. Climate change and natural disasters can impact the financial sector balance sheets through four overlapping channels (Feyen et al. 2020). » Operational risk: This includes damages to financial infrastructure, branches, and office buildings. » Market and liquidity risk: Re-assessing financial projections and risk premiums will impact asset valuations. This could trigger pro-cyclical materialization of losses and tighter funding and liquidity conditions, particularly when it is due to a disaster. Droughts and other natural disasters can also drive up commodity and energy prices.  TAKING ACTION >> Sample targets and indicators » Regulations of banks, insurers, and large investors include specific disaster and climate risk requirements » All banks, insurers, and large investors conduct stress tests for climate and disaster risks, including at least two climate scenarios » All banks, insurers, and large investors provide a quantified estimate of their exposure to natural hazards  » Credit risk: Damage to infrastructure, higher prices, lower productivity and so on can adversely affect borrower repayment capacity. Lower collateral prices amplify credit risk, particularly when uninsured. In natural disaster-prone economies, sovereign credit risks could adversely interact with financial sector risks.  » Underwriting risk: Physical risks can impede the pricing accuracy of (re) insurance liabilities. This can cause losses to insurers, raise premiums, or even render some activities or geographies uninsurable, raising fiscal costs as governments are forced to backstop losses. Lower availability of insurance can have important repercussions on investments and loans.    Countries can manage these impacts by investing in data, knowledge and modeling capacity, planning and budgeting for disasters, and improving coordination between sectors. They may also need to issue specific regulations to incentivize their financial systems to assess climate-related risks. Banks: Climate change impacts can increase operational, credit, market, and liquidity risks for banks. Weather-related shocks could trigger losses due to higher defaults and lower collateral valuations, particularly if people are uninsured. Weather-related shocks can also damage payment systems and bank branches. Institutional investors: Pension funds, life insurance companies and other institutional investors could be disproportionately affected by climate change, given their longer-term investment horizons. Climate change can trigger nonlinear impacts such as food security crises, social and political unrest, biodiversity loss and the sudden reevaluation of assets located in risky areas, so investors must design investment strategies that can manage these (uncertain) long-term risks. Insurers: Climate change has implications for insurance companies on both sides of the balance sheet: as investors and as underwriters. As investors, they face similar risks as other asset managers. Like institutional investors, insurers may be disproportionally affected by the long-term nature of their equity and infrastructure investments. As underwriters, pricing risks may arise from the changing risk profiles of insured assets (Feyen et al. 2020). Climate change introduces deep uncertainty in catastrophe models, so it is harder to make valid predictions about expected losses and therefore price some insurance products. Some risks may become impossible to insure. At the same time, some insurers might find opportunities for innovative insurance offerings. Insurance companies may also be affected by increased liability risks due to climate change, as part of negligence policies or through litigation--for example, related to inadequate disclosure of climate risks (IAIS/SIF 2018). Real estate and housing values: Risks related to real estate and housing are included in credit risks and mostly borne by the banking system. But it is worth assessing them separately due to their importance (especially in banks' balance sheets) and exposure to climate change risks. Because natural risks are at least partly included in housing values (Beltrán et al. 2018; Hallstrom and Smith 2005; Erman et al. 2018), a rapid reevaluation of risks from natural hazards--which has happened after big disasters (see, for example, Hallstrom and Smith 2005)--could lead to brutal changes in housing values, significantly impacting banks' portfolios and risk profiles.   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox J Stress testing financial institutions for disaster and climate risks  Stress testing is common in the financial sector. In practice, it is possible to estimate the effect of some negative but plausible socioeconomic scenarios--for example, a 3 percent drop in GDP--on individual financial firms' portfolios or across the sector, providing insights on vulnerability in the firm or sector. Some regulations mandate that financial firms demonstrate their ability to weather an economic crisis or shock through such a stress test. Stress testing is now also used to investigate climate change-related risks, though this is mostly for so-called ""transition risks"", which are those associated with policies enacted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For example, Battiston et al. (2017) link global macroeconomic scenarios to major commercial banks' portfolios to estimate their exposure to rapid decarbonization. Stress testing the financial system to the physical risks of climate change, however, is more challenging, because the impacts of climate  change are more spatially heterogenous than the impacts of climate policies. Estimating a company's vulnerability would require considering the localization of every production unit. But this information is not enough, as a well-designed asset in a high-risk area can be very resilient. And information on how assets are designed--for example, whether a factory can cope with heavy rain--is simply not available, even to companies themselves. A firm's or a sector's vulnerability also depends on its suppliers, clients, and the transport and communication networks that their relationships depend on (Colon et al. 2019). And while firms usually know their direct suppliers, only the biggest ones have the resources and capacity to understand their full supply chain and its vulnerability. Finally, uncertainty around future impacts is so large that any single scenario is unlikely to capture a firm's or a sector's full vulnerability to climate change. In this context, government and financial system regulators have two (complementary) options:    » Top-down stress tests: First-order assessments based on sector-level vulnerability to climate change--for example, vulnerability of Uganda's coffee production-- assuming that all firms within a sector have a similar vulnerability. This approach provides insight on an economy's vulnerability based on its sectoral structure, disregarding heterogeneity across firms and individual firms' ability to adjust to a shock by diversifying to other activities or developing new technologies. » Bottom-up stress tests: Firms and financial actors conduct their own risk assessments, based on their in-depth knowledge of their production systems and supply chains and publicly available data on climate change and natural hazards, building knowledge from the bottom up that can be aggregated over time. A firm's or a sector's vulnerability to climate change will depend on its ability to respond to anticipated and  non-anticipated impacts of climate change. Top-down and bottom-up stress tests should therefore go beyond the direct physical impacts, to assess various firms' and financial actors' ability to absorb shocks and adapt to change. For example, a firm that is heavily exposed to major hazards but has well-developed contingency plans and is well insured may be less at risk  than a firm that is less exposed but not prepared. A European Bank of Reconstruction and Development and Global Center for Adaptation report recommends that all firms and private actors assess how climate risks may affect their value chains and operations, and put in place appropriate risk management systems (EBRD and GCECA 2018, see figure J.1).   First-order impacts · acute or chronic climate hazards that directly affect corporate operations, supply chains, or markets · includes extreme precipitation, heat stress, water stress, cyclones, rising sea levels, cold snaps, and winter storms · can be measured in physical terms and estimated financial terms Source: EBRD and GCECA 2018.  Second-order impacts · climate hazards that affect the broader economic, human, or natural environment · transmission pathways from climate hazards to firms may include ecosystem collapse, migration, social licence to operate, impacts on human health, and so on · impacts on the corporate value chain are difficult to predict and quantify   Information on firms' exposure to disaster and climate risks--including through stress tests (toolbox J)--can help investors and decision makers adjust investments and portfolios to reduce exposure and future losses. Transparency on disaster and climate risks, as advocated by the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure,1 would also send a strong signal to firms' management that this is a topic of concern for investors and create an incentive for all firms to manage their long-term risks better. In this domain, governments can lead the action through a law, or regulators who consider that climate change risks are part of their mandate due to their impact on financial stability can lead the action directly. One example of action through law is Article 173-VI of the French Energy Transition for Green Growth Act. Its objective is to influence decision making and directly promote adaptation and resilience while enabling public authorities, NGOs, think-tanks, and civil society more generally to have the information they need to influence investors. However, implementing the law has shown that reporting on exposure to climate and disaster risks is more challenging than reporting on carbon emissions, exposure to carbon pricing, and climate mitigation policies. But regulators can act even in the absence of such an explicit mandate, on the basis of the impact of physical climate change risks on the financial system (for example, NGFS 2020). They could, for example, consider imposing appropriate requirements to ensure firms' risk management approaches adequately capture the different risk profiles of their investments with regard to natural hazards and other adaptation-relevant climate risks. Authorities can set out regulatory guidance or supervisory expectations to enhance firms' responses to these risks, addressing all aspects of firms' governance, risk management and disclosure practices. They should actively monitor the implementation of these expectations by integrating climate risk into existing regulatory frameworks. The Network for Greening the Financial System provides useful recommendations in its guide to regulators (NGFS 2020), focusing on identifying and quantifying exposures and risks, and managing these risks. Requiring regulated entities to conduct climate-related stress testing or scenario analysis will enable firms to test their portfolios' resilience to physical climate risk and adaptation-related shocks. Taking a forward-looking approach will provide insights into their assets' longer-term risk profile, exposing potential future vulnerabilities in their business models. Using this to inform their strategic planning and decision making would increase the overall resilience of the financial system. Over time, regulators may consider imposing additional capital requirements, should supervisory assessments conclude that firms fail to adequately address   climate risk. Shortcomings in risk management practices or a failure to reduce high-risk exposures may lead to a capital add-on under Basel regulations. Integrating climate risk into the direct risk-weighting of assets will require substantial further research to close significant data gaps, in addition to an agreed-upon climate risk-related classification system. It is important to note that current methodologies for financial climate risk assessment and stress tests are crude, and their limits could have unintended effects. Many assessments are based solely on geographic localization--for example, whether a factory is in a flood zone. They do not consider whether the asset was designed and built to manage local hazards, because these data do not exist. This simplification means that a well-designed asset in a flood zone could be wrongly considered at high risk, despite all the project developer's efforts. This type of error could discourage the proper design of assets in at-risk areas and any form of investment in high-risk regions, including the poorest countries and communities. It could thus complicate efforts to reduce poverty and accelerate development, which should be the priority for reducing climate change vulnerability and impacts (see Foundations).   Application: Prioritization, implementation, and monitoring progress  LEAD MINISTRIES: Finance/ economy and ministry or agency in charge of climate change (often environment)  The earlier sections of this guide have argued that an effective climate change adaptation strategy needs to comprise measures to ensure a broad, productive, and inclusive development pathway (Foundations), and actions in four priority areas, covering the adaptation of people and firms (Priority Area 1); land use plans, public assets and services (Priority Area 2); residual risk management (Priority Area 3); and macrofiscal risk management (Priority Area 4).  To effectively implement these actions, governments must first establish the right institutional and legal framework for robust implementation (Action A.1) and then design a concrete multisectoral adaptation and resilience strategy that clearly identifies and prioritizes actions in line with available resources (Action A.2). A concrete set of intermediate targets and milestones is essential to implement the strategy in each sector (Action A.3). Governments should actively mainstream and integrate resilience in all public policies, rather than limit their consideration of resilience to climate-related actions (Action A.4). With priority actions defined, they need to raise, allocate and track adequate financial resources to implement the strategy (Action A.5). Finally, once implementation is underway and new information and challenges emerge, they will need to make regular strategy adjustments and course corrections to strengthen the approach (Action A.6). Overall, the key to successful implementation is ensuring that all government departments adopt and mainstream the strategy in all their decisions, and that governments continuously monitor and evaluate the impact of their decisions and actions, so they can address any challenges and adjust their actions accordingly. Figure 23 illustrates how these actions link together. FIGURE 23 >> Six actions to effectively implement an adaptation and resilience strategy   ACTION A.1 >> Create a strong institutional and legal framework, with appropriate stakeholder involvement The policy actions discussed across this report require an appropriate institutional and legal framework. Such changes are usually introduced through climate change framework laws (see World Bank 2020b). These framework laws have multiple roles, from establishing short-and long-term climate change targets to creating the institutional and legal framework needed to ensure that climate change is properly addressed. There are many required changes, which are discussed in multiple places in this report. For example, most climate change framework laws have a ""knowledge"" or ""data"" component, to ensure that climate change-related information is available to public and private decision makers (Action 1.1). There are three important components for creating a strong institutional and legal framework: 1. Adjusting the mandate of existing ministries, agencies or institutions: Considering resilience and climate and disaster vulnerability must be made part of existing mandates, to ensure these issues become part of good governance. This is particularly important for infrastructure services (Action 2.2)--for example, regulating public and private power providers can help increase power systems' resilience to storms and drought (see Hallegatte et al. 2019)--and when developing rules for budget preparation and discussions (Action 4.1) and financial or banking regulations (Action 4.4) (NGFS 2020). Considering climate and disaster risks in land use planning (Action 2.3) should also be included in the mandate of municipalities or authorities in charge of developing land use plans and delivering building permits. 2. Creating new agencies or committees where needed: Although it is generally preferable to build on existing institutional design to prevent conflicts and contain costs, governments will sometimes have to create new agencies or institutions to implement an action. But while infrastructure resilience may be coordinated by a small committee placed under the prime minister or minister of economy, the design and implementation of the measures is better left to existing regulators of infrastructure services. Leaving, for example, regulations on the resilience of the power system to the regulator of said power system will prevent cross-agency conflicts and improve consistency in regulations and investments. But where there is an institutional vacuum--for example, an absence of watershed agencies to manage water allocation at the right spatial scale--the challenges around climate change and natural risks provide additional rationale for strengthening institutions, including by creating new agencies.   3. Establishing an overarching coordinating body: Designing and implementing an adaptation and resilience strategy often requires a coordination mechanism to ensure consistency in actions across sectors and ministries (horizontal coordination) and across national, regional and local tiers of government (vertical coordination) (World Bank 2020b). Ensuring coordinated action across entities can help capture synergies and take care of important roles like M&E and progress tracking. To be effective, the mechanism must include representation at a senior (typically agency head) level, to give it the necessary authority and access to the required resources. Since adaptation and resilience are highly cross-sectoral, the mechanism is also best placed at the center of government--for example, with a committee chaired by the presidency or prime minister's office, or the head of a planning or central finance agency. Several proposals exist, including the creation of a national risk board or chief risk officers (World Bank 2013). The UK's Committee on Climate Change, in charge of maintaining political commitment to climate goals and adherence to the Climate Change Act, comprises eight experts from academia, business, civil society, and politics. Its Adaptation Sub-Committee has six members. The Climate Change Act requires Parliament to have access to the committee's advice and obliges the government to respond to the committee's recommendations--in other words, the government cannot ignore the committee's advice. The committee has an effective public communications function and its advice is regularly referred to in the media. Kenya's Climate Change Act 2016 establishes a National Climate Change Council chaired by the president as an overarching national climate change coordination mechanism and the lead agency in charge of climate change plans and actions.33 The act outlines duties for all state ministries, departments and agencies, establishes a climate change unit and appoints a senior official to coordinate mainstreaming climate change into sectoral strategies. The council reports annually on the implementation of climate change duties and functions. Stakeholder involvement is an important dimension of any institutional setup. It is critical at each stage of the adaptation and resilience process, including: » Strategy design, identifying available options and contributing to assessment and prioritization, making sure that the concerns and priorities of various groups are given due consideration » Implementation, since the adaptation and resilience strategy will be largely implemented by private actors   » M&E, particularly by flagging unintended side-effects that the established set of indicators would miss--for example, an adaptation and resilience strategy may have unintended negative impacts on housing affordability, and if the M&E framework does not include the right indicator to identify this problem, it would need stakeholders to raise it. Countries have used different approaches for stakeholder involvement, depending on their political system and context. Some--like the recent citizens' convention for ecological transition in France--have punctual stakeholder consultations when plans are designed.34 Others have created permanent bodies, such as Colombia's National Council for Climate Change, which ensures effective coordination between the government and unions, civil society, Congress and academia,35 Ireland's Citizens' Assembly on Climate Change,36 and Costa Rica's Citizen Advisory Council and Citizen Consultative Council on Climate Change.37 Peru's Framework Law on Climate Change includes specific provision on the rights and participation of indigenous stakeholders. ACTION A.2 >> Design an adaptation and resilience strategy with prioritized actions After establishing the appropriate institutional and legal framework for adaptation and resilience, governments can design their adaptation and resilience strategy-- with details of interventions, investments, and policies--building on the agencies and participatory instruments available. Since no country has the capacity to implement in parallel all desirable measures and interventions for increasing resilience and reducing future disaster and climate change losses, one of the strategy's (and the finance ministry's) main roles is prioritizing interventions, to ensure limited resources go to the best opportunities. Even projects that are economically beneficial--with a positive NPV--may be impossible to fund with available resources. Ministries can use multiple tools to prioritize investments in climate change adaptation, from traditional methods for appraising investments to more holistic approaches that account for societal benefits and uncertainty (toolbox K). Indeed, tools for prioritizing and selecting investments are crucial for a robust adaptation strategy. For example, some interventions may not be justified on the basis of pure economics, but are essential for protecting populations and communities from unacceptable impacts. Prioritization methodologies allow decision makers to identify a small subset of interventions that are most likely to deliver large net benefits. But when selecting short-term priorities, they should also consider the long term. Resilience-boosting interventions implemented over the lifetime of an adaptation plan (say, five years) should be considered as the first steps within a decades-long strategy. Selected short-term interventions need to: » Build the foundation for future interventions--for example, by establishing the right institutions and governance systems » Demonstrate the value of investing in resilience--for example, by supporting pilot and demonstration projects that can then be scaled up and generalized » Prevent irreversible impacts--for example, by implementing interventions that cannot wait. This last consideration is crucial in rapidly growing countries. As they build new infrastructure and buildings, they have an opportunity to build right in the first place and prevent large retrofit costs in a few decades. The World Bank's Lifelines report estimates that delaying action in improving the resilience of new   infrastructure by one year would cost low- and middle-income countries around $100 billion (Hallegatte et al. 2019). A cascade of uncertainties characterizes all decisions that relate to climate change and long-term socioeconomic trends. Uncertainty about sea level rise, temperature, precipitation, and other climate factors--as well as socioeconomic change, political factors, disruptive new technologies, and behavioral change-- all have tremendous implications for decision makers' short-term choices. Past evidence shows that our ability to predict the future is limited (Kahneman 2011; Silver 2012). Parties to a decision often also have competing priorities, beliefs, and preferences. And when parties do not know or cannot agree on the models that describe the key processes that shape the future, the probability distribution of key variables and parameters in these models, or the value of alternative outcomes, it leads to deep uncertainty (Lempert et al. 2003). Traditional investment appraisal methods can be ill-suited for prioritizing adaptation investments in this context, especially when the uncertainties cannot be translated into probabilities of occurrence. Conventional cost-benefit analysis is particularly challenging in the presence of deep uncertainty, diverging worldviews, or disagreement among experts. Against this context, new decision-making tools--such as decision trees and adaptive pathways--have been developed to make robust decisions that perform well across a wide range of future scenarios, preferences, and worldviews (toolbox K). They are designed to deliver acceptable outcomes in the largest range of possible futures, instead of optimizing for one particular scenario (Haasnoot et al. 2013; Lempert and Groves 2010; Ray and Brown 2015). Governments also need to consider the context of the COVID-19 crisis when prioritizing and financing an adaptation and resilience strategy. On the one hand, governments managing a health emergency have reduced capacity to design and implement complex policy changes or investments, their tax revenues have dropped, and they may want to focus on simpler and cheaper actions in the short term. On the other hand, their COVID-19 response may allow them to build long-term resilience to other shocks. For example, all countries have scaled up their social protection systems to protect their populations against the negative side-effects of COVID-19 containment measures. Ensuring the infrastructure for scaling up their social protection system stays in place after this crisis would build a country's resilience, by improving their ability to respond to the next emergency. As the COVID-19 crisis gets under control, over a timeline that remains highly uncertain, countries may also implement recovery and stimulus packages to help restart the economy. Spotlight 4 outlines a simple methodology for identifying measures that create an effective stimulus while also building long-term resilience.   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox K Tools to prioritize adaptation and resilience interventions  Cost-benefit analysis, NPV, and rate of return One traditional approach to selecting projects is using a cost-benefit analysis to calculate the NPV, benefit-cost ratio, or internal rate of return of various options, to select the best ones. A standard cost-benefit analysis would simply take the discounted sums of the costs and benefits over the project's lifetime and calculate either the NPV (as the benefits minus the costs) or the benefit-cost ratio (as the benefits divided by the costs).39 If the NPV is larger than zero, then the project delivers net benefits and is economically beneficial. The choice of the discount rate  and the pricing of non-market impacts--for example, when a project reduces mortality or morbidity --are complex questions that are well treated elsewhere (see, for example, Tan et al. 2001). Following World Bank guidance on the discount rate, we recommend that the discount rate  is based on normative considerations, while the opportunity cost of funds or financing costs should be considered directly as a project cost, not indirectly through the discount rate. This means that there may be more projects with a positive NPV than available resources to invest in them, and a positive NPV is a necessary--but not sufficient--criterion  for implementing a project. Additional prioritization--for example, based on ranking benefit-cost ratios or NPV--is required. In the case of adaptation and resilience, however, there are four additional complexities that traditional approaches are often ill-equipped to address: » The benefits of increased resilience are not only avoided losses; higher resilience can also enable investments and development, creating more value than avoided losses alone (Tanner et al. 2015). Cost-benefit analyses too often consider only avoided losses, and thus underestimate the value of risk reduction interventions. » Adaptation and resilience projects tend to have broad consequences at the system level, and focusing on the project level is likely to oversee such aspects (Hallegatte et al. 2019). » Future climate change impacts are highly uncertain, as different models tend to provide different projections, making it difficult to calculate a single expected NPV (Kalra et al. 2014). » Decisions on resilience and climate change adaptation cannot be driven by economic considerations alone (Hallegatte et al.   2016b). Concentrating interventions on where the return on investment is highest would focus on richer areas and populations by protecting the areas that have most to lose. This toolbox discusses alternative approaches to dealing with these specificities. System-level and criticality analysis In a networked and interconnected system, the resilience of each asset depends on the resilience of the whole system. Even perfectly functional power plants can stop producing if the transmission system is damaged, for example. So, the resilience of each asset in a system must be determined from the system's needs and depends on its importance within the system. A simple approach to prioritizing interventions is assigning a level of criticality to assets based on their capacity. For example, construction standards are often higher for primary roads such as highways and freeways than  for tertiary roads that have much lower volumes of traffic. Similarly, strengthening or retrofitting actions can be prioritized by focusing on the largest assets in a system. However, this approach is limited in that it does not include information on the type of service the asset provides (for example, a freeway that provides access to a camping area is less critical than one that leads to the main port or hospital) or the role that the asset plays in overall network functionality. Sophisticated approaches to prioritizing infrastructure assets model infrastructure systems as a network of nodes and links. A criticality analysis can identify the bridges and road segments that are most important for the whole system, so that resources can be focused on them. Figure C.1 (toolbox C) is an example from Tanzania. Approaches based on criticality analysis can provide similar outcomes as a cost-benefit analysis: they can help decision makers estimate the costs and benefits of investing in different parts  of a network, and calculate an NPV or benefit-cost ratio for each asset, making it possible to prioritize highest returns. Figure K.1 shows the losses from a four-week disruption of different roads in Tanzania, ranked from the most to the least important road. With a given budget for retrofitting and strengthening, such an analysis can provide a prioritized list of roads that should be reinforced. Scenario analysis and decision making under uncertainty Regardless of the quality of data and models available, long asset lifetimes and deep uncertainty about the future exacerbate the challenges of sound decision making in risk management. Scenario analysis and tools for decision making under uncertainty have been designed to deliver acceptable outcomes in the largest range of possible futures, instead of optimizing for a single future scenario. The first step is stress testing available options under a range of plausible conditions, without requiring a decision or   TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox K  agreement on how likely these conditions are. The methods then repeatedly evaluate decision options under different sets of assumptions, including low-likelihood but high-consequence events. This process promotes consensus around decisions, which can help decision makers manage deep uncertainty. By performing analyses in this way, decision makers can debate important questions, such as: » What trade-offs should be made between robustness and, for example, cost? » Is it possible to add safety margins to a project to hedge against surprises? » Which options offer the most flexibility for responding to unexpected changes in the future? » What should be done in case of failure? Robust solutions can usually be achieved by selecting  options that minimize the potential for regret. Here, regret is defined as the difference between what a given decision would achieve and what the best decision could have achieved. For example, there is a regret from having strengthened a bridge to resist a strong earthquake, if no such earthquake occurs during the lifetime of the bridge. Similarly, there is a regret from not having strengthened the bridge if a strong earthquake does happen and the bridge is destroyed. Figure K.2 represents this approach, which is based on the Robust Decision Making (RDM) methodology. It suggests starting from existing plans and working with decision makers and stakeholders to define what would be considered a failure or unacceptable outcome. These can be defined in pure economic terms (for example, the NPV is negative) or in more complex ways (the NPV is negative or the project creates unsustainable debt or bad health consequences for the population). It is then possible to identify scenarios in which the existing plan would fail. The vulnerabilities identified through this process can help identify options and opportunities to reduce or manage them, and to make the considered system less vulnerable. This approach does not usually provide a ranking of projects or a single metric to measure project returns. But it does identify vulnerabilities and options to minimize them. It is then up to decision makers to decide whether the vulnerabilities are too big to be accepted and whether investing in the identified options is worthwhile. Defining a target level of residual risk Risk cannot be brought to zero. The appropriate approach to manage risk is always a combination of prevention to avoid disasters and impacts and preparedness to manage the risks and impacts that cannot be prevented at an acceptable cost. The right balance between these two pillars depends on whether we are dealing with frequent or rare events. For changes in average conditions, and small and frequent shocks, it is usually best to focus on preventing the impacts--for example, by retrofitting housing and infrastructure to manage higher temperatures or by building dikes to prevent frequent floods. But for more    extreme and infrequent events, or places with low population and asset density and more limited economic value, the cost of prevention may quickly become unaffordable. In these cases, preparedness becomes an increasingly important option. For many assets--including electricity distribution infrastructure, some roads and other transport infrastructure--it may be cheaper to accept and be ready to repair damage quickly after disasters, than to try to strengthen them (Nicolas et al. 2019; Colon et al 2019). Figure K.3 illustrates how, when shocks are more intense and less frequent, prevention becomes less affordable and preparedness more important. Not all countries can aspire to the same level of resilience over the short term. Defining risk levels should also consider ethical issues, poverty reduction and inequality objectives.  Countries with different institutional and technical capacities and levels of wealth will not select the same level of acceptable risk. So, while the Netherlands has invested massively in coastal protection to reduce flood risks to almost zero, this solution may remain unaffordable for many developing countries in the next decades. Poor countries often experience repeated shocks. For example, urban floods affect Dar es Salaam in Tanzania almost every year and drought-related crop losses occur every few years across Eastern Africa. The frequency of disaster- and climate-related impacts in these countries means that preparedness, through early warning systems and other mechanisms, has to play a bigger role than it does in richer countries (figure K.3). Once an acceptable level of risk has been defined, it can guide investment decisions, funding the required actions  to maintain residual risk below this acceptable level. This is the approach the Netherlands government uses to manage flooding: it commits to maintain risk below certain levels, depending on population density, and then translates these commitments into investment plans. In the presence of significant interdependencies across systems, applying a consistent level of resilience to various components of the infrastructure system is more cost-effective than making independent decisions. It would not make sense for a government to invest major resources in making the power system highly resilient if the water supply or transport system cannot cope with frequent hazards. For systems that interact, it is more practical and efficient to use a target level of resilience to allocate investments across sectors than trying to equalize the rate of return of various investments. Dedicated metrics to capture distributional impacts Economic losses hide the impact of disasters on poor people (Hallegatte et al. 2016b). Because the wealthy have more assets and income to lose, their interests dominate economic loss assessments. If informed only by potential economic losses, decisions about the resilience of infrastructure or investments to reduce natural risks will tend to favor a country's or a city's richest areas. Although the poor often have little to lose, they lack the resources and tools to cope with infrastructure  disruptions or income shocks without reducing essential consumption. So, they are more likely than the wealthy to forgo food, health services, and education after a disaster. To ensure resilience is distributed fairly across the population, governments can use a metric that accounts for the socioeconomic status of affected populations to measure the impacts of disasters and infrastructure disruptions. A recent analysis in the Philippines employed a multimetric regional-level assessment of disaster risks using traditional asset losses, poverty-related  measures such as poverty headcount, well-being losses for a balanced estimate of the impact on poor and rich households, and socioeconomic resilience to measure the population's ability to cope with and recover from asset losses (Walsh and Hallegatte 2020). In both spatial (where to act?) and sectoral (how to act?) terms, priority interventions depend on the metric used for disaster severity. Focusing on physical asset risks prioritizes adaptation action in areas with high asset values and strong economic activity, while concentrating on well-being  losses prioritizes action in poorer and vulnerable areas. In the Philippines, for example, if asset losses are the main measure of disaster impacts, the most important interventions will take place in the Manila area. If the government expresses its policy objectives in terms of poverty incidence and well-being losses, then other regions become priorities (figure K.4). But countries need to account for multiple policy objectives when assessing national risks. As such, they should use a set of metrics that goes beyond asset losses. SPOTLIGHT 4 >> COVID-19 Developing a stimulus and recovery package that builds resilience  To accelerate recovery once the COVID-19 health emergency is under control, many governments are planning to introduce massive stimulus packages to help restart the economy. Governments can improve these packages by considering not only the short-term needs for jobs and economic activity, but also actions to boost the potential, resilience, and sustainability of future development paths. Governments can use a sustainability checklist to screen potential projects (Hammer and Hallegatte 2020), policies, and measures for inclusion in a stimulus package, looking both at the short term (How many jobs will be created? Over which timeline?) and the long term (Does the intervention improve long-term growth prospects, for instance by improving the population's skillset? Does it increase resilience? Does it facilitate the transition to a zero-carbon economy?). The key is to maximize short- and long-term gains through a careful selection of interventions. If stimulus packages simply get countries to where they were before the pandemic, they will face the same problems tomorrow that they faced yesterday, with low productivity, high pollution, and lock-in of carbon-intensive economic structures. The most efficient stimulus packages will be the ones that are designed to create many jobs and support economic activity over the short term, but also get economies on track for rapid sustainable growth. As well as using this spending to make their countries 21st-century-ready by investing in skills, governments can invest in building modern, resilient, zero carbon infrastructure systems and a healthy environment.  This spotlight demonstrates how governments can transform the sustainability checklist into a screening, scoring, and prioritization tool, using Fiji's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA) resilience-enhancing plan as an example (Fargher and Hallegatte 2020). Fiji's starting point was the list of 124 interventions identified as part of the CVA. This list was created through an in-depth multi-sectoral collaboration between the government of Fiji and the World Bank, based on an assessment of the threat that climate change and natural disasters create for Fiji's own development goals, as stated in its national development plan. Although the list includes some pure adaptation or disaster risk reduction interventions, such as building dikes, most of the measures and interventions combine development and resilience-building objectives. Indeed, the CVA plan was designed to support the achievement of the country's 5- and 20-year national development plans, despite disaster and climate risks. Not all the measures listed in the CVA plan are useful stimulus actions. For example, creating drought management plans is essential to minimize future economic costs from climate change, but it is not likely to create many jobs. To select the right set of interventions for the short term, governments need to look at many dimensions, as suggested in the sustainability checklist. Assessment methodology To identify interventions that should be included in a stimulus package, each of the criteria listed in the sustainability checklist was applied to each intervention, with a score given based on expected performance, using simple classification to categorize performance:   SPOTLIGHT 4 >> COVID-19 » 1 for ""good""--for example, this measure generates short-term jobs » 0 for ""not relevant"" or ""requires more information"" » -1 for ""bad""--for example, this measure does not generate short-term jobs. To transform the 35 scores of the full checklist into a small set of priority interventions, the first step was removing any interventions that failed to achieve short-term objectives or were likely to create significant issues over the long term. Next, using a ""do no harm"" approach, any interventions that received a score of -1 for the following dimensions were also removed: » Short-term job creation: Does the measure create new jobs in the short term? Do the new jobs make use of skills that already exist in the local population? Can the intervention create jobs in 12 months after a decision is made, including intervention design, consultation processes, budget mobilization, and procurement?  » Long-term financial sustainability: Is the risk for local/national debt sustainability manageable? Are induced costs--for example, for maintaining and operating a new asset-- manageable? » Irreversible environmental impacts or lock-in to risky or carbon-intensive patterns: Can the intervention be designed to prevent irreversible environmental or cultural losses, such as increased deforestation, developing on wetlands or damage to cultural heritage sites? Has it been screened for exposure and vulnerability to disaster and climate risk, considering future changes in climate conditions? Can it prevent magnifying (or creating new) lock-in to carbon- or energy-intensive development patterns? Interventions that do not perform well along these dimensions have no place in a stimulus package. This first screening removed 50 percent of the interventions. Since the CVA plan carefully considered longterm implications, the screening  removed measures that were not expected to generate many jobs over the short term. The plan included two massive interventions related to the retrofit of schools and hospitals, with a total cost of F$560 million that was considered unrealistic for a stimulus package. These were reduced instead to F$60 billion, making short-term implementation more realistic. The next step was using a classical multicriteria approach to identify the most promising of the remaining interventions. This involved aggregating the scores into four core categories of interest--short-term stimulus, long-term growth, resilience, and decarbonization --and weighting each of the category scores to calculate an overall score. Governments need to select the weights that best represent their priorities and policy goals. The example here simply illustrates the approach by selecting a set of weights in an ad-hoc manner. Results Figure B4.1 demonstrates how each sectoral group performed against each category for the   63 remaining interventions. As expected, they were all strong on resilience--this was, after all, a resilience plan--but they also performed well on long-term growth. This was to be expected, since the plan was developed to support long-term sustainable growth. Short-term growth was more selective, but since the worst measures were removed during initial screening, the 63 remaining actions provided some short-term stimulus benefits. The decarbonization dimension produced the most different results across sectors, with only the energy and agriculture interventions generating significant benefits in this domain. To package these measures into a suitable stimulus plan, a budget cut-off was applied at 3 percent GDP, reducing the list to 10 core interventions (table B4.1). As expected, they all perform well against the four core categories. In particular, they are expected to boost long-  term productivity and growth, by improving agricultural productivity or the reliability of infrastructure, or by reducing energy use or wastewater. Some, but not all of them, also contribute to decarbonization. Conclusion This exercise does not pretend to identify the best stimulus package for Fiji. Designing a stimulus package would require further exploration of options and interventions that are not part of the CVA resilience plan. For example, the tourism sector is heavily affected by COVID-19 and identifying measures that target this sector will be crucial. Direct cash transfers or public work programs targeting the unemployed and the poorest are also a cornerstone of a stimulus program. Finally, the weights used to prioritize interventions need to reflect the priorities of both government and population, instead of being fixed arbitrarily as they were here for illustrative purposes.  But this exercise shows how governments can use existing investment plans as an input into a stimulus program design, if properly screened to ensure selected interventions are appropriate in the current context. It also demonstrates how a simple tool that allows governments to discard measures that are inappropriate today and prioritize others based on simple weights can support the design of a recovery plan. Using existing development plans as an initial menu of options for screening has its advantages. It would ensure that selected interventions meet short-term needs by immediately creating appropriate jobs. At the same time, the fact that all considered measures were already included in long-term plans--whether national development plans, NDCs, or resilience plans--would ensure that the stimulus package generates long-term benefits that go beyond immediate needs.

ACTION A.3 >> Set concrete sector-level targets to guide implementation by line ministries The transport, energy, water, environment, social protection, and other ministries will implement and fund most adaptation and risk reduction interventions, and local authorities will also be important players. For example, a national adaptation and resilience strategy can aim to revise 50 percent of all land use plans to account for climate change by 2025, and 100 percent by 2030. But it would be down to local authorities to implement these targets, under the supervision of the ministry in charge of land use. Governments can identify sector-level targets for 2025 or 2030 for each of the actions outlined in this guide, and include these in their strategy, leaving detailed policy implementation for achieving the targets to the relevant ministries. These targets are also often introduced through a climate change framework law (see World Bank 2020b). Targets already set include Singapore's long-term adaptation target of a tenfold increase in desalination capacity to meet 30 percent of long-term water needs by 2060,40 Vietnam's objective of at least 90 percent of socioeconomic development plans having integrated disaster risk management and climate change adaptation by 2030, and Samoa's requirement that 100 percent of new buildings be climate-resilient by 2020. Having a representative body such as parliament approve a list of indicators and targets could significantly improve ownership and accountability and strengthen the strategy's authority. It could also help institutionalize a formal and regular reporting process. Such an open process can ensure transparency and may facilitate public acceptance of less popular measures. For illustration, Annex 1 offers a list of concrete indicators that could help track the actions identified in this note.   ACTION A.4 >> Screen all public policies and expenditures for disaster and climate risks, and align them with adaptation targets Adaptation measures can only be cost-effective if all investments and planning decisions consider climate-related risks in their design. To mainstream adaptation measures in this way, governments must systematically screen relevant policies and expenditures--even those without an explicit adaptation or climate rationale-- to avoid any negative effects on adaptation objectives. If they find that a policy or expenditure has a negative impact on adaptation objectives, then decision makers should ensure that the benefits exceed the costs and account for any negative climate change impacts. The value of mainstreaming explains why countries implement wide-ranging laws to support climate change and disaster management (World Bank 2020b). For example, the Philippines' Climate Change Act 2009 puts in place a comprehensive framework for integrating climate change with disaster risk reduction, in policy formulation, development plans, poverty reduction strategies and other development tools.41 The priority is improving public investment management (PIM) to include specific actions and controls that will ensure public investments are consistent with adaptation strategy objectives and consider disaster and climate risks. To help governments do this, multilateral institutions are adapting their assessments of PIM systems that inform the design of institutional reforms and capacity building initiatives. The World Bank assesses critical features of PIM systems across the project cycle. The IMF's PIM assessment follows a similar approach, with the addition of planning and monitoring financial assets. But these assessments do not explicitly address the institutional arrangements needed to support integrating climate change into PIM. The World Bank is currently testing a simple assessment tool that integrates disaster resilience features. Further work is needed to integrate the features described above, thus putting greater emphasis on climate in investment policy and planning, land use planning, regulation use, screening for environmental and transition risks, climate-responsive economic appraisal, asset management and results reporting. The ultimate goal is mainstreaming climate change considerations in PIM across all institutions. Multiple tools are in place to help governments conduct such a screening process. These include the World Bank-International Finance Corporation's climate   risk screening tools,42 which governments can use systematically when making decisions. These tools help project development teams assess possible climate change or natural disaster-linked threats to their projects and identify possible interventions and options for reducing risks and increasing resilience. Many institutions have produced guidance notes for different sectors. USAID's Sector Environment Guidelines and Resources include information on how to reduce project vulnerability to climate change in 21 sectors.43 The International Hydropower Association--with financial support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank Group and its Korea Green Growth Trust Fund--has also produced a guide to help investors, owners and developers make informed decisions about how to plan, build, upgrade and operate hydropower systems in the face of increasingly variable climatic and hydrological conditions.44 One option for governments is mandating the use of such screening tools or guidance for all investment projects, to ensure project design and appraisal considers disaster and climate risks. As one of the pillars of its Adaptation and Resilience Action Plan, the World Bank Group is developing a resilience rating system, which aims to ensure investors, government officials, World Bank Group teams and other decision makers are aware of the risks associated with projects and can make informed decisions on whether a project's expected benefits exceed the risks it creates or is exposed to. The rating asks whether the project is likely to underperform compared with expectations. Here, ""underperforming"" is used in relative, rather than absolute, terms. As part of this process, the World Bank Group is producing a series of guidance notes on necessary screening and risk assessments for different categories of projects. Over the next years and decades, the tools available for mainstreaming climate change adaptation and resilience into all areas of government intervention will be improved and simplified. However, there is no time to lose. Governments should start using the available tools today, updating them as learning about climate change risks improves. ACTION A.5 >> Allocate appropriate funding to the adaptation strategy After preparing an adaptation and resilience strategy, the next step is ensuring it is appropriately funded. A small budget for an adaptation and resilience plan may be necessary, especially for monitoring and evaluating progress. But most funding needs are in sectoral interventions--for example, more resilient roads, investments in irrigation, financial protection instruments, and so on. There are two ways of funding these interventions: through dedicated funds or sectoral budgets. Some countries have created dedicated funds, with the mandate of funding investment in resilience or climate change (adaptation and/or mitigation). Such funds draw on various sources, including state budget and foreign aid, to finance resilience projects. Bangladesh's Climate Change Trust Act 2010, for example, created a Climate Change Trust Fund as the designated mechanism to fund actions to address the adverse impacts of climate change.45 Tuvalu's Climate Change and Disaster Survival Fund Act 2015 also created a fund to provide vital services to reduce climate change and natural disasters risks.46 And Guatemala's 2013 Climate Change Framework Law created the National Fund for Climate Change to support natural risk management plans, programs and projects for climate change adaptation, mitigation, capacity building, payment for ecosystem services for carbon sinks, and others. To simplify processes, promote synergies within each sector, and ensure consistent action, however, it may be preferable for most adaptation and resilience funding to come from sectoral budgets rather than a specific budget or fund. For example, if transport system resilience investments can be funded by the transport infrastructure budget without relying on a dedicated resilience fund, it would help ensure that investments in the transport system and investments in the resilience of the transport system are as consistent and synergetic as possible. And rather than having to establish new institutions or funds, governments would only need to ensure that existing ministries have the mandates (Action A.2) and budgets they need. When adaptation and resilience spending is funded by the general budget, rather than a specific fund, assessing the resources spent can be challenging. One way of monitoring and reporting on this spending is through budget tagging or expenditure reviews (toolbox L). Such tools can help track resources invested and ensure consistency across the different areas of government intervention, and thus also across budget expenditures. These tools can also help identify disincentives for resilience created by the tax system and thus support the reallocation of resources to ensure adaptation and resilience needs can be financed. This could include agriculture, water consumption, or fossil fuels subsidies, which tend to reduce populations' resilience by increasing water scarcity, damaging ecosystems and their services, and increasing local air and water pollution. While such subsidies have often been implemented to help populations access food, water, and energy, they tend to benefit the richest, who consume more energy and water. Their negative side-effects also mean that populations would likely benefit more if resources were directly distributed through cash transfers or reallocated to resilience--for example, by boosting social protection systems, as done in Indonesia and Jordan, or investing in infrastructure to provide universal access to basic services. Do sectoral budgets need to be increased to account for climate change and natural risks, and allow for more resilience? Making infrastructure more resilient often increases upfront costs at the investment stage. Looking at transport, energy, and water systems, Hallegatte et al. (2019) estimate this additional cost as being on average around 3 percent of baseline upfront costs for new investments across countries. Where retrofitting is necessary, budgetary needs can be much higher. In extreme cases, where some strategic retreat is required, such as moving away from places where risks are becoming too high or too expensive to reduce, it may be necessary to invest in new infrastructure, which means a cost equivalent to 100 percent of the infrastructure value. In such situations, budgets would need to increase. If they do not, adaptation and resilience investments will take place at the expense of other investments and policy priorities. But these higher upfront costs will pay off in the long term, and many of the interventions in a national adaptation and resilience strategy would pay for themselves. By definition, adaptation and resilience interventions are designed to reduce the future costs of disaster and climate change. Well-designed interventions should thus have positive NPVs, as the value of reduced disaster and climate change losses will be higher than the costs. An example of such cost-efficiency is the set of options to strengthen and increase the resilience of infrastructure systems suggested in the World Bank's Lifelines report: each $1 invested in these measures is expected to reduce future socioeconomic losses by $4 (Hallegatte et al. 2019). But even a cost-effective investment in adaptation and resilience can be difficult to fund and to finance. Many countries with high vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change already have high debt levels (Feyen et al. 2020); and government responses to COVID-19 are bound to leave them with even larger debts. High debt makes it challenging for governments to finance investments--for resilience or any other purpose. But constraints on investment capacity also tend to make countries more vulnerable, increasing their debt level every time a disaster forces them to invest heavily in reconstruction. This is one reason why the IMF proposed in a recent staff paper that vulnerable countries develop comprehensive disaster resilience   strategies in consultation with development partners and other stakeholders, to facilitate donor coordination and make it easier to decide on the value of various investments in a context of high risk and high vulnerability (IMF 2019). In addition to general constraints on investments, not all benefits from adaptation and resilience investments can be readily transformed into a financial flow, which could be used to reimburse a loan, for example. First, benefits tend to be far in the future--sometimes farther than the borrowing time horizon. And second, transforming avoided losses into an actual cash flow is complicated. Unlike monetary benefits--for example, from a toll road--it is difficult to monetize avoided losses or gains in well-being from better health or quality of life and transform them into a financial flow that can be used to finance the upfront cost. In such cases, financing adaptation and resilience investments needs to rely on general taxation, rather than the direct benefit of each investment.  TAKING ACTION >> Toolbox L Expenditure reviews and budget tagging  Climate change public expenditure and institutional reviews (CPEIRs) use tagging to identify climate change-related activities and expenditures and, in some cases, quantify the funds allocated in support of climate policies. They typically cover climate change mitigation and adaptation, and inclusion of disaster risk management varies by country. In low- and middle-income countries, they are often prepared by international organizations in collaboration with central finance agencies to assess policy alignment, effectiveness, and efficiency in public spending. Early examples include World Bank CPEIRs for Morocco, Philippines and Vietnam and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) CPEIRs for Bangladesh, Nepal and Cambodia. There is no standardized tagging methodology for CPEIRs; most use variations on the OECD's Rio Markers47 and multilateral development bank (MDB) methodologies.48 The World Bank's 2013 CPEIR Sourcebook49 provides an overview of the issues and methodology for conducting CPEIRs. Budget tagging is the practice of identifying climate-relevant activities and expenditures as part of the routine, annual budget process. Developing countries have led the way in budget tagging methodology development, often building on tagging undertaken in CPEIRs. The Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, and Cambodia were among the first; they have been joined more recently by Kenya, Pakistan, Ghana, and Uganda. UNDP's 2019 Knowing What  You Spend: A Guidance Note for Governments to Track Climate Finance in their Budgets50 summarizes experience from seven developing countries and provides a step-by-step guide. In parallel, several OECD countries have developed tagging methodologies. The US Congress has required appropriations bills to identify funds addressing climate change since 2010. The European Commission applied EU climate markers-- based on the Rio Markers-- to track climate finance commitments in its 2014­ 2020 programming period. More recently, Ireland and France have developed budget tagging methodologies. Defining climate relevance There are three broad approaches to defining climate-relevant activities and expenditures. The positive list approach comprises a standardized set of activities that are eligible for tagging regardless of country context. Green bond standards and MDB methodologies use a positive list for defining mitigation activities, but none of the methodologies use it to identify adaptation activities. The objective approach tags activities where the objective is achieving climate outcomes. Activities that reduce vulnerability of human or natural systems to climate impacts by increasing resilience are tagged as adaptation related. Given that many development activities can increase resilience, adaptation activities must   also identify and state the intent to address specific climate risks, vulnerabilities and impacts, and demonstrate a direct link between these and their proposed activities. The Rio Markers methodology for mitigation and adaptation apply this approach, which has also been adopted by the MDB Joint Methodology and EU Taxonomy for identifying adaptation activities. Most of the CPEIRS and many budgeting tagging methodologies are objective-based and usually use some variation on the Rio Markers methodology. The policy alignment approach tags activities that are aligned with national climate change policy. Some methodologies only tag activities that are identified in climate change policy documents--for example, in Bangladesh, only programs and thematic priorities identified in the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan are tagged as climate-related, while in the Philippines, expenditures are tagged to policy initiatives under the National Climate Change Action Plan and Risk Resilience Program. Other methodologies allow agencies to self-assess the policy alignment of climate-related activities and expenditures based on sector climate change policy. The simplest approach assumes that all expenditures related to a tagged activity are climate-related. This is the measurement approach used by green bond standards. Budget tagging methodologies can also be used to assess the  proportion of expenditures that are climate-relevant. They typically use three or five-step classification ranging from ""not relevant"" to ""strongly relevant"" with corresponding weights expressed as percentages of total program or project cost. It is also possible to estimate the proportion of expenditures that are climate-related, based on the cost of a program or project's climate-related activities. This approach, applied in the MDB methodology and in some World Bank CPEIRs, recognizes that activities with a development purpose can also contribute to achieving climate change objectives. Calculating incremental costs would require comparison with a counterfactual program or project design that does not include climate-related activities. Tagging approaches Different tagging approaches have different coverage. » The expenditure approach: The Rio Marker, MDB and green bond methodologies were all designed to tag projects. This is relatively straightforward: projects typically have supporting documentation that details objectives, activities, costs, and results. Tagging current expenditures is only feasible if the budget has a program classification, ideally with some breakdown by subprogram, project, activity, and outputs. » The tax expenditure approach: Recent assessments by France and Finland identified tax  expenditure as an important instrument for financing climate policy and the main instrument for financing expenditure with adverse climate impacts. Where tax expenditures are reported in budget documentation, they can be tagged following the same principles as expenditures executed through the budget process. This is particularly important to identify tax expenditures-- like many agricultural or energy subsidies--that have a negative effect on resilience. However, most low- and middle-income countries do not systematically report on tax expenditures. » The off-budget expenditure approach: Explicit subsidies are direct payments that can be identified as expenditures in budget documents and financial statements and so can be tagged as climate-relevant. » The tax revenue approach: Taxation is an essential tool for climate change policy. It can also help address other market failures such as the degradation of natural landscapes or inappropriate land use in areas that are subject to disaster risk. Tagging can support these policies by identifying taxation that has a climate-change related objective and supporting the notional earmarking of climate-related revenues to climate-related expenditures. » The subnational government approach: These important actors in adaptation and resilience also account for a substantial share of expenditure in most countries, averaging just over 10 percent of public expenditure in low-income countries to nearly 40 percent in high-income countries. Usually assigned critical land use management, urban services, transport, and water and environmental management functions, they are often the first line of defense in dealing with disasters. Budget tagging can capture climate-related transfers between central and subnational government where these are earmarked for specific purposes or tied to specific programs. In some countries, subnational governments have taken the initiative in launching climate budget tagging. Odisha state, for instance, prepared India's first climate budget for FY2020. » The state-owned enterprise approach: Given their role in strategic industries and the energy, water, and transport sectors, SOEs are key players in climate policy, so central finance and planning agencies will need to integrate them into their  mitigation and adaptation policies. The purposes of tagging Anecdotal evidence suggests that tagging successfully serves several purposes, including: » Awareness raising and communication: Tagging raises awareness of climate change risks, vulnerabilities, and policies within government and across external stakeholders by forcing government agencies to consider the link between resource allocation choices and climate priorities. » Resource allocation: Tagging informs the allocation of resources in line with climate change policy objectives. This information can influence program and project design if there is a feedback mechanism. Tagging alone is unlikely to influence, much less drive, resource allocation. » Resource mobilization: Tagging supports resource mobilization by channeling finance from ethical investors. Early  expectations that budget tagging could be used to mobilize climate-related budget support from sources such as the Green Climate Fund have not materialized. » Fiduciary: Green bond standards provide assurance that funds are applied for the purpose intended by requiring definition of eligible programs and projects, independent verification of eligibility, segregation of funds, independent audit, and impact reporting. Fiduciary concerns would arise in the context of budgeting if there are statutory allocations for climate-related expenditures. » Accountability: Tagging can be used to monitor financial commitments in national policy statements and international treaties. Broader concepts of accountability for results would require the presentation of information on climate-related impacts alongside financial information. ACTION A.6 >> Track progress over time, and review and revise the strategy Tracking progress is key. Without systematic and rigorous M&E, it is impossible to know whether an adaptation strategy is successfully mitigating climate and disaster risks. Continuous tracking of sector-specific progress indicators can highlight any sectors where implementation lags behind (Action A.3). Likewise, sectors that consistently meet implementation indicators may yield important lessons that can help strengthen approaches in other sectors. Overall, tracking progress across a range of indicators for each of the actions outlined in this note will enable decision makers to provide regular and consistent progress updates and to communicate residual risks in a transparent manner. Revising the strategy should be part of the strategy itself. Every strong adaptation and resilience strategy can be further strengthened as new challenges and insights become apparent over time. If targets and milestones are missed, implementation challenges--such capacity or resource constraints, or coordination failures between implementing bodies--may become apparent that were not accounted for in the initial strategy design. In such cases, revising institutional arrangements or prioritizing alternative approaches can help bring implementation back on track. By allowing flexibility, course corrections and adjustments can be programmed as integral elements of the strategy, rather than regarded as admissions of failure. Such strategy revisions are also likely to become necessary as new challenges and risks arise. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic forced many governments to reevaluate their approach to emergency management, not least in areas such as evacuation planning. Indeed, as this guide emphasizes, there are many uncertainties regarding the future impacts of climate change--especially at macroeconomic level--and the performance and effectiveness of resilience measures. New solutions and technologies are also likely to become available that will allow resilience actions to be implemented in more targeted or cost-effective ways. For example, scientific advances may enable us to anticipate future climate change challenges in more robust ways.  Foundations: rapid, robust, and inclusive development is the first priority ACTION F.1 >> Increase economic productivity and growth, while keeping buffers for shocks » Average productivity growth » Economic growth » Debt/GDP ratio » Structural deficit ACTION F.2 >> Ensure that economic growth is inclusive » Poverty headcount » Change in poverty headcount (last five years) » Growth in income of bottom 40 percent » Average income of farmers » Percentage of farmers with access to fertilizers or improved seeds » Average share of household budget spent on food and beverages » Access to modern energy » Number of power outages per year » Access to improved water » Number of water outages per year » Access to sanitation » Share of population with a bank account » Share of population covered by social protection » Total social protection spending » Share of population with health care coverage » Number of conflict-related deaths in the last year Priority Area 1: Facilitate the adaptation of people and firms ACTION 1.1 >> Assess disaster and climate risks, and make the information available » Number of weather or hydrological observation stations operational in the country » Real-time availability of hydromet observations » Time series of hydromet observations are freely available » Percentage of country covered by high-resolution digital terrain model » Percentage of country covered by high-resolution hazard maps for current and future risks, with multiple scenarios » Risk assessment for main economic sector done and publicly available (including opportunities where competitive advantage may improve) » Data platform providing easy access to hazard and climate change scenario data » Guidance materials and methodologies available to users on how to access and include disaster and climate information in decision making    "

Foreword





Concentrations of greenhouse gases, particularly C02, continue to rise. The year 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1 above estimated pre-industrial averages, second only to the record set in 2016. Without the role of El Niño in the warming increase observed in 2016, 2019 would have been a record year.
Temperature is one indicator of the ongoing climate change. Also, sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, through greater warming of the oceans, on the surface and in the depths, and through the enhanced melting of Greenland's ice and of glaciers, exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas.
Furthermore, in 2019, heatwaves, combined with long periods of drought, were linked to wildfires of unprecedented size. This was the case in Australia, where millions of hectares were set ablaze, and in Siberia and other Arctic regions hit by wildfires of record intensity.
Besides these powerful phenomena, there has been weather-related damage, such as the effects of multi-annual droughts on the internal and cross-border migration of populations, greater exposure of the world population to health hazards due to heat and pollution, and the reduction of economic growth, especially in developing economies, due to rising temperatures and weather extremes.
The results of this report demonstrate that cl ¡mate change is already very visible in various ways. More ambitious climate mitigation efforts are needed to keep the warming below 2 by the end of the century.
The World Meteorological Organization will continue to follow closely climate variability and change and their impact. An information portal is being set up to allow indicators of the state of the climate to be tracked.
I would like to thank the many expert teams in climatology and other disciplines. National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, the global and regional centres for climate data collection and analysis and the United Nations sister agencies. Thanks to their unfailing collaboration, the WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate has become a flagship publication providing policymakers all over the world with essential climate information.


{P. Taalas)
Secretary-General
Statement by the United Nations Secretary-Genera I



Climate change is the defining challenge of our time. Time is fast running out for us to avert the worst impacts of climate disruption and protect our societies from the inevitable impacts to come.
Science tells us that, even if we are successful in limiting warming to 1.5 *C, we will face significantly increased risks to natural and human systems. Yet, the data in this report show that 2019 was already 1.1 *C warmer than the pre-industrial era.The consequences are already apparent. More severe and frequent floods, droughts and tropical storms, dangerous heatwaves and rising sea levels are already severely threatening lives and livelihoods across the planet.

We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5 *C or 2 *C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by 2050. And for that, we need political will and urgent action to set a different path.
This report outlines the latest science and il I ust rates the urgency for far- reaching cli mate action. It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change - from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement.
I call on everyone - from government, civil society and business leaders to individual citizens - to heed these facts and take urgent action to halt the worst effects of climate change. We need more ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance intime for the climate conference {COP26} to be held in Glasgow in November. That is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.
{A. Guterres}
United Nations Secretary-General

The global mean temperature for 2019 was 1.1±0.1 °C above pre-industrial levels. The year 2019 is likely to have been the second warmest in instrumental records. The past five years are the five warmest on record, and the past decade, 2010–2019, is also the warmest on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding one since 1850.

Global atmospheric mole fractions of greenhouse gases reached record levels in 2018 with carbon dioxide (CO2) at 407.8±0.1 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1869±2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 331.1±0.1 ppb. These values constitute, respectively, 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial levels. Early indications show that the rise in all three – CO2, CH4 and N2O – continued in 2019.

The year 2019 saw low sea-ice extent in both the Arctic and the Antarctic. The daily Arctic sea-ice extent minimum in September 2019 was the second lowest in the satellite record. In Antarctica, variability in recent years has been high with the long-term increase offset by a large drop in extent in late 2016. Extents have since remained low, and 2019 saw record-low extents in some months.

The ocean absorbs around 90% of the heat that is trapped in the Earth system by rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. Ocean heat content, which is a measure of this heat accumulation, reached record- high levels again in 2019.

Over the decade 2009–2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of the annual CO2 emissions, lessening the increase in atmospheric concentrations. However, CO2 absorbed in sea water decreases its pH, a process called ocean acidification. Observations from open- ocean sources over the last 20 to 30 years show a clear decrease in average pH at a rate of 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s.


As the ocean warms it expands and sea levels rise. This rise is further increased by the melting of ice on land, which then flows into the sea. Sea level has increased throughout the altimeter record, but recently sea level has risen at a higher rate due partly to increased melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value since the beginning of the high-precision altimetry record (January 1993).


Global Climate Indicators



Global Climate Indicators describe the changing climate, providing a broad picture of climate change at a global level that goes beyond temperature. They provide important information for the domains most relevant to climate change, including the composition of the atmosphere, the energy changes that arise from the accumulation o fgreenhouse gases and other factors, and the responses of land, oceans and ice. KeyGlobal Climate Indicators include global mean sur fa ce temperature, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, ocean heat content, global sea level, ocean acidification, sea-ice extent and the mass balance of glaciers and ice sheets.

TEMPERATURE
The global mean temperature for 2019 was around 1.1 ± 0.1 ^C above the 1360-1900 baseline, used as an approximation of preindustrial levels. The year 2019 is likely to be the second warmest on record. The WMO assessment is based on five global temperature datasets1 {Figure 1), with four of the five putting 2019 in second place and one dataset placing it third warmest. The spread of the five estimates is between 1.06 ^C and 1.13 ^C.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {IPCC} Special Report. Global Warming of 15 °C {IPCC SRI 6} concluded that ""Human- induced warming2 reached approximately 1 ^C {likely between 0.3 ^C and 1.2 ^C} above pre-industrial levels in 2017, increasing at 0.2 ^C {likely between 0.1 ^C and 0.3 ^C} per decade {high confidence}"". An update of the figures for 2019 is consistent with continued warmi ng in t he range of 0.1 -0.3 ^C pe r decade.
The year 2016, which began with an exceptionally strong El Nino, remains the warmest on record. Weak El Niño conditions in the first half of 2019 may have made a small contribution to the high global temperatures in 2019, but there was no clear increase in temperature at the start of the year as was seen in early 2016.
The past five years, 2015–2019, are the five warmest on record. The last five-year (2015– 2019) and ten-year (2010–2019) averages are also the warmest on record.3 Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding one since 1850.
Although the overall warmth of the year is clear, there were variations in temperature anomalies across the globe. Most land areas were warmer than the recent average (1981– 2010, Figure 2). The year 2019 was among the top three warmest on record since at least 1950 over Africa. Other continental averages were among the three warmest, except the average for North America, which was nominally 14th warmest. The US State of Alaska was exceptionally warm. Areas of notable warmth for the year include large areas of the Arctic, central and eastern Europe, southern Africa, mainland south- east Asia, parts of Australia (where it was the warmest and the driest year on record), north-east Asia and parts of Brazil. Outside of North America, there were limited areas of below-average temperature over land.

GREENHOUSE GASES AND OZONE
Global averaged mole fractions of greenhouse gases are calculated from in situ observations at multiple sites, obtained through the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme of WMO. These data are available from the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency.4 The year 1750 is used as a representative baseline for pre-industrial conditions.
Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are a major driver of climate change. Atmospheric concentrations reflect a balance between sources (including emissions) and sinks. Global CO2 concentrations reflect the balance between emissions due to human activities and uptake by the biosphere and ocean.
In 2018, greenhouse gas mole fractions reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of CO2 at 407.8±0.1 ppm, CH4 at 1869±2 ppb and N2O at 331.1±0.1 ppb (Figure 3). The annual increases in the three main greenhouse gases were larger than the increases in the previous year and the 10-year averaged growth rates. The global averaged mole fractions in 2018 constitute, respectively, 147%, 259% and 123% of pre-industrial (1750) levels.



Global average figures for 2019 will not be available until late 2020, but real-time data from specific locations, including Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) indicate that levels of C02, CH4 and N ,0 continued to increase in 2019.
The IPCC SR15 report found that limiting warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels implies reaching net zero CO , emissions globally around 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in emissions of non-CO ,forcers, particularly methane.

CARBON BUDGET
Accurate assessment of anthropogenic CO., emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere -the ""global carbon budget""5- is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change.
Fossil CO emissions have increased steadily over the past two centuries, with brief interruptions due to minor falls associated with major economic downturns such as recessions or oil price shocks. Over the 2009-2018 decade, for which complete data are available, global fossil C02 emissions were on average 34.7± 1.8 GtCO .(billions of tonnes) per year, growing at an average rate of 0.9% per year to reach a record 36.6 GtC02 in 2018. Carbon dioxide emissions from land use change were 5.5 ±2.6 GtCO .for the same period with no clear trend (Figure 4).
In the 2009-2018 decade, both atmospheric CO, concentration and its growth rate increased, and land and ocean C02 sinks continued to grow in response to the rise in atmospheric C02 concentrations. The land and ocean C02sinks remove about 45% of all anthropogenic CO ,emissions. A preliminary projection of global fossil CO , emissions, using data from the first three quarters of 2019, suggested that emissions would grow 0.6% in 2019, with a range of -0.2% to +1.5% that includes the possibility of no growth or even slight decline in emissions relative to 2018. Fire emissions in deforestation zones indicate that emissions from land use change for 2019 were above the 2009-2018 average. In 2019, the growth rate in atmospheric C02 was 19.1 ±
1.3 GtC02, above the 2009-2018 average, with the increase driven by rising CO , emissions. The preliminary estimates for the ocean and land C02sink in 2019 were 9.5 GtCO and 14.3 GtC02 respectively, both above their decadal average.



STRATOSPHERIC OZONE AND OZONE DEPLETING GASES
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol, the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbon^ {CFOs} has been reported as discontinued. Their levels in the atmosphere are monitored to understand the continued effect they have on the ozone layer and to detect unexpected changes. Recent studies reported a slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 201 If connecting it to an increase in global emissions to which emissions from eastern Asia contributed. Because of their long atmospheric lifetime, these compounds will remain in the atmosphere for many decades. Even if there were no new emissions, there is more than enough chlorine and bromine present in the atmosphere to cause complete destruction of ozone at certain altitudes in Antarctica from August to December. Consequently, the formation of the ozone hole continues to be an annual spring event with year to year variation in its size and depth largely governed by meteorological conditions.
The 2019 ozone hole developed relatively early and continued growing until a sudden stratosphere warming in September disturbed the progression of the ozone destruction and led to the ozone hole being smaller and weaker than the long-term mean. The area of ozone depletion was below the long-term mean and the minimum ozone remained above the longterm mean until the beginning of November, several weeks earlier than usual. The ozone hole area reached its maximum for 2019 on 3 September, with 16.4 million km2. By way of comparison, it reached 29.9 million km2 on 9 September 2000 and 29.6 million km2 on 24 September 2006, according to an analysis from the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration {NASA} {Figure 6}.
OCEAN
The ocean is an important part of the Earth system. The rate of change in ocean heat content is a measure of global warming, as it represents a large proportion of the heat accumulating in the climate system. Thermal expansion from ocean warming, combined with melting of ice on land, leads to sea level rise, which affects coastal areas. Changes in ocean chemistry associated with rising C02 concentrations in the atmosphere are altering the pH of the oceans.

OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
Ocean heat content {OHC} is a fundamental metric for climate change as it is a measure of heat accumulation in the Earth system. Human-induced atmospheric composition changes cause a radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere - Earth's energy imbalance - which is driving global warming.7 Due to the ocean's large heat capacity, the majority {-90%} of this accumulated heat is stored in the global ocean.

Consequently, the ocean is warming, with wide-reaching impacts on the Earth climate system. For example, OHC increase contributes more than 30% of observed global mean sea-level rise through thermal expansion of sea water.8 Ocean warming is altering ocean currents9,10 and indirectly altering storm tracks.11,12 The implications of ocean warming are widespread across Earth’s cryosphere too, as floating ice shelves become thinner and ice sheets retreat.13,14,15,16 Ocean warming increases ocean stratification and, together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, can lead to dramatic changes in ecosystem assemblages and biodiversity, to population extinction, coral bleaching, infectious diseases, changes in behaviour {including reproduction) and redistribution of habitats.
 Historical measurements back to the 1940s mostly relied on shipboard techniques, which constrained the availability of subsurface temperature observations at global scale and at depth.20 Global-scale estimates of OHC are thus often limited to the period from 1960 onwards, and to a vertical integration from the surface down to a depth of 700 m. With the deployment of the Argo network of autonomous profiling floats, which reached target coverage in 2006, it is now possible to routinely measure OHC changes down to a depth of 2000 m21 {Figure 6).

 In 2019, OHC in the upper 700 m {a series of measurements starting in the 19B0s) and in the upper 2000 m {a series of measurements starting in 2006} continued to rise reaching record or near-record levels, with the average for the year exceeding the previous record highs set in 2013. In the last quarter of the decade and compared to the historical heat uptake since 1960, global ocean heat gain has increased in the upper {0-700 m) layer, and heat has been sequestered in the deeper ocean layers {0-2000 m).



MARINE HEATWAVES
As with heatwaves on land, extreme heat can affect the near-surface layer of the oceans with a range of consequences for marine life and dependent communities. Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature can be used to monitor marine heatwaves {MHWs}. In this case, MHWs are categorized as follows: moderate, when the sea-surface temperature is above the 90th percentile of the climatological distribution for five days or longer;3 4 strong, if the difference from the long-term average is more than twice that between the 90th percentile and the long-term mean; severe, if the difference from the long-term average is more t ha n three ti mes as large, and ext re me, if that difference is more than four times as large.


For 2019 {Figure 7}, the number of MHW days averaged over the entire ocean was approximately 66 days per pixel, nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. More of the ocean had an MFIW classified as strong {41%} rather than moderate {29%}, and 34% of the ocean experienced at least one MHW. In large areas of the north-east Pacific, MHWs reached the ""severe"" category. From 2014 to 2016, sea-surface temperatures in the area were also unusually high and the mass of warmer than average waters was dubbed the ""blob"".5'6 Another notable area is the Tasman Sea, where there has been a series of MHWs in the summers of 2016/2016,7 2017/20138 and again in 2013/2019. In late 2019, an extreme MHW also affected the area to the east of New Zealand. Climate events, including MHWs and floods, were
associated with extensive mortality of key marine habitat-forming communities along more than 46% of Australia's continental coastline, between 2011 and 2017.

SEA LEVEL
In 2019, the sea level continued to rise {Figure 3, left}, with the global mean sea level reaching its highest value since the beginning of the high-precision altimetry record {January 1993}. The average rate of rise is estimated at 3.24 ±0.3 mm yr1 over the 27 year period, but the rate has increased over that time. A greater loss of ice mass from the ice sheets is the main cause of the accelerated rise in the global mean sea level® o n to p of steady increases from the expansion of ocean waters driven by warming.

Interannual variability (Figure 8, right) in sea-level rise b mainly driven by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation {ENSO, see above the section Drivers of short-term climate variability}. During El Nino, water from tropical river basins on land is transferred to t he ocean by shifts in precipitation and run-off (as was the case in 1997, 2012 and 2015}. Du ring La Nina, the opposite occurs, with a transfer of water from the ocean to land (for example, in 2011 }.31
Sea-level rise b not regionally uniform. Figure 9 shows the spatial trend patterns from January 1993 to May 2019. The strongest regional trends in the southern hemisphere are east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, east of New Zealand in the Pacific Ocean, and east of Rio de la Plata/South America in the South Atlantic. In the northern hemisphere, an eastward, elongated pattern is also seen in the North Pacific. A previously strong pattern seen in the western tropical Pacific over the first two decades of the altimetry record is now fading, suggesting that it was not a long-term signal. Non-uniform sea-level trends are dominated by geographical variations in OHC32;33 but also depend on processes involving the atmosphere, geosphere and cryosphere.



OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
In the decade 2009-2013, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual C02emissions,34 which helps to alleviate the impact of climate change. However, increasing atmospheric C02 concentrât ions alter the chemistry of the ocean as C02 reacts with seawater decreasing its pH and increasing the acidity of the ocean. This process is called ocean acidification. The change in pH is linked to other shifts in carbonate chemistry that decrease the ability of some marine organisms - such as mussels, crustacean and corals - to calcify. T he combined changes affect marine life, lessening the potential for growth and reproduction. Observations from open-ocean sources over the last 20 to 30 years show a clear decrease in average pH, with a decline of the average global surface ocean pH of 0.017-0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1930s.
In coastal seas, changes in carbonate chemistry caused by anthropogenic ocean acidification are more difficult to distinguish, due to the complexity of the environment and the variety of influences on it. These changes affect ocean services that are centred on the coast, which are important for human well-being, such as fisheries and aquaculture, tourism and recreation. Strong seasonal patterns and variability in pH are evident in recent monitoring efforts in the Southern Ocean around New Zealand {Figure 10}, highlighting the need for sustained long-term observations with high temporal and spatial resolution.
DEOXYGENATION
Both observations and numerical models indicate that oxygen is declining in the modern open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%-2% decrease {that is, 2.4-4.3 Pmol or 77 billion-146 billion tons} in the global ocean oxygen inventory.35'36 However, ocean observations at 200-m depths show that changes vary across the ocean basins, with the highest loss of dissolved oxygen in the northern hemisphere in the last decades (Figure 11}.
The projected 7% expansion of the pre- industrial area of oxygen minima (< 80 pmol kg-1} by 2100 is expected to alter the diversity, composition, abundance and distribution of marine life. New studies further identified deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and ocean acidification as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and human well-being. Even coral reefs are now recognized as vulnerable to major oxygen loss.

CRYOSPHERE

like sea ice extent, have been measured from space for many years, while the capability to measure other components from space is still developing. The major cryosphere indicators used here include sea-ice extent, glacier mass balance and the Greenland ice- sheet mass balance. Specific snow events are covered in the section High-impact events in 2019.
SEA ICE
Arctic (as well as sub-Arctic} sea ice has seen a long-term decline in all months during the satellite era (1979-present, Figure 12}, with the largest relative losses in late summer, around the time of the annual minimum in September, with regional variations.


The cryosphere includes solid precipitation, snow cover, sea ice, lake and river ice, glaciers, ice caps, ice sheets, permafrost and seasonally-frozen ground. The cryosphere provides key indicators of a changing climate, yet it is one of the most under-sampled domains of the Earth system. Many of the components are measured at the surface, but spatial coverage is generally poor. Some, like sea ice extent, have been measured from space for many years, while the capability to measure other components from space is still developing. The major cryosphere indicators used here include sea-ice extent, glacier mass balance and the Greenland ice- sheet mass balance. Specific snow events are covered in the section High-impact events in 2019.

SEA ICE
Arctic (as well as sub-Arctic) sea ice has seen a long-term decline in all months during the satellite era (1979–present, Figure 12), with the largest relative losses in late summer, around the time of the annual minimum in September, with regional variations.

The 2019 Arctic winter maximum daily sea- ice extent (14.78 million km2), reached around 13 March, was the 7th lowest maximum on record,38 and the March monthly average was also the 7th lowest (Figure 12). The Arctic summer minimum daily sea-ice extent (4.15 million km2), which occurred around 18 September, was tied with 2007 and 2016 as the second lowest on record.39 The September monthly average extent was nominally the 3ri lowest on record.
Extents remained very low till November, with the ice edge advancing more slowly than normal in the Beaufort, Chukchi, Kara and Barents Seas. Around Svalbard, however, the sea ice returned to near average conditions.41 From April to November 2019, monthly extents were among the three lowest on record for those months, with the monthly extent for October being the lowest on record.
Ice conditions varied considerably during the 2013/2019 winter in the Arctic regional seas. Although ice extent was extremely low in the Bering Sea, it was close to normal in the adjacent Sea of Okhotsk. Northerly winds in the Barents Sea region, from January to August 2019, meant that ice extent was close to normal in the northern part of this area, unlike the past decade when it was lower than average. Winter 2013/2019 brought early ice formation on the Great Lakes of North America and above-average ice coverage. The maximum ice coverage on the Great Lakes was 146% of the long-term average and the 7th highest since 1972/1973.*
Until 2016, Antarctic sea-ice extent had shown a small long-term increase {Figure 13). In late 2016, this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extremely low values. Since then. Anta retie sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels. The year 2019saw three months with record-low monthly extents {May, June and July). Late austral winter and spring saw extents that were closer to the long-term average, but November had its 2nd lowest extent on record, and December its 4th or 5th lowest. The minimum daily sea-ice extent {2.47 million km2}, reached around 28 February, was the 7th lowest on record. The maximum daily sea-ice extent {18.40 million km?} was reached around 30 September.

GLACIERS
Glaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which can deform and flow down hi II to lower, warmer altitudes, where it me Its or, if the glacier terminates in the ocean, breaks up forming icebergs. Glaciers are sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation and incoming solar radiation as well as other factors such as changes in basal lubrication or the loss of buttressing ice shelves.
According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, in the hydrological year 2017/2018, observed glaciers experienced an ice loss of 0.80 metre water equivalent {mw.e.} {Figure 14}. Preliminary results for 2019, based on a subset of glaciers, indicate that the hydrological year 2018/2019 was the thirty-second consecutive year of negative mass balance, with an ice loss in excess of 1 m w.e. Eight out of the ten most negative mass-balance years have been recorded since 2010. The cumulative loss of ice since 1970 amounts to over 23 m w.e.
The year 2019 saw major losses in ice volume from Swiss glaciers, as reported by the Cryospheric Commission of the Swiss Academy of Sciences,11 though overall losses were lower than in the previous two years. In late spring, snow cover on the glaciers was around 20% to 40% above normal and, although the onset of melt was relatively late, the rate of loss reached record levels in late June and early July during a two-week period of intense heat. Melting continued until the beginning of September. In the 12 months to October 2019, around 2% of Switzerland's total glacier volume was lost. Over the past five years, the loss has exceeded 10%, the highest rate of decline in more than a century of records.
GREENLAND ICE SHEET
Changes in the mass of the Greenland ice sheet reflect the combined effects of surface mass balance {SMB}-defined as the difference between snowfall and run-off from the Greenland ice sheet, which is always positive at the end of the year - and mass losses at the periphery from the calving of icebergs and the melting of glacier tongues that meet the ocean.
The total accumulated SMB between September 2018 and August 2019 {Figure IS, left} was 169 Gt, which is the 7* lowest on record. Nine of the 10 lowest SMByearssince 1981 have been observed in the last 13 years. By way of comparison, the average SMB for 1981-2010 is 368 Gt, and the lowest SMB was 38 Gt in 2012. The surface mass balance was below normal almost everywhere in Greenland except the southeast {Figure IS, right). This was due to a dry winter, a very early start of the melting season and a long, dry, warm summer.
As noted earlier, SMB is always positive at the end of the year, but the ice sheet also loses ice through calving of icebergs and melting where the glacier tongues meet warm sea water. With satellites we can measure the ice velocity of the outlet glaciers around the edges of the ice sheet, and from that we can estimate how much ice is lost through calving and ocean melting. The analysis for 2018/2019 gives a loss of about 498 Gt. In comparison, the ice sheet lost an average of about 462 Gt per year as icebergs and through ocean melting over the period 1986-2018.
Combining a gain in SMB of 169 Gt with ice loss from calving and ocean melting of 498 Gt gives a net ice loss for 2018/2019 of 329 Gt. To put this in context, data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment {GRACE) satellites tell us that Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 4S3 Gt in 2011/2012. So, the 329 Gt of this season is well above the average, but not a record loss.

DRIVERS OF SHORT-TERM CLIMATE VARIABILITY
The ocean plays several important roles in the climate. Surface temperatures change relatively slowly over the ocean so recurring patterns in sea-surface temperature can be used to understand and, in some cases, predict the more rapidly changing patterns of weather over land on seasonal time scales. Two factors, in particular, that can help to understand the climate of 2019, are the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole.

EL NIÑO-SOUTHERN OSCILLATION

The El Nino-Southern Oscillation {ENSO) is one of the most important drivers of year-to- year variability in global weather patterns. El Niño events, characterized by warmer than average sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific and a weakening of the trade winds, are associated with higher global temperatures. Cooler global temperatures often accompany La Niña events, which are characterized by cooler than average sea- surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific and a strengthening of the trade winds.

Record global temperatures in 2016 followed an unusually strong El Niño event in late 2015 and early 2016. In contrast, 2019 started with neutral or weak El Niño conditions.13 Sea- surface temperatures reached or exceeded typical El Niño thresholds from October 2018 through the first half of 2019, but an atmospheric response was absent in the early stages of the event. Atmospheric indicators such as weakened trade winds and increased cloudiness at the dateline did not show consistently until February. Thereafter, coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere maintained sea-surface temperatures at borderline El Niño levels until the middle of the year.

INDIAN OCEAN DIPOLE
The positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is characterized by cooler than average sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Indian Ocean and warmer than average sea-surface temperatures in the west. The negative phase has the opposite pattern. The resulting change in the gradient of sea-surface temperature across the ocean basin affects the weather of the surrounding continents.
In 2019, the IOD started weakly positive and became progressively more positive from May to October, ultimately becoming one of the strongest positive IOD events since reliable records began around 1960. The IOD index declined somewhat before the end of the year. The positive phase of the IOD during austral winter and spring has been associated with drier and warmer conditions over Indonesia and surrounding countries, as well as parts of Australia. Indeed, Australia has seen unusually dry conditions during winter and spring exacerbating long-term rainfall deficits. The positive IOD is also linked to late withdrawal of the south-west Indian monsoon, as was observed this year, and to high rainfall in the later part of the year in east Africa. For more details on regional impacts, see the following sections: Heavy rainfall and floods. Drought and Case study: Severe climatic shocks lead to a deterioration of the food security situation and to population displacement in the Greater Horn of Africa in 2019.

HIGH-IMPACT EVENTS IN 2019
The following sections describe some of the high-impact events that occurred in 2019. Information on such events is largely based on contributions from WMO Members with additional information from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), Regional Climate Centres and tropical storm monitoring centres.
HEAT AND COLD WAVES
The year 2019 also saw numerous major heatwaves. Amongst the most significant were two heatwaves that occurred in Europe in late June and late July (Figure 16). The first one reached its maximum intensity in southern France, where a national record of 46.0 °C (1.9 °C above the previous record) was set on 28 June at Vérargues (Hérault). It also affected much of western Europe. The second one was more extensive, with national records set in Germany (42.6 °C), the Netherlands (40.7 °C), Belgium (41.8 °C), Luxembourg (40.8 °C) and the United Kingdom (38.7 °C). The heat also extended to the Nordic countries, where Helsinki had its highest temperature on record (33.2 °C) on 28 July. At some longterm stations, records were broken by 2 °C or more, including Paris, where a temperature of
42.6 °C, at the main Montsouris observatory on 25 July, was 2.2 °C above the previous record set in 1947, and Uccle (near Brussels), whose 39.7 °C was 3.1 °C above the previous record (for impacts, see the section Extreme heat and health).
Japan experienced two heatwaves that were notable in different ways. The first occurred in late May, with unusually high temperatures, including 39.5 °C (the equal highest on record for anytime of year on the island of Hokkaido), but limited impacts. The second, in July, was less unusual in a meteorological sense but had much greater health impacts as it occurred during the peak of summer and was focused in the more heavily populated area of Honshu.
Australia had an exceptionally hot summer in 2018-2019. The mean summer temperature was the highest on record by almost 1 °C, and January was Australia's hottest month on record. Most of the country was affected, with the most extreme anomalies occurring in inland New South Wales. The heat was most notable for its persistence but there were also significant individual extremes, including 46.6 at Adelaide on 24 January, the city's highest temperature on record. The heat extended to New Zealand at the end of January, with record highs on 29 January at Hamilton (32.9 °C) and Wellington (30.3 *C), and significant wildfires in the north of South Island. There was further extreme heat in December, which was the hottest on record for Australia and included Australia's hottest area-averaged day on record (41.9 *C) on IS December, whilst Nullarbor Roadhouse reached 49.9°C on 19 December, the highest temperature in Australia since 199S. In total, Australia's seven hottest days on record, and nine of the ten hottest, occurred in 2019.
Another major heatwave of the southern hemisphere summer occurred in southern South America in late January and early February. The initial stage of the heatwave peaked in central Chile, with records set in a number of locations, including Santiago (3S.3 *C on 27 January). The following week, exceptionally high temperatures reached the far south of the continent: 30.S °C at Rio Grande (Argentina, 53.3° S), on 4 February, is believed to be the southernmost recorded instance of a temperature of 30 *C.
Whilst the absolute highest temperatures in the Middle East were not as high as some observed in recent years, some were noteworthy: 49.9°C at Sedom, on 17 July, was Israel's highest temperature since at least 1942. Extreme heat also affected India in the pre-monsoon period in May and early June. A number of record- high temperatures were set, including 43.0 *C at New Delhi Airport on 10 June.
Consistent with a warm year globally and an overall warming trend, extreme cold was less common than extreme heat. One area of be low-average temperature for 2019 was North America (Figure 2). The year's most significant cold spell was in late winter in central North America. This started with an intense cold wave in the United States Midwest in late January, including an Illinois state record of-33.9°Cat Mount Carroll on 31 January, foil owed by very persistent cold through February and early March in inland western areas on both sides of the United States-Canada border. February mean temperatures were more than 15° below normal in places, including Great Falls (Montana), whose monthly mean of -17.9 *C was 15.3 *C below normal and more than 5 *C below the previous record. It was also the coldest February on record for several regions in western Canada, including the city of Vancouver, and the first half of the year in parts of eastern Canada was rather cold.

There were further outbreaks of unseasonable cold and early-season snowfall in the western and central interior of North America in late September and late October. Record-low temperatures for October were set for eight states in the northern and western United States late in the month, in marked contrast to the record-high temperatures for the month set in ten southern and eastern states early in the month. Heavy snow in mid-October, with f al I s of up to 74 cm, caused major disruption and power outages in Manitoba (Canada). The first half of November was also unusually cold in many parts of the northern United States and southern Canada.
While temperatures were near or above average, very heavy winter and early spring precipitation led to an unusually heavy snowpack in many parts of the European Alps. More than 300 cm of snow fell in parts of the Austrian Alps between 4 and 15 January, whilst spring snowfalls led to a record-high snow depth for 1 June of 270 cm at Weissfluhjoch {Switzerland, 2S40 m elevation), although very hot weather in June led to that snow melting by early July, close to the normal start of the snow-free period. Numerous avalanches were reported throughout the region during the heaviest snowfall periods.
PRECIPITATION
Unusually dry conditions in relation to long-term means for 2019 {Figure 17) were observed in Australia and western Indonesia and surrounding countries. Also, southern Africa, Central America and parts of South America received abnormally low precipitation amounts. Large areas with unusually high precipitation amounts were observed in the Central United States, Northern Canada, northern Russia, South-west Asia, northern China and eastern Africa.
There was a large precipitation deficit in India in June as the onset of the monsoon was delayed. However, associated with the positive IOD phase, the withdrawal of the Indian monsoon was also delayed and there was an excess of precipitation in the following months for all regions except north-east India. In addition, positive precipitation anomalies in eastern Africa and negative anomalies in the Malay Archipelago and Australia are associated with the positive IOD phase, which prevailed through most of the second half of 2019.
The longest period of consecutive wet days {CWD) in 2019 was longer than average14 in tropical South America, tropical western Africa, tropical South-east Asia and the Maritime Continent. In 2019, the longest period of consecutive dry days {CDD) was longer than normal in Australia, southern and western Africa, central and southern South America and northern North America. The period of CDD was shorter than normal in South-west Asia and the Arabian Peninsula, south-west North Ame rica and the northern Andes region. The number of heavy precipitation days {days with more than 20 mm precipitation, PD20) was above the long-term means in India, parts of eastern Africa, parts of South America, central North America and parts of eastern Asia. Fewer than normal heavy precipitation days were observed in the Maritime Continent, central Africa and Madagascar as we 11 as in parts of tropical South and Central America.



HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODS
Regular flooding occurred during the Indian summer monsoon season, particularly in western and northern India and neighbouring countries. Overall, all-India rainfall for the summer monsoon season (June-September) was 10% above the 1961-2010 average, the first above-average year since 2013 and the wettest since 1994, despite below-average June rainfall. The retreat of the monsoon was also exceptionally late, the withdrawal date of 9 October being the latest on record. Over 2 200 lives were reported to have been lost in various flooding episodes in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar during the season. Monsoonal flooding also affected parts of southern China in June, with 83 deaths and over US$2.5 billion in economic losses reported.
The Islamic Republic of Iran was badly affected by flooding in late March and early April, with the Shiraz region being the worst affected. During the event, 24-hour rainfall totals were as high as 188 mm. At least 76 deaths were reported as well as severe economic losses.
A tropical low brought extreme rainfall and associated flooding in northern Queensland (Australia) in late January and early February. Rainfall totals over a 10-day period exceeded 2000 mm in some coastal areas around Townsville, with Townsville itself receiving 1 259.8 mm,16 whilst a second episode of heavy rain in inland north-west Queensland brought 7-day totals exceeding 600 mm. There was major urban flooding in the Townsville area, whilst in north-west Queensland some rivers expanded to tens of kilometres in width. The flooding and associated unusually cool weather led to heavy livestock losses. Total economic losses were estimated to be in the order of US$2 billion.
In March, flash flooding and associated landslides occurred around Jayapura, in the Indonesian province of Papua, after rainfall of 235 mm in 8 hours, with at least 112 deaths reported. Later, an influx of tropical moisture brought extreme rainfall to the west coast of New Zealand's South Island in late March, with a national 48-hour record of 1086 mm at Cropp River and associated major flooding. A bridge on the region's main highway was washed away.
Persistent heavy rainfall affected a large part of the central United States in late 2018 and the first half of 2019. The 12-month rainfall averaged over the contiguous United States for the period July 2018 to June 2019 (962 mm) was the highest on record. This led to long-lived flooding in the Mississippi basin, with the river remaining above flood stage at Baton Rouge (Louisiana) for nearly seven months, from 6 January to 4 August. There was also significant flooding in parts of eastern Canada in April and early May, due to a combination of heavy rain and rapid melting of an above-average snowpack, particularly in the Ottawa and Montreal areas and in New Brunswick, with 6 000 dwellings flooded in the Ottawa region. Total economic losses from flooding in the United States, in 2019, were estimated at US$20 billion,18 with especially acute episodes on the Missouri River in March, and the Arkansas River in late May and early June.
Very wet conditions affected parts of South America in January. There was major flooding in northern Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil, with losses in Argentina and Uruguay estimated at US$2.5 billion. January monthly totals exceeded 600 mm at a number of sites in north-east Argentina.
In October and November, major flooding affected many hitherto drought-affected parts of east Africa (see Case study: Severe climatic shocks lead to a deterioration of the food security situation and to population displacement in the Greater Horn of Africa in 2019). Earlier in the year, flooding during the rainy season affected a number of countries, including Sudan, Nigeria, Cameroon and Côte d'Ivoire, although overall Sahel seasonal rainfall was mostly fairly close to average.


TROPICAL CYCLONES
Global tropical cyclone activity in 2019 was above average. The northern hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones, compared with the average of 69, although accumulated cyclone energy {ACE} was only 4% above average. The 2018-2019 southern hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones, the highest number in a season since 2008-2009.
It was a particularly extreme cyclone season in the North Indian Ocean. Three cyclones reached maximum sustained winds of 100 kn or more, the first known instance in a single season, and the seasonal ACE was the highest on record by a large margin. Fani was the most significant cyclone to affect India since 2013, making landfall in the east, on the Odisha coast, on 3 May, with sustained winds of 100 kn, having earlier peaked at 136 kn in the Bay of Bengal. There was significant damage in coastal areas and loss of life, although extensive evacuations in affected coastal areas greatly reduced the human impact. Kyarr, in October, was one of the strongest cyclones on record in the Arabian Sea, but did not make landfall, although associated high seas and storm surges affected some coastal areas.
The South Indian Ocean basin also had an active season; there were 18 cyclones of which 13 reached hurricane intensity, equalling the largest number on record. Tropical Cyclone id at made landfall near Beira {Mozambique} on 16 March {Figure 18}, after maximum sustained winds of 106 kn. It was one of the strongest known cyclones to make landfall on the east coast of Africa. There was widespread destruction from wind and storm surge in coastal Mozambique, especially in the city of Beira, whilst severe flooding extended to inland regions of Mozambique and parts of Zimbabwe, particularly the north-east. Over 900 deaths were associated with the storm, the greatest known loss of life in a southern hemisphere tropical cyclone in at least the last 100 years. The following month, severe Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in a more sparsely populated region of northern Mozambique where damage was less severe.
One of the year's most intense Tropical Cyclones was Dorian, which reached category 6 intensity in the western Atlantic at the end of August, making landfall in the Bahamas on 1 September, with maximum sustained winds of 166 kn, equalling the highest on record for a North Atlantic landfall. Dorian was also exceptionally slow-moving and remained near- stationary over the Bahamas as a category 6 system for about 24 hours. The prolonged extreme winds and storm surge led to near total destruction on a number of islands of the Bahamas, with at least 60 deaths reported19 and economic losses estimated at more than US$3 billion.20 Dorian then moved north-east, with significant damage recorded on parts of the United States east coast and in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia. Tropical Storm ime ida brought extreme rainfall to the eastern border of Texas, also hit by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, with rainfall totals of over 1000 mm in places. Estimated losses stand at US$6 billion.50 The number of cyclones in the North Atlantic was well above average, but the number reaching hurricane intensity was close to normal.
Typhoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo on 12 October, with a central pressure of 966 hPa. The major impact of Hagibis was flooding, as a result of extreme rainfall. Hakone, in the foothills of Mount Fuji, had a daily total of 922.6 mm, the highest on record for a calendar day in Japan. Many other sites in the region west of Tokyo had daily totals in excess of 400 mm. At least 96 deaths were reported. In September, Typhoon Faxaicontributed to major disruption in Chiba prefecture. Earlier in the season, Typhoon Lekima had made landfall in Zhejiang province (China) with major flooding and heavy economic losses reported. With maximum wind speed at landfall of 185 km/h, Lekima was the 5th strongest typhoon to make landfall in China since 1949. Overall, activity in both the North-east and North-west Pacific basins was close to average.

SEVERE STORMS
Repeated extratropical systems affected the Mediterranean region in the autumn, with extreme rainfall and high winds associated with significant damage. The most severe events affected parts of Spain, especially around the Alicante and Murcia regions, in mid- September; southern France in mid-October; and the northern Adriatic in mid-November. Events in Spain and France both brought 24-hour rainfall totals exceeding 200 mm in places, whilst a storm surge associated with the November storm raised water levels in Venice to 1.85 m, the highest since 1966 and the 2nd highest in the instrumental record. Italy saw regular flooding in November, which was the wettest on record for the Emilia- Romagna region, whilst significant flooding and wind damage was also reported in southern Austria. There were also a number of severe thunderstorms in the Mediterranean region during the summer, including near Thessaloniki (Greece) on 10-11 July, with seven deaths reported, and in Corsica (France) on 15 July, when 30 mm of rain was reported in six minutes.
Widespread severe thunderstorms and associated dust storms affected Pakistan and northern and western India in mid-April. At least 50 deaths were reported in India on 16-17 April with a further 39 in Pakistan; 60 deaths were reported from further severe thunderstorms in northern India in the first half of June.
The United States experienced its most active tornado season since 2011. May was especially active, with 556 tornadoes reported, the 2nd highest number on record for any single month. However, only one tornado reached EF-4 intensity during the year, and casualties were well below the long-term average.

DROUGHT
Drought affected many parts of south-east Asia and the south-west Pacific in 2019, associated in many cases with the strong positive IOD phase. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed from mid-year onwards in Indonesia and neighbouring countries; Singapore had its driest July to September on record.
Further north, it was a severe drought year in many parts of the Mekong basin. The worst affected areas were near the China- Laos border, where April-September rainfall was more than 50% below normal in places, although heavy rain in central and southern Laos in September eased drought conditions there. April-July rainfall in Yunnan province of China was the lowest since 1961. It was also abnormally dry in parts of northern Thailand, with January-September rainfall at Chiang Rai 42% below normal. The Mekong River was at or near the lowest levels observed for the time of year in the last 30 years at various locations in the second half of 2019.
Long-term drought conditions, which had affected many parts of inland eastern Australia in 2017 and 2018, expanded and intensified in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year, which saw Australia's driest spring (November and December) on record. The worst affected areas were in the northern half of New South Wales and adjacent border areas of Queensland, where annual rainfall was widely the lowest on record and up to 70%-80% below average. Some areas had only about half their previous record-low rainfall. Most of the country had well below-average rainfall (Figure 19), with the only above-average areas being in northern Queensland, affected by the early 2019 floods, and in western Tasmania. The 2018/2019 wet season (October-April) was also widely the driest since 1991-1992 in tropical areas of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and was marked by an almost total lack of precipitation in the central continent. It was the driest year on record for Australia as a whole, for the Murray-Darling Basin and for the states of South Australia (where the annual total at the Marree station was only 12 mm) and New South Wales. The drought led to severe water shortages on the rivers of the northern Murray-Darling Basin, with heavy agricultural losses and some towns requiring water to be trucked in after their usual water sources dried up.
The 2018/2019 rainy season was poor in many parts of southern Africa, including central and western South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana and Zimbabwe. However, there were major floods in north-east Zimbabwe in March (associated with Cyclone Idai), and in eastern South Africa in April, where 70 deaths were reported in KwaZulu-Natal province after daily rainfall exceeded 200 mm in places. Much of southern Africa also experienced below-average rainfall in the early part of the 2019/2020 rainy season. Rainfall during the rainy season in the western and central African Sahel was generally close to average.
Dry conditions affected many parts of Central America in 2019. Lake levels fell significantly following below-average rainfall in Panama in the first half of the year, leading to shipping restrictions in the Panama Canal.
While conditions improved in Panama from mid-year, it remained substantially drier than normal in areas further north-west, including Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, until heavy rains in October. Central Chile also had an exceptionally dry year, with an annual total of only 82 mm in Santiago, less than 25% of the long-term average.
It was a second successive summer with extended dry periods in many parts of western and central Europe, from France to the Ukraine. Paris had 34 consecutive days without rain, from 19 August to 21 September, equalling the 2nd longest dry spell on record, following an earlier 27-day dry spell, from 21 June to 17 July (ranking 6th). Low levels in the Danube disrupted river transport in Serbia in early autumn, whilst the Wisla River in Poland reached its equal-lowest level on record in late September. It was also a dry winter in many parts of the western Mediterranean: rainfall in Spain from January to August was 23% below average, including the driest February of the 21st century, whilst winter rainfall over most of Morocco was less than half the long-term mean. In Iceland, late spring and early summer were especially dry in the south and west. No precipitation was recorded in Stykkishólmur for 37 consecutive days, from 21 May to 26 June, the longest drought on record in the station series beginning in 1856.

WILDFIRES
Wildfires, typically in response to abnormally dry and/or warm conditions, again affected many parts of the world in 2019. Activity was lower than in recent years in some known wildfire areas, such as western North America, but major fires in California, in October, still caused significant losses. On the other hand, it was an above-average fire year in several higher-latitude regions, including Siberia (Russian Federation) and Alaska (United States), with fire activity occurring in some parts of the Arctic where it was previously extremely rare. In 2019, C02 emissions from summer wildfires in the Arctic were the highest in the 17-year record of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)/ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASvl.2) dataset.
Australia experienced an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season in the later part of 2019, with repeated major outbreaks. Major fires began in north-east New South Wales and southern Queensland in early September, with further outbreaks extending progressively southwards during the following months, supported by very dry conditions and several episodes of strong westerly winds and extreme heat. The monthly accumulated Forest Fire Danger Index, an indicator of severe fire weather, for December was the highest on record for any month in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Many individual fires burned for two months or more. The fires reached their peak at the end of December and in the first few days of January, with widespread destruction in south-eastern New South Wales, especially near the coast, and eastern Victoria, as well as near Adelaide and on Kangaroo Island in South Australia. As of early 2020, 33 deaths had been reported and over 2 000 properties had been lost, while a total of about 7 million hectares had been burnt in New South Wales and Victoria. Earlier in 2019, a dry summer in Tasmania contributed to numerous long-lived fires in January and February, in the normally wetter western and central parts of the island. This is the second time in four years that fires have affected regions where historically fire was extremely rare.

The severe drought in Indonesia and neighbouring countries led to the most significant fire season since 2015, although the fires and associated smoke pollution were not as severe as in 2015.21 Fire activity in the Amazon basin was also higher than in recent years, particularly in August, although it fell well short of previous severe drought years such as 2010. The number of reported fires in Brazil's Amazonia region was only slightly above the 10-year average, but total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among the countries with particularly active fire years.22
While 2019 witnessed significant regional wildfire activity around the world, the overall global daily and annual total estimated emissions were close to the average calculated for the previous 17 years of the CAMS/ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASvl.2) dataset. GFASvl.2 combines active fire observations from the MODIS instruments on the NASA Terra and Aqua satellites to provide a dataset of daily average fire radiative power and estimated emissions of pyrogenic species, including particulate matter, reactive gases and greenhouse gases, as of 1 January 2003 until the time of writing.
Daily total wildfire C02 emissions throughout the year (Figure 20, left) generally followed the 2003-2018 mean with increased activity, greater than 20 Mt C02 per day, between June and October, and reduced activity, less than 20 Mt C02 per day, throughout the rest of the year. The largest increases above the 17-year mean occurred in July, August, September and at the end of December, corresponding to the peak activity of wildfires in the Arctic, Siberia, Indonesia and Australia respectively.
The global annual total C02emissions from wildfires for 2019 (Figure 20, right) were higher than the previous two years but remained lower than most other years in the dataset, consistent with the general decline in global wildfire activity since 2003.

Climate-related risks and impacts




The risk of climate-related impacts depends on complex interactions between climate- related hazards and the vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity of human and natural systems.55 At current levels of global greenhouse gas emissions, the world remains on course to exceed the agreed temperature thresholds of either
1.6 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial levels,56 which would increase the risk of pervasive effects of climate change beyond what is already seen.57'58
Climate-related events already pose risks to society through impacts on health, food and water security as well as human security, livelihoods, economies, infrastructure and biodiversity. Climate change also has severe implications for ecosystem services. It can affect patterns of natural resource use, as well as the distribution of resources across regions and within countries.

HEALTH AT INCREASING RISK
Health effects include heat-related illness and death; injury and loss of life associated with severe storms and flooding; occurrences of vector-borne and water-borne diseases; exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases through air pollution; and stress and mental trauma from displacement as well as loss of livelihoods and property.
EXTREME HEAT AND HEALTH
Highly-populated areas of the planet are increasingly exposed to warmer conditions, experiencing a mean summer temperature change that is higher than the global average {Figure 21).
Extreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems. Even greater consequences are recorded in locations where extreme heat occurs in the context of aging populations, urbanization, urban heat island effects and health inequalities.60 In 2013, vulnerable people over the age of 65 experienced a record 220 million more heatwave exposure,61 than the average for the baseline of 1036-2005 — breaking the previous record set in 2015 by 11 million.
In 2010, record-setting high temperatures in Australia, India, Japan and Europe adversely affected health and well-being. A major heatwave affected Japan in late July and early August 2010, resulting in over 100 deaths and placing a great burden on the health system with an additional 13 000 hospital admissions. Europe experienced two significant heatwaves in the summer of 2010. In June, a heatwave affecting south-western and central Europe resulted in a number of deaths in Spain and France. The more significant heatwave occurred in late July, affecting much of central and western Europe. In the Netherlands, this event was associated with 2 064 deaths, nearly 400 more deaths than during an average summer week,62 while in England 572 {300 to 754, 05% confidence interval) excess deaths were observed above the baseline for all-cause mortality in people over 65.
In metropolitan France, between the beginning of June and mid-September, over 20 000 e merge ncy room visits a nd 5 700 ho me visits by doctors were recorded for heat- related illnesses.64 During the two summer heatwaves, a total of 1 462 excess deaths {a 0.2 % increase in average mortality, with an uncertainty range of 543 to 2 221 excess deaths) were observed in the affected regions. Older people over 75, but also age groups 15-44 and 65-74 were those mostly affected. In regions of France that experienced extreme heat {red alerts), 572 observed excess deaths represent a 50% increase in the mortality that would have been expected if no heatwave had occurred.

VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES
Changes in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit the dengue virus, increasing the risk of the disease {Figure 22). In parallel, the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world's population is now at risk of infection.65 In 2019, the world experienced a large increase in dengue cases, compared with the same period in 2013. The Americas identified more than 2 300000 suspected and confirmed dengue cases, including around 1 250 deaths.66 In the three months from August to October, 35% of nearly 1 050000 cases were reported by Brazil, the Philippines, Mexico, Nicaragua, Thailand, Malaysia and Colombia.

FOOD SECURITY AND POPULATION DISPLACEMENT CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND EXTREME WEATHER
Rising global temperature and changing rainfall patterns have already affected terrestrial ecosystems such as forests and grasslands, as well as agricultural lands and crop yields.23 Between 2006 and 2016, agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture) in developing countries accounted for an estimated 26% of total loss and damage incurred during medium- and large-scale climate-related disasters. While about two-thirds of loss of and damage to crops was associated with floods, almost 90% of loss and damage in the livestock sector was attributable to drought24 (Figure 23).
In addition to conflicts, insecurity, and economic slowdowns and downturns, climate variability and extreme weather events are among the key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe crises. After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again - over 820 million, or one in every nine people in the world, suffered from hunger in 2018, the latest global data available (Figure 24). The situation is most acute in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of undernourished people increased by more than 23 million between 2015 and 2018, particularly in countries affected by conflict. Among 33 countries with food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes were a compounding factor together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries, and the leading driver in 12 of the 26.25 In light of this, the global community faces an enormous challenge to meet the Zero Flunger target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
More than 6.7 million new internal disaster displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, triggered by hydrometeorological events such as Cyclone Idai in south-east Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Flurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia, generating acute humanitarian and protection needs.26 This number was forecast to reach close to 22 million in 2019,27 while it reached 17.2 million across 143 countries and territories in 2013. Of all natural hazards, floods and storms have contributed the most to displacement recorded in 2019, followed by droughts. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees {UNHCR} was actively involved in protecting and supporting people displaced in this context, notably in Mozambique after Cyclone Id ai.
The effects of climate-related events and disasters on the displacement of people are not the same everywhere. Asia and the Pacific remain the regions most prone to sudden- and slow-onset disasters. For instance, more than 2 million people were evacuated in Bangladesh, the second most disaster-prone country in the region, due to Cyclone Bulbul in November 2019, and more than 2 million in China, due to Typhoon Lekima in August 2019. Latin America and the Caribbean were also particularly affected by climate-re late de vents and other hazards such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, which resulted in further displacement. For instance, around 70 000 people became homeless in the Bahamas, in September 2019, following Hurricane Dorian, and more than 42 000we re displaced in the Amazonas, in Brazil, in June 2019, due to flooding. Millions of people in the Horn of Africa and west Africa were also affected by floods.
Existing refugee populations often reside in climate ""hotspots"", where they are exposed to and affected by slow- and sudden-onset hazards, which can also result in secondary displacement. For instance, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who have fled into Bangladesh and are now residing in Kutupalong are routinely affected by storms and heavy rainfall and landslides. Between January and November 2019, the camps in the area were hit by floods, landslides and strong winds. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and partners, therefore, made preparedness for the monsoon season a priority, including building retaining structures on hillsides, drainage, roads and bridges. Poor building quality and settlement in exposed areas have resulted in over 34 000 people being affected out of a total population of nearly 945 000.
Although most disaster- and climate-related displacement is internal, displacement across borders, which may be interrelated with conflict or violence, also occurs. The worsening drought and violence in Somalia drove thousands of people to flee to Ethiopia, a country that also faces adverse impacts of climate-related events. The Lake Chad region has seen desertification and deforestation associated with the shrinking of Lake Chad, extreme climate events, population growth and unregulated irrigation. All of this, added to violence, which has driven millions of people from their homes in Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger, exacerbates forced displacement, including refugee movements, across borders.
In southern Africa, the start of the seasonal rains was delayed, and there were extensive dry periods. In May 2019, Namibia declared a state of emergency in response to the drought it was facing.31 Regional cereal output is forecast to be about 8% below the five-year average, with 12.5 million people in the region expected to experience severe food insecurity up to March 2020, an increase of more than 10% on the previous year.
Food security has been deteriorating in several areas of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda due to a poor, long Gu rainy season, which followed a below-average 2018 short Deyr season. In addition, between October 2019 and January 2020, the region faced widespread flooding that affected 3.4 million people.
In March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Idai contributed to complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region.33 The cyclone also led to the displacement of at least 50 905 people in Zimbabwe,34 53 237 in southern Malawi35 and 77 019 in Mozambique.36 Furthermore, Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Kenneth a few weeks later, contributing to a current total of 88 381 internally displaced persons, mostly concentrated in the Beira and Quelimane areas.
Food insecurity remained severe in South Sudan throughout 2019, with 4.54 million people estimated to be severely food insecure between September and December. However, the actual number of food-insecure people is likely to be substantially higher than the estimate produced in August, as widespread floods in September and October affected about 900 000 people and resulted in significant crop and livestock losses.
Flash floods in Afghanistan, in March 2019, following an intense drought from April to October 2018, resulted in the worst flooding in a decade in some parts of the country: 13.5 million people are food insecure, with 22 out of 34 provinces still rallying from the severe drought faced in 2018, which had already led to 32 515 people being displaced in Herat alone.39 The situation is particularly severe because an estimated 80% of soils in the country are degraded due to cumulative years of dry conditions.
Dry weather persisted throughout the first half of 2019 in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after two consecutive years of dry conditions and irregular weather patterns. On average, only 56.3 mm of rain fell in the country from January to March 2019, which is the lowest on record since 1917. About 10 million people urgently require food assistance.
In 2019, drier than normal conditions in the Dry Corridor of Central America and the Caribbean led to forest fires across northern Guatemala and Honduras, with adverse effects on crop development, and contributed to the drying up of some rivers in Honduras. After below-normal rainfall from May to August 2019, about 50 000 families lost close to 80% of their maize production in Guatemala. Significant crop losses (up to 70% and 60% for maize and beans, respectively) were also reported in Honduras under similar dry conditions. In September 2019, the government declared an emergency due to a loss of staple crops, with more than 100 000 people at risk of food insecurity. In El Salvador, over 70 000 households are estimated to be affected by a lack of food and safe drinking water.
MARINE LIFE AND BIODIVERSITY THREATENED BY THE CHANGING CLIMATE AND EXTREME EVENTS
The primary pressures on living marine resources are overexploitation, pollution from land-based activities and climate change.43 44 45 Coral reefs are the marine ecosystem most threatened by climate-related ocean change, especially ocean warming and acidification.8990 Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%- 30% of former cover at 1.6 ^C warming, and to less than 1% at 2 ^C warming.46 Ocean acidification may also have adverse effects on other marine systems, including mussel beds and some macro algal habitats. Fisheries are being affected by climate change in many ways.47 As temperature and salinity profiles change with global warming, the distribution and productivity of important target species are already being reflected in changes in the distribution of fishery catches.
Long-term monitoring of the Great Barrier Reef {GBR} showed that the hard coral cover increased slightly from 11% in 2017 to 14% in 2019 in the northern GBR {Figure 26). However, However, these values remain close to the lowest levels recorded by the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program {AIMS-LTMP}since 193 S, associated with the cumulative impact of cyclones and two episodes of severe coral bleaching over the period 2014 to 2019."" To date, recovery has been limited. Severe Tropical Cyclone Debbie in 2017, and the continued southward spread of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, contributed to a continuing decrease of coral cover in the Central GBR. Average hard coral cover declined slightly, from 14% in 2013 to 12% in 2019. Overall, mean coral cover on reefs in the Southern GBR region continued to decline, albeit only slightly, from 26% in 2013 to 24% in 2019.


CASE STUDY:
Severe climatic shocks lead to a deterioration of the food security situation and to population displacement in the Greater Horn of Africa in 2019
Alessandro Costantino, Sarah Graf and Oscar Rojas, FAO
The food security situation deteriorated markedly in 2019 in some countries of the Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. For instance, in Somalia and Kenya, the number of people affected by food insecurity increased between late 2018 and late 2019, from 1.6 to 2.1 million and from 0.7 to 3.1 million, respectively. By late 2019, about 22.2 million people (6.7 million in Ethiopia, 3.1 million in Kenya, 2.1 million in Somalia, 4.5 million in South Sudan95 and 5.8 million in the Sudan) were estimated to be severely food insecure,96 only a slightly lower number than during the severe and prolonged drought of 2016–2017.97
Exceptional dryness prevailed in March and the first twenty days of April, with cumulative precipitation estimated to be about 80% below average across most of the Horn of Africa.98 The unfavourable weather conditions, among the driest on record in some parts, affected several cropping areas, with reduced planted zones and yields (see Figure 26). In such dry conditions, fall army-worm infestations further constrained yields.
Above-average precipitation in late April and May reduced moisture deficits and improved vegetation conditions. Heavy showers also reduced fall armyworm infestation levels, but damage to crops was largely irreversible in several areas. The sharpest output contractions were recorded in Somalia and in south-eastern Kenya, where rainfall deficits were more severe, and the rainy season is normally shorter than in other countries in the region. In Somalia, the output of the 2019 Gu harvest was the lowest since 1995 and about 60% below the average of the previous five years. Maize production was estimated at about 50%–60% below the average in agro-pastoral and marginal agricultural areas of central, south-eastern and coastal Kenya. In pastoral areas, the exceptionally dry conditions in March and April, especially in central and northern Somalia, south-eastern Ethiopia and most of Kenya, resulted in severe weight loss and increased mortality rates in livestock as well as a sharp decline in milk production.99 In late 2019, cereal prices were very high in most markets of Kenya, Uganda, Somalia and Ethiopia, up to twice what they had been a year earlier, thus restricting food access for large segments of the population.

The 2019 October–December short Deyr rains were characterized by exceptionally heavy precipitation throughout the region, which received the highest or the 2nd highest rainfall totals on record since 1981, between 200% and 400% of the long-term average. Atypical warming of the sea surface off the coast of East Africa, part of one of the strongest Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events on record, was associated with heavy rainfall inland. While abundant rains had a positive impact on crops and rangelands, they also triggered widespread floods and associated loss of life, displacement, damage to crops and livestock deaths, mainly in central and southern Somalia, south-eastern Ethiopia, northern and eastern Kenya and in South Sudan.
Climate extremes caused severe additional threats to already precarious livelihoods in East Africa and the Horn of Africa,101 home to highly vulnerable communities with at least 75 million people living on incomes below US$ 1.9 per day.102 An estimated 8.1 million people in the region are internally displaced, of whom at least 1.8 million are displaced by drought and 3.5 million are asylum seekers and refugees.103 Climate and weather extremes further force people to move in search of safety: in Somalia, between January and May 2019, droughts displaced at least 60 000 people,104 while widespread floods in October and November resulted in 370 000 additional displacements.105 Thousands have been fleeing to Ethiopia, a country that also faces the adverse impacts of climate events, including displacement. Moreover, climate-related events are exacerbating tensions between displaced people and their host communities, further fuelling intra-communal conflict.
The country worst hit by the floods was South Sudan, where about 900 000 individuals were affected, of whom about 420 000 were displaced.
Large flood-induced crop losses, especially in former Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Warrap states, have somewhat offset the increased production and security improvements due to high yields in areas unaffected by floods. As a result, aggregate cereal production in 2019 is estimated to be higher than the poor 2018 output but below the five-year average production.106 Significant livestock losses were reported in flood-affected areas. The flood-induced livelihood damages have further exacerbated an already dire food security situation: 4.54 million people (almost 40% of the total population) were projected to be food insecure between September and December, but the current number is likely to be substantially higher because of the floods.107
Uncontrolled locust reproduction in the Arabian Peninsula, coupled with unusual weather and climate conditions in East Africa, resulted in the worst desert locust outbreak in 25 years in the Horn of Africa and the most serious in 70 years for Kenya. In late 2019, the locust outbreak affected eastern Ethiopia and central/ southern Somalia; by January 2020, it had spread to northern Kenya, and by June 2020 is expected to spread to southern Ethiopia, north-eastern Uganda and eastern South Sudan. Large swarms such as the ones that appeared over Kenya can eat the same amount of food as 80 million people in a single day, and affected areas can experience the total loss of crops and fodder. Sustained locust reproduction is expected until June 2020 and “represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods in the region, and could lead to further suffering, displacement and potential conflict”.

Foreword

Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases continued to increase in 2019 and 2020. Globally averaged mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) have already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), and if the CO2 concentration follows the same pattern as in previous years, it could reach or exceed 414 ppm in 2021.

Stabilizing global mean temperature at 1.5 °C to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century will require an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, which must begin to occur during this decade.

It has been 28 years since the World Meteorological Organization issued the first state of the climate report in 1993. The report was initiated due to the concerns raised at that time about projected climate change. While understanding of the climate system and computing power have increased since then, the basic message remains the same, and we now have 28 more years of data that show significant temperature increases over land and sea, as well as other changes, such as sea-level rise, melting of sea ice and glaciers and changes in precipitation patterns.

I take this opportunity to congratulate the experts and the lead author, who compiled this report using physical data analyses and impact assessments. I thank all the contributors, particularly WMO Member National Meteorological and Hydrological Services and Regional Climate Centres and our sister United Nations Agencies for their collaboration and input on this report. The report is intended to help our organizations to update world leaders and citizens on the latest information about our Earth system's behaviour and climate change impacts. WMO remains committed to supporting this publication and communicating it widely for this purpose.

This underscores the robustness of climate science based on the physical laws governing the behaviour of the climate system. All key climate indicators and impact information provided in this report show relentless, continuing climate change, an increasing occurrence and intensification of high-impact events and severe losses and damages affecting people, societies and economies.

(P. Taalas) Secretary-General

Foreword by the United Nations Secretary-General

We know that to avert the worst impacts of climate change, we must keep global temperatures to within 1.5 °C of the pre-industrial baseline. That means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The data in this report show that the global mean temperature for 2020 was around 1.2 °C warmer than pre-industrial times, meaning that time is fast running out to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. We need to do more, and faster, now.

2020 was an unprecedented year for people and planet: a global pandemic on a scale not seen for more than a century; global temperatures higher than in a millennium; and the highest concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere for over 3 million years.
While many will remember 2020 most poignantly for how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the world, this report explains that, for many across the planet, especially in developing countries, 2020 was also a year of extreme weather and climate disruption, fuelled by anthropogenic climate change, affecting lives, destroying livelihoods and forcing many millions from their homes.

This year is pivotal. At the United Nations climate conference, COP26, in November, we need to demonstrate that we are taking and planning bold action on mitigation and adaptation. This entails scaled-up financial flows from developed to developing countries. And it means radical changes in all financial institutions, public and private, to ensure that they fund sustainable and resilient development for all and move away from a grey and inequitable economy.
As the world focuses on COVID-19 recovery, let us use the opportunity to get back on track to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and reduce the threat from climate change. I call on everyone ­ from governments, civil society and business to individual citizens ­ to work to make 2021 count.

This report also demonstrates the impact of this warming, both on the planet's ecosystems and on individuals and communities, through superstorms, flooding, heatwaves, droughts and wildfires. We know what needs to be done to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts now and in the future. We have the technology to succeed. But current levels of climate ambition and action are significantly short of what is needed.

(A. Guterres) United Nations Secretary-General

Highlights
Concentrations of the major greenhouse gases, CO2, CH4, and N2O, continued to increase despite the temporary reduction in emissions in 2020 related to measures taken in response to COVID-19.
2020 was one of the three warmest years on record. The past six years, including 2020, have been the six warmest years on record. Temperatures reached 38.0°C at Verkhoyansk, Russian Federation on 20 June, the highest recorded temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle.
The trend in sea-level rise is accelerating. In addition, ocean heat storage and acidification are increasing, diminishing the ocean's capacity to moderate climate change.
The Arctic minimum sea-ice extent in September 2020 was the second lowest on record. The sea-ice retreat in the Laptev Sea was the earliest observed in the satellite era.
The Antarctic mass loss trend accelerated around 2005, and currently, Antarctica loses approximately 175 to 225Gt of ice per year.
The 2020 North Atlantic hurricane season was exceptionally active. Hurricanes, extreme heatwaves, severe droughts and wildfires led to tens of billions of US dollars in economic losses and many deaths.
Some 9.8million displacements, largely due to hydrometeorological hazards and disasters, were recorded during the first half of 2020.
Disruptions to the agriculture sector by COVID-19 exacerbated weather impacts along the entire food supply chain, elevating levels of food insecurity.
Global climate indicators

Global climate indicators1 reveal the ways in which the climate is changing and provide a broad view of the climate at the global scale. They are used to monitor the key components of the climate system and describe the most relevant changes in the composition of the atmosphere, the heat that arises from the accumulation of greenhouse gases (and other factors), and the responses of the land, ocean and ice to the changing climate. These indicators include global mean surface temperature, global ocean heat content, state of ocean acidification, glacier mass balance, Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent, global CO2 mole fraction and global mean sea level and are discussed in detail in the sections below. Further information on the data sets used for each indicator can be found at the end of this report.
A variety of baselines are used in this report. For global mean temperature, the baseline is 1850­1900, which is the baseline used in the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C as an approximation of pre-industrial temperatures.2 For greenhouse gases, pre-industrial concentrations estimated from ice cores for the year 1750 are used as baselines.
For other variables and for temperature maps, the WMO climatological standard normal

1981­2010 is used, where possible, as a base period for consistent reporting of surface measurements, satellite data and reanalyses. For some indicators, it is not possible to use this base period, either because there are no measurements in the early part of the period, or because a longer base period is needed to calculate a representative average. Where the base period used is different from 1981­2010, this is noted in the text or figure captions, and more details are given in the Data set details section.
TEMPERATURE
The global mean temperature for 2020 was 1.2 ± 0.1 °C above the 1850­1900 baseline (Figure 1), which places 2020 as one of the three warmest years on record globally. The WMO assessment is based on five global temperature data sets (Figure 1). All five of these data sets currently place 2020 as one of the three warmest years on record. The spread of the five estimates of the annual global mean ranges between 1.15 °C and 1.28 °C above pre-industrial levels (see the baseline definition in the Global climate indicators section). It is worth noting that the Paris Agreement aims to hold the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above
pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels3. Assessing the increase in global temperature in the context of climate change refers to the long-term global average temperature, not to the averages for individual years or months.
The warmest year on record to date, 2016, began with an exceptionally strong El Niño, a phenomenon which contributes to elevated global temperatures. Despite neutral or comparatively weak El Niño conditions early in 20204 and La Niña conditions developing by late September,5 the warmth of 2020 was comparable to that of 2016.
With 2020 being one of the three warmest years on record, the past six years, 2015­2020, were the six warmest on record. The last five-year (2016­2020) and 10-year (2011­2020) averages were also the warmest on record.
Although the overall warmth of 2020 is clear, there were variations in temperature anomalies across the globe (Figure 2). While most

land areas were warmer than the long-term average (1981­2010), one area in northern Eurasia stands out with temperatures of more than five degrees above average (see The Arctic in 2020). Other notable areas of warmth included limited areas of the south-western United States, the northern and western parts of South America, parts of Central America, and wider areas of Eurasia, including parts of China. For Europe, 2020 was the warmest year on record. Areas of below-average temperatures on land included western Canada, limited areas of Brazil, northern India, and south-eastern Australia.
Over the ocean, unusual warmth was observed in parts of the tropical Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The pattern of sea-surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific is characteristic of La Niña, having cooler-than-average surface waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific surrounded by a horseshoe-shaped band of warmer-than-average waters, most notably in the North-East Pacific and along the western edge of the Pacific from Japan to Papua New Guinea.


Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance between emissions from human activities and natural sources, and sinks in the biosphere and ocean. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities have been the major driver of climate change since the mid-twentieth century. Global average mole fractions of greenhouse gases are calculated from in situ observations made at multiple sites in the Global Atmosphere Watch Programme of WMO and partner networks.
In 2019, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs (Figure 3), with globally averaged mole fractions of carbon dioxide (CO2) at 410.5 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1 877 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 332.0 ± 0.1 ppb, respectively, 148%, 260% and 123% of pre-industrial (before 1750) levels. The increase

in CO2 from 2018 to 2019 (2.6 ppm) was larger than both the increase from 2017 to 2018 (2.3 ppm) and the average yearly increase over the last decade (2.37 ppm per year). For CH4, the increase from 2018 to 2019 was slightly lower than the increase from 2017 to 2018 but still higher than the average yearly increase over the last decade. For N2O, the increase from 2018 to 2019 was also lower than that observed from 2017 to 2018 and close to the average growth rate over the past 10 years.
The temporary reduction in emissions in 2020 related to measures taken in response to COVID-196 is likely to lead to only a slight decrease in the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which will be practically indistinguishable from the natural interannual variability driven largely by the terrestrial biosphere. Real-time data from specific locations, including Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to increase in 2020.
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C found that limiting warming to 1.5 °C

above pre-industrial levels implies reaching net zero CO2 emissions globally by around 2050, with concurrent deep reductions in emissions of non-CO2 forcers.
STRATOSPHERIC OZONE AND OZONE-DEPLETING GASES
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol, the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons has been reported as discontinued, but their levels in the atmosphere continue to be monitored. Because of their long lifetime, these compounds will remain in the atmosphere for many decades, and even if there are no new emissions, there is still more than enough chlorine and bromine present in the atmosphere to cause the complete destruction of ozone in Antarctica from August to December. As a result, the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole continues to be an annual spring event, with the year-to-year variation in its size and depth governed to a large degree by meteorological conditions.
The 2020 Antarctic ozone hole developed early and went on to be the longest-lasting and one of the deepest ozone holes since ozone layer monitoring began 40 years ago (Figure 4). The ozone hole area reached its maximum area for 2020 on 20 September at 24.8 million km2, the same area as was reached in 2018. The area of the hole was

closer to the maxima observed in 2015 (28.2 million km2) and 2006 (29.6 million km2) than the maximum that was reached in 2019 (16.4 million km2) according to an analysis from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The unusually deep and long-lived ozone hole was driven by a strong and stable polar vortex and very low temperatures in the stratosphere.
At the other end of the Earth, unusual atmospheric conditions also led to ozone concentrations over the Arctic falling to a record low for the month of March. Unusually weak ""wave"" events in the upper atmosphere left the polar vortex relatively undisturbed, preventing the mixing of ozone-rich air from lower latitudes. In addition, early in the year, the stratospheric polar vortex over the Arctic was strong, and this, combined with consistently very low temperatures, allowed a large area of polar stratospheric clouds to grow. When the sun rises after the polar winter, it triggers chemical processes in the polar stratospheric clouds that lead to the depletion of ozone. Measurements from weather balloons indicated that ozone depletion surpassed the levels reported in 2011 and, together with satellite observations, documented stratospheric ozone levels of approximately 205 Dobson Units on 12 March 2020. The typical lowest ozone values previously observed over the Arctic in March are at least 240 Dobson Units.

The thick grey line is the 1979­2019 average. The blue shaded area represents the 30th to 70th percentiles, and the green shaded area represents the 10th and 90th percentiles for the period 1979­2019. The thin black lines show the maximum and minimum values for each day in the 1979­2019 period. The plot was made at WMO on the basis of data downloaded from NASA Ozone Watch (. gsfc.nasa.gov/). The NASA data are based on satellite observations from the OMI and TOMS instruments.

OCEAN
The majority of the excess energy that accumulates in the Earth system due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is taken up by the ocean. The added energy warms the ocean, and the consequent thermal expansion of the water leads to sea-level rise, which is further increased by melting ice. The surface of the ocean warms more rapidly than the interior, and this can be seen in the rise of the global mean temperature and in the increased incidence of marine heatwaves. As the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere rises, so too does the concentration of CO2 in the oceans. This affects ocean chemistry, lowering the average pH of the water, a process known as ocean acidification. All these changes have a broad range of impacts in the open ocean and coastal areas.
OCEAN HEAT CONTENT
Increasing human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases cause a positive radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere ­ the Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) ­ which is driving global warming through an accumulation of energy in the form of heat in the Earth

system.7,8,9 Ocean heat content (OHC) is a measure of this heat accumulation in the Earth system as around 90% of it is stored in the ocean. A positive EEI signals that the Earth's climate system is still responding to the current forcing10 and that more warming will occur even if the forcing does not increase further.11
Historical measurements of subsurface temperature back to the 1940s mostly rely on shipboard measurement systems, which constrain the availability of subsurface temperature observations at the global scale and at depth.12 With the deployment of the Argo network of autonomous profiling floats, which first achieved near-global coverage in 2006, it is now possible to routinely measure OHC changes to a depth of 2000 m.13,14
Various research groups have developed estimates of global OHC. Although they all rely more or less on the same database, the estimates show differences arising from the various statistical treatments of data gaps, the choice of climatology and the approach used to account for instrumental biases.9,15 A concerted effort has been established to provide an international assessment on the global evolution of ocean warming,16 and an

update of the entire analysis to 2019 is shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6.
The 0­2000 m depth layer of the global ocean continued to warm in 2019, reaching a new record high (Figure 5), and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future.17 A preliminary analysis based on three global data sets suggests that 2020 exceeded

that record. Heat storage at intermediate depth (700­2000 m) increased at a comparable rate to the rate of heat storage in the 0­300 m depth layer, which is in general agreement with the 15 international OHC estimates (Figure 6). All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase over the past two decades. Moreover, there is a clear indication that

heat sequestration into the ocean below 700 m depth has occurred over the past six decades and is linked to an increase in OHC trends over time. Ocean warming rates for the 0­2000 m depth layer reached rates of 1.2 (0.8) ± 0.2 Wm-2 over the period 2010­2019. Below 2000 m depth, the ocean also warmed, albeit at the lower rate of 0.07 ± 0.04 Wm-2 from 1991 to 2018.18
SEA LEVEL
On average, since early 1993, the altimetry- based global mean rate of sea-level rise has amounted to 3.3 ± 0.3 mm/yr. The rate has also increased over that time. A greater loss of ice mass from the ice sheets is the main cause of the accelerated rise in global mean sea level.19
Global mean sea level continued to rise in 2020 (Figure 7, left). A small decrease during the northern hemisphere summer was likely related to La Niña conditions in the tropical Pacific. Interannual changes of global mean sea level around the long-term trend are correlated with El Niño­Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability (Figure 7, right). During La Niña events, such as that which occurred in late 2020 and the strong La Niña of 2011,

shifts in rainfall patterns transfer water mass from the ocean to tropical river basins on land, temporarily reducing global mean sea level. The opposite is observed during El Niño (for example, the strong 2015/2016 El Niño). In 2020, exceptional rainfall across the African Sahel and other regions may also have contributed to a temporary slowing in sea-level rise as flood waters slowly found their way back to the sea. However, by the end of 2020, global mean sea level was rising again.
At the regional scale, sea level continues to rise non-uniformly. The strongest regional trends over the period from January 1993 to June 2020 were seen in the southern hemisphere: east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean; east of New Zealand in the Pacific Ocean; and east of Rio de la Plata/South America in the South Atlantic Ocean. An elongated eastward pattern was also seen in the North Pacific Ocean. The strong pattern that was seen in the western tropical Pacific Ocean over the first two decades of the altimetry record is now fading, suggesting that it was related to short-term variability. Regional sea-level trends are dominated by variations in ocean heat content.17 However, in some regions, such as the Arctic, salinity changes due to freshwater input from the melting of ice on land play an important role.


MARINE HEATWAVES
As with heatwaves on land, extreme heat can affect the near-surface layer of the oceans. This situation is called a marine heatwave (MHW), and it can cause a range of consequences for marine life and dependent communities. Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature can be used to monitor MHWs. An MHW is categorized here as moderate, strong, severe or extreme (for definitions, see Marine heatwave data).
Much of the ocean experienced at least one `strong' MHW at some point in 2020 (Figure 8a). Conspicuously absent are MHWs in the Atlantic Ocean south of Greenland and in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. The Laptev Sea experienced a particularly intense MHW from June to December. Sea-ice

extent was unusually low in that region, and adjacent land areas experienced heatwaves during the summer (see The Arctic in 2020). Another important MHW to note in 2020 was the return of the semi-persistent warm region in the North-East Pacific Ocean. This event is similar in scale to the original `blob',20,21 which developed around 2013, with remnants lasting until 2016.22 Approximately one fifth of the global ocean was experiencing an MHW on any given day in 2020 (Figure 8b). This percentage is similar to that of 2019, but less than the 2016 peak percentage of 23%. More of the ocean experienced MHWs classified as `strong' (45%) than `moderate' (28%). In total, 84% of the ocean experienced at least one MHW during 2020 (Figure 8c); this is similar to the percentage of the ocean that experienced MHWs in 2019 (also 84%), but below the 2016 peak (88%).

Note that the number of stations is not constant with time. Right: Global mean surface pH from E.U. Copernicus Marine Service Information (blue). The shaded area indicates the estimated uncertainty in each estimate.

OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere,23 thereby helping to alleviate the impacts of climate change.24 However, the CO2 reacts with seawater, lowering its pH. This process, known as ocean acidification, affects many organisms and ecosystem services, threatening food security by endangering fisheries and aquaculture. This is particularly a problem in the polar oceans. It also affects coastal protection by weakening coral reefs, which shield coastlines. As the pH of the ocean declines, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere decreases, diminishing the ocean's capacity to moderate climate change. Regular global observations and measurements of ocean pH are needed to improve the understanding of the consequences of its variations, enable modelling and prediction of change and variability, and help inform mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Global efforts have been made to collect and compare ocean acidification observation data. These data contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.3 and can be used to determine its associated SDG Indicator 14.3.1: ""Average marine acidity (pH)

measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations"". They are summarized in Figure 9 (left) and show an increase of variability (minimum and maximum pH values are highlighted) and a decline in average pH at the available observing sites between 2015 and 2019. The steady global change (Figure 9, right) estimated from a wide variety of sources, including measurements of other variables, contrasts with the regional and seasonal variations in ocean carbonate chemistry seen at individual sites. The increase in the amount of available data highlights the variability and the trend in ocean acidification, as well as the need for sustained long-term observations to better characterize the natural variability in ocean carbonate chemistry.
DEOXYGENATION
Since 1950, the open ocean oxygen content has decreased by 0.5­3%.17 Oxygen minimum zones, which are permanent features of the open ocean, are expanding.25 The trend of deoxygenation in the global coastal ocean is still uncertain. Since 1950, the number of hypoxic sites in the global coastal ocean has increased in response to worldwide eutrophication.26 A quantitative assessment of the severity of

2005 2010 hypoxia on marine life at the global coastal scale requires characterizing the dynamics of hypoxia, for which there is currently insufficient data.
A comprehensive assessment of deoxygenation in the open and coastal ocean would benefit from building a consistent, quality-controlled, open-access global ocean oxygen data set and atlas complying with the FAIR27 principles. An effort in this direction has been initiated by the Global Ocean Oxygen Network (GO2NE), the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the German Collaborative Research Centre 754 (SFB 754) project. This effort is part of the Global Ocean Oxygen Decade (GOOD) proposal submitted to the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development.
CRYOSPHERE

SEA ICE
In the Arctic, the annual minimum sea-ice extent in September 2020 was the second lowest on record, and record low sea-ice extent was observed in the months of July and October. The sea-ice extents in April, August, November, and December were among the five lowest in the 42-year satellite data record. For more details on the data sets used, see Sea-ice data.
In the Arctic, the maximum sea-ice extent for the year was reached on 5 March 2020. At just above 15 million km2, this was the 10th or 11th (depending on the data set used) lowest maximum extent on record.28 Sea-ice retreat in late March was mostly in the Bering Sea. In April, the rate of decline was similar to that of recent years, and the mean sea-ice extent for April was between the second and fourth lowest on record, effectively tied with 2016, 2017, and 2018 (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Sea-ice extent difference from the 1981­2010 average in the Arctic (left) and Antarctic (right) for the months with maximum ice cover (Arctic: March; Antarctic: September) and minimum ice cover (Arctic: September; Antarctic: February).

The cryosphere is the domain that comprises the frozen parts of the earth. The cryosphere provides key indicators of the changing climate, but it is one of the most under-sampled domains. The major cryosphere indicators used in this report are sea-ice extent, glacier mass balance and mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Specific snow events are covered in the High-impact events in 2020 section.

Record high temperatures north of the Arctic Circle in Siberia (see The Arctic in 2020) triggered an acceleration of sea-ice melt in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas, which continued well into July. The sea-ice extent for July was the lowest on record (7.28 million km2).29 The sea-ice retreat in the Laptev Sea was the earliest observed in the satellite era. Towards the end of July, a cyclone entered the Beaufort Sea and spread

the sea ice out, temporarily slowing the decrease of the ice extent. In mid-August, the area affected by the cyclone melted rapidly, which, combined with the sustained melt in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas, made the August extent the 2nd or 3rd lowest on record.
The 2020 Arctic sea-ice extent minimum was observed on 15 September to be 3.74 million km2, marking only the second time on record that the Arctic sea-ice extent shrank to less than 4 million km2. Only 2012 had a lower minimum extent at 3.39 million km2. Vast areas of open ocean were observed in the Chukchi, East Siberian, Laptev, and Beaufort Seas, notwithstanding a tongue of multi-year ice that survived the 2020 melt season in the Beaufort Sea (Figure 13).30
Refreeze was slow in late September and October in the Laptev and East Siberian Seas, probably due to the heat accumulated in the upper ocean since the early retreat in late June. The Arctic sea-ice extent was the lowest on record for October and November. December sea-ice growth was faster than average, but the extent remained the second or third lowest on record for the month.
Interannual variability in the annual mean extent of Antarctic sea ice has increased since 1979. For the first 20 years of measurements from 1979 to 1999, there was no significant trend; however, around 2002, the total extent began to increase, reaching a maximum of

12.8 million km2 in 2014. This was followed by a remarkable decrease over the next three years to a record minimum of 10.7 million km2 in 2017. The decrease occurred in all sectors but was greatest in the Weddell Sea sector.
In 2020, the Antarctic sea ice extent increased to 11.5 million km2, only 0.14 million km2 below the long-term mean. Indeed, extents were close to the long-term mean in all sectors. The Bellingshausen Sea sector had its lowest extent on record in July 2020, but the extent was closer to the mean later in the year.
The Antarctic sea-ice extent in January 2020 showed only a modest increase from the very low values of the previous years, but February 2020 saw a return to less extreme conditions. During the autumn and winter of 2020, the Antarctic sea-ice extent was mostly close to the long-term mean but with positive ice extent anomalies near the maximum in September and October.
The minimum Antarctic sea ice extent in 2020 was around 2.7 million km2. This occurred between 19 February and 2 March (depending on the data set) and was the seventeenth lowest minimum in the record. It reflected the gradual increase from the record minimum extent of 2.08 million km2 on 1 March 2017. The maximum extent of the Antarctic sea ice in 2020 was around 19 million km2 and was observed between 26 and 28 September. This was the thirteenth largest extent in the 42-year record.

GLACIERS
Glaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which can deform and flow downhill to lower, warmer altitudes, where it melts, or if the glacier terminates in the ocean, breaks up, forming icebergs. Glaciers are sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation and incoming solar radiation, as well as other factors, such as changes in basal lubrication or the loss of buttressing ice shelves.
According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service (Figure 11), in the hydrological year 2018/2019, the roughly 40 glaciers with

long-term observations experienced an ice loss of 1.18 metre water equivalent (m w.e.), close to the record loss set in 2017/2018. Despite the global pandemic, observations for 2019/2020 were able to be collected for the majority of the important glacier sites worldwide, although some data gaps will be inevitable. Preliminary results for 2020, based on a subset of evaluated glaciers, indicate that glaciers continued to lose mass in the hydrological year 2019/2020. However, mass balance was slightly less negative, with an estimated ice loss of 0.98 m w.e.
The lower rates of glacier mass change are attributed to more moderate climate forcing in some regions, for example in Scandinavia, High Mountain Asia and, to a lesser extent, North America. Lower rates are in some cases explained by high winter precipitation. Most other regions, such as the European Alps or New Zealand, showed strong glacier mass loss, albeit less than in the two preceding years. In contrast, there are indications that glaciers in the Arctic, which account for a large area, were subject to substantially increased melting, but data are still too scarce to establish the overall signal. Although the hydrological year 2019/2020 was characterized by somewhat less negative glacier mass balances in many parts of the Earth, there is a clear trend towards accelerating glacier mass loss in the long term, which is also confirmed by large-scale remote sensing studies. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years have been recorded since 2010.
ICE SHEETS

surface mass balance (SMB) ­ defined as the difference between snowfall and run-off from the ice sheet, which is always positive at the end of the year ­ and mass losses at the periphery from the calving of icebergs and the melting of glacier tongues that meet the ocean. The 2019/2020 Greenland SMB was +349 Gt of ice, which is close to the 40-year average of +341 Gt. However, ice loss due to iceberg calving was at the high end of the 40-year satellite record. The Greenland SMB record is now four decades long and, although it varies from one year to another, there has been an overall decline in the average SMB over time (Figure 12). In the 1980s and 1990s, the average SMB gain was about +416 Gt/year. It fell to +270 Gt/year in the 2000s and +260 Gt/year in the 2010s.
The GRACE satellites and the follow-on mission GRACE-FO measure the tiny change of the gravitational force due to changes in the amount of ice. This provides an independent measure of the total mass balance. Based on this data, it can be seen that the Greenland ice sheet lost about 4 200 Gt from April 2002 to August 2019, which contributed to a sea-level rise of slightly more than 1 cm. This is in good agreement with the mass balance from SMB and discharge, which was 4 261 Gt during the same period.
The 2019/2020 melt season on the Greenland ice sheet started on 22 June, 10 days later than the 1981­2020 average. As in previous seasons, there were losses along the Greenlandic west coast and gains in the east. In mid-August, unusually large storms

Despite the exceptional warmth in large parts of the Arctic, in particular the very unusual temperatures that were observed in eastern Siberia, temperatures over Greenland in 2020 were close to the long-term mean (Figure 2). The Greenland ice sheet ended the September 2019 to August 2020 season with an overall loss of 152 Gt of ice. This loss was a result of surface melting, the discharge of icebergs and the melting of glacier tongues by warm ocean water (Figure 12) and although significant, was less than the loss of ice in the previous year (329 Gt).
Changes in the mass of the Greenland ice sheet reflect the combined effects of the


a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2019: IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, .
In a large region of the Siberian Arctic, temperature anomalies for 2020 were more than 3 °C, and in its central coastal parts, more than 5 °C above average (Figure 13). A preliminary record temperature of 38 °C was set for north of the Arctic Circle, on 20 June in Verkhoyansk,b during a prolonged heatwave. Heatwaves and heat records were also observed in other parts of the Arctic (see High-impact events in 2020), and extreme heat was not confined to the land. A marine heatwave affected large areas of the Arctic Ocean north of Eurasia (Figure 8). Sea ice in the Laptev Sea, offshore from the area of highest temperature anomalies on land, was unusually low through the summer and autumn. Indeed, the sea-ice extent was particularly low along the Siberian coastline, with the Northern Sea Route ice-free or close to ice-free from July to October. The high spring temperatures also had a significant effect on other parts of the cryosphere. June snow cover was the lowest for the Eurasian Arctic in the 54-year satellite record despite the region having a larger-than-average extent as late as April.c
Although the Arctic was predominantly warmer than average for this period, some regions,

including parts of Alaska and Greenland, saw close to average or below-average temperatures. As a result, the 2019/2020 surface mass balance for Greenland was close to the 40-year average. Nevertheless, the decline of the Greenland ice sheet continued during the 2019/2020 season, but the loss was below the typical amounts seen during the last decade (see Cryosphere). Sea-ice conditions along the Canadian archipelago were close to average at the September minimum, and the western passage remained closed.d
The wildfire season in the Arctic during 2020 was particularly active, but with large regional differences. The region north of the Arctic circle saw the most active wildfire season in an 18-year data record, as estimated in terms of fire radiative power and CO2 emissions released from fires. The main activity was concentrated in the eastern Siberian Arctic, which was also drier than average. Regional reportse for eastern Siberia indicate that the forest fire season started earlier than average, and for some regions ended later, resulting in long-term damage to local ecosystems. Alaska, as well as the Yukon and the Northwest Territories, reported fire activity that was well below average.


brought four times the normal monthly precipitation to western Greenland, most of which fell as snow that temporarily stopped the net loss of ice and was decisive in reducing the amount of melt; this was quite different from the situation in the previous season (2018/2019), in which there were extended high pressure periods and large amounts of sunshine, which significantly increased the summer melt.
There is no routine reporting of the annual mass balance for the Antarctic ice sheet, and reported mass changes typically have a latency of several years. This is because multiple data sets must be combined to reduce uncertainty and bias in mass-change estimates on the continental scale.

Antarctica has exhibited a strong mass loss trend since the late 1990s. This trend accelerated around 2005, and currently, Antarctica loses approximately 175 to 225 Gt per year. Nearly 90% of the acceleration of this trend is due to the increasing flow rates

of major glaciers in West Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula.17 This is in contrast to the Greenland ice sheet, where losses from surface melting are of comparable magnitude to those from glacier dynamics. The main driver of faster glacier flow in Antarctica has been enhanced sub-sea melting of fringing ice shelves, with a secondary driver being abrupt ice-shelf collapse due to localized surface melting on the Antarctic Peninsula.39 This glacier-dynamic response to climate and ocean forcing is strongly controlled by thresholds (ice shelf collapse) and strongly modulated by positive feedbacks in flow. As a result, Antarctica's interannual dynamic losses are largely uncoupled from fluctuations in weather on annual timescales.
Superimposed on this sustained mass loss trend is a large interannual variability in snowfall that fluctuates by several hundred gigatons (Figure 14) around an average of approximately 2 300 Gt to 2 500 Gt per year31 and has no clear trend over recent decades.32 These large fluctuations are dominated spatially and temporally by occasional extreme snowfall events.33 Instrumental observations of snowfall on the continent are extremely scarce, however, and ice-sheet mass changes are instead calculated retrospectively from satellite-observed changes in flow rate (the mass budget method), the gravity field or surface height, combined with modelled surface mass balance, near-surface snow density and isostatic rebound, respectively. Each of these three sets of observations and associated model inputs contains significant uncertainties and potential biases, and the results reported by these techniques do not always agree within their uncertainties.34 Consensus on Antarctic mass changes therefore emerges only from a detailed inter-comparison of this suite of methods, with careful consideration of their respective strengths and weaknesses.39,43 No such consensus value is available yet for the 2019/2020 period.

DRIVERS OF SHORT-TERM CLIMATE VARIABILITY
There are many different natural phenomena, often referred to as climate patterns or climate modes, that affect weather at timescales ranging from days to several months. Surface temperatures change relatively slowly over the ocean, so recurring patterns in sea-surface temperature can be used to understand, and in some cases, predict the more rapidly changing patterns of weather over land on seasonal timescales. Similarly, albeit at a faster rate, known pressure changes in the atmosphere can help explain certain regional weather patterns.
In 2020, the El Niño­Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) each contributed to weather and climate events in different parts of the world. The Indian Ocean Dipole, which played a key role in the events of 2019, was near-neutral for much of 2020.
EL NIÑO­SOUTHERN OSCILLATION
ENSO is one of the most important drivers of year-to-year variability in weather patterns around the world. It is linked to hazards such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. El Niño, characterized by higher-than-average sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific and a weakening of the trade winds, typically has a warming influence on global temperatures. La Niña, which is characterized by below-average sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific and a strengthening of the trade winds, has the opposite effect.
Sea-surface temperatures at the end of 2019 were close to or exceeded El Niño thresholds in the Niño 3.4 region.4 These temperatures persisted into the early months of 2020, but the event did not strengthen, and sea-surface temperature anomalies in the eastern Pacific fell in March. After a six-month period of neutral conditions ­ that is, sea-surface temperatures within 0.5 °C of normal ­ the cool-phase, La Niña, developed in August and strengthened through the northern hemisphere autumn to moderate strength

(1.0­1.5 °C below normal). The atmosphere also responded with stronger-than-average trade winds, indicating a coupling with the sea-surface temperatures. La Niña conditions are associated with above-average hurricane activity in the North Atlantic, which experienced a record number of named tropical storms during its 2020 hurricane season, and also with above-average rainfall in Australia, which ended the year with its fourth wettest December on record.
ARCTIC OSCILLATION
AO is a large-scale atmospheric pattern that influences weather throughout the northern hemisphere. The positive phase is characterized by lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic and higher-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream is parallel to the lines of latitude and farther north than average, locking up cold Arctic air, and storms can be shifted northward of their usual paths. The mid-latitudes of North America, Europe, Siberia, and East Asia generally see fewer cold air outbreaks than usual during the positive phase of AO. A negative AO has the opposite effect and is associated with a more meandering jet stream and cold air spilling south into the mid-latitudes.
AO was strongly positive during the northern hemisphere 2019/2020 winter and in February was the strongest it had been since January 1993. This contributed to the warmest winter on record for Asia and Europe and the sixth warmest winter on record for the contiguous United States; at the same time, Alaska experienced its coldest winter in more than two decades. By containing cold air in the polar region through the entire winter, the positive AO also contributed to a relatively rare and record-large Arctic ozone hole in March (see Stratospheric ozone and ozone-depleting gases). Additionally, the positive winter phase of AO has been linked to low sea-ice extent the following summer35 (see Sea ice). AO was strongly positive in November but rapidly declined to large negative values in December and in early 2021.
High-impact events in Although understanding broad-scale changes in the climate is important, the most acute impacts of weather and climate are often felt during extreme meteorological events such as heavy rain and snow, droughts, heatwaves, cold waves, and storms, including tropical storms. These can lead to or exacerbate other high-impact events such as flooding, landslides, wildfires, and avalanches. The risks and impacts associated with these events are described in Risks and impacts.
A YEAR OF WIDESPREAD FLOODING, ESPECIALLY IN AFRICA AND ASIA
Very extensive flooding occurred over large parts of Africa in 2020. Rainfall was well above average in most of the Greater Horn of Africa during the March­May ""long rains"" season, following a similarly wet season in October­December 2019. This was followed by above-average rainfall across the vast majority of the Sahel region, from Senegal to Sudan, during the summer monsoon (Figure 15).
Flooding was extensive across many parts of the region, although Sudan and Kenya were the worst affected, with 285 deaths reported in Kenya,36 and 155 deaths and over 800 000 people affected in Sudan,37 along with further indirect impacts from disease. Countries reporting loss of life or significant displacement of populations included Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, Chad, Nigeria (which also experienced drought in the southern part of the country), Niger, Benin, Togo, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon and Burkina Faso. Many lakes and rivers reached record high levels, including Lake Victoria in May and the Niger River at Niamey and the Blue Nile at Khartoum in September.

rainfall for June to September 9% above the long-term average. Heavy rain, flooding and landslides also affected the surrounding countries. August was the wettest month on record for Pakistan, and 231 mm of rain fell on 28 August at Karachi-Faisal, the highest daily total on record in the Karachi area. More than 2 000 deaths were reported during the monsoon season in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Myanmar,36 including 145 deaths associated with flash flooding in Afghanistan in late August and 166 deaths associated with a landslide at a mine in Myanmar in early July following heavy rain.
Persistent high rainfall in the Yangtze River catchment in China in the monsoon season also caused severe flooding. The June­August period was particularly wet, and floods affected the Yangtze and its tributaries. In mid-August, the Three Gorges Dam saw the largest flood peak since its construction, reaching 75 000 m3s-1. The summer monsoon season over the Korean Peninsula was also very wet, with the Republic of Korea experiencing its third-wettest summer, and parts of western Japan were affected by significant flooding in July.
Parts of South-East Asia experienced severe flooding in October and November. The

worst affected area was Central Viet Nam, where heavy rains typical of the arrival of the north-east monsoon were exacerbated by a succession of tropical cyclones and depressions, with eight making landfall in less than five weeks. Hué received over 1 800 mm of rain in the week of 7 to 13 October, and a total of 2 615 mm for the month of October. The flooding also extended further west into Cambodia.
Other regions which experienced a significant loss of life associated with floods (mostly flash floods resulting from extreme local rainfall) included Indonesia in January, Brazil in January and March, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in April and May, and Yemen in July. Jakarta had its wettest day since 1996, with 377 mm of rainfall recorded at Halim Airport on 1 January, and Belo Horizonte, Brazil experienced its wettest day on record, with 172 mm of rainfall recorded on 24 January. Khombole, Senegal also experienced its wettest day on record, with 226 mm of rainfall recorded on 5 September.

of northern Argentina had one of their five driest years on record, with Buenos Aires experiencing its second driest year. Rainfall for the period was also far below average in Paraguay and Uruguay. Estimated agricultural losses were near US$ 3 billion in Brazil, with additional losses in Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. River levels were so low that river transport in Paraguay was disrupted. Peru also experienced drought conditions between January and March, mainly in the north of the country.38 As the drought continued, a major heatwave stretched across the region in late September and early October, extending east and north to cover much of the interior of Brazil. The temperature reached 44.6 °C on 5 October at Nova Maringá and Água Clara, and individual locations which had their hottest day on record included Cuiaba, Curitiba, Belo Horizonte and Asuncion. There was significant wildfire activity across Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay from mid-year onwards, with some of the most serious wildfires occurring in the Pantanal wetlands in western Brazil.

HEATWAVES, DROUGHT AND WILDFIRE
Severe drought affected many parts of the interior of South America in 2020, with the worst-affected areas being northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and the western border areas of Brazil. Most of the provinces

2020 was an exceptionally warm year for most of Russia, especially Siberia. Temperatures averaged over Russia for 2020 were 3.2 °C above average, 1.0 °C above the previous record set in 2007. In parts of northern Siberia, mean temperatures for the year were 6 °C or more above average. The heat culminated in late June, when temperatures reached 38.0 °C at Verkhoyansk on 20 June, provisionally the highest known temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. Abnormal warmth also extended to other parts of the high Arctic outside Russia, with temperatures reaching records on 25 July of 21.9 °C at Eureka (Canada), and 21.7 °C at Svalbard Airport.

 A number of exceptionally large wildfires,

including the largest fires ever recorded


in the states of California and Colorado, occurred in the western United States in late summer and autumn, contributing to the largest area burned nationally in the last 20 years. Widespread drought conditions through the western half of the United States, particularly the interior south-west, contributed to the fires, as did a very weak summer monsoon. The three-month period from July to September was the hottest and driest on record for the south-west United States, and 2020 was the driest year on record for Nevada and Utah. Abnormal lightning activity in coastal California in mid-August also ignited many fires. The most destructive fires were in California and western Oregon, with over 8 500 structures destroyed in California and over 2 000 destroyed in Oregon; 46 deaths and US$ 16.5 billion in losses were attributed to the fires across multiple states.39 There were also a number of episodes of extreme heat. Death Valley reached 54.4 °C on 16 August, the highest known temperature in the world in at least the last 80 years, while 49.4 °C was reached on 6 September at Woodland Hills, which was a record for greater Los Angeles. The highest temperature ever recorded was 56.7 °C and was reached at Furnace Creek, California on 10 July 1911. A temperature of 55.0 °C was recorded in Kebili, Tunisia on 7 July 1931;40 this was a record for the eastern hemisphere.

New Zealand reported their longest dry spell on record between late December 2019 and late February 2020.
A major heatwave affected the Caribbean region and Mexico in April. Temperatures reached 39.7 °C at Veguitas on 12 April, a national record for Cuba, and Havana also had its hottest day on 12 April, with temperatures reaching 38.5 °C. In eastern Mexico, temperatures exceeded 45 °C at a number of locations, reaching as high as 48.8 °C at Gallinas on 12 April, while very high readings in Central America included 41.2 °C at San Agustin Acasaguastlán (Guatemala). Further extreme heat in September saw national or territorial records set for Dominica, Grenada and Puerto Rico.
Dry conditions affected parts of North-Central Europe during the spring and summer of 2020 although generally not to the same extent as in 2018 or 2019. April was especially dry, with Romania and Belarus having their driest April on record, and Germany, the Czech Republic

Major wildfires in eastern Australia which had burned throughout the later part of 2019 continued into early 2020 before finally being controlled after heavy rain in early February. Drought conditions, which had prevailed since early 2017, eased from January 2020 onwards, but there were a number of episodes of extreme heat in early 2020. Penrith, in western Sydney, reached 48.9 °C, the highest temperature observed in an Australian metropolitan area, on 4 January, while Canberra, which set monthly records in all three summer months, reached a new high of 44.0 °C on the same day. Severe smoke pollution also affected many parts of south-eastern Australia in the early part of 2020. A number of stations in

and Slovak Republic their second driest, while Geneva (Switzerland) had a record 43-day dry spell from 13 March to 24 April. There was also a significant heatwave in western Europe in August; while it was generally not as intense as those of 2019 (except locally on the northern coast of France), many locations, particularly in northern France, reached temperatures which ranked second behind the 2019 heatwaves, and De Bilt (Netherlands) had a record eight consecutive days above 30 °C. In early September, the focus of extreme heat shifted to the eastern Mediterranean, with all-time records at locations including Jerusalem (42.7 °C) and Eilat (48.9 °C) on 4 September following a late July heatwave in the Middle East in which temperatures at Kuwait Airport reached 52.1 °C and temperatures at Baghdad reached 51.8 °C.
The summer was very hot in parts of East Asia. Hamamatsu (41.1 °C) equalled Japan's national record on 17 August, and Taipei had its hottest day on record on 24 July, with temperatures reaching 39.7 °C. Hong Kong had a record run of 13 consecutive hot nights, with a daily minimum temperature of 28 °C or above, from 19 June to 1 July, followed by 11 consecutive hot nights from 5 to 15 July.
Long-term drought continued to persist in parts of southern Africa, particularly the Northern and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa, although heavy winter rains saw water storages reach full capacity in Cape Town, continuing the recovery from the extreme drought situation which peaked in 2018. Rainfall during the 2019/2020 summer rainy season in the interior of southern Africa was locally heavy, and many areas had above-average rainfall in November and December; however long-term drought still persisted in some areas.
EXTREME COLD AND SNOW
North America's most significant snowstorm of the 2019/2020 winter occurred on 17­18 January in Newfoundland. St. John's received 76.2 cm of snow, including a record daily snowfall, and wind gusts reached 126 km/h. Later in the year, there were two extreme early-season cold episodes in autumn.

In the second week of September, widespread snowfalls occurred in lowland Colorado, including Denver, where a September record high temperature of 38.3 °C had been set only three days earlier on 5 September.
Later, in October, a major cold outbreak brought exceptionally low temperatures and winter precipitation across a broad region of the Rocky Mountains and central states. A damaging ice storm in Oklahoma City saw power outages which lasted for days across more than half the city, while further north, Potomac, Montana reached -33.9 °C on 25 October, the earliest autumn date on which temperatures had fallen below -30 °C at a climate station anywhere in the United States (excluding Alaska).
The extremely wet and warm winter in northern Europe resulted in exceptionally low snow cover in many places ­ Helsinki experienced a record low number of snow-covered days, breaking the previous record by a wide margin ­ but in far northern Europe, where temperatures were above average but still cold enough for snow, the snowpack was exceptionally heavy. At Sodankylä (Finland), the snowpack reached a record depth of 127 cm in mid-April. A cold May led to a delayed melt with some cover persisting into June, while flooding occurred in late May and early June with the spring melt. Rain-on-snow events prevented some reindeer herds from reaching feed.
The 2020 winter was cold in southern South America. Tierra del Fuego had its most significant cold spell since 1995 in late June and early July, with Rio Grande recording a maximum of -8.8 °C and a minimum of -16.5 °C on 1 July. Paraguay saw record minimum temperatures for August in a number of places. Snow cover in Patagonia was the second-most extensive since 2000 and sea ice formed along parts of the Tierra del Fuego coast. Some stock losses were reported. In August, a cold wave in the north of Peru's Amazonia saw temperatures at Caballococha reach 12.8 °C, the lowest temperature recorded there since 1975.
Abnormal low-elevation snowfalls occurred in Tasmania in early August. On 4 August, snow settled to sea level in Launceston in

Electric supply tower in Chubut, Argentina brought down by an intense snowstorm on 22 July the city's most significant snowfall since 1921. Liawenee, in the central highlands, reached -14.2 °C on 7 August, a Tasmanian record low.
Significant cold weather affected parts of eastern Asia in the second half of December. Extremely heavy snow fell in parts of Japan as cold air of Siberian origin crossed the relatively warm waters of the Sea of Japan, with 19 sites, mostly on the Sea of Japan side of Honshu, setting records for 72-hour snowfall. There were major transport disruptions with many people stranded on roads for extended periods.
TROPICAL CYCLONES
The number of tropical cyclones globally was above average in 2020, with 98 named tropical storms in the 2020 northern hemisphere and 2019/2020 southern hemisphere seasons. The North Atlantic region had a very active season, with 30 tropical cyclones; this was more than double the long-term average and

broke the record for a full season set in 2005. Most other basins had cyclone numbers near or slightly below average.
The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index, which integrates cyclone intensity and longevity, was well below average in all basins except the North Atlantic and North Indian Oceans, with the North-West Pacific about 50% below the long-term average. While ACE seasonal values for the North Atlantic were above average, they were well short of seasonal records.
The exceptionally active North Atlantic season resulted in a large number of landfalls. Twelve systems made landfall in the United States, breaking the previous record of nine, and five of those 12 systems made landfall in the state of Louisiana. The most severe impacts of the season in the United States came from Hurricane Laura, which reached category 4 intensity and made landfall on 27 August near Lake Charles in western Louisiana, leading to extensive wind and storm surge damage. Laura was also associated with extensive flood damage in Haiti and the Dominican Republic

in its developing phase. Seventy-seven deaths and US$ 19 billion in economic losses41 were attributed to Laura across the three countries. Later in the season, two major hurricanes made landfall in rapid succession in Central America. Hurricane Eta made landfall as a category 4 system on the east coast of Nicaragua on 3 November, causing severe flooding in the region as it moved slowly across Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Eta moved offshore on 6 November and re-intensified to a tropical storm, making further landfalls in Cuba and the Florida Keys. Hurricane Iota was even stronger, becoming the season's first category 5 system off the Nicaraguan coast on 16 November. Eta and Iota also affected Colombia, and Iota was the first category 5 hurricane ever recorded so close to the Colombian national territory. Other damaging landfalls in the United States included those of Hurricane Isaias in North Carolina in August and Hurricane Sally in Alabama in September, while other parts of the region which experienced significant damage during the season included Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.

Cyclone Amphan, which made landfall on 20 May near the India­Bangladesh border in the eastern Bay of Bengal, was the costliest tropical cyclone on record for the North Indian Ocean, with reported economic losses in India of approximately US$ 14 billion.36 Large-scale evacuations of coastal areas in India and Bangladesh meant that casualties from Amphan were far lower than the number of casualties from previous comparable cyclones in the region. Nevertheless, 129 lives were lost across the two countries. Amphan reached category 5 intensity while over the Bay of Bengal, and although it weakened somewhat before landfall as a category 2 storm, it still led to extensive wind and storm surge damage in the city of Kolkata and surrounds. Later in the season, Cyclone Gati made landfall in north-eastern Somalia on 22 November, the first instance since satellite records began of a cyclone making landfall in Somalia at hurricane intensity.
The South-West Pacific experienced two category 5 cyclones in 2020. The first was Tropical Cyclone Harold, in April. Its most


significant impacts were in the northern islands of Vanuatu, where it made landfall at near peak intensity on 6 April. More than 17 000 homes were damaged or destroyed,42 and about 65% of Vanuatu's population was affected,43 with the city of Luganville among the hardest hit. There was significant damage in Fiji as Harold passed to the south of the main island of Viti Levu, while damage also occurred in Tonga and the Solomon Islands. Thirty deaths were reported along the cyclone's path, most of them when high seas washed passengers overboard from a ferry in the Solomon Islands. In December, Tropical Cyclone Yasa was one of the most intense cyclones ever recorded in the South-West Pacific, with a minimum central pressure of 899 hPa. Widespread damage occurred in Fiji, especially on the second largest island of Vanua Levu.
The strongest tropical cyclone of the season was Typhoon Goni (Rolly).44 It crossed the northern Philippines on 1 November with a 10-minute mean wind speed of 220 km/h (or higher) at its initial landfall, making this one of the most intense landfalls on record. Goni (Rolly) was followed the next week by Typhoon Vamco (Ulysses), which was less intense but caused severe flooding in Manila and other areas. At least 25 deaths were attributed to Goni (Rolly) and 67 to Vamco (Ulysses).45 Two major tropical cyclones hit the Korean Peninsula within a few days in early September, with Typhoon Mayask (Julian) making landfall near Busan on 3 September, followed by Typhoon Haishen (Kristine) on 7 September.
Mayask (Julian) brought 963.5 mm of rainfall over two days to a site on Jeju Island and brought wind gusts to the island of up to 177 km/h. Both tropical cyclones led to significant flooding on the Korean Peninsula and in western Japan, and 41 lives were lost when a ship sank off western Japan during

the passage of Maysak (Julian). Eight tropical cyclones and depressions made landfall in Viet Nam in less than five weeks in October and November, contributing to major flooding in the region.
Other tropical cyclones associated with significant loss of life through flooding were Cyclone Diane in Madagascar in January, and Tropical Storm Amanda in Guatemala and El Salvador in May.
EXTRATROPICAL STORMS
One of the costliest extreme events of the year was a fast-moving line of severe thunderstorms known as a derecho, which moved across the United States Midwest on 10 August, extending from South Dakota to Ohio. Iowa was the worst-affected area, with severe agricultural losses, including an estimated two million hectares of flattened corn and soybean crops. Over 90% of the buildings in the city of Cedar Rapids were damaged. Total losses were estimated at US$ 11 billion. The United States tornado season was below average, with the two most significant outbreaks affecting the Nashville area on 2­3 March and a broad area extending from Texas to Maryland on 12­13 April. Twenty-five lives were lost in the March outbreak and 35 in the April outbreak, with losses of several billion dollars across the two events.46
Severe thunderstorms affected a wide area of eastern Australia during the third week of January. The most significant damage was in Canberra, where hail 5 cm in diameter on 20 January led to extensive vehicle and building damage across a broad swathe of the city. Significant hail damage also occurred in some eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Total losses from the storms were estimated at


US$ 1.1 billion.47 Further major hailstorms affected Queensland on 31 October, with hailstones as large as 14 cm in diameter reported in the suburbs of Brisbane. Other major severe storms included a hailstorm in Calgary (Canada) on 13 June, with insured losses exceeding US$ 1 billion, a squall line which crossed southern Brazil on 30 June, with tornadoes, hail and wind gusts exceeding 100 km/h and 12 associated deaths, and a hailstorm in Tripoli (Libya) on 27 October, with hailstones as large as 20 cm accompanied by unusually cold conditions.
A number of severe extratropical cyclones affected northern, central and western Europe in February, contributing to a very wet month with flooding in some areas.48 The most significant storm of this period was Ciara (also known as Sabine and Elsa), which passed to the north-west of Europe on 10­11 February. Significant wind damage extended from Ireland to Sweden, Poland and Italy. In the autumn, Storm Alex in early

October brought extreme winds to western France, with gusts as high as 186 km/h and heavy rain over a wide area. 3 October was the wettest area-averaged day on record for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with a national average of 31.7 mm, while extreme rainfall occurred near the Mediterranean coast on both sides of the France­Italy border, with 24-hour totals exceeding 600 mm in Italy and 500 mm in France. The extreme rainfall extended to southern Switzerland, where 421 mm fell in 24 hours at Càmedo. Significant flash flooding occurred in all three countries. A Mediterranean cyclone hybrid system (""Medicane""), showing some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and others of a mid-latitude storm, developed in mid-September, making landfall in south-western Greece on 18 September with wind gusts exceeding 110 km/h. Earlier, it brought heavy rainfall and flash flooding to coastal Libya, with a daily rainfall total of 150.5 mm at Sabratha on 15 September.

Climate indicators and sustainable development goals

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart is a set of sustainable development goals (SDGs), which recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth, while tackling climate change and preserving oceans and forests. The achievement of many of these goals is put at risk by climate change, however. For example, rising temperatures are leading to the loss of species and ecosystems, which can reduce agricultural and fishing yields, contributing to food insecurity and affecting livelihoods (SDGs 1, 2, 14 and 15). Extreme weather and climate events can increase health risks, damage infrastructure and lead to water scarcity (SDGs 1, 3, 6, 9 and 11). These threats, together with others, are interrelated with conflict and stability (SDG 16). Uneven distribution of such risks across populations and regions can reinforce or worsen existing inequalities (SDG 10).
Figure 18 demonstrates how rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations lead to cascading effects via six of the other key climate indicators. Beyond posing risks to achieving sustainable development, some of these processes also have the potential to release further

greenhouse gases into the atmosphere in a feedback loop that can perpetuate warming. For example, rising temperatures can thaw permafrost, releasing more carbon into the atmosphere.

Hydromet Developmenta are establishing a Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF).
Complementing the observations of the physical and dynamic properties of the atmosphere, WMO's Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) coordinates atmospheric composition measurements, ensuring that reliable and accurate data are obtained from measurements made by WMO Members, research institutions and/ or agencies and other contributing networks.
Ocean observations of ocean physics, biogeochemistry, biology and ecosystems are coordinated through the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). The GOOS Observations Coordination Group (OCG) monitors the performance of these observationsb and produces an annual Ocean Observing System Report Card. Ocean observations are generally made widely available to international users.
In the terrestrial domain, there is a wider group of observing networks. Hydrological observations are generally operated by NMHSs

and coordinated through WMO. A number of specialized Global Terrestrial Networks (GTNs), for example, on hydrology, permafrost, glaciers, land use, and biomass, also report to GCOS. Data exchange agreements are generally less developed for the terrestrial networks, and many important observations are not made available to international users.
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites/Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CEOS/CGMS) Joint Working Group on Climate (WGClimate) bases the development of satellite observations for climate on the ECV requirements established by GCOS. It has produced an ECV Inventory that includes records for 766 climate data records for 33 ECVs covering 72 separate ECV products, with more planned. Satellite observations have some advantages ­ they have near-global coverage ­ but optical observations can be interrupted by clouds. Used with ground-based observations, either as complementary data sets, or for validation and calibration, they form an invaluable part of the global observing system.

Risks and impacts

The risk of climate-related impacts depends on complex interactions between climate-related hazards and the vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity of human and natural systems. At current levels of global greenhouse gas emissions, the world remains on course to exceed the agreed temperature thresholds of either 1.5 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, which would increase the risks of pervasive climate change impacts beyond what is already seen.
Climate-related events already pose risks to society through impacts on health, food and water security, as well as human security, livelihoods, economies, infrastructure and biodiversity. Climate change also has implications for ecosystem services. It can affect patterns of natural resource use, as well as the distribution of resources across regions and within countries.
Climate change and individual climate-related events have significant environmental repercussions as well. Negative environmental effects include impacts to the land, such as droughts, wildfires in forest and peatland areas, land degradation, sand and dust storms, and desertification. Air pollution is linked to the use of fossil fuels. In freshwater systems, impacts include floods and water stress, and in marine systems, they include sea-level rise, ocean acidification, reduced levels of ocean oxygen, mangrove decay and coral bleaching. Many of these impacts are linked to biodiversity loss. For example, besides the heavy human impacts of the wildfires in Australia in 2019 and early 2020, there was likely a severe loss or displacement of many millions of animals during the disaster.49
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had wideranging impacts on health and well-being, livelihoods, businesses and economies across the world. While countries and communities worldwide responded to the specific risks and

impacts of the pandemic, the risks associated with other hazardous events did not go away. During the course of 2020, countries and communities also prepared for and responded to seasonal and emerging extreme weather events, other natural hazards and outbreaks of diseases taking into account the COVID-19 situation in each country/community and incorporating additional precautions for a safe response to the pandemic. WHO, in collaboration with WMO, issued a WHO health advisory to provide guidance on adapting preparedness and response plans and procedures for cyclones, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and potential outbreaks of other diseases to their COVID-19 strategic preparedness and response plans.50 The WHO advisory reinforces the application of risk-based and whole-of-society approaches as laid out in the WHO Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management Framework,51 the critical roles of stakeholders from community, national and international levels, and the collaboration among hydrometeorological, health and disaster management organizations, as well as the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005).52
HUMAN MOBILITY AND DISPLACEMENT
Climate and weather events had major and diverse impacts on population movements and on the vulnerability of people on the move throughout 2020. In line with previously reported patterns, many of the largest scale displacements were in populous Asian countries. Furthermore, the complexity of human-mobility-related risks and impacts tends to be greatest ­ and least understood due to major limitations with respect to the available data ­ in relation to slow-onset events and in fragile and conflict-affected contexts; knowledge in this area is relevant

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic added a further dimension to human mobility concerns, highlighting the need for an integrated approach to understanding and addressing climate risk and impacts on vulnerable populations.

WEATHER AND CLIMATE-RELATED HAZARDS AND DISASTERS DRIVING NEW DISPLACEMENT

Over the past decade (2010­2019), weather- related events triggered an estimated 23.1 million displacements of people on average each year.53 The overwhelming majority of weather-related displacements take place within national borders, though cross-border movements may also occur. Some 9.8 million displacements, largely due to hydrometeorological hazards and disasters, were recorded during the first half of 2020, mainly concentrated in South and South-East Asia and the Horn of Africa.54 Events in the second half of the year, including displacements linked to flooding across the Sahel region, the active Atlantic hurricane season and typhoon impacts in South-East Asia, are expected to bring the total for the year close to the average for the decade.
In May, Cyclone Amphan hit the Sundarbans region between India and Bangladesh. 2.4 million people were displaced in India, mostly in West Bengal and Odisha, and 2.5 million were displaced in Bangladesh. While many returned relatively soon afterwards, damage to more than 2.8 million homes likely resulted in homelessness and prolonged

displacement for many thousands.77 Many displaced people did not have access to evacuation centres and were compelled to take shelter in tents or in the open air on embankments.78
Monsoon rains led to massive flooding, dam collapses, landslides, and the displacement of millions of people in Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Pakistan,55 Nepal,56 the Republic of Korea,57 Turkey58 and Viet Nam. The floods and landslides in China were particularly intense. 29 000 homes were destroyed, and over 2.2 million people were evacuated by mid-July 2020.59
In July, flooding and landslides affected several districts across Nepal. International Organization for Migration (IOM) assessments in August showed the presence of a total of 5 467 persons from 1 066 households in 29 displacement sites across the country.60 By September, only 12 sites were still active, hosting some 2 000 individuals in three districts, as people returned home with the end of the monsoon season.Dust storm in Polatli, Ankara, 12 September 2020. Source: State of the Climate in Turkey in 53 Data sourced from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre's Global Internal Displacement Philippine Red Cross teams performed rescue operations after debris from Super Typhoon Goni caused the Magnus River to overflow, which resulted in flooding.

In the Philippines, Super Typhoon Goni (locally known as Rolly) displaced 400 000 people when it made landfall across the country on 1 November.62 Two weeks later, Typhoon Vamco triggered a further 320 000 displacements.63 In October 2020, Cyclone Molave, the fourth storm of the month to hit Viet Nam, triggered the evacuation of some 1.3 million people and left hundreds of thousands of people in a critical situation as crops were destroyed.64
2020 also saw some of the largest wildfires on record, which led to significant displacement. The 2020 fire season in the USA resulted in the destruction of at least 2 000 residential buildings in California and displaced some 100 000 people. In Oregon, around 500 000 people were placed under evacuation notice, and more than 40 had to be evacuated from their homes.65 In Australia, around 65 000 new displacements were recorded as a consequence of the fires that affected the country between July 2019 and February 2020. Fires also destroyed 3 100 homes in Australia, potentially leading to longer-term displacement of some 8 100 people.66
PATTERNS OF PROTRACTED, PROLONGED AND REPEATED DISPLACEMENT LINKED WITH HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL HAZARDS
Many displacement situations triggered by hydrometeorological events have become prolonged or protracted for people unable to return to their former homes or without options for integrating locally or settling


elsewhere. While several storms and floods led to damage in Mozambique in 2020, over a year after cyclones Kenneth and Idai hit the country in March and April 2019, tens of thousands of people remain displaced and held back from recovery.67 An assessment conducted in October 2020 identified 93 324 people still displaced in the country's central region (of whom 81 251 were displaced by Idai and 12 073 by the 2020 floods).68 In Cabo Delgado, almost 6 500 internally displaced people were staying in displacement sites.69
Due to the continuing or growing risk in their areas of origin (and return) or settlement, people who have been displaced by hydrometeorological and climatic events may also be subject to repeated and frequent displacement, leaving little time for recovery between one shock and the next. This has implications for disaster preparedness and management and also for supporting solutions to displacement that are sustainable and supporting the resilience of people who might otherwise see their living conditions progressively eroded through repeated disasters and displacement.
COMPOUNDED RISK AND VULNERABILITY
Refugees, internally displaced people and migrants are often among those most vulnerable to climate- and weather-related hazards. Many vulnerable people on the move, regardless of their reasons for moving,

end up settling in high risk areas, where they are exposed to climate and weather hazards at a range of scales. Weather hazards and human mobility may also intersect with social and political tensions and conflict in complex settings and, as such, require the integrated consideration of multi-hazard disaster risk reduction measures, including early warning systems and preparedness, and longer-term sustainable development concerns, such as land use and urban planning.
Specific conditions of risk from hydrometeorological disasters are particularly well documented in the Rohingya refugee sites in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Over the year, a total of 162 275 people were affected, with many requiring specific assistance.70 Without preparedness measures undertaken in the camp areas, including kits for strengthening shelters, building of retaining structures on hillsides, and improving drainage, roads and bridges, these impacts would have been worse.71
In East Africa, floods and the worst desert locust infestation in 25 years resulted in large-scale displacement. In Somalia, floods were associated with the displacement of over one million people in 2020, mostly inside the country, while drought-related impacts induced a further 80 000 displacements.72,73 Around a quarter of the population affected by floods in 2020 consisted of people already living in overcrowded and insecure camps for internally displaced people,74 to which many newly flood-displaced people also moved.67 UNHCR, . html

Farmers whose crops were devastated by desert locusts were also forced to move in search of survival assistance.76
In Ethiopia, over 300 000 displacements, two thirds of which were in the Somali region, were brought on by floods and landslides during the first half of the year.77 IOM assessments between June and July 2020 determined that at least 104 696 people were displaced by floods and 351 062 by droughts in the country's south-east ­ respectively 6% and 19% of the local displaced population.

In Yemen ­ where more than 80% of the total population is in need of humanitarian assistance ­ severe flash floods displaced many who were already internally displaced because of the conflict, living in conditions of abject poverty and in precarious shelters without access to secure alternatives. Some 300 000 people lost their homes, crops, livestock and belongings due to rain and floods. The sudden breaching of the Al-Roone dam affected thousands of people in internally displaced person sites in Al-Tahseen, Souq al-Lill and elsewhere.Sudan experienced flash floods, and rivers, including the Nile, overflowed in August 2020. Some 125 000 refugees and internally displaced people were among those affected.78
Between August and September 2020, extreme rainfall triggered floods that struck several countries in the Sahel. IOM assessments estimated a total of 1.25 million people displaced in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger ­ in contexts already characterized by conflict and food insecurity, as well as forced internal and cross-border population movements. The further degradation of living conditions and livelihoods resulting from the floods increased the risk of displacement within the region, southward to coastal countries and northward to North Africa and Europe.79 Floods in August 2020 in N'Djamena, Chad, resulted in 31 853 individuals fleeing their homes and finding shelter elsewhere in the city, with little relief assistance being provided. Floods also affected the Lac province, displacing over 4 000 people and affecting many more who had previously been displaced by conflict and violence.In Syria, from early October, wildfires in Lattakia, Tartous and Homs affected up to 40 000 people through damage to housing and assets and major loss of livelihoods. Some 25 000 displacements were reported, including from areas with recently returned internally displaced people. The resilience of affected communities has been eroded over 10 years of conflict, as well as by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic crises and the preceding massive uptake of displaced people.82
COMPOUNDED CRISIS IMPACTS ON FOOD SECURITY, DISPLACEMENT, AND HUMANITARIAN ACTION
After decades of decline, the recent increase in food insecurity since 2014 is being driven by conflict and economic slowdown as well as climate variability and extreme weather events. Nearly 690 million people, or 9% of the world population, were undernourished, and about 750 million, or nearly 10%, were exposed to severe levels of food insecurity

in 201983 (Figure 20). The number of people classified under crisis, emergency and famine conditions (Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 or above) had increased to almost 135 million people across 55 countries.84
In 2020, over 50 million people were doubly hit ­ by climate-related disasters (floods, droughts and storms) and by the COVID-19 pandemic.85 Countries in Central America suffered from the triple-impact of Hurricanes Eta and Iota, COVID-19 and pre-existing humanitarian crises. The Government of Honduras estimated that 2.8 million people were affected by Hurricane Eta, and 53 000 hectares of cropland, mainly rice, beans, and sugarcane, were washed away.86 Among the Pacific Islands, Tropical Cyclone Harold affected over 17 500 hectares of cropland in Vanuatu, causing substantial damage just as the growing season began.87 (For more

information about Tropical Cyclone Harold, see Tropical Cyclones.) The long period of dry weather already observed in South America in 2020 is likely to continue as La Niña often brings below-average precipitation to some areas. As a result, corn production in Argentina is forecast to drop by 2 million tons (a 5% decline) in 2020­2021.88
The restrictions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, particularly measures to limit the movement of people within and between countries and the sale and purchase of goods and services, have posed significant challenges for managing the impacts of climate-related disasters on food insecurity. The feasibility of face-to-face services to provide farmers with information from seasonal weather forecasts as guidance on early actions has been reduced in many countries.89 Disruptions to the agriculture sector by COVID-19 have

exacerbated weather impacts along the entire food supply chain, elevating levels of food insecurity, malnutrition and undernourishment.
The largest desert locust outbreak in 25 years in the Greater Horn of Africa and Yemen, triggered by heavy rains, has exacerbated existing conditions of undernourishment, and efforts to combat this outbreak have been disrupted by restrictions on the movement of personnel and disruptions in the supply chain of equipment due to the pandemic. In Ethiopia alone, 200 000 hectares of cropland were damaged, and over 356 000 tons of cereals were lost, leaving almost one million people food insecure.90 By September 2020, data suggested that the number of Somalis facing acute malnutrition (Integrated Food

Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 3 or above) and marginally able to meet minimum food needs tripled to 3.5 million compared to early 2020.91 Desert locusts and river floods were responsible for crop losses within the country, with an estimated reduction in cereal production of 1 525% during the April­June growing season (Figure 21).92
COVID-19 IMPACTS ON HUMANITARIAN ACTION
Mobility restrictions and economic downturns due to COVID-19 have slowed the delivery of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people on the move as well as efforts to support recovery for affected persons, including durable solutions for those displaced. The vulnerabilities of displaced populations, which often live in densely populated settlements, were amplified further.93
Cyclone Harold, which struck Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu and was one of the strongest storms ever recorded in the South Pacific,94 triggered an estimated 99 500 displacements. Because of COVID-19 lockdowns and quarantines, response and recovery operations were hampered leading to delays in providing equipment and assistance.95
Likewise, in the Philippines, the pandemic complicated evacuation and response efforts ahead of Tropical Cyclone Vongfong (Ambo) in mid-May. Over 180 000 people were pre-emptively evacuated,96 though operations were hampered by the need for social distancing measures as residents could not be transported in large numbers and evacuation centres could only be used at half

capacity.97 The storm also damaged Bicol Region's only COVID-19 testing facility.98
In northern Central America, some 5.3 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance, including 560 000 internally displaced people before the onset of the pandemic.99 Responses to storms and cyclones that repeatedly affected the area throughout the Atlantic hurricane season therefore took place in the context of complex, interlinked vulnerabilities linked to pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19-related challenges.
Creating the conditions that enable people's options to safely stay where they are, to leverage the full potential benefits of dignified migration, and to avert, minimize and address displacement and related protection needs is a significant concern for both climate and human mobility policies and cooperation, especially as countries are faced with decisions to expand mobility options that have been constrained throughout the COVID-19 crisis.

Clean energy, disaster-proof infrastructure and early warning systems
Meeting the aim of the 2015 Paris Agreement, ""to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius"",a requires sizeable reductions in carbon emissions. The International Monetary Fund in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook showed that a push in green infrastructure investment combined with steadily rising carbon prices could deliver the emission reductions needed to limit the increase in temperatures and to put the global economy on a more sustainable growth path. Climate change mitigation policies such as emission limits, emission trading programs, feed-in tariffs that provide a guaranteed price for producers of renewable energy, carbon taxes, and research and development subsidies have gradually become more popular over time (Figure 22a). The introduction of environmental policies has been accompanied by increases in global innovation and investment in clean energy technologies (Figure 22b) and has made important contributions to the reallocation of innovation, electricity generation, and employment towards low-carbon activities (Figure 22c-e). A further green infrastructure investment push and subsidies for renewable energy generation, combined with pre-announced gradually increasing carbon prices, would lead to the emissions reductions that are needed to keep temperature increases to safer levels (Figure 22g). In turn, targeted support for poorer households and policies that facilitate job reallocation from high-carbon to low-carbon sectors would ensure a fair transition. The costs of the transition to a low-carbon global economy are manageable with green investment boosting economic activity and employment and thus compensating for some of the costs associated with carbon taxes. While the current global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can make it challenging to enact the policies needed for mitigation, it also presents opportunities to put the economy on a greener path by providing correct price signals and other financial incentives in order to boost investment in green and resilient public infrastructure, thus supporting the national economic output and employment during the recovery phase.
Adaptation policies aimed at enhancing resilience to a changing climate, such as investing in disaster-proof infrastructure and early warning systems, risk sharing through financial markets, and the development of social safety nets, can limit the impact of weather-related shocks and help the economy recover faster (International Monetary Fund, 2017). Adaptation strategies play a key role in countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, such as low-income countries located in hot regions and areas exposed to more frequent or severe natural disaster risks (Figure 23).
CASE STUDY 1: PROTECTING FARMERS IN PAKISTAN FROM THE COMPOUNDED IMPACTS OF SEVERE WEATHER, LOCUSTS AND COVID-19
Floods following heavy monsoon rains in August and September 2020 severely damaged livelihoods, causing the loss of livestock and crops across 20 districts of Sindh province in Pakistan. Concurrently, a desert locust outbreak affected 46 districts across major agricultural provinces, with breeding favoured by the unusual weather conditions. More than a third of the crop area in the region was severely affected, threatening food security and the livelihoods of farming households. COVID-19 further compounded the response to the outbreak. FAO's forecasts and tracking of locust swarms in the region, combined with local situation analysis, helped the Government of Pakistan put effective surveillance and control operations in place. As a result, Pakistan was able to survey 61.4 million hectares and treat 1.13 million hectares of cropland thereafter declared locust free.
CASE STUDY 2: FORECAST-BASED FINANCING AND ANTICIPATORY ACTION IN BANGLADESH
To reduce the impact of severe floods during the 2020 monsoon season in Bangladesh, the World Food Programme (WFP) and its partners used robust early warning data to transfer cash to vulnerable families several days before flood impacts.a Beneficiaries used the funds to buy food and medicine, fortify homesteads, protect critical assets, and transport livestock and vulnerable family members to safety. The aim of this endeavour was to offer more and faster support to help communities prepare and protect themselves before the next disaster. Pre-positioning of finances for these forecast-based actions was possible due to the US$ 140 million ""Anticipatory Humanitarian Action"" project led by the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF).b Based on a weather forecast issued on 4 July 2020, which predicted severe flooding in five vulnerable districts of Bangladesh by mid-month, CERF immediately disbursed its first-ever anticipatory humanitarian funding for flood events. Out of the US$ 5.2 million disbursed in total, WFP used US$ 4.25 million to reach 145 000 people with mobile-phone-based cash transfers four days before water in the Brahmaputra River rose to dangerous levels.c

Atmospheric concentrations of the major greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, continued to increase in 2020 and 2021. The growth rate of all three greenhouse gases in 2020 was above the average for the last decade despite a 5.6% drop in fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2020 due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Global mean temperature in 2021 (January to September) is around 1.08 ±0.13 °C above the 18501900 pre-industrial average and the year is likely to be between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record. 2021 is cooler than recent years owing to La Niña conditions early in the year.
The rate of global sea level rise has increased since satellite altimeter measurements began in 1993, reaching 4.4 mm/yr between 2013 and 2021. Global mean sea level reached a new record high in 2021.
Ocean heat content reached new record highs in 2019 and then 2020, the latest year for which a comprehensive analysis is available. Ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades.
Changes in the global cryosphere in 2021 were consistent with recent multi-decadal trends, with below-normal Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and end-of-summer Arctic sea ice area, negative mass balances on mountain glaciers and the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, and nearnormal Antarctic sea ice cover.
The summer heat wave in western North America took a toll on the region's mountain glaciers, with exceptional mass losses in the Cascade, southern Coast, and Rocky Mountains. Mass loss at some glaciers in southwestern British Columbia was the greatest in the instrumental record (1965-2021).
Greenland experienced an exceptional mid-August melt event which included temperatures above 0 °C and rainfall at Summit Station, the highest point on the ice sheet. This is the first time that rain has been observed at Summit, and marks the third time in the last nine years that the Summit has experienced melting conditions. Ice core records indicate that only one such melt event occurred in the 20th century.
Exceptional heatwaves affected western North America on several occasions during June and July. Lytton, in south-central British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, breaking the previous Canadian national record by 4.6 °C. 569 heat-related deaths were reported in British Columbia alone between 20 June and 29 July.
Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s.
Extreme heat affected the broader Mediterranean region on several occasions during the second half of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The most exceptional heat was in the second week of August. On 11 August, an agrometeorological station near Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C, a provisional European record.
The most significant hurricane of the North Atlantic season was Ida. Ida made landfall in Louisiana on 29 August with sustained 1-minute winds of 240 km/h, the equal-strongest landfall on record for the state, with major wind damage and storm surge inundation. The system continued on a northeast track over land with significant flooding, especially in the New York City area. In total, 72 direct and 43 indirect deaths were attributed to Ida in the United States and Venezuela, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$63.8 billion.

Extreme rainfall hit Henan Province of China from 17 to 21 July. On 20 July, the city of Zhengzhou received 201.9 mm of rainfall in one hour (a Chinese national record), 382 mm in 6 hours, and 720 mm for the event as a whole, more than its annual average. The city experienced extreme flash flooding with many buildings, roads and subways inundated. 302 deaths were attributed to the flooding, and economic losses of US$17.7 billion were reported.
Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July. The worstaffected area was western Germany and eastern Belgium, where 100 to 150 mm fell over a wide area on 14-15 July over wet ground. The highest daily rainfall was 162.4 mm at WipperfürthGardenau (Germany). Numerous rivers experienced extreme flooding, with several towns inundated, and there were also several landslides. 179 deaths were reported in Germany and 36 in Belgium, with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion.

Global Climate Indicators
Global climate indicators1 provide a broad view of climate change at a global scale, encompassing the composition of the atmosphere, energy changes largely caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases, and the response of the land, ocean, and ice. These indicators are closely interrelated. For example, the rise in CO2 and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leads to warming of the atmosphere and ocean. Warming of the ocean leads in turn to rising sea levels, which is added to by the melting of ice on land in response to increasing atmospheric temperatures. The global indicators draw on a wide range of data sets that are listed at the end of the report and show a consistent picture of a warming world.
The connections between global climate indicators and the Sustainable Development Goals were highlighted in ""Climate Indicators and Sustainable Development: Demonstrating the Interconnections""2. The report demonstrates the linkages and feedback loops amongst the key climate indicators as a physical system and the resulting cascading risks to nearly all of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, including those affecting environmental, social, and economic systems. Monitoring the global climate indicators, as well as their related risks and impacts, is therefore of critical importance for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
Baselines
Baselines are fixed periods, usually spanning one or more decades, that are used as a fixed point against which current conditions can be compared. A variety of baselines are used in this report and these are specified in the text and figures where appropriate.
Where possible the WMO climatological standard normal, 1981-2010, is used as a baseline for consistent reporting3. For some indicators however, it is not possible to use this baseline due to a lack of measurement during the whole period or because a longer period is needed to calculate representative statistics.
3 1981-2010 is used in preference to 1991-2020 for consistency with climate reports from WMO members not all of whom have yet transitioned to using the more recent period.

There are two notable exceptions. Firstly, for global mean temperature, a baseline of 1850-1900 is used. This is the baseline used in recent IPCC reports (AR6 WG14, SR155) as a reference period for pre-industrial temperatures and is relevant for understanding progress relative to the long term goal of the Paris Agreement. For more details of how this is calculated see Global Temperature data. Secondly, for greenhouse gases, atmospheric concentrations can be estimated much further back in time, using gas bubbles trapped in ice cores. The year 1750 is used in this report to represent preindustrial greenhouse gas concentrations.
Greenhouse gases
Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance between emissions from human activities, natural sources and sinks in the biosphere and ocean. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities are the major driver of climate change since the mid-20th century. Global average mole fractions of greenhouse gases are calculated from in situ observations made at multiple sites in the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme of WMO and partner networks.
In 2020, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs (Figure 1), with globally averaged surface mole fractions for carbon dioxide (CO2) at 413.2 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm), methane (CH4) at 1889 ± 2 parts per billion (ppb) and nitrous oxide (N2O) at 333.2 ± 0.1 ppb, respectively, 149%, 262% and 123% of pre-industrial (1750) levels. The increase in CO2 from 2019 to 2020 was slightly lower than that observed from 2018 to 2019, but higher than the average annual growth rate over the last decade. This is despite the approximately 5.6% drop in fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2020 due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic6. For CH4 and N2O, the increase from 2019 to 2020 was higher than that observed from 2018 to 2019 and also higher than the average annual growth rate over the last decade.
Real-time data from specific locations, including Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) indicate that levels of CO2, CH4 and N2O continued to increase in 2021.
Atmospheric methane increase is an issue for concern because it is not only a powerful greenhouse gas but it also has, as a precursor of tropospheric ozone, implications for human health, agriculture and ecosystems7. The mean annual increase of CH4 decreased from approximately 12 ppb yr-1 during the late 1980s to near zero between 1999 and 2006. Since 2007, atmospheric CH4 has been increasing, and in 2020 it increased by 11 ppb over 2019 levels. Studies using GAW CH4 measurements indicate that increased CH4 emissions from wetlands in the tropics and from anthropogenic sources at the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere are the likely causes of this recent increase8. These studies also have pointed to the short-term climate benefits and cost-effectiveness of mitigating CH4 emissions. Such mitigation measures were presented in the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) methane assessment7 and address major emitting sectors, namely oil and gas, agriculture and waste management.

Temperature
The global mean temperature for 2021 (based on data from January to September) was 1.08 ± 0.13°C above the 1850-1900 average (Figure 2). Currently, year-to-date averages from all data sets used in the analysis would place 2021 as the 6th (NOAAGlobalTemp) or 7th (all others) warmest year on record globally. However, three months of the year remain, and the ranking is liable to change. It is nevertheless likely that 2021 will be between the 5th and 7th warmest year on record and therefore likely that the most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, will be the seven warmest years on record.
2021 is cooler than recent years due to the influence of a moderate La Niña at the start of the year (see Drivers of short-term variability). La Niña has a temporary cooling effect on the global mean temperature, which is strongest in the year following an event. Aside from the weak La Niña of 2018, the last significant La Niña event was in 2011. 2021 is around 0.18 to 0.26 °C warmer than 2011. As the 2020-21 La Niña has waned, monthly global temperatures have increased. However, conditions have approached La Niña thresholds again as of October. The year 2016, which started during a strong El Niño, remains the warmest year on record in most of the data sets surveyed.

Figure 2: Global annual mean temperature difference from preindustrial conditions (1850­1900) for six global temperature data sets. For details of the datasets and processing see Data sets and methods.
The calculation of global temperature anomalies relative to the 1850-1900 baseline has been updated from previous State of the Global Climate reports. The new method uses the assessment of temperature change and its uncertainties from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) as a foundation for estimating changes since 1850-1900. Details are given in the section on Global Temperature data.
The Paris Agreement9 aims to ""strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by ... Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change"".
Assessments of changes in climatological averages refer to long-term changes, in this case in the global mean temperature, and not to the temperature of a single year. In IPCC AR6 WG1 SPM, longterm change was assessed using a 20-year average. For the period, 2001-2020 the average was estimated10 to be 0.99 [0.84-1.10] °C. The provisional 20-year average for the period 2002-2021, based on the average of the six data sets, was 1.01 ± 0.12 °C above the 1850-1900 average.
Near surface air temperatures for the first nine months of 2021 (Figure 3) were above the 1981-2010 average across a broad swath of North America and Greenland, northern and tropical Africa, the Middle East and southern Asia. Areas with below average temperatures included parts of northern Asia, Australia, southern Africa, northwest North America, and the southern central United States. The imprint of La Niña can clearly be seen in the tropical Pacific. Cooler conditions in southern Africa, India, and eastern Australia are characteristic of La Niña. The cooler-than-average area in northern Asia stands in contrast to 2020 which saw exceptionally high temperatures in the region, this is
partly associated with the different phases of the Arctic Oscillation in early 2020 (strongly positive) and early 2021 (strongly negative, see the section on AO Arctic Oscillation).

Ocean
Most of the excess energy that accumulates in the Earth system due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is taken up by the ocean. The added energy warms the ocean, and the consequent thermal expansion of the water leads to sea level rise, which is added to by melting land ice. The surface layers of the ocean have warmed more rapidly than the interior, which can be seen in the rise of global mean sea-surface temperature and also in the increased incidence of marine heatwaves. As the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases, so too does the concentration of CO2 in the ocean. This affects ocean chemistry, lowering the average pH of the water, a process known as ocean acidification. All these changes have a broad range of impacts in the ocean and coastal areas. Note that with reporting delays, the most recent data for some of these indicators are from 2020. Ocean heat content Increasing human emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases cause a positive radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere ­ the Earth Energy Imbalance (EEI) ­ leading to an accumulation of energy in the form of heat in the Earth system which is driving global warming11,12,13. Around 90% of this accumulated heat in the Earth system is stored in the ocean, which is measured through Ocean Heat Content (OHC). A positive EEI signals that the Earth's climate system is still responding to the current forcing14 and that more warming will occur even if the forcing does not increase further15. This in turn is reflected in a continued increase of ocean heat content. IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 (WG1) concluded that it is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean
and land, and that it is extremely likely that human influence was the main driver of the ocean heat increase observed since the 1970s16. Historical measurements of subsurface temperature back to the 1940s mostly rely on shipboard measurement systems, which constrains the availability of subsurface temperature observations at a global scale and at depth17. With the deployment of the Argo network of autonomous profiling floats, which first achieved near-global coverage in 2006, it is now possible to routinely measure OHC changes down to a depth of 2000m18,19. Various research groups have developed estimates of global OHC, and all results show continued ocean warming (Figure 4). Differences between the estimates at annual to decadal scale arise from the various statistical treatments of data gaps, the choice of climatology and the approach used to account for instrumental biases20,21. A concerted effort has been established to provide an international view on the global evolution of ocean warming22 up to the year 2020. The upper 2000m depth of the ocean continued to warm in 2019 reaching a new record high, and it is expected that it will continue to warm in the future23,24. A preliminary analysis based on seven global data sets suggests that 2020 exceeded that record (Figure 4). All data sets agree that ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. Figure 4: 1960-2020 ensemble mean time series and ensemble standard deviation (2-standard deviations, shaded) of global ocean heat content (OHC) anomalies relative to the 2005-2017 average for the 0-300m (grey), 0-700m (blue), 0-2000m (yellow) and 700-2000m depth layer (green). The ensemble mean is an outcome of a concerted international effort, and all products used are listed in von Schuckmann et al., 2020. Note that values are given for the ocean surface area between 60°S-60°N, and limited to the 300m bathymetry of each product. Updated from von Schuckmann et al. (2020). The ensemble mean OHC (0-2000m) anomaly (relative to the 1993-2020 average) has been added as a cross, together with its ensemble spread, and is based on the 7 products listed in Ocean heat content data.
Sea level Global mean sea level (GMSL) is one of the key global climate indicators. It integrates changes occurring in many components of the climate system; on interannual to multidecadal time scales, GMSL changes result from ocean warming via thermal expansion of sea water, melting of land ice and exchange of water with water bodies on land. Measured since the early 1990s by high precision altimeter satellites, the mean GMSL rate was 2.1 mm yr-1 between 1993 and 2002 and 4.4 mm yr-1 between 2013 and 2021, an increase by a factor of 2 between the periods, mostly due to the accelerated loss of ice mass from the ice sheets26. In 2021, GMSL reached a new record high. Compared to previous El Niño and La Niña years (e.g., in 1997-1998, 2010-2011, 2015-2016), during which the GMSL displayed temporary positive or negative anomalies of several millimetres, 2021 was marked by an increase of the GMSL that was close to the long-term trend (Figure 5).

The coloured straight lines represent the average linear trend over 3 successive time spans (January 1993-December 2002; January 2003-December 2012; January 2013-September 2021).

Although sea level has risen almost everywhere since 1993, sea level has not risen equally everywhere. Regional patterns of sea level change are dominated by local changes in ocean heat content and salinity. Several regions continue to be affected by a rate of sea level rise substantially faster than the global mean (see Figure 6, which shows the difference between local and global sea level). This is particularly the case in the western tropical Pacific east of the Philippines and New Guinea, the southwest Pacific east of Australia and New Zealand, the north Pacific, the southwest Indian ocean east of Madagascar, and the south Atlantic. In other regions, local sea level has risen more slowly than the global mean e.g., around Greenland and south of Iceland, and in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. The patterns of trends in sea level have only varied a little over the last 30 years of the altimetry era, and changes from one year to another are small.

Marine heatwaves and cold spells In analogy with heatwaves and cold spells on land, Marine Heat Waves (MHW) and Marine Cold Spells (MCS) are prolonged periods of extreme heat or cold that affect the near-surface layer of the ocean. They can have a range of consequences for marine life and dependent communities27 and MHWs have become more frequent over the 20th Century. Satellite retrievals of sea-surface temperature are used to monitor MHWs and MCSs, categorized here as moderate, strong, severe, or extreme (for definitions, seeMarine heatwave and marine cold spell data). Much of the ocean experienced at least one `strong' MHW at some point in 2021 (to 14 October, Figure 7). MHWs were conspicuously absent in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean ­ linked to below average sea-surface temperatures associated with La Niña ­ and much of the Southern Ocean ­ one of the few areas in which MCSs are increasing in duration. The Laptev and Beaufort Seas experienced ""severe"" and ""extreme"" MHWs from January to April 2021. In 2021, almost all MCSs were 'moderate', except in areas of high variability such as the poleward extension of the Gulf Stream. The eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean experienced almost no MHWs in 2021 and was one of the few non-polar regions of the global ocean to see broad MCS coverage. MHWs in 2021 (to 14 October) showed an average daily coverage of 13%, which is less than the record of 17% in 2016 and 16% in 2020. Nearly 25% of MHWs were classified as `strong', another 25% as `moderate', and 55% of the ocean surface experienced at least one MHW during 2021 (Figure 7c) ­ less than the record of 65% in 2016 and 63% in 2020. The average daily coverage of the global ocean by MCSs in 2021 (to 14 October) was 3% (Figure 8b) ­ a lower value than the record high in 1982 (7%) and less than 2020 (4%). MCSs in 2021 were predominantly classified as `moderate' (17%) and `strong' (3%). In total, 22% of the ocean surface experienced at least one MCS during 2021 (Figure 8c), which is lower than 2020 (25%) and 1985 (63%).

Ocean acidification The ocean absorbs around 23% of the annual emissions of anthropogenic CO2 to the atmosphere28,29, while this slows the rise of atmospheric concentration of CO230 and the related warming, the costs to the ocean are high. CO2 reacts with seawater and reduces the pH of the ocean31, a process known as ocean acidification. The current global rate of ocean acidification (Figure 9) exceeds, by at least an order of magnitude, the rates inferred for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which occurred around 56 million years ago and was associated with large perturbations of the global carbon cycle32. The IPCC AR6 concluded that ""there is very high confidence that open ocean surface pH is now the lowest it has been for at least 26 kyr and current rates of pH change are unprecedented since at least that time"". As the pH of the ocean decreases, its capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere also declines33.
Ocean acidification threatens organisms and ecosystem services, and hence food security, tourism and coastal protection. Local and regional acidification is of great relevance to marine organisms and
biological processes. However, there is high variability in coastal areas due to a range of factors affecting CO2 levels.
National datasets of ocean acidification observations submitted towards the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.3 and the associated SDG Indicator 14.3.1 (""Average marine acidity (pH) measured at agreed suite of representative sampling stations"",
Figure 10) highlight the need for sustained, repeated observation and measurement of ocean acidification along the coastlines and in the open ocean to improve understanding of its consequences, enable modelling and predictions of change and variability. While there are currently still gaps in the global coverage, capacity building efforts increase the capability of many nations to measure, manage and report ocean acidification data, as confirmed by the growing number of countries participating in data collection towards the SDG Indicator 14.3.1.

Cryosphere
The cryosphere comprises the frozen parts of the earth. This includes sea ice, glaciers, ice sheets, snow, and permafrost, all of which are covered in this report. Note that with reporting delays, the most recent data for some of these indicators are from 2020.
Sea ice Arctic sea ice The 2020-2021 Arctic winter saw anomalously high sea-level pressure over the central Arctic Ocean. The resulting anticyclonic wind pattern drove thicker multiyear ice into the Beaufort Sea34. The maximum Arctic sea-ice extent for the year was reached35 on 21 March, at 14.8 million km2. March 2021 was the 9th or 10th lowest extent on record (1979-2021), depending on the data source. For more details on the data sets used, see Sea ice.
Melt rates were close to the 1981-2010 average early in the melt season. However, sea-ice extent decreased very rapidly in June and early July in the Laptev Sea and East Greenland Sea regions. As a result, the Arctic-wide sea-ice extent was record low in the first half of July. The monthly July average was the 2nd to 4th lowest on record (tied with 2012 and 2019), with strong regional contrasts36 (Figure 12). More ice than normal (1981-2010) was found in the Beaufort and ChukchiSeas, but the Siberian and European sectors (Laptev Sea and East Greenland Sea) had much less sea ice than normal. One exception was the Eastern Kara Sea, where some sea ice persisted for the whole season. Conditions shifted rapidly after July, with a sustained period of colder weather across the Arctic Ocean. This slowed the sea-ice melt and August 2021 ended-up with the 10th lowest extent on record, possibly also related to thicker multiyear ice in the Beaufort Sea that resisted melting. Assisted by the August slowdown in melt, the minimum September extent was greater than in recent years but still well below the 1981-2010 average, representing the 12th lowest minimum ice extent in the 43-year satellite record (Figure 11). The 2021 minimum extent was observed37 on 16 September at 4.72 million km2 while the mean September ice extent was 4.92 million km2, significantly below the 1981-2010 average. Sea-ice extent in the East Greenland Sea was a record low by a large margin.

Antarctic sea ice Sea-ice extent across the Southern Ocean during the first 9 months of 2021 was generally below the 1981­2010 mean, with a relatively low February minimum but near- average conditions during the summer melt season. There was an exceptionally early maximum ice extent at the end of August.
The minimum in the 2021 annual cycle occurred on 19 February, when sea ice covered 2.60 million km2, the 15th lowest extent in the record (1979-present). The extent of ice at the annual minima began to increase in magnitude in the early 1990s, reaching a maximum of 3.68 million km2 in 2013, before dropping sharply to 2.08 million km2 in 2017, the lowest ice extent in the record. Since then, the extents at the annual minima have increased slowly. In February, most Antarctic sea ice is found in the Weddell Sea and therefore the sea-ice extents at the annual minima reflect regional changes in that area.
Antarctic sea ice reached its maximum annual extent of 18.80 million km2 on 30 August 2021. This was close to the average magnitude in terms of extent and the 22nd largest in the 43 years of data. However, this was the 2nd earliest maximum, with only one other maximum having occurred in August (that of 2016). During July and August both the Amundsen Sea Low to the west of the Antarctic Peninsula and the Lazarev Sea Low close to the Greenwich Meridian were deeper than normal, leading to stronger than average offshore flow that led to positive sea ice anomalies in the Amundsen and Ross Seas, and between the northeast Weddell 
Glaciers Glaciers are formed from snow that has compacted to form ice, which can deform and flow downhill to lower and warmer altitudes where it melts. If the glacier terminates in a lake or the ocean, ice loss also occurs through melting where ice and water meet or by calving of the glacier front to form icebergs. Glaciers are sensitive to changes in temperature, precipitation, and sunlight, as well as other factors such as changes in basal lubrication, warming ocean waters, or the loss of buttressing ice shelves.
Over the period 2000-2019, global glaciers and ice caps (excluding the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets) experienced38 an average mass loss of 267 ± 16 Gt yr-1. Mass loss increased to 298 ± 24 Gt yr1 from 2015-2019. Glaciers in several mid-latitude regions thinned at more than double the global average (0.52 ± 0.03 m yr-1) from 2015-2019, e.g., -1.52 m yr-1 in New Zealand, -1.24 m yr-1 in Alaska, -1.11 m yr-1 in Central Europe, and -1.05 m yr-1 in western North America (not including Alaska).
According to the World Glacier Monitoring Service, in the hydrological year 2019-2020, the 40 or so glaciers with long-term observations experienced an average mass balance of -0.98 m water equivalent (m w.e39. Figure 13), less than in the record years 2018 and 2019, but still ranking as the 5th most negative mass balance year on record, for the period 1950-2020. Despite the global pandemic, mass balance observations were collected for most glacier monitoring sites worldwide, although some data gaps will be inevitable. Preliminary results for 2021 are only available for a few selected regions at this time, including for southwestern Canada and the Swiss Alps.

Exceptional Glacier Mass Loss in Western Canada: Mass loss from North American glaciers accelerated over the last two decades. Glacier mass loss in western North America increased from 53 ± 13 Gt yr-1 for the period 2000-2004 to 100 ± 17 Gt yr-1 for 2015-201938. An exceptionally warm, dry summer in 2021 (see Heatwaves and wildfires) exacerbated mass loss for most glaciers in southern British Columbia, Alberta and the US Pacific Northwest. In the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Place and Helm glaciers lost more mass during the period 2020-2021 than in any year since measurements began in 1965 (Figure 14a). In the Canadian Rocky Mountains, mass loss from Peyto Glacier was the second greatest since 1965, after the strong El Niño year of 1998 (Figure 14b). Repeat LiDAR surveys40 indicate mass balances of -2.66, -3.30, and -1.95 m w.e. on Place, Helm, and Peyto glaciers, respectively. This represents roughly twice the mean regional rate of thinning from 2015-2019. Little snow remained on most of the mountain glaciers in this region by mid-August, and many of these glaciers have lost their firn zone, where multi-year snow undergoes the transformation from snow to glacial ice. Particulate deposition ­ including soot and ash ­ from extensive regional wildfire activity in summer 2021 meant that the surfaces of the glaciers were unusually dark in July and August and absorbed more sunlight than usual, contributing to the extreme mass loss. Kokanee Glacier, British Columbia, lost 5-6% of its total volume in 2021, while Columbia Icefield, the largest icefield in the Rocky Mountains (210 km2), lost about 0.34 Gt of ice (Figure 14c).

Reduced Glacier Melt Rates in the Swiss Alps: Glaciers in the Swiss Alps suffered significantly less ice loss than in the previous years due to substantial snow in winter and a cool and rainy summer season. Nevertheless, in 2021 none of the monitored glaciers showed mass gain, and ice losses averaged around 0.5 m w.e., corresponding to a reduction of glacier ice volume in Switzerland of 0.8%.
Ice sheets Ice sheets are expanses of glacial ice that cover an area larger than 50 000 km2. In the current climate, there are two ice sheets, found on Greenland and Antarctica.
Greenland ice sheet Changes in the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet reflect the combined effects of: surface mass balance, defined as the difference between snowfall and meltwater runoff from the ice sheet; the marine mass balance, which is the sum of mass losses at the periphery from the calving of icebergs and the melting of glacier tongues on contact with the ocean; and the basal mass balance,

which consists of basal melting due to geothermal heat, frictional heat generated by sliding at the base of the glacier and by deformation of the ice. For Greenland41, the total mass balance in 2020-2021 (1 September 2020 ­ 31 August 2021) was 166 Gt, which is close to the average for the period 1987-2021. This was the 25th year in a row with a negative mass balance. Over the period September 1986 to August 2021, for which we have daily data, the Greenland Ice Sheet lost a total of 5 511 Gt of ice. Cumulative mass loss was 4 261 Gt from April 2002 to June 2021, the period covered by observations from the GRACE satellites. The GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites can measure changes in the amount of ice using the minute variations they cause in the gravitational field. This provides an independent measure of the total mass balance. Based on this data, the Greenland ice sheet for the same period as above (April 2002 to June 2021) has lost about 4 473 Gt. This ice loss contributed to a sea level rise of about 1.2 cm. The surface mass balance for the 2020-2021 mass balance season in Greenland was +357 Gt, which is slightly above the 35-year average 1986-2020 of +326 Gt. However, estimated ice loss due to iceberg calving and glacier tongue melting, the marine mass balance, of -500 Gt, was the highest of the period. The basal mass balance is small (~ -23 Gt) and does not show an obvious trend. The Greenland surface mass balance record is now three and a half decades long and, although it varies considerably from one year to another, there has been an overall decline in the average surface mass balance and total mass balance over time. Greenland Ice Sheet melt extent was close to the long-term average through the early summer, but temperatures and meltwater runoff were well above normal in late July and August 2021 (Figure 16), the latter event was associated with a major incursion of warm, humid air in mid-August. This air mass moved in from Baffin Bay and covered much of southwestern and central Greenland. On August 14, rain was observed for several hours at Summit Station, the highest point on the Greenland Ice Sheet (3 216 m), and air temperatures remained above freezing for about nine hours42. There is no previous report of rainfall at Summit, and this is the latest date in the year that above-freezing temperatures have been recorded at this location. Melt events at Summit were also observed in 1995, 2012, and 2019. Ice core records indicate that prior to 1995, the last time melting occurred at Summit was in the late 1800s.

The summer 2021 melt season in Antarctica was moderate and was below average for 1990-2020 (Figure 17)44. The northern Filchner Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea experienced a strong but brief melt event in mid-December 2020. The summer melt season in Antarctica concluded in mid-February 2021. The strongest positive melt anomalies of the year were over the remnant Larsen B and C ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula; most other locations experienced near-normal melt extent relative to the mean 1990-2020 conditions. Despite near-normal surface melting in Antarctica in summer 2021, GRACE-FO satellite gravity data indicate that the Antarctic Ice Sheet continued to lose mass in early 2021 (Figure 18), associated with calving and marine ice sheet melting in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica. Antarctic Ice Sheet mass loss since 2010 is largely driven by thinning and grounding-line retreat of Thwaites Glacier, triggered by ocean warming in this sector of the ice sheet45.
Permafrost Permafrost occurs beneath about one eighth of Earth's exposed land area. It is ground that remains at or below 0 °C for at least two consecutive years. Permafrost thaw can lead to landscape instability and other impacts, including the emission of greenhouse gases from previously frozen organic material. As permafrost temperature approaches 0 °C, changes in temperature in the ice-rich ground are subdued due to the phase change between ice and water. While temperature increase may level off near 0 °C for several years or decades due to the aforementioned phase change, the impacts of permafrost warming and thaw on ground stability including subsidence and mass movements, hydrology, ecosystems, and infrastructure are often clearly visible (Figure 20).

In the foreground, large amounts of material have pushed into the river to form a debris tongue. Foothills of the Mackenzie Mountains south of Norman Wells, north-western Canada.

Since the 1990s, the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) has compiled data sets of Permafrost Temperatures (temperature measured in boreholes) and Active Layer Thickness (the maximum thickness of the seasonally thawed layer above the permafrost). GTN-P products rely mostly on research projects to sustain activities. Long-term data series from national and regional networks operating in mountain and polar areas show a continuation of past warming trends up to 2020, the most recent data available.
Stratospheric ozone
Following the success of the Montreal Protocol, use of halons and CFCs has been reported as discontinued but their levels in the atmosphere continue to be monitored. Because of their long lifetime, these compounds will remain in the atmosphere for many decades and even if there were no new emissions, there is still more than enough chlorine and bromine present to cause complete destruction of ozone in Antarctica from August to December. As a result, the formation of the Antarctic ozone hole continues to be an annual spring event with year-to-year variation in its size and depth governed to a large degree by meteorological conditions. The 2021 ozone hole developed relatively early and continued growing, resulting in a large and deep ozone hole. It expanded to 24 million km2 on 24 September and remains close to this value as of mid-October 2021. The development of the hole, its extent and severity are close to that for the 2020 and 2018 seasons. The ozone hole reached its maximum area of 24.8 million km2 on 7 October 2021 similar to the areas in 2020 and 2018 and close to the highest values observed in earlier years such as 28.2 million km2 in 2015 and 29.6 million km2 in 2006 according to an analysis from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Figure 21a). NASA reported a minimum

ozone of 92 DU (Dobson Units) on 7 October 2021 which is the lowest value in the past 17 years (see Figure 21b). Since the end of September 2021, the concentration of stratospheric ozone was persistently reduced to near-zero values between 15 and 20 km altitude over Antarctica. Together with the season of 2020 these are some of the lowest ever ozone values measured via sondes at the Antarctic stations as reported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The lowest total column value of 92 DU was reached on 7 October 2021. The unusually deep and large ozone hole this year is driven by a strong and stable polar vortex and very low temperatures in the stratosphere.

The most recent years are shown for comparison as indicated by the legend. The smooth, thick grey line is the 1979­2020 average. The blue shaded area represents the 10th to 90th percentiles, and the green shaded area represents the 30th and 70th percentiles for the period 1979­2020. The thin black lines show the maximum and minimum values for each day in the 1979­2020 period. The plot is made at WMO on the basis of data downloaded from the NASA Ozone Watch (). The NASA data are based on satellite observations from the OMI and TOMS instruments.
Drivers of short-term variability
There are many different natural phenomena, often referred to as climate patterns or climate modes, that affect weather at timescales ranging from days to several months. Surface temperatures change relatively slowly over the ocean, so recurring patterns in sea surface temperature can be used to understand and, in some cases, predict the more rapidly changing patterns of weather over land on seasonal time scales. Similarly, albeit at a faster rate, known pressure changes in the atmosphere can help explain certain regional weather patterns. In 2021, the El Niño­Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) each contributed to major weather and climate events in different parts of the world and are described in further detail below. ENSO El Niño Southern Oscillation ENSO is one of the most important drivers of year-to-year variability in weather patterns worldwide. It is linked to hazards such as heavy rains, floods, and drought. El Niño, characterised by higher-thanaverage sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific and a weakening of the trade winds, typically has a warming influence on global temperatures. La Niña, which is characterised by belowaverage sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific and a strengthening of the trade winds, has the opposite effect. La Niña conditions emerged in mid-2020 and peaked in the October­December period at moderate strength, with average sea surface temperatures 1.3 °C below the 1991­2020 normal. The La Niña

weakened through the first half of 2021, reaching an ENSO-neutral state (temperatures within 0.5 °C of normal) in May, according to both oceanic and atmospheric indicators. However, sea surface temperatures cooled after mid-year, approaching La Niña thresholds once again by October.
In addition to having a temporary cooling influence on Earth's global temperature, La Niña is associated with drier-than-normal conditions in east Africa; most of Kenya, Ethiopia, and Somalia experienced consecutive below-average rainfall seasons in late 2020 and early 2021, leading to drought in the region. In early 2021, precipitation was higher than normal over the Maritime Continent49 and lower than normal in Patagonia at the beginning of the year, typical patterns associated with La Niña. Additionally, La Niña conditions can contribute to above-average hurricane activity in the North Atlantic, which has experienced 20 named tropical cyclones during its 2021 hurricane season to date (the 1981­2010 average for the entire season is 14), following a recordbreaking season in 2020 (28 storms, also associated with La Niña).
AO Arctic Oscillation The AO is a large-scale atmospheric pattern that influences weather throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The positive phase is characterised by lower-than-average air pressure over the Arctic and higher-than-average pressure over the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The jet stream is parallel to the lines of latitude and farther north than average, locking up cold Arctic air, and storms can be shifted northward of their usual paths. The mid-latitudes of North America, Europe, Siberia, and East Asia generally see fewer cold air outbreaks than usual during the positive phase of the AO. A negative AO has the opposite effect, associated with a more meandering jet stream and cold air spilling south into the mid-latitudes where the jet stream dips southward.

Dec Jan Feb
Figure 22: Arctic Oscillation monthly index values for Northern Hemisphere winter months, December in blue, January in orange and February in grey (Source: NOAA Climate Prediction Center).
The AO was negative during the Northern Hemisphere 2020-21 winter and, seasonally, was the most negative on record since winter 2009-10. The jet stream swept down over North America, contributing to its coldest February for the continent since 1994. However, the same wavy jet stream also contributed to extreme warmth in parts of northern and eastern Asia in February as it surged northward over the area, with regions in Mongolia, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea reporting record-high temperatures for this time of year. The contrast between the positive AO and the negative AO (winter 2020-21) could explain some of the differences between temperature patterns in the first quarters of 2020 and 2021. The negative winter phase of the Arctic Oscillation has also been linked to more moderate Arctic sea ice loss the following summer50 (see Arctic sea ice). The minimum extent for 2021, reached on 16 September, was the 12th lowest extent on record and the highest minimum since 2014.
High impact events in 2021
Although understanding broad-scale changes in the climate is important, the most acute impacts of weather and climate are often felt during extreme meteorological events such as heavy rain and snow, droughts, heatwaves, cold waves, and storms, including tropical storms and cyclones. These can lead to or exacerbate other high-impact events such as flooding, landslides, wildfires, and avalanches. This section is based largely on inputs from WMO Members. The risks and impacts associated with these events are described in Risks and impacts.
Heatwaves and wildfires
Exceptional heatwaves affected western North America on several occasions during June and July. By some measures, the most extreme was in late June in the north-western United States and western Canada. Lytton, in south-central British Columbia, reached 49.6 °C on 29 June, breaking the previous Canadian national record by 4.6 °C, with temperatures reaching the mid-40s as far west as eastern suburbs of Vancouver and in the interior of Vancouver Island. It was also more than 5 °C higher than the previous highest known temperature north of 50 °N. 569 heat-related deaths were reported in British Columbia alone between 20 June and 29 July51. Many long-term stations broke records by 4 to 6 °C, including Portland, Oregon (46.7 °C). There were also multiple heatwaves in the southwestern United States. Death Valley, California reached 54.4 °C on 9 July, equalling a similar 2020 value as the highest recorded in the world since at least the 1930s. It went on to be the hottest summer on record averaged over the continental United States.
There were numerous major wildfires during and after the heatwaves (including one which largely destroyed the town of Lytton the day after its record temperature). The Dixie fire in northern California, which started on 13 July, had burned about 390,000 hectares by 7 October, the largest single fire on record in California. However, the overall area burned for the season52 in the United States was slightly below average53.
Extreme heat affected the broader Mediterranean region on several occasions during the second half of the Northern Hemisphere summer. The most exceptional heat was in the second week of August. On 11 August, an agro-meteorological station near Syracuse in Sicily reached 48.8 °C, a provisional European record, while Kairouan (Tunisia) reached a record 50.3 °C. Montoro (47.4 °C) set a national record for Spain on 14 August, while on the same day Madrid (Barajas Airport) had its hottest day on record with 42.7 °C. Earlier, on 20 July, Cizre (49.1 °C) set a Turkish national record and Tbilisi (Georgia) had its hottest day on record (40.6 °C). Major wildfires occurred across many parts of the region with Algeria, southern Turkey and Greece especially badly affected. Over 40
deaths occurred in the Algerian fires. Other countries which experienced significant wildfires during the period included France, Italy, North Macedonia, Lebanon, Israel, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco.
June was exceptionally warm through many parts of eastern Europe. National June records were set for Estonia (34.6 °C) and Belarus (37.1 °C), whilst locations which had their hottest June day on record included St. Petersburg (35.9 °C) and Moscow (34.8 °C), both on 23 June, Yerevan (Armenia, 41.1 °C) on the 24th, and Baku (Azerbaijan, 40.5 °C) on the 26th. Tampere in Finland reported its highest temperature on record (33.2 °C) on 22 June. Libya also saw a prolonged heatwave in late June. Later in the summer, abnormal warmth also reached northwest Europe; 31.3 °C at Castlederg on 21 July was a record for Northern Ireland.
For the third successive year, there were major wildfires during the summer in Siberia, particularly in the Sakha Republic around Yakutsk. Fire activity in the Amazon region during the August-September peak season was less than in 2019 or 202054, but there was extensive fire activity in other parts of Brazil including the Pantanal. The Australian wildfire season in 2020-21 was also relatively inactive after a very severe season in 2019-20.
Cold spells and snow
Abnormally cold conditions affected many parts of the central United States and northern Mexico in mid-February. The most severe impacts were in Texas, which generally experienced its lowest temperatures since at least 1989, with temperatures in some areas staying below freezing continuously for 6 to 9 days, setting records in locations including Austin and Waco. On 16 February, Oklahoma City reached -25.6 °C and Dallas -18.9 °C, their lowest temperatures since 1899 and 1949 respectively. Electricity transmission was severely disrupted, with power outages affecting nearly 10 million people at the event's peak, while frozen pipes were another major cause of damage. 172 deaths were reported in the United States along with over $20 billion in economic losses, making it the most costly winter storm on record for the United States55.
It was a cold winter in many parts of northern Asia. The Russian Federation had its coldest winter since 2009-10. Below-average temperatures affected much of Japan in late December and early January, with heavy snowfalls on a number of occasions, and a number of locations on the Sea of Japan coast of Honshu having their heaviest 72-hour snowfall on record in early January. Much of China was also cold during this period, with Beijing reaching -19.6 °C on 7 January, its lowest temperature since 1966.
A severe snowstorm hit many parts of Spain from 7 to 10 January, followed by a week of freezing air temperatures. A total of 53 cm of snow fell at the central city location of Retiro, and heavy falls were also reported in many other parts of Spain56. Some locations, including Toledo (-13.4 °C) and Teruel (-21.0 °C), had their lowest temperatures on record on 12 January in the wake of the storm. There were major disruptions to land and air transport. Later in the winter, in the second week of February, the Netherlands experienced its most significant snowstorm since 2010 with heavy snow also falling in Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom; in the wake of the storm, Braemar recorded -23.0 °C on 12 February, the lowest temperature in the United Kingdom since 1995. In southeast Europe, Athens had its heaviest snow since 2009 on 15 February.
An abnormal spring cold outbreak affected many parts of Europe in early April. Record low April temperatures in France included -7.4 °C at Saint-Etienne on the 8th and -6.9 °C at Beauvais on the

6th, while Belgrade (Serbia) had its heaviest April snowfall on record on the 7th. At high elevations, national records for April were set for Switzerland (-26.3 °C at Jungfraujoch) and Slovenia (-20.6 °C at Nova vas na Blokah). This followed a very warm end to March with France having its warmest March day on record on the 31st. Frost damage to agriculture was widespread and severe, with losses to vineyards and other crops in France alone exceeding US$4.6 billion57. The United Kingdom went on to have its lowest monthly mean temperature for April since 1922.
Precipitation
Compared to temperature, precipitation is characterized by higher spatial and temporal variability. Large regions with above normal (1951-2000) precipitation totals from January till September were Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, the Maritime Continent, areas of northern South America and south-eastern North America (Figure 24). Large regions with a rainfall deficit included southwest Asia and the Middle East, parts of southern Africa, southern South America and central North America. La Niña events are often ­ but not always ­ characterised by shifting patterns of rainfall. In some regions the pattern of precipitation anomalies were typical of those associated with La Niña conditions at the beginning of the year: wetter than average conditions over the Maritime Continent and drier than usual conditions in Patagonia. However, in Australia, where La Niña is typically associated with above-normal rainfall, precipitation anomalies were relatively weak. The onset of the African Monsoon was delayed. Later in the season, rainfall totals were higher than normal, especially in the western monsoon region. In total, the seasonal rainfall was close to normal. In Southern Africa, in an area centred on Zambia, rainfall amounts during the wet season until May were below the long-term mean. It was at least the second year in a row with below normal rainfall for Madagascar; rainfall totals have been below average in most years since 2011. In addition, the April-May wet season was drier than usual in the Greater Horn of Africa region. Over North America, above average rainfall totals were observed in Alaska and the north of Canada, and in the southeast of the United States and parts of the Caribbean. Between these two wetterthan-average bands was a swath of unusually dry conditions extending across the width of the continent. Unusually high precipitation amounts, relative to the chosen climatology period (1951-2010), were recorded in the southwest and southeast of Australia. On the other hand, abnormally low precipitation amounts were received on the North Island of New Zealand. Unusually low precipitation amounts fell around the Mediterranean Sea, while unusually high totals were detected around the Black Sea and in parts of Eastern Europe.

Flood
Extreme rainfall, to which moisture ahead of Typhoon In-fa contributed, hit Henan Province of China from 17 to 21 July. The most severely affected area was around the city of Zhengzhou, which on 20 July received 201.9 mm of rainfall in one hour (a Chinese national record), 382 mm in 6 hours, and 720 mm for the event as a whole, more than its annual average. The city experienced extreme flash flooding with many buildings, roads and subways inundated. 302 deaths were attributed to the flooding, and economic losses of US$17.7 billion were reported58.
Western Europe experienced some of its most severe flooding on record in mid-July. The worst-affected area was western Germany and eastern Belgium, where 100 to 150 mm fell over a wide area on 14-15 July over ground which was already unusually wet after high recent rainfall. The highest daily rainfall was 162.4 mm at Wipperfürth-Gardenau (Germany). Numerous rivers experienced extreme flooding, with several towns inundated, and there were also several landslides. France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and Switzerland also experienced significant flooding. 179 deaths were reported in Germany and 36 in Belgium, with economic losses in Germany exceeding US$20 billion59.
Persistent heavy rainfall in mid-March resulted in major flooding in eastern New South Wales in Australia60. The week from 18 to 24 March was the wettest on record averaged over coastal New South Wales. The most severe flooding was in the Hastings, Karuah and Manning Rivers north of Sydney, but there was also significant flooding in other areas, including parts of western Sydney. There was also flooding on many inland rivers, which led to substantial recovery in water storages severely depleted by the 2017-19 drought. At least US$2.1 billion in economic losses were reported.
Two flash flood events associated with localised heavy rainfall occurred in Afghanistan during 2021, in early May around Herat in the west, and on 28-29 July centred on Nuristan in the east. There was significant loss of life in both events with 61 deaths reported in the May event and 113 in the July event61.
Flash flooding occurred on several occasions around the Mediterranean and Black Sea coasts. The most impactful event was on the Black Sea coast of Turkey on 10 August, where several towns experienced severe damage and 77 deaths were reported. 399.9 mm of rain fell at Bozkurt in 24 hours. This event was associated with a `Medicane' ­ a storm forming outside the tropics that nevertheless has characteristics of a tropical storm ­ in the Black Sea, with heavy rain and flooding also reported on the Russian Black Sea coast. On 4 October, exceptional rainfall fell in coastal regions of Liguria (northwest Italy), including 496.0 mm in 6 hours at Montenotte Inferiore and 740.6 mm in 12 hours at Rossiglione.
Persistent above-average rainfall in the first half of the year in parts of northern South America, particularly the northern Amazon basin, led to significant and long-lived flooding in the region. The Rio Negro at Manaus (Brazil) reached its highest level on record, peaking at 30.02 m on 20 June62. The most widespread flooding was reported in northern Brazil, but Guyana, Colombia and Venezuela were also affected.
The progress and withdrawal of the Indian Monsoon was delayed but overall Indian monsoon rainfall was close to average, with above-average falls in the west offset by below-average values in the northeast. During the course of the season, 529 deaths in India and 198 in Pakistan (as of 30 September) were attributed to flooding with further deaths in Bangladesh and Nepal63. In eastern Asia, eastern China (except for Henan) was generally less wet during the monsoon season than in
58 RM 114.3 billion, from the Chinese national contribution 59 German national contribution 61 EM-DAT 63 National contributions for India and Pakistan, EM-DAT has 120 deaths in Nepal over two incidents and 21 in Bangladesh from one,

2020, but August was extremely wet in Japan. Western Japan had its wettest August on record64, with some locations having more than 1400 mm of rain between 11 and 26 August.
The rainy season in the African Sahel was generally close to the average (1951-2000), and less wet than some recent years, although there was still some significant flooding reported, especially in Niger, Sudan and South Sudan as well as Mali. Elsewhere in Africa, Lake Tanganyika rose to more than 3 m above its normal level in May65, displacing lakeshore residents in Burundi. In southern Africa, much of which had been experiencing long-term drought, rainfall during the 2020-21 rainy season was above average in regions including northern South Africa and Zimbabwe with some flooding reported but was near or below average further north.
Drought
Significant drought affected much of subtropical South America for the second successive year. Rainfall was well below average over much of central and southern Brazil66, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern Argentina. The drought led to significant agricultural losses, exacerbated by a cold outbreak at the end of July, in which maximum temperatures were below 10°C for five consecutive days over higher parts of the south and which caused damage over many of Brazil's coffee-growing regions. Low river levels also reduced hydroelectricity production67 and disrupted river transport. The Brazilian government declared a situation of critical scarcity of water resources in the Paraná hydrographic region, with numerous water storages at or near their lowest levels in the last 20 years68. The 24-month Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) over the region reached its lowest level since the 1960s. The Paraguay River at Asuncion fell to a record low 0.75 m below the reference level on 6 October, 0.21 m below the previous record set last year. In Chile, where long-term drought has persisted for most of the last decade, 2021 was another dry year, with most locations having rainfall at least 30% below average. At Santiago, 107.7 mm had fallen as of 6 October, 67% below average.
Widespread drought in western North America, which had become established during 2020, spread and intensified in 2021. By September, extreme to exceptional drought covered most of the United States over and west of the Rocky Mountains, despite some slight easing from July onwards in parts of the inland southwest, due to an active summer monsoon. Extreme to exceptional drought also extended eastwards on both sides of the United States-Canada border, affecting northern border states as far east as Minnesota and the Prairie Provinces of Canada. The 20 months from January 2020 to August 2021 was the driest on record for the southwestern United States69, more than 10% below the previous record. Forecast wheat and canola crop production for Canada in 2021 is 30 to 40% below 2020 levels70, whilst in the United States, the level of Lake Mead on the Colorado River fell in July to 47 m below full supply level, the lowest level on record since the reservoir was fully commissioned.
Significant drought affected large areas of southwest Asia during 2021. Well below average precipitation fell during the 2020-21 cool season in regions including most of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, southeast Turkey, and Turkmenistan. Pakistan had its third-driest February on record. Mountain snowpack was also well below average, with snow cover extent in Iran about half thelong-term average for most of January and February, leading to reduced streamflow in rivers depending on snowmelt, and reduced water availability for irrigation.
A severe, relatively localised, drought, which has persisted for at least two years, continues to affect southern Madagascar71. Rainfall for the 12 months from July 2020 to June 2021 was around 50% below normal over the region. There were significant food security issues in the area, with 1.14 million classified by the World Food Programme as needing urgent assistance as of August 202172.
Tropical cyclones
Tropical cyclone activity over the globe in 2021 was close to average (1981-2010). For the second successive year, the North Atlantic had a very active season, with 20 named storms as of 11 October, about double the average for that period. It was also an active season in the North Indian Ocean, but the western North Pacific and eastern North Pacific were near to or below average. The 2020-21 Southern Hemisphere season was also slightly below average in both the Pacific and Indian Oceans.
The most significant hurricane of the North Atlantic season was Ida. Ida made landfall as a category 4 system in Louisiana on 29 August with sustained 1-minute winds of 240 km/h, the equal-strongest landfall on record for the state, with major wind damage and storm surge inundation. The system then continued on a northeast track over land with significant flooding, especially in the New York City area. New York, which had already experienced flooding from Hurricane Henri two weeks earlier, had a record hourly rainfall of 80 mm, with 24-hour totals exceeding 200 mm in parts of the city. Before it developed into a tropical cyclone, Ida's precursor system also caused significant flooding in Venezuela. In total, 72 direct and 43 indirect deaths were attributed to Ida in the United States and Venezuela, with economic losses in the United States estimated at US$63.8 billion73. Another significant landfall during the season was Grace, which hit Veracruz (Mexico) as a category 3 hurricane, having earlier resulted in impacts, mostly from flooding, in Haiti (where it hindered postearthquake recovery), the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago.
In the Southern Hemisphere, 2021's most significant cyclone74 was Seroja in April. Seroja formed south of Indonesia and tracked southeast towards Western Australia. It made landfall near Kalbarri on 11 April as an (Australian) category 3 cyclone, the strongest landfall so far south in Western Australia since 1956. Seroja's most severe impacts were from flooding and associated landslides from its precursor system in Timor-Leste, and the Indonesian regions of East Nusa Tenggara, Flores and Timor. Kupang (Timor) received 700.4 mm rainfall in the four days from 2 to 5 April. 272 deaths in total were attributed to Seroja, 230 in Indonesia, 41 in Timor-Leste and one in Australia75. Eloise in January contributed to flooding in southern Africa with damage and casualties reported in Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Eswatini and Madagascar, while in the South Pacific, Ana and Niran caused flooding and power outages in Fiji and New Caledonia respectively.
The most severe cyclone of the North Indian Ocean season was Tauktae, which tracked north off the west coast of India, with a peak 3-minute sustained wind speed76 of 50-53 m/s, before making landfall in Gujarat on 17 May at slightly below peak intensity, the equal strongest known landfall in Gujarat. At least 144 deaths were reported in India and 4 in Pakistan77. Later in the season, Cyclone Gulab crossed the eastern coast of India from the Bay of Bengal in late September; the remnant system crossed India before emerging and re-intensifying in the Arabian Sea, where it was renamed Shaheen. Shaheen made landfall on 3 October on the northern Oman coast northwest of Muscat, the first cyclone since 1890 to make landfall in this area. Al Suwaiq recorded 294 mm rain in 24 hours, about three times the region's annual average. 39 deaths were reported across India, Pakistan, Oman and Iran, mostly from flooding.
Direct impacts from North Pacific tropical cyclones were less than in recent years, although there were several significant landfalls, most notably from Typhoon Chanthu on the Batanes Islands (Philippines). Chanthu and Typhoon In-fa, in July, also both contributed to flooding and disruptions to shipping around Shanghai, while moisture ahead of In-fa was a contributor to the Henan Province floods (see Flood), and Dianmu contributed to flooding in Thailand in September after making landfall in Viet Nam.
Severe storms
There were multiple severe thunderstorm outbreaks in western and central Europe in the second half of June. An F4 tornado78 struck several villages in southern Moravia on 24 June, with major damage and six deaths reported. This was the strongest tornado on record in the Czech Republic. Tornadoes were also reported during the month in Belgium and France. Large hail (6-8 cm in diameter) was reported in multiple countries, including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, and Germany. In the Czech Republic alone, losses were around US$ 700 million.
959 tornadoes were provisionally reported in the United States between January and April, slightly below the 1991-2010 average. The most significant outbreak, including the season's only EF-4 tornado78, hit the southeast on 25 March with the most severe impacts in Alabama and western Georgia. 6 deaths and US$1.6 billion in economic losses were reported. Hailstorms in Texas and Oklahoma on 27-28 April resulted in US$2.4 billion in losses.
Attribution
Attribution of individual extreme events can often take several months to complete peer review. But increasingly it is becoming possible to carry out rapid attribution assessments that used peerreviewed methods to reach conclusions within just a few days of a weather record being broken. Such ""rapid attribution"" studies have been carried out for the heatwave in northwest America in June and July79,80 and of floods in western Europe in July81. Studies of the heatwave in the Pacific Northwest found that while the heatwave is still quite rare in today's climate, it would have been virtually impossible without climate change.
For the western Europe flooding, the rapid attribution study found that the detection of trends in extreme precipitation at the scale of the event in question was challenging and that saturated soils and the local hydrology were also factors in the event. However, across a wider area of western Europe, significant trends in extreme precipitation were found and these could be attributed to human-induced climate change and the study concluded that human-induced climate change had increased the likelihood of such an event.
More generally, events such as these fit into a broader pattern of change. The IPCC assessed82 that hot extremes in the regions of West North America and Northwest North American have increased, and that there is at least medium confidence in a human contribution to this increase. Similarly, the IPCC assessed that heavy precipitation has increased in the West and Central Europe region affected by flooding, but that there is currently low confidence in the attribution of this change to human influence.
Risks and impacts
The risk of climate-related impacts depends on complex interactions between climate-related hazards and the vulnerability, exposure and adaptive capacity of human and natural systems. At current levels of global greenhouse gas emissions, the world remains on course to exceed the agreed temperature thresholds of either 1.5 °C or 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, which would increase the risks of pervasive climate change impacts beyond what is already seen.
State of disasters
Disasters continue to take a heavy toll on life and assets, severely affecting and rolling back the development gains of countries. Years of investment in disaster preparedness, including early warning and rapid response capabilities, has strengthened capacities to reduce the human impact of disasters. However, economic losses remain high and continue to increase. The impact of highfrequency, low-impact events has also increased, often cumulatively exceeding the impact of single mega events.
Human impact of disasters In the longer term, the average annual number of dead and missing persons in the event of disaster per 100 000 people has fallen from 1.98 during 2005-2014 to 1.32 during 2011-2020. Nonetheless, in absolute terms the disaster-related mortality remains high. In the last three years alone (2018-2020), a total of about 250 000 disaster-related deaths and missing persons were reported by an average of 74 countries83.
The single largest event with highest mortality in 2021 was the earthquake in Haiti resulting in over 2500 deaths. However, the impact of climate change and variability continues to manifest in the form of hydrometeorological disasters. In 2021, floods resulted in around 1200 deaths in India, over 350 deaths in China, and over 200 deaths in Germany and Belgium. At the same time, over 600 people lost their lives due to heat waves in Northern America84.
In the last three years (2018-2020), a total of approximately 319 million people were affected due to disasters as reported by an average of 66 countries each year83. In 2020 alone, 40.5 million new internal displacements were recorded, of which over 75 per cent were displaced due to disaster85.
Driven by climate, growing vulnerability and conflict, humanitarian needs are at their highest-ever with one in every 33 people globally in need of assistance and protection86. Recurrent droughts continue to affect millions of people around the world, in particular in countries in Africa and Asia84.
Economic cost of disasters In the last three years (2018-2020), total economic losses of about US$ 148.32 billion have been reported by an average of 53 countries each year83. That this is an underestimation (due to limited reporting on loss and damage), can be ascertained from the fact that global disaster losses from natural hazards in 2020 alone is estimated to be US$210 billion by the insurance sector, which was over 25% higher than in the previous year87. In fact, over a four-decade period starting 1980, total losses due to such disasters have been estimated to be US$5.2 trillion88.
In 2019, the agriculture sector accounted for 60 per cent of recorded losses, followed by the housing infrastructure sector83. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that between 2008 and 2018, disasters cost the agricultural sectors of developing-country economies over US$108 billion in damaged or lost crop and livestock production89. At a global level, disaster-related losses amounted to US$280 billion. Up to 4% of the agricultural production was lost to disasters and 82% of all damage caused by drought was absorbed by the agricultural sector.
Further, in 2019, Least Developed Countries accounted for about 21% of reported mortality and 5% of economic losses which is relatively higher as compared to their total population and GDP.
Food Security
Global outlook of food security in 2021 In the last ten years, conflict, extreme weather events and economic shocks have increased in frequency and intensity. The compound effects of these perils, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a rise in hunger and, consequently, undermined decades of progress towards improving food security (Figure 25). Worsening humanitarian crises in 2021 have also led to a growing number of countries at risk of famine. Following a peak in undernourishment in 2020 (768 million people), projections indicated a decline in global hunger to around 710 million in 2021 (9%)91. However, as of October 2021, the numbers in many countries were already higher than in 2020. This striking increase (19%) was mostly felt among groups already suffering from food crises or worse (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above), rising from 135 million people in 2020 to 161 million by September 202192. Another dire consequence of these shocks was the growing number of people facing starvation and a total collapse of livelihoods (IPC/CH Phase 5), mostly in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Yemen, and Madagascar (584 000 people). The first quarter of 2021 has also seen the highest global consumer food prices in the last six years, concentrated in Latin America and the Caribbean91. In West Africa, prices of coarse grains increased, driving food prices to record and near record highs in several countries, exacerbated by civil insecurity and torrential rains. In North Africa, food inflation
rates remained at modest levels in 2021, buffered by subsidies on many basic commodities that prevented price increase.
Figure 25: The number of undernourished people in the world significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 650 million people in 2019 to 768 million people in 2020. Dotted lines and empty circles illustrate projected values in the above figure. According to the 2021 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, projections show a decrease in undernourishment rates between 2021 and 2030, with divergent trends across regions. While the numbers of undernourished people are likely to decrease in Asia, from 418 million in 2020 to 295 million in 2030, in Africa, the projected number of undernourished people is likely to increase, from 282 million in 2020 to 290 million in 2030. The entire series was revised to reflect new information made available since the publication of the report (GRFC, 2021).
Impacts of weather hazards on food production Extreme weather during the 2020/21 La Niña altered rainfall seasons, disrupting livelihoods and agricultural campaigns across the world. Extreme weather events during the 2021 rainfall season have compounded shocks from the previous year(s), making it increasingly difficult to quantify impacts resulting from one single event. Consecutive droughts across large parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America have coincided with severe storms, cyclones and hurricanes, significantly affecting livelihoods and the ability to recover from recurrent weather shocks. Extreme dry conditions across vast areas of South America, and the recent return of La Niña conditions could further threaten crop yields within this region. However, larger than usual cultivations have to some extent offset the adverse effects of La Niña-induced crop productivity losses throughout the continent (-3.6% in 2021 compared to 2020)93. In the Caribbean, Haiti has been triply hit by natural disasters (earthquakes), weather shocks (irregular rains) and political instability, increasing agricultural damage and significantly worsening food insecurity. In West Africa, floods and dry spells have caused crop damage and losses in localized areas resulting in small production downturns in 2021, but the forecasted aggregate outputs for the whole continent remain above average (+2.9% in 2021 over 2020)93. The 2021 first season harvest along central and southern areas of East Africa has been negatively affected by prolonged droughts, mostly in Kenya where maize outputs have been officially estimated to be 42-70% below average93. In northern parts of East Africa, the scale of seasonal flooding and its impact on crops has been lower compared to the severe flood impacts in 2020. In Southern Africa, the second consecutive below-average rainfall season in Madagascar has led to a severe reduction in staple food production and a decline in livestock herd size. Although rainfall is projected to be near average in Madagascar in autumn 2021, seed and cutting supplies will be insufficient for the next cropping season and the lack of government and household control of weather-related hazards, pests and diseases, will result in sharp harvest declines with yield estimates 50-70% below the five-year average94. In Mozambique, cyclone Eloise made landfall in late January during the region's lean season when vulnerabilities were at their highest and affected communities still recovering from Cyclone Idai barely two years ago. According to the Government of Mozambique more than 441 000 people were affected by the cyclone displacing nearly 44 000 and destroying more than 45 000 hectares of cropland95.
Drought conditions in the Near East reduced cereal production to below-average levels, exacerbating the impacts on agriculture and food security in fragile contexts, mostly in Afghanistan and the Syrian Republic. While cereal production decreased in the Near East, wheat production in the Far East reached a record high in 2021, with paddy rice outputs at high levels due to suitable weather conditions. In contrast, Central China was hit by torrential rains in mid-July 2021, leading to significant loss of life and damage to property. This sparked concerns over the potential impact on the nation's food supplies, as 1 million hectares of cropland ­ mostly corn, soybeans and peanuts ­ were affected, a third of which were wiped out.
Population Displacement
Climate-related hazards were a major driver of new displacement Extreme weather events and conditions have had major and diverse impacts on population displacement and on the vulnerability of people already displaced throughout the year. From Afghanistan to Central America, droughts, flooding and other extreme weather events are hitting those least equipped to recover and adapt96. Similar to previous years, many of the largest scale displacements in 2021 occurred in populous Asian countries. Most disaster displacements in 2021 resulted from tropical storms and floods in East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, the Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa.
Over the course of 2021, hazardous weather events and environmental degradation have further contributed to the displacement of millions more people in exposed and vulnerable situations. This includes the impact of rapid-onset events such as floods, storms and wildfires, as well as slow-onset processes such as drought and desertification, affecting people's safety and ability to meet their basic needs for survival such as food, water, resilient housing and productive land. Over the first half of the year in Afghanistan, for example, disasters brought on some 22 500 new displacements, primarily linked to floods97. In June, the government declared a national drought with 80% of the country classified as being in either severe or serious drought status on top of escalating conflict, food insecurity and health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 and with humanitarian, development and government actors foreseeing that agricultural families would very likely become displaced98. People forced to leave their homes had to sell their assets and engage in dangerous work to survive, while some children were sent to work in other areas or in neighbouring countries or were married off as a way to reduce financial burdens99.
In line with established trends, 2021 saw the overwhelming majority of new displacements related to hazardous weather events take place within national borders. Most of these internal displacements were triggered by typhoons, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, especially in the East Asia and Pacific region. The countries with the highest numbers of displacements recorded as of October 2021 were China (more than 1.4 million evacuations recorded in July 2021), the Philippines (more than 214,000 in July and more than 386,000 in October) and Vietnam (more than 664,000 displacements recorded in September 2021)100.
High-income countries were also affected. In the western parts of the United States and Canada exceptional heatwaves, drought, and wildfires displaced thousands from their homes. Wildfires also compounded risks related to other hazards, further increasing the risk of displacement. For instance, 15 000 people were displaced in California in January 2021, following mandatory pre-emptive evacuation orders following heavy rains101.
Hydro-meteorological hazards fuelled patterns of protracted, prolonged and repeated displacement Many displacement situations triggered by hydro-meteorological events have become prolonged or protracted for people unable to return to their former homes or without options for integrating locally or settling elsewhere. As of the beginning of 2021, at least 7 million people were living in internal displacement following disasters102 related to natural hazard events in previous years (IDMC, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre). The highest numbers of these people were in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, followed by Ethiopia, Sudan, Bangladesh, Niger and Yemen103.
Due to continuing or growing risk in their areas of origin (and return) or settlement, people who have been displaced by hydro-meteorological and climatic events may also be subject to repeated and frequent displacement, leaving little time for recovery between one shock and the next. In Indonesia, for example, 557 000 new disaster displacements were recorded in the first half of the year, mostly triggered by major rainy season floods. Human activities, including deforestation, urbanisation and land degradation have reduced the capacity of some regions of Indonesia to absorb heavy rainfall. With heavy rainfall during La Niña, the floods triggered an estimated 190 000 new displacements in the Kalimantan province in January and 161 000 new displacements on the island of Java in February. Further displacements are expected to arise during the new rainy season, starting from November 2021104. Such situations highlight the importance of disaster preparedness and risk management, but also for supporting solutions to displacement that are sustainable and supporting the resilience of people who might otherwise see their living conditions progressively eroded through repeated disasters and displacement.
Hazardous weather events and changing climatic conditions also added to the multiple risks faced by internally displaced people in conflict-affected countries and refugees In Yemen, for instance, the annual rainy season brings heavy rainfall, high winds and flooding, particularly to coastal areas. In mid-April heavy rain and flooding hit several parts of the country affecting 7 000 people, 75% of whom were internally displaced people living in precarious conditions105 It has also contributed to population displacement in what is already the world's fourth
biggest internal displacement crisis, with over 4 million internally displaced people. The annual rainy season brings heavy rainfalls, high winds and flooding, particularly to coastal areas, with thousands of families already impacted by flash floods in 2021. By blocking passage of roads, flooding also continues to impede the ability of humanitarian partners to deliver lifesaving assistance to people in need106.
In Mozambique, multiple tropical storms and floods, on top of recurrent disease outbreaks and conflict107, significantly increased the vulnerability of people affected108, including thousands of families still displaced since Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019. In January, strong winds and floods from Tropical Storm Chalane and then Cyclone Eloise damaged or destroyed the shelters of over 8 700 of these internally displaced families as well as schools and hospitals109. These events also resulted in new displacement, with Cyclone Eloise displacing more than 43 300 people110. Greater attention is needed to reduce climate vulnerability and risks in fragile and conflict-affected contexts and strengthen community-based preparedness111.
In East Africa, floods and droughts resulted in large-scale displacement, especially in Somalia and Ethiopia, many of whom were people already living in overcrowded and insecure camps for internally displaced people to which many newly flood-displaced people also moved. Farmers whose crops were devastated by desert locusts were also forced to move in search of survival assistance112.
Nigeria also experienced drought and floods, which affected agricultural activities, resulting in loss of shelter and increased vulnerability of people already displaced by conflict in the northeast. The situation further deteriorated in the first half of 2021, with around 294 000 new displacements reported between January and June 2021113.
In Bangladesh, monsoon rains led to massive flooding and the displacement of millions of people following Cyclone Yaas in June 2021. In the Rohingya refugee sites in Cox's Bazar, over 6 000 shelters were damaged and more than 25 000 refugees were forced to seek shelter in communal facilities or with other families114. Without preparedness measures undertaken in the camp areas, including the strengthening of shelters, the building of retaining structures on hillsides and improved drainage, roads and bridges, these impacts would have been far worse.
Climate impacts on ecosystems
Ecosystems ­ including terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems ­ and the services they provide, are affected by the changing climate and some are more vulnerable than others115. In addition, ecosystems are degrading at an unprecedented rate. The degradation of ecosystems is
limiting their ability to support human well-being and harming their adaptive capacity to build resilience116.
For example, mountain ecosystems ­ the water towers of the world ­ are vulnerable and can be profoundly affected by climate change due to their low capacity to adapt. This may affect the 1.9 million people living in mountain areas117. Climate change may exacerbate water stress, especially in areas of decreased precipitation and where groundwater is already being depleted, affecting agricultural production, arable land, and the more than 2 billion people who are already experiencing water stress116.
Climate change is also affecting temperature-sensitive plants and other species. There is evidence that temperature-sensitive plants are leafing out and flowering earlier in spring and dropping their leaves later in autumn. Also, there has been a clear shift in the timing of marine and freshwater fish spawning events and animal migrations worldwide. Substantial changes in species' abundance and distribution may in turn affect the interactions between species118. Climate change also exacerbates other threats to biodiversity. The number of species projected to go extinct increases dramatically as global temperatures rise ­ and is 30% higher at 2 °C warming than at 1.5 °C warming116.
Meanwhile, large-scale changes have been observed in marine ecosystems, including declining ocean productivity, migration of species to higher latitudes, and damage to coral reefs and mangroves. Warming towards 1.5 °C will increase water temperatures and change the ocean's chemistry (e.g., acidification), resulting in new ecosystems. Species that are less able to relocate are projected to experience high rates of mortality and loss119. Climate change is also triggering the disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets and increasing the chances of the Arctic Ocean being ice-free in the summer, further disrupting ocean circulation and Arctic ecosystems116.
Rising temperatures heighten the risk of irreversible loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, including seagrass meadows and kelp forest. Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to climate change. They are projected to lose between 70 and 90% of their former coverage area at 1.5 °C of warming and over 99% at 2 °C. Between 20 and 90% of current coastal wetlands are at risk of being lost by the end of this century, depending on how fast sea levels rise. This will further compromise food provision, tourism, and coastal protection, among other ecosystem services116.

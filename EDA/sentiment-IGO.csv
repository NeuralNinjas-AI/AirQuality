4,Accuracy,27
5,"A relative measure of the exactness of an emission or removal estimate. Estimates should be accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over nor under true emissions or removals, so far as can be judged. Activity",27
6,A practice or ensemble of practices that take place on a delineated area over a given period of time. Activity data,27
7,"Data on the magnitude of a human activity resulting in emissions or removals taking place during a given period of time. Data on energy use, metal production, land areas, management systems, lime and fertilizer use and waste arisings are examples of activity data. Agricultural pond",27
8,An artificial storage containing water for agricultural (irrigation) or pastoral (stock watering) uses. They are typically unlined and constructed using a combination of earthen embankments and the natural topography on the landscape. They can range in size from very small farm dams (< 50 m2) to very large (> 10 km2). Allochthonous,27
9,Material or formation originating outside the water body. Allometric model,27
10,A formula that quantitatively describes an allometric relationship. Allometry,27
11,The relative dimensional relationships between body parts that grow at different rates. Anaerobic,27
12,"Conditions in which oxygen is not readily available. These conditions are important for the production of methane emissions. Whenever organic material decomposes in anaerobic conditions (in landfills, flooded rice fields, etc.) methane is likely to be formed. Andosol",27
13,A soil developed in volcanic ash. Generally andosols have good drainage and are prone to fertility problems. Approaches to consistent representation of lands,27
14,"Approach 1: Represents land-use area totals within a defined spatial unit, which is often defined by political boundaries, such as a country, province or municipality. Approach 2: The essential feature of Approach 2 is that it provides an assessment of both the net losses or gains in the area of specific land-use categories and what these conversions represent (i.e., changes both from and to a category). Thus, Approach 2 differs from Approach 1 in that it includes information on conversions between categories, but is still only tracking those changes without spatially-explicit location data, often based on political boundaries (i.e., locations of specific land-use and land-use conversions are not known). Approach 3: The key defining characteristic of Approach 3 is that it is both spatially and temporally consistent and explicit. Sample-based, survey-based and wall-to-wall methods can be considered Approach 3 depending on the design of the sampling/mapping program and the way the data is processed and analysed. Aquaculture pond",27
15,An artificial storage containing water for the production of aquatic animals or plants. They are typically unlined and constructed using a combination of earthen embankments and the natural topography on the landscape. They can range in size from (< 50 m2) to (> 10 km2). Arithmetic mean,27

23,An indicator of the eutrophication status of a water body based on the presence of microalgae at the sediment-water interface at the bottom of the water body. Bias,27
24,"A systematic error of the observation and estimation method, whose magnitude in most cases is unknown. It can be introduced by using measuring equipment that is improperly calibrated, by selecting items from a wrong population or by favouring certain elements of a population, etc. For example: Estimating the total fugitive emission from gas transport and distribution using only measurements of leakage from high/medium pressure pipelines can lead to bias if the leakage in the lower pressure distribution network (which is significantly more difficult to measure) is neglected. Biochar",27
25,"For the purpose of this report, biochar is defined as a solid material generated by heating biomass to a temperature in excess of 350 °C under conditions of controlled and limited oxidant concentrations to prevent combustion. These processes can be classified as either pyrolysis (in which oxidants are excluded), or gasification (in which oxidant concentrations are low enough to generate syngas). Bioenergy",27
26,Energy derived from any form of biomass. Biofuels,27
27,"Any fuels derived from biomass, either deliberately grown or from waste products. Peat is not considered a biofuel in these guidelines due to the length of time required for peat to re-accumulate after harvest. Biogenic carbon",27
28,Carbon derived from biogenic (plant or animal) sources excluding fossil carbon. Note that peat is treated as a fossil carbon in these guidelines as it takes so long to replace harvested peat. Biological treatment of waste,27
29,"Composting and anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, such as food waste, garden/park waste and sludge, to reduce volume in the waste material, stabilisation of waste, and destruction of pathogens in the waste material. This includes mechanical-biological treatment. Biomass",27
30,"(1) The total mass of living organisms in a given area or of a given species usually expressed as dry weight. Includes above and below ground living biomass. (2) Organic matter consisting of or recently derived from living organisms (especially regarded as fuel) excluding peat. Includes products, by-products and waste derived from such material. Blowing agent (for foam production)",27

37,"An artificial waterway typically constructed with a uniform cross-section to provide navigation or to transport water for irrigation, hydropower, town water supplies, etc. They may be earthen structures or they may have concrete linings. “Canals are generally long and narrow, with a uniform width and depth, and have a single outlet.” <<https://www.ramsar.org/news/ramsar-topics-report-on-canal-estates>>",27
38,Carbon budget,27
39,"The balance of the exchanges of carbon between carbon pools or within one specific loop (e.g., atmosphere – biosphere) of the carbon cycle. This is a generic definition of “carbon budget” in the context of national greenhouse gas inventories. This term may be defined with other specific meaning in the other context. (For example, see the Glossary of IPCC Special Report “Global Warming of 1.5°C”). Carbon dioxide equivalent emission",27
40,"The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO2-equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG by its global warming potential (GWP) for a 100-year time horizon. Carbon sequestration",27
41,The process of storing carbon in a carbon pool. Category,27
42,"Categories are subdivisions of the four main sectors Energy; Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU); Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU); and Waste. Categories may be further divided into sub-categories. For details, see Chapter 8 of Volume 1. Census",27

46,"Chronosequences in this report are used in the context of the AFOLU sector, and consist of a temporal sequence in land use or management, for example, years since deforestation, which are used to evaluate change over time. Efforts are made to control all other between-site differences (e.g., by selecting areas with similar soil type, topography, previous vegetation). Chronosequences are often used as a surrogate for experimental studies or measurements repeated over time at the same location. Climate sub-domain",27

49,Coefficient of variation,27
50,"Statistical definition: The coefficient of variation, vx is the ratio of the population standard deviation, σx, and mean, μx, where vx = σx /μx. It also frequently refers to the sample coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the sample standard deviation and sample mean.1",27
51,Cogeneration,27
52,See: Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation. Combined heat and power (CHP),27
53,"Combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, is the simultaneous production of both electricity and useful heat for application by the producer or to be sold to other users with the aim of better utilisation of the energy used. Public utilities may utilise part of the heat produced in power plants and sell it for public heating purposes. Industries as auto-producers may sell part of the excess electricity produced to other industries or to electric utilities. Comparability",27
54,"Comparability means that estimates of emissions and removals reported by countries in inventories are comparable among countries. For this purpose, countries should use agreed methodologies and formats for estimating and reporting inventories. Completeness",27
55,Completeness means that an inventory covers all sources and sinks and gases included in the IPCC Guidelines for the full geographic coverage in addition to other existing relevant source/sink categories which are specific to individual countries (and therefore may not be included in the IPCC Guidelines). Confidence,27
56,"The term ‘confidence’ is used to represent trust in a measurement or estimate. Having confidence in inventory estimates does not make those estimates more accurate or precise; however, it will eventually help to establish a consensus regarding whether the data can be applied to solve a problem. This usage of confidence differs substantially from the statistical usage in the term confidence interval. Confidence interval",27
57,"A confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed/estimated data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. The interval has an associated confidence level that quantifies the level of confidence that the parameter lies in the interval. Most commonly, the 95 per cent confidence level is used. Consistency",27
58,Consistency means that an inventory is internally consistent in all its elements over a period of years. An inventory is consistent if the same methodologies are used for the base year and all subsequent years and if consistent data sets are used to estimate emissions or removals from sources or sinks. An inventory using different methodologies for different years can be considered to be consistent if it has been estimated in a transparent manner taking into account the guidance in Volume 1 on good practice in time series consistency. Correlation,27
59,Mutual relationship between two quantities. See correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient,27
60,"A number lying between –1 and +1, which measures the mutual relationship between two variables that are observed together. A value of +1 means that the variables have a perfect linear relationship; a value of –1 means that there is a perfect inverse linear relation; and a value of 0 means that there is no straight line relation. It is defined as the covariance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations. Country-specific data",27
61,"Data for either activities or emission factors that are based on research carried out on sites either in that country or otherwise representative of that country. 1 ‘Coefficient of variation’ is the term, which is frequently replaced by ‘error’ in a statement like ‘the error is 5%’.

65,An artificial structure that is barrier used to hold back water in a reservoir. Typically constructed with mineral sediment or concrete. Degassing emissions,27
66,"Elevated gas emissions that occur as water is released from a dam and experiences sudden changes in pressure, temperature and turbulence. These changes cause air-water exchange processes to occur at much greater rates than in surface waters as the released water approaches a new equilibrium with the environment downstream following Le Chatelier's principle. In the case of dams the change in the hydrostatic pressure before and after water passing through turbines affects this balance. Also, water released from dams is typically released into a stilling basin designed to dissipate much of the turbulent energy of the flow in order to prevent excessive bank erosion in the natural river channel downstream. The increased water column turbulence greatly increases the air-water gas transfer rate for a given dissolved gas concentration. In some cases, water may be discharged through needle valves into the air, which provides very high air-water contact area leading to rapid gas release. Decision tree",27
67,A decision tree is a flow chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the principles of good practice. Denitrification,27
68,The microbially facilitated reduction of nitrates or nitrites to molecular nitrogen (N2) through which the nitrogen is emitted from the substrate to the atmosphere. Diffusive emission,27
69,"The gas flux across the air-water interface governed by diffusion. For measuring diffusive fluxes, the most popular method employs floating chambers. Frequently estimated using the Thin Boundary Layer model of gas transfer. Displaced emission",27
70,"An emission of greenhouse gases that has been relocated in space (and possibly in time) but unchanged in quantity. For example, remineralisation and emission of CO2 of 1 kg of soil C assumed to occur in an agricultural field may actually occur downstream in a river, reservoir or ocean if that 1 kg of soil C is carried into the stream network as a consequence of rainfall. The carbon is still converted to CO2 but enters the atmosphere at a location downstream of the carbon source. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC)",27

80,The flux of gas carried by bubbles from sediments through to the water column to the atmosphere. Eddy flux measurement,27
81,The measurement of material fluxes by correlating high-frequency turbulent velocity fluctuations with turbulent concentration fluctuations. Also referred to as eddy correlation i.e. micrometeorological method that uses differences in concentration associated with turbulence in the air to quantify net vertical gas exchange. Emission factor,27
82,"A coefficient that quantifies the emissions or removals of a gas per unit activity. Emission factors are often based on a sample of measurement data, averaged to develop a representative rate of emission for a given activity level under a given set of operating conditions. Emissions",27
83,The release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period of time. (UNFCCC Article 1.4),27
84,Energy recovery,27
85,A form of resource recovery in which the organic fraction of waste is converted to some form of usable energy. Recovery may be achieved through the combustion of processed or raw refuse to produce steam through the pyrolysis of refuse to produce oil or gas; and through the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes to produce methane gas. Enhanced coal bed methane (recovery),27
86,Increased CH4 recovery produced by the injection of CO2 into coal seams. Epilimnetic,27
87,Pertaining to the epilimnion of a stratified water body. Epilimnion,27

90,Natural or anthropogenic process of nutrient enrichment of a water body which leads to increases in algal biomass. Evaporative emissions,27
91,"Evaporative emissions fall within the class of fugitive emissions and are released from area (rather than point) sources.

97,"Distinguishes first uses (and related emissions) from later non-energy uses of fossil fuels. For example, first-use emissions from lubricants are those which take place as a result of oxidation during use as a lubricant. Used lubricants may be used subsequently for heat raising as waste oils. Flaring",27
98,All burning of natural gas/vapour streams and hydrocarbon liquids by flares as a waste disposal option rather than for the production of useful heat or power. Floating chamber,27
99,Closed container that floats on the surface of the water used to quantify greenhouse gas emissions from the water surface. The time-dependent change in gas concentration within the floating chamber is a direct measurement of the gas flux. Flood control,27
100,The operation of a reservoir to reduce peaks in river discharge. Flow rate,27

(2) Raw materials, such as limestone, dolomite, lime, and silica sand, which are used to reduce the heat or other energy requirements of thermal processing of minerals (such as the smelting of metals). Fluxes also may serve a dual function as a slagging agent. Forest Land",27
104,"This category includes all land with woody vegetation consistent with thresholds used to define Forest Land in the national greenhouse gas inventory. It also includes systems with a vegetation structure that currently fall below, but in situ could potentially reach the threshold values used by a country to define the Forest Land category.

108,Wood used directly as fuel. Fugitive Emissions (oil and natural gas systems),27
109,"The intentional or unintentional release of greenhouse gases that occur during the exploration, processing and delivery of fossil fuels to the point of final use.

111,Global warming potential,27
112,"Global Warming Potentials (GWP) are calculated as the ratio of the radiative forcing of one kilogramme greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere to that from one kilogramme CO2 over a period of time (e.g., 100 years). Good Practice",0
113,"""Good practice"" is a key concept for inventory compilers to follow in preparing national greenhouse gas inventories. The key concept does not change in the 2019 Refinement. The term ""good practice"" has been defined, since 2000 when this concept was introduced2, as ""a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced so far as practicable"". This definition has gained general acceptance amongst countries as the basis for inventory development and its centrality has been retained for the 2019 Refinement. Certain terms in the definition have been updated based on feedback from the statistics community, such that this definition can be also understood as ""a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and that they are precise so far as practicable"" in the context of refinement of Chapter 3 of Volume 13. Good Practice covers choice of estimation methods appropriate to national circumstances, quality assurance and quality control at the national level, quantification of uncertainties and data archiving and reporting to promote transparency. Ground truth",4
114,"A term used for data obtained by measurements on the ground, usually as validation for remote sensing, e.g., satellite data. Harvested wood products",27
115,"Harvested wood products (HWP) according to the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (2003) and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines refer to wood and paper products, and include i) wood products in use (i.e. wood utilised as a material); ii) wood biomass used for energy purposes and iii) wood biomass in solid waste disposal sites. Hydrocarbon",27
116,"Strictly defined as molecules containing only hydrogen and carbon. The term is often used more broadly to include any molecules in petroleum which may also contain S, N, or O. An unsaturated hydrocarbon is any hydrocarbon containing olefinic, acetylenic, or aromatic structures. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)",27
117,"Halocarbons containing only hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon atoms. Because HCFCs contain chlorine, they contribute to ozone depletion. They are also greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)",27
118,"Halocarbons containing only hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms. Because HFCs contain no chlorine, bromine, or iodine, they do not deplete the ozone layer. Like other halocarbons, they are potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluoroethers (HFEs)",27
119,"Chemicals composed of hydrogen, fluorine and carbon atoms, with ether structure. Because HFEs contain no chlorine, bromine, or iodine, they do not deplete the ozone layer. Like other halocarbons, they are potent greenhouse gases. Hypolimnetic",27
120,"Pertaining to the hypolimnion. 2 The definition was originally introduced with the Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories published in 2000. 3 In the 2006 IPCC Guidelines, the term “uncertainty” was used with two meanings – a general one which is associated with both accuracy and precision, and a specific one only as the inverse of precision. This definition text of “good practice” which uses the term “precise” instead of “uncertainties” overcomes inconsistencies with general IPCC definition for uncertainty, without changing the original concept of “good practice”. Glossary",27
121,G.10 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,27
122,Hypolimnion,27
123,"The region of colder water at the bottom of a thermally stratified water body. It lies below the metalimnion (or thermocline) – the region with the strongest temperature gradient – and it may contain a weak temperature gradient. In many reservoirs, the hypolimnion can be anoxic (no oxygen) for many months each year because vertical transport of dissolved gases from above occurs mainly by slow diffusive processes across the metalimnion. This can lead to the accumulation of large concentrations of dissolved CH4 released from the bottom sediments. Hypoxia",27
124,Waterbodies where dissolved oxygen has become undersaturated due to natural and/or anthropogenic processes which have led to aerobic biological oxygen consumption rates greater than the rate of re-oxygenation. Hypoxic,27
125,Depletion of dissolved oxygen in aquatic environments to levels that are detrimental or fatal to aerobic organisms often caused by eutrophication. Independence,27
126,"Two random variables are independent if there is a complete absence of association between how their sample values vary. The most commonly used measure of the lack of independence between two random variables is the correlation coefficient. Inflow, in the context of water bodies",27
127,"The water that enters a water body (e.g. pond, lake, reservoir). In addition to surface flows (streams, rivers), inflow may also include precipitation and groundwater inputs. Irrigation channel",27
128,An open channel that transports water in order to irrigate agricultural land. Key category,27
129,"A key category is one that is prioritised within the national inventory system because its estimate has a significant influence on a country's total inventory of greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions and removals, the trend in emissions and removals, or uncertainty in emissions or removals. Whenever the term key category is used, it includes both source and sink categories. Key source",27
130,See key category. Kilns,27
131,"A tubular heating apparatus used in the manufacture of cement, lime and other materials. The calcination reaction may take place in the kiln itself, or, where so-equipped, it may partly or completely take place in a preheater and/or precalciner apparatus ahead of the kiln. Land cover",27
132,"Refers to the bio-physical coverage of land (e.g., bare soil, rocks, forests, buildings and roads or lakes). Land use",27
133,"A broad classification of land based on the activities and cover, and in this report refers specifically to six general types including Forest Land, Cropland, Grassland, Wetlands, Settlements and Other Land. Note that a specific parcel of land may have more than one land use, but it is generally the predominant land use that forms the basis for the classification. The land-uses may be considered as top-level categories for representing all land-use areas, with sub-divisions describing specific circumstances significant to emissions estimation. Landfill gas",27
134,"Municipal solid waste contains significant portions of organic materials that produce a variety of gaseous products when deposited, compacted, and covered in landfills. Anaerobic bacteria thrive in the oxygen-free environment, resulting in the decomposition of the organic materials and the production of primarily carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon dioxide is likely to leach out of the landfill because it is soluble in water. Methane, on the other hand, which is less soluble in water and lighter than air, is likely to migrate directly to the atmosphere. G.11",27
135,Large dams,27
136,"A dam with a height of 15 metres or greater from lowest foundation to crest or a dam between 5 metres and 15 metres impounding more than 3 million cubic metres. (See International Commission On Large Dams Constitution, Page 3)",27

138,"All aircraft activities that occur under 914 metres (3 000 feet) including idling aircraft engines, taxi-out, take-off, climb up to 914 metres, descend, approach and taxi-in. Note: some gatherers of statistics count either single take-off or landing as one cycle; however, it is both one take-off and one landing that together define the LTO cycle. Lubricants",27
139,"Lubricants are hydrocarbons produced from distillate or residue, and they are mainly used to reduce friction between bearing surfaces. This category includes all finished grades of lubricating oil, from spindle oil to cylinder oil, and those used in greases, including motor oils and all grades of lubricating oil base stocks. Managed land",27
140,"Land where human interventions and practices have been applied to perform production, ecological or social functions. All land definitions and classifications should be specified at the national level, described in a transparent manner, and be applied consistently over time. Therefore, what is not defined as ‘managed land’ by a country should be classified as unmanaged. Managed Land Proxy (MLP)",27
141,"For the AFOLU Sector, anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals by sinks are defined as all those occurring on ‘managed land’. This approach, i.e., the use of managed land as a proxy for anthropogenic effects, was adopted in the Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (2003) and that use is maintained in the 2019 Refinement. Manure",27
142,"Waste materials produced by domestic livestock (vegetative material such as green manures are considered to be crop residues or compost). The term ‘manure’ is used here collectively to include both dung and urine (i.e., the solids and the liquids) produced by livestock. Mean",27
143,The mean is a value around which values sampled from a probability distribution tend to lie. The sample mean or arithmetic average is an estimator for the mean. It is an unbiased and consistent estimator of the population mean (expected value) and is itself a random variable with its own variance value. The sample mean is the sum of values divided by the number of values:,27
144,"Σ=niixnx1 (xi, where i = 1,…., n are items of a sample). Measurement-based approach",27
145,The use of direct measurements to compute GHG fluxes from a system. Median,27
146,"The median or population median is a value which divides the integral of a probability density function (PDF) into two halves. For symmetric PDFs, it equals the mean. The median is the 50th population percentile. The sample median is an estimator of the population median. It is the value that divides an ordered sample into two equal halves. If there are 2n + 1 observations, the median is taken as the (n + 1)th member of the ordered sample. If there are 2n, it is taken as being halfway between the nth and (n + 1)th. Methanogenic production",27
147,Production of methane by microorganisms (methanogenic bacteria) during the decomposition of organic matter. Glossary,27
148,G.12 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,27
149,Mode,27
150,"The mode of a distribution is the value which has the highest probability of occurrence. Distributions can have one or more modes. In practice, distributions with only one mode are usually encountered. In this case, the mode or population mode of a PDF is the measure of a value around which values sampled from a probability distribution tend to lie. The sample mode is an estimator for the population mode calculated by subdividing the sample range into equal subclasses, counting how many observations fall into each class and selecting the centre point of the class (or classes) with the greatest number of observations. Model",27
151,A model is a quantitatively-based or qualitatively-based abstraction of a real-world situation which may simplify or neglect certain features to better focus on its more important elements. Example: the relationship that emissions equal an emission factor times an activity level is a simple model. The term ‘model’ is also often used in the sense of a computer software realisation of a model abstraction. Model-based approach,27
152,"The application of (typically) statistical or process-based models that employ indirect measurements to infer GHG fluxes from a system of interest. For example, a model-based estimate of a pollutant flux could be computed as the product of an assumed concentration and a measured flow rate, whereas the corresponding measurement-based estimate would use a measured concentration and a measured flow rate. Monte Carlo method",27
153,"In these Guidelines a Monte Carlo method is recommended to analyse the uncertainty of the inventory. The principle of Monte Carlo analysis is to perform the inventory calculation many times by computer, each time with the uncertain emission factors or model parameters and activity data chosen randomly (by the computer) within the distribution on uncertainties specified initially by the user. Uncertainties in emission factors and/or activity data are often large and may not have normal distributions. In this case the conventional statistical rules for combining uncertainties become very approximate. Monte Carlo analysis can deal with this situation by generating an uncertainty distribution for the inventory estimate that is consistent with the input uncertainty distributions on the emission factors, model parameters and activity data.

154,"Primary or secondary fossil fuels which are used directly for their physical or diluent properties. Examples are: lubricants, paraffin waxes, bitumen, and white spirits and mineral turpentine (as solvent). Non-energy use",27
155,"Within the Guidelines this term refers to the use of fossil fuels as Feedstock, Reductant or Non-energy products. However, the use of this term differs between countries and sources of energy statistics.

Non-marketed lime production",27
156,"Lime production occurring at facilities where the primary purpose is the production of lime as an intermediate input: such as plants that produce steel, synthetic soda ash, calcium carbide, magnesia and magnesium metal, as well as copper smelter and sugar mills. The lime produced by these facilities is often used on site and thus is often not reported in national statistics. Also referred to as in-house lime production. Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs)",27
157,"A class of emissions which includes a wide range of specific organic chemical substances. Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs) play a major role in the formation of ozone in the troposphere (lower atmosphere). Ozone in the troposphere is a greenhouse gas. It is also a major local and regional air pollutant, causing significant health and environmental damage. Because they contribute to ozone formation, NMVOCs are considered ""precursor"" greenhouse gases. NMVOCs, once oxidized in the atmosphere, produce carbon dioxide. G.13",27

Typically using differential equations to represent the change over time of parameters of interest, it provides a useful framework to project specific responses to altered environmental conditions. For example, a process-based model might be used to quantify the delivery of organic matter delivered from the catchment and/or produced by primary production within a reservoir, its deposition onto a reservoir's sediment, the degradation of the organic matter aerobically to CO2 or anaerobically to CH4 over time, and the emission of these gases across the air-water interface.

213,An engineered channel used to pass high flows safely past a dam when the reservoir water level is higher than the crest of the dam. Note that the maximum water level of a reservoir is frequently higher than the crest because of the use of gates that are on top of the crest. Standard deviation,27
214,The population standard deviation is the positive square root of the variance. It is estimated by the sample standard deviation that is the positive square root of the sample variance. Storage volume,27
215,"The volume of water stored in a water body. The ‘active’ storage of a reservoir is the volume of water contained between the full supply level (the maximum level at which water may be stored indefinitely) and the lowest outlet level. The ‘dead’ storage is the volume of water that is below the lowest outlet and therefore cannot be routinely accessed for beneficial use. The ‘flood control’ storage is the volume of water contained between the full supply level and the top of gates (or other adjustable structures) located on top of the spillway and used to regulate the discharge of floodwaters. The total reservoir storage volume is the sum of dead storage, active storage, and flood control storage capacities. Surrogate data",27
216,"Surrogate data or so-called proxy data is data that is used in place of the actual data, where the specific data needed is unobtainable. Often surrogate data is needed to describe changes in an emission source over time, for example population change may be used to approximate change in waste arisings. Survey",27
217,A survey is an investigation about the characteristics of a given population by means of collecting data from a sample of that population and estimating their characteristics through the systematic use of statistical methodology. G.17,27
218,Systematic and random errors,27
219,"Systematic error (i.e., bias) is the difference between the true, but usually unknown, value of a quantity being estimated, and the mean observed value as would be estimated by the sample mean of an infinite set of observations. The random error of an individual measurement is the difference between an individual measurement and the above limiting value of the sample mean. Systematic error",27

225,The thin boundary layer model expresses the flux of gas across an air-water interface as the product of a gas transfer velocity and the concentration change across the interface. It was originally developed by Liss and Slater (1974). Tier,27
226,"A tier represents a level of methodological complexity. Usually three tiers are provided. Tier 1 is the basic method, Tier 2 intermediate and Tier 3 most demanding in terms of complexity and data requirements. Tiers 2 and 3 are sometimes referred to as higher tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate. Time series",27
227,A time series is series of values which are affected by random processes and which are observed at successive (usually equidistant) points in time. Transparency,27
228,Transparency means that the assumptions and methodologies used for an inventory should be clearly explained to facilitate replication and assessment of the inventory by users of the reported information. The transparency of inventories is fundamental to the success of the process for the communication and consideration of information. Trend,27
229,"The trend of a quantity measures its change over a time period, with a positive trend value indicating growth in the quantity, and a negative value indicating a decrease. It is defined as the ratio of the change in the quantity over the time period, divided by the initial value of the quantity, and is usually expressed either as a percentage or a fraction. Trophic state",27
230,"A measure of the biological productivity of a water body. It is usually characterized by some combination of nutrients, photosynthetic pigments (Chl-a) and/or water column optical properties. As the ambient nutrient levels increase, primary production (the algal population) increases and the water clarity decreases. As primary production increases, higher levels of biological production are supported and the trophic state increases. Lakes or reservoirs are usually classified as being in one of four possible trophic states: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, or hypereutrophic. (see e.g., Carlson, 1977)",27
231,"Oligotrophic: an oligotrophic lake or reservoir is characterised by low primary productivity, as a result of low nutrient content. (Chl-a ≤ 2.6 μg L-1.) Mesotrophic: mesotrophic lakes or reservoirs are characterised with an intermediate level of productivity (2.6 μg L-1 < Chl-a ≤ 20 μg L-1.) Eutrophic: a eutrophic lake, pond or reservoir with high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. (20 μg L-1 < Chl-a ≤ 56 μg L-1.) Hypereutrophic: a hypereutrophic body of water experiences the highest levels of biological productivity. (56 μg L-1 < Chl-a)",27

236,"Areas where mean annual temperature (MAT) is more than 18 oC, with no more than 7 days of frost, and mean annual precipitation greater than 2000mm. Unbiased estimator",27
237,"An unbiased estimator is a statistic whose expected value equals the value of the parameter being estimated. Note that this term has a specific statistical meaning and that an estimate of a quantity calculated from an unbiased estimator may lack bias in the statistical sense, but may be biased in the more general sense of the word if the sample has been affected by unknown systematic error. Thus, in statistical usage, a biased estimator can be understood as a deficiency in the statistical evaluation of the collected data, and not in the data themselves or in the method of their measurement or collection. For example, the arithmetic mean (average) x is an unbiased estimator of the expected value (mean). Uncertainty",27
238,"Lack of knowledge of the true value of a variable that can be described as a probability density function characterizing the range and likelihood of possible values. Uncertainty depends on the analyst’s state of knowledge, which in turn depends on the quality and quantity of applicable data as well as knowledge of underlying processes and inference methods. (See Volume 1 Chapter 3.) Uncertainty analysis",27
239,"An uncertainty analysis of a model aims to provide quantitative measures of the uncertainty of output values caused by uncertainties in the model itself and in its input values, and to examine the relative importance of these factors. Validation",27
240,"Validation is the establishment of sound approach and foundation. In the context of emission inventories, validation involves checking to ensure that the inventory has been compiled correctly in line with reporting instructions and guidelines. It checks the internal consistency of the inventory. The legal use of validation is to give an official confirmation or approval of an act or product. G.19",27
241,Variability,27
242,"This refers to observed differences attributable to true heterogeneity or diversity in a population. Variability derives from processes which are either inherently random or whose nature and effects are influential but unknown. Variability is not usually reducible by further measurement or study, but can be characterised by quantities such as the sample variance. Verification",27
243,"Verification refers to the collection of activities and procedures that can be followed during the planning and development, or after completion of an inventory that can help to establish its reliability for the intended applications of that inventory. Typically, methods external to the inventory are used to check the truth of the inventory, including comparisons with estimates made by other bodies or with emission and uptake measurements determined from atmospheric concentrations or concentration gradients of these gases. Watercourse",27
244,The channel that a flowing body of water follows. Water residence time,27
245,"The average amount of time that water spends in a particular system (lake, reservoir, etc.). Defined as the volume of the reservoir divided by the inflow. Water withdrawal",27
246,"The controlled release of water from a dam. Depending on the dam’s design, i.e. the number and level of discrete outlets, the withdrawn water may originate solely from specific regions of the water column, i.e. epilimnion, metalimnion and hypolimnion. The withdrawal region for a specific discharge depends strongly on the density stratification of the water body, the outlet dimensions, and the reservoir morphology. Wetlands",27
247,"This category includes land that is covered or saturated by water for all or part of the year (e.g., peatland) and that does not fall into the forest land, cropland, grassland or settlements categories. The category can be subdivided into managed and unmanaged according to national definitions. Wetlands occur over all climate zones and include reservoirs and other constructed waterbodies (e.g. agriculture and aquaculture ponds, canals and ditches and wetlands constructed for wastewater treatment) as managed sub-divisions. Managed wetlands may also include peatlands, riparian wetlands, forested swamps, marshes, playas, pans, salt lakes, brackish wetlands, salinas, and sabkhas, in addition to coastal wetlands, including mangroves, saltmarshes, tidal marshes and seagrass. Unmanaged wetlands include natural rivers, lakes and ponds and any wetlands that have not been directly modified by human activity based on the Managed Land Proxy.AI Annex I: Glossary",27

405,"the Earth System, including the climate system. Originally proposed",27
406,"in the Earth System science community in 2000, the proposed new",27

442,"(CCS) and Land use, Land-use change, and Forestry (LULUCF). Aridity The state of a long-term climatic feature characterised",27
443,by low average precipitation or available water in a region. Aridity,27
444,generally arises from widespread persistent atmospheric subsidence,27
445,"or anticyclonic conditions, and from more localised subsidence",27
446,"in the lee side of mountains (adapted from Gbeckor-Kove, 1989;",27
447,"Türkeş, 1999). Atmosphere The gaseous envelope surrounding the Earth, divided",27
448,into five layers — the troposphere which contains half of the Earth’s,27
449,"atmosphere, the stratosphere, the mesosphere, the thermosphere,",27
450,"and the exosphere, which is the outer limit of the atmosphere. The",27
451,dry atmosphere consists almost entirely of nitrogen (78.1% volume,27
452,"mixing ratio) and oxygen (20.9% volume mixing ratio), together",27
453,"with a number of trace gases, such as argon (0.93 % volume mixing",27
454,"ratio), helium and radiatively active greenhouse gases (GHGs) such",27
455,"as carbon dioxide (CO2) (0.04% volume mixing ratio) and ozone (O3). In addition, the atmosphere contains the GHG water vapour (H2O),",27
456,whose amounts are highly variable but typically around 1% volume,27
457,mixing ratio. The atmosphere also contains clouds and aerosols. See,27
458,"also Carbon dioxide (CO2), Ozone (O3), Troposphere, Stratosphere,",27

460,(AOGCM) See Climate model. Atmospheric boundary layer The atmospheric layer adjacent,27
461,to the Earth’s surface that is affected by friction against that boundary,27
462,"surface, and possibly by transport of heat and other variables across",27
463,"that surface (AMS, 2000). The lowest 100 m of the boundary layer",27
464,"(about 10% of the boundary layer thickness), where mechanical",27
465,"generation of turbulence is dominant, is called the surface boundary",27
466,layer or surface layer. Attribution See Detection and attribution. Baseline scenario In much of the literature the term is also,27
467,"synonymous with the term business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, although",27
468,the term BAU has fallen out of favour because the idea of business,9
469,as usual in century-long socio-economic projections is hard to,27
470,"fathom. In the context of transformation pathways, the term baseline",27
471,scenarios refers to scenarios that are based on the assumption that,27
472,no mitigation policies or measures will be implemented beyond,27
473,those that are already in force and/or are legislated or planned to,27
474,be adopted. Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions,27
475,"of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve",27
476,to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further,27
477,"policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to",27
478,mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals,27
479,"for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, atmospheric concentrations",27
480,or temperature change. The term baseline scenario is often used,27
481,interchangeably with reference scenario and no policy scenario. See,27
482,"also Emission scenario, and Mitigation scenario. Biochar Relatively stable, carbon-rich material produced by",27
483,heating biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. Biochar is,27
484,distinguished from charcoal by its application: biochar is used as,27
485,a soil amendment with the intention to improve soil functions and,27
486,to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biomass that would,27
487,"otherwise decompose rapidly (IBI, 2018). Biodiversity Biodiversity or biological diversity means the",27
488,"variability among living organisms from all sources including, among",27
489,"other things, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the",27
490,ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity,27
491,"within species, between species and of ecosystems (UN, 1992). See",27

500,"climate, excluding biophysical effects. These processes include",27
501,changes in net emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) towards the,27
502,"atmosphere, net emissions of aerosols (mineral and organic), ozone",27

514,which land affects climate. These processes include changes in,27
515,"hydrology (e.g. water vapor fluxes at the land/atmosphere interface),",27
516,"heat exchanges via convective fluxes (latent and sensible), radiation",27
517,"(solar and infra-red, absorbed and emitted), and momentum (e.g. affecting wind speed). Glossary Annex I",27

522,weeks. Black carbon is a climate forcing agent with strong warming,27
523,"effect, both in the atmosphere and when deposited on snow or ice. See also Atmosphere, and Aerosol. Blue carbon All biologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage",27
524,in marine systems that are amenable to management can be,27
525,considered as blue carbon. Coastal blue carbon focuses on rooted,27
526,"vegetation in the coastal zone, such as tidal marshes, mangroves and",27
527,seagrasses. These ecosystems have high carbon burial rates on a per,27
528,unit area basis and accumulate carbon in their soils and sediments. They provide many non-climatic benefits and can contribute to,27
529,"ecosystem-based adaptation. If degraded or lost, coastal blue carbon",27
530,ecosystems are likely to release most of their carbon back to the,27
531,atmosphere. There is current debate regarding the application of the,27
532,blue carbon concept to other coastal and non-coastal processes and,27
533,"ecosystems, including the open ocean. See also Ecosystem services,",27
534,and Carbon sequestration. Business as usual (BAU) See Baseline scenario. Carbon budget Refers to three concepts in the literature:,27
535,(1) an assessment of carbon cycle sources and sinks on a global,27
536,"level, through the synthesis of evidence for fossil-fuel and cement",27
537,"emissions, land-use change emissions, ocean and land CO2 sinks,",27
538,and the resulting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) growth rate. This is referred to as the global carbon budget; (2) the estimated,27
539,cumulative amount of global carbon dioxide emissions that that is,27
540,estimated to limit global surface temperature to a given level above,27
541,"a reference period, taking into account global surface temperature",27
542,contributions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) and climate forcers;,27
543,(3) the distribution of the carbon budget defined under (2) to the,27
544,"regional, national, or sub-national level based on considerations of",27
545,"equity, costs or efficiency. See also Remaining carbon budget. Carbon cycle The flow of carbon (in various forms, e.g., as carbon",27
546,"dioxide (CO2), carbon in biomass, and carbon dissolved in the ocean",27
547,"as carbonate and bicarbonate) through the atmosphere, hydrosphere,",27
548,"terrestrial and marine biosphere and lithosphere. In this report, the",27
549,reference unit for the global carbon cycle is GtCO2 or GtC (one,27
550,"Gigatonne = 1 Gt = 1015 grams; 1GtC corresponds to 3.667 GtCO2). Carbon dioxide (CO2) A naturally occurring gas, CO2 is also a byproduct",27
551,"of burning fossil fuels (such as oil, gas and coal), of burning",27
552,"biomass, of land-use changes (LUC) and of industrial processes (e.g.,",27
553,cement production). It is the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas,27
554,(GHG) that affects the Earth’s radiative balance. It is the reference gas,27
555,against which other GHGs are measured and therefore has a Global,27
556,"Warming Potential (GWP) of 1. See also Greenhouse gas (GHG), Land",27
557,"use, and Land-use change. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) A process in",27
558,which a relatively pure stream of carbon dioxide (CO2) from industrial,27
559,"and energy-related sources is separated (captured), conditioned,",27
560,compressed and transported to a storage location for long-term,27
561,isolation from the atmosphere. Sometimes referred to as Carbon,27
562,Capture and Storage. See also Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation,27
563,"(CCU), Bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage (BECCS),",27
564,and Sequestration. Carbon dioxide capture and utilisation (CCU) A process in,27
565,which carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and then used to produce a,27
566,new product. If the CO2 is stored in a product for a climate-relevant,27
567,"time horizon, this is referred to as carbon dioxide capture, utilisation",27
568,"and storage (CCUS). Only then, and only combined with CO2 recently",27

581,(CO2) or CO2-equivalent emissions. This may refer to the rate of,27
582,"a carbon tax, or the price of emission permits. In many models that",27
583,"are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are",27

590,under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol through which investors,27
591,(governments or companies) from developed (Annex B) countries,27
592,may finance greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction or removal,27
593,"projects in developing countries (Non-Annex B), and receive Certified",27
594,Emission Reduction Units (CERs) for doing so. The CERs can be credited,27
595,towards the commitments of the respective developed countries. The CDM is intended to facilitate the two objectives of promoting,27
596,sustainable development (SD) in developing countries and of helping,27
597,industrialised countries to reach their emissions commitments in,27
598,a cost-effective way. Climate Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the,27
599,"average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in",27
600,terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period,27
601,,27
602,,27
603,of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The,27
604,"classical period for averaging these variables is 30 years, as defined",27
605,by the World Meteorological Organization. The relevant quantities,27
606,"are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation",27
607,"and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical",27
608,"description, of the climate system. Climate change A change in the state of the climate that can be",27
609,"identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/",27
610,or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended,27
611,"period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to",27
612,natural internal processes or external forcings such as modulations,27
613,"of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions and persistent anthropogenic",27
614,changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note,27
615,that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,27
616,"(UNFCCC), in its Article 1, defines climate change as: ‘a change of",27
617,climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity,27
618,that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is,27
619,in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable,27
620,time periods’. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate,27
621,change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric,27
622,"composition and climate variability attributable to natural causes. See also Climate variability, Global warming, Ocean acidification, and",27
623,Detection and attribution. Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event) The,27
624,occurrence of a value of a weather or climate variable above (or,27
625,below) a threshold value near the upper (or lower) ends of the,27
626,"range of observed values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme",27
627,weather events and extreme climate events are referred to collectively,27
628,as ‘climate extremes.’ See also Extreme weather event. Climate feedback An interaction in which a perturbation in,27
629,one climate quantity causes a change in a second and the change,27
630,in the second quantity ultimately leads to an additional change in,27
631,the first. A negative feedback is one in which the initial perturbation,27
632,is weakened by the changes it causes; a positive feedback is one in,27
633,which the initial perturbation is enhanced. The initial perturbation,27
634,can either be externally forced or arise as part of internal variability. Climate governance See Governance. Climate model A numerical representation of the climate,27
635,"system based on the physical, chemical and biological properties",27
636,"of its components, their interactions and feedback processes and",27
637,accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system,27
638,"can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for",27
639,any one component or combination of components a spectrum or,27
640,"hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as",27
641,"the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical,",27
642,"chemical or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the",27
643,level at which empirical parametrizations are involved. There is an,27
644,evolution towards more complex models with interactive chemistry,27
645,and biology. Climate models are applied as a research tool to study,27
646,"and simulate the climate and for operational purposes, including",27
647,"monthly, seasonal and interannual climate predictions. See also Earth",27
648,system model (ESM). Climate projection Simulated response of the climate system,27
649,to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse,27
650,"gases (GHGs) and aerosols, and changes in land use, generally",27
651,derived using climate models. Climate projections are distinguished,27
652,from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/,27

701,"the atmosphere, the hydrosphere, the cryosphere, the lithosphere and",27
702,the biosphere and the interactions between them. The climate system,27
703,evolves in time under the influence of its own internal dynamics,27
704,"and because of external forcings such as volcanic eruptions, solar",27
705,"variations, orbital forcing, and anthropogenic forcings such as the",27
706,"changing composition of the atmosphere and land-use change. Climate target A temperature limit, concentration level,",27
707,or emissions reduction goal used towards the aim of avoiding,27
708,dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. For,14
709,"example, national climate targets may aim to reduce greenhouse gas",27
710,"emissions by a certain amount over a given time horizon, for example",27
711,those under the Kyoto Protocol. Climate variability Variations in the mean state and other,27
712,"statistics (such as standard deviations, the occurrence of extremes,",27
713,etc.) of the climate on all spatial and temporal scales beyond that,27
714,of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural,27
715,"internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or",27
716,to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external,27
717,variability). See also Climate change. CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emission The amount of carbon,27
718,dioxide (CO2) emission that would cause the same integrated,27
719,"radiative forcing or temperature change, over a given time horizon, as",27
720,an emitted amount of a greenhouse gas (GHG) or a mixture of GHGs. There are a number of ways to compute such equivalent emissions,27
721,"and choose appropriate time horizons. Most typically, the CO2-",27
722,equivalent emission is obtained by multiplying the emission of a GHG,27
723,by its Global Warming Potential (GWP) for a 100 year time horizon. For a mix of GHGs it is obtained by summing the CO2-equivalent,27
724,emissions of each gas. CO2-equivalent emission is a common scale,27
725,for comparing emissions of different GHGs but does not imply,27
726,equivalence of the corresponding climate change responses. There,27
727,is generally no connection between CO2-equivalent emissions and,27
728,resulting CO2-equivalent concentrations. CO2 fertilisation The enhancement of plant growth as a result,27
729,of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The magnitude of CO2 fertilisation depends on nutrients and,27
730,water availability. Co-benefits The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed,27
731,"at one objective might have on other objectives, thereby increasing",27
732,the total benefits for society or the environment. Co-benefits are,27
733,often subject to uncertainty and depend on local circumstances,6
734,"and implementation practices, among other factors. Co-benefits are",27

748,"from static instability, usually caused by near-surface cooling or",27
749,increases in salinity in the case of the ocean and near-surface warming,27
750,or cloud-top radiative cooling in the case of the atmosphere. In the,27
751,"atmosphere, convection gives rise to cumulus clouds and precipitation",27

769,modelling activity from the World Climate Research Programme,27
770,(WCRP) which coordinates and archives climate model simulations,27
771,based on shared model inputs by modelling groups from around,27

773,using SRES scenarios. The CMIP5 data set includes projections using,27
774,the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The CMIP6,27
775,phase involves a suite of common model experiments as well as an,27

777,"over a specified period of time. See also Carbon budget. Decarbonisation Process by which countries, individuals or other",27
778,entities aim to achieve zero fossil carbon existence. Typically refers,27
779,"to a reduction of the carbon emissions associated with electricity,",27
780,industry and transport. Decoupling Decoupling (in relation to climate change) is where,27
781,economic growth is no longer strongly associated with consumption,27
782,of fossil fuels. Relative decoupling is where both grow but at different,27

804,as the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected,27
805,"by climate has changed in some defined statistical sense, without",27
806,providing a reason for that change. An identified change is detected,27
807,in observations if its likelihood of occurrence by chance due to,27
808,"internal variability alone is determined to be small, for example,",27

810,contributions of multiple causal factors to a change or event with,27
811,a formal assessment of confidence. Development pathways See Pathways. Diet ‘The kinds of food that follow a particular pattern that,27
812,"a person or community eats’ (FAO, 2014). See also Dietary patterns. Dietary patterns The quantities, proportions, variety or",27

818,"and Khurana, 2008; Popkin, 2006). Over historical time there have",27
819,been a number of dietary transitions but in recent decades the,27
820,prime transition has been associated with changes from subsistence,27
821,towards eating diets rich in calories and relatively poor in nutrition,27
822,(the ‘westernised diet’) that are obesogenic. From a public health,27
823,"perspective, a new dietary transition is in focus, from the obesogenic",27

834,"response, and recovery practices, with the explicit purpose of",27
835,"increasing human security, well-being, quality of life, and sustainable",4
836,"development (UNISDR, 2017). Discounting A mathematical operation that aims to make",27
837,monetary (or other) amounts received or expended at different,27
838,times (years) comparable across time. The discounter uses a fixed,27
839,or possibly time-varying discount rate from year to year that makes,27
840,future value worth less today (if the discount rate is positive). The,27
841,choice of discount rate(s) is debated as it is a judgement based on,27
842,hidden and/or explicit values. Discount rate See Discounting. (Internal) Displacement The forced movement of people,27
843,within the country they live in. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are,27
844,‘Persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee,27
845,"or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as",27
846,"a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations",27
847,"of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or",27
848,"human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally",27
849,"recognized State border’ (UN, 1998). See also Migration. Displacement In land system science, displacement denotes the",27
850,increasing spatial separation between the location of agricultural,27
851,and forestry production and the place of consumption of these,27
852,"products, as it occurs with trade. Displacement disconnects spatially",27
853,environmental impacts from their socioeconomic drivers. Downscaling Method that derives local- to regional-scale (up to,27
854,km) information from larger-scale models or data analyses. Two,27
855,main methods exist: dynamical downscaling and empirical/statistical,27
856,downscaling. The dynamical method uses the output of regional,27
857,"climate models, global models with variable spatial resolution, or",27
858,high-resolution global models. The empirical/statistical methods [are,27
859,based on observations and] develop statistical relationships that link,27
860,the large-scale atmospheric variables with local/ regional climate,27
861,"variables. In all cases, the quality of the driving model remains an",27
862,important limitation on quality of the downscaled information. The,27
863,"two methods can be combined, e.g., applying empirical/statistical",27
864,"downscaling to the output of a regional climate model, consisting of",27
865,"a dynamical downscaling of a global climate model. Drainage ‘Artificial lowering of the soil water table’ (IPCC, 2013). See also Rewetting. Glossary Annex I",27
866,AI,27
867,Drought A period of abnormally dry weather long enough,27
868,to cause a serious hydrological imbalance. Drought is a relative,27
869,"term, therefore any discussion in terms of precipitation deficit",27
870,must refer to the particular precipitation-related activity that is,27
871,"under discussion. For example, shortage of precipitation during the",27
872,growing season impinges on crop production or ecosystem function,27
873,"in general (due to soil moisture drought, also termed agricultural",27
874,"drought), and during the runoff and percolation season primarily",27
875,affects water supplies (hydrological drought). Storage changes in,27
876,soil moisture and groundwater are also affected by increases in,27
877,actual evapotranspiration in addition to reductions in precipitation. A period with an abnormal precipitation deficit is defined as,27
878,a meteorological drought. Megadrought,27
879,"A very lengthy and pervasive drought, lasting much longer than",27
880,"normal, usually a decade or more. Early warning systems (EWS) The set of technical, financial",27
881,and institutional capacities needed to generate and disseminate,27
882,"timely and meaningful warning information to enable individuals,",27
883,communities and organisations threatened by a hazard to prepare,27
884,to act promptly and appropriately to reduce the possibility of harm,5
885,"or loss. Dependent upon context, EWS may draw upon scientific and/",27
886,or Indigenous knowledge. EWS are also considered for ecological,27
887,"applications e.g., conservation, where the organisation itself is not",27
888,threatened by hazard but the ecosystem under conservation is,27
889,"(an example is coral bleaching alerts), in agriculture (for example,",27

898,"of the extinction of a key species within an ecosystem (Soulé, 2010). Ecosystem A functional unit consisting of living organisms, their",27
899,non-living environment and the interactions within and between,27
900,them. The components included in a given ecosystem and its spatial,27
901,boundaries depend on the purpose for which the ecosystem is,27
902,"defined: in some cases they are relatively sharp, while in others they",27
903,are diffuse. Ecosystem boundaries can change over time. Ecosystems,27
904,are nested within other ecosystems and their scale can range from,27
905,"very small to the entire biosphere. In the current era, most ecosystems",27
906,"either contain people as key organisms, or are influenced by the effects",27
907,of human activities in their environment. See also Ecosystem services. Ecosystem services Ecological processes or functions having,27
908,monetary or non-monetary value to individuals or society at large. These are frequently classified as (1) supporting services such as,27
909,"productivity or biodiversity maintenance, (2) provisioning services",27
910,"such as food or fibre, (3) regulating services such as climate regulation",27
911,"or carbon sequestration, and (4) cultural services such as tourism or",27
912,spiritual and aesthetic appreciation. See also Ecosystem. Effective climate sensitivity See Climate sensitivity. Effective radiative forcing See Radiative forcing. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The term El Niño was,27
913,initially used to describe a warm-water current that periodically flows,27
914,"along the coast of Ecuador and Peru, disrupting the local fishery. It has",27
915,since become identified with warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean,27
916,east of the dateline. This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation,27
917,of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern,27
918,called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere–ocean,27
919,"phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven",27
920,"years, is known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). It is often",27
921,measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti,27
922,and Darwin and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and,27
923,"eastern equatorial Pacific. During an ENSO event, the prevailing trade",27
924,"winds weaken, reducing upwelling and altering ocean currents such",27
925,"that the sea surface temperatures warm, further weakening the trade",9
926,"winds. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface",0
927,temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific. It has,27
928,climatic effects throughout the Pacific region and in many other parts,27
929,"of the world, through global teleconnections. The cold phase of ENSO",27
930,"is called La Niña. Embodied (embedded) [emissions, water, land] The total",27
931,"emissions [water use, land use] generated [used] in the production",27
932,of goods and services regardless of the location and timing of those,27
933,"emissions [water use, land use] in the production process. This",27
934,"includes emissions [water use, land use] within the country used",27
935,"to produce goods or services for the country’s own use, but also",27
936,"includes the emissions [water use, land use] related to the production",27
937,of such goods or services in other countries that are then consumed,27
938,"in another country through imports. Such emissions [water, land]",27
939,"are termed ‘embodied’ or ‘embedded’ emissions, or in some cases",27
940,"(particularly with water) as ‘virtual water use’ (David and Caldeira,",27
941,"; Allan, 2005; MacDonald et al., 2015). Emission scenario A plausible representation of the future",27

969,"services or other useful physical outputs obtained from a system,",27
970,"conversion process, transmission or storage activity to the input",27
971,"of energy (measured as kWh kWh–1, tonnes kWh–1 or any other",27
972,physical measure of useful output like tonne-km transported). Energy,27
973,"efficiency is often described by energy intensity. In economics,",27
974,energy intensity describes the ratio of economic output to energy,27
975,input. Most commonly energy efficiency is measured as input energy,27
976,"over a physical or economic unit, i.e. kWh USD–1 (energy intensity),",27
977,"kWh tonne–1. For buildings, it is often measured as kWh m–2, and",27
978,for vehicles as km liter–1or liter km–1. Very often in policy ‘energy,27
979,efficiency’ is intended as the measures to reduce energy demand,27
980,"through technological options such as insulating buildings, more",27
981,"efficient appliances, efficient lighting, efficient vehicles, etc. Energy security The goal of a given country, or the global",27
982,"community as a whole, to maintain an adequate, stable and",27

992,"characterising historical climate conditions, climate predictions, or",27
993,climate projections. Variation of the results across the ensemble,27
994,members may give an estimate of modelling-based uncertainty. Ensembles made with the same model but different initial conditions,27
995,only characterise the uncertainty associated with internal climate,27
996,"variability, whereas multi-model ensembles including simulations",27
997,"by several models also include the impact of model differences. Perturbed parameter ensembles, in which model parameters are",27
998,"varied in a systematic manner, aim to assess the uncertainty resulting",27
999,from internal model specifications within a single model. Remaining,27
1000,sources of uncertainty unaddressed with model ensembles are,6
1001,"related to systematic model errors or biases, which may be assessed",27

1080,or alternative (non-food) use of food that is safe and nutritious,4
1081,"for human consumption along the entire food supply chain, from",27
1082,primary production to end household consumer level. Food waste is,27
1083,recognised as a distinct part of food loss because the drivers that,27
1084,generate it and the solutions to it are different from those of food,27
1085,"losses (FAO, 2015b). Food security A situation that exists when all people, at all times,",27

1089,‘food security’ explicitly includes nutrition within it ‘dietary needs …,27
1090,"for an active and healthy life’, in the past the term has sometimes",27
1091,"privileged the supply of calories (energy), especially to the hungry. Thus, the term ‘food and nutrition security’ is often used (with the",27
1092,same definition as food security) to emphasise that the term food,27
1093,"covers both energy and nutrition (FAO, 2009).] Food system All the elements (environment, people, inputs,",27

1113,"mass by accumulation of snow, and loses mass by melting and ice",27
1114,discharge into the sea or a lake if the glacier terminates in a body of,27
1115,water. Land ice masses of continental size (>50 000 km2) are referred,27

1134,"range of means for deciding, managing, implementing and monitoring",27
1135,policies and measures. Whereas government is defined strictly in,27
1136,"terms of the nation-state, the more inclusive concept of governance",27
1137,"recognises the contributions of various levels of government (global,",27
1138,"international, regional, sub-national and local) and the contributing",27
1139,"roles of the private sector, of nongovernmental actors, and of civil",27
1140,society to addressing the many types of issues facing the global,27

1142,and measures are determined. Adaptive governance,27
1143,An emerging term in the literature for the evolution of formal,27
1144,"and informal institutions of governance that prioritise planning,",27
1145,implementation and evaluation of policy through iterative social,27
1146,"learning; in the context of climate change, governance facilitating",27

1151,"systems towards preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the risks",27
1152,"posed by climate change (Jagers and Stripple, 2003). Deliberative governance",27
1153,Involves decision making through inclusive public conversation,27
1154,which allows opportunity for developing policy options through,27
1155,public discussion rather than collating individual preferences through,27
1156,voting or referenda (although the latter governance mechanisms can,27
1157,also be proceeded and legitimated by public deliberation processes). Flexible governance,27

1169,A governance system that enables direct public engagement in,27
1170,"decision-making using a variety of techniques for example, referenda,",27
1171,"community deliberation, citizen juries or participatory budgeting. The",27
1172,approach can be applied in formal and informal institutional contexts,4
1173,"from national to local, but is usually associated with devolved",27
1174,"decision making (Fung and Wright, 2003; Sarmiento and Tilly, 2018). Governance capacity See Governance. Grazing land The sum of rangelands and pastures not considered",27
1175,"as cropland, and subject to livestock grazing or hay production. It",27
1176,"includes a wide range of ecosystems, e.g. systems with vegetation",27

1182,"green open spaces and original grassland and woodlands, as well",27
1183,as possible building and street level design interventions that,27
1184,incorporate vegetation. Green infrastructure provides services and,27

1245,behalf of their interests and to live with dignity. Human system Any system in which human organisations,27
1246,"and institutions play a major role. Often, but not always, the term",27
1247,is synonymous with society or social system. Systems such as,27
1248,"agricultural systems, urban systems, political systems, technological",27
1249,"systems, and economic systems are all human systems in the sense",27
1250,applied in this report. Hydrological cycle The cycle in which water evaporates from the,27
1251,"oceans and the land surface, is carried over the Earth in atmospheric",27
1252,"circulation as water vapour, condenses to form clouds, precipitates",27
1253,"as rain or snow, which on land can be intercepted by trees and",27
1254,"vegetation, potentially accumulating as snow or ice, provides runoff",27
1255,"on the land surface, infiltrates into soils, recharges groundwater,",27
1256,"discharges into streams, and ultimately, flows out into the oceans",27
1257,"as rivers, polar glaciers and ice sheets, from which it will eventually",27
1258,evaporate again. The various systems involved in the hydrological,27
1259,cycle are usually referred to as hydrological systems. Ice sheet An ice body originating on land that covers an area of,27
1260,"continental size, generally defined as covering >50,000 km2. An ice",27
1261,sheet flows outward from a high central ice plateau with a small,27
1262,"average surface slope. The margins usually slope more steeply, and",27
1263,most ice is discharged through fast flowing ice streams or outlet,27
1264,"glaciers, often into the sea or into ice shelves floating on the sea. There are only two ice sheets in the modern world, one on Greenland",27
1265,and one on Antarctica. The latter is divided into the East Antarctic Ice,27

1288,"far-reaching social and economic consequences, beginning in Britain",27
1289,during the second half of the 18th century and spreading to Europe,27
1290,and later to other countries including the United States. The invention,27
1291,of the steam engine was an important trigger of this development. The industrial revolution marks the beginning of a strong increase,27
1292,"in the use of fossil fuels, initially coal, and hence emission of carbon",27
1293,dioxide (CO2). See also Pre-industrial. Industrialised/developed/developing countries There are,27
1294,a diversity of approaches for categorising countries on the basis of,27
1295,"their level of economic development, and for defining terms such",27
1296,,27
1297,,27
1298,"as industrialised, developed, or developing. Several categorisations",27
1299,"are used in this report. (1) In the United Nations system, there is no",27
1300,established convention for designating of developed and developing,27
1301,countries or areas. (2) The United Nations Statistics Division specifies,27
1302,"developed and developing regions based on common practice. In addition, specific countries are designated as Least Developed",27
1303,"Countries (LDC), landlocked developing countries, small island",27
1304,"developing states (SIDS), and transition economies. Many countries",27
1305,appear in more than one of these categories. (3) The World Bank,27
1306,uses income as the main criterion for classifying countries as,27
1307,"low, lower middle, upper middle, and high income. (4) The United",27
1308,Nations Development Programme (UNDP) aggregates indicators for,27
1309,"life expectancy, educational attainment, and income into a single",27
1310,composite Human Development Index (HDI) to classify countries as,27
1311,"low, medium, high, or very high human development. Inequality See Equality. Institution Rules, norms and conventions held in common by",27
1312,"social actors that guide, constrain and shape human interaction. Institutions can be formal, such as laws and policies, or informal,",27

1328,Integrated assessment model (IAM). Integrated assessment model (IAM) Models that integrate,27
1329,knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. They,27
1330,are one of the main tools for undertaking integrated assessments. One class of IAM used in respect of climate change mitigation may,27
1331,"include representations of: multiple sectors of the economy, such as",27
1332,"energy, land use and land use change; interactions between sectors;",27
1333,the economy as a whole; associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,27

1464,and assets to which people have access. Such assets can be,27
1465,"categorised as human, social, natural, physical, or financial. Local knowledge The understandings and skills developed",27
1466,"by individuals and populations, specific to the places where they",27
1467,live. Local knowledge informs decision-making about fundamental,27

1476,"compounds includes carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O),",27
1477,together with some fluorinated gases. They have a warming effect on,27
1478,climate. These compounds accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal,27
1479,"to centennial timescales, and their effect on climate hence persists",27
1480,for decades to centuries after their emission. On timescales of,27

1497,intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition addresses,27
1498,"three broad groups of conditions: undernutrition, which includes",27
1499,"wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age)",27
1500,and underweight (low weight-for-age); micronutrient-related,27
1501,"malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of",9

1503,"overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases",27
1504,"(such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers) (WHO,",27
1505,). Micronutrient deficiencies are sometimes termed ‘hidden,27
1506,hunger’ to emphasise that people can be malnourished in the sense,27
1507,of deficient without being deficient in calories. Hidden hunger can,27
1508,apply even where people are obese. Managed forest Forests subject to human interventions (notably,27

1521,ecological or social functions’. The IPCC (2006) defines anthropogenic,27
1522,GHG emissions and removals in the LULUCF sector as all those,27
1523,occurring on ‘managed land’. The key rationale for this approach is,27
1524,that the preponderance of anthropogenic effects occurs on managed,27

1527,prices that do not reflect the real scarcity of goods and services but,27
1528,"rather reflect market distortions, they do not generate an efficient",27
1529,allocation of resources but cause welfare losses. A market distortion,9
1530,is any event in which a market reaches a market clearing price,27
1531,that is substantially different from the price that a market would,27
1532,achieve while operating under conditions of perfect competition and,27
1533,state enforcement of legal contracts and the ownership of private,27

1660,Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted on,27
1661,"December 2015 in Paris, France, at the 21st session of the Conference",27
1662,"of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC. The agreement, adopted by 196",27
1663,"Parties to the UNFCCC, entered into force on 4 November 2016 and",27
1664,as of May 2018 had 195 Signatories and was ratified by 177 Parties. One of the goals of the Paris Agreement is ‘Holding the increase in the,27
1665,global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial,27
1666,levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C,27
1667,"above pre-industrial levels’, recognising that this would significantly",27
1668,"reduce the risks and impacts of climate change. Additionally, the",27
1669,Agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with,27

1675,of quantitative and qualitative scenarios or narratives of potential,27
1676,futures to solution-oriented decision-making processes to achieve,27
1677,desirable societal goals. Pathway approaches typically focus on,27

1685,A series of adaptation choices involving trade-offs between shortterm,27
1686,and long-term goals and values. These are processes of,27

1707,only one of many possible scenarios that would lead to the specific,27
1708,radiative forcing characteristics. The term pathway emphasises the,27
1709,"fact that not only the long-term concentration levels, but also the",27

1907,or a motionless sheet attached to the coast (land-fast ice). Sea ice,27
1908,concentration is the fraction of the ocean covered by ice. Sea ice less,27
1909,than one year old is called first-year ice. Perennial ice is sea ice that,27

1919,of the ocean is called barystatic. The amount of barystatic sea level,27
1920,change due to the addition or removal of a mass of water is called,27
1921,"its sea level equivalent (SLE). Sea level changes, both globally and",27
1922,"locally, resulting from changes in water density are called steric. Density changes induced by temperature changes only are called",27
1923,"thermosteric, while density changes induced by salinity changes",27
1924,are called halosteric. Barystatic and steric sea level changes do not,27
1925,include the effect of changes in the shape of ocean basins induced by,27

1944,primarily composed of those with short lifetimes in the atmosphere,27
1945,"compared to well-mixed greenhouse gases (GHGs), and are also",27

1948,"as well as ozone (O3) and aerosols, or their precursors, and some",27
1949,halogenated species that are not well-mixed greenhouse gases. These compounds do not accumulate in the atmosphere at decadal to,27

The SROCC follows the other two Special Reports on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SRI .5) and on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)6 and the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) compiles key findings of the report and is structured in three parts: SPM.A: Observed Changes and Impacts, SPM.B: Projected Changes and Risks, and SPM.C: Implementing Responses to Ocean and Cryosphere Change.

2162,"All people on Earth depend directly or indirectly on the ocean and cryosphere. The global ocean covers 71 % of the Earth surface and contains about 97% of the Earth's water. The cryosphere refers to frozen components of the Earth system1. Around 10% of Earth's land area is covered by glaciers or ice sheets. The ocean and cryosphere support unique habitats, and are interconnected with other components of the climate system through global exchange of water, energy and carbon. The projected responses of the ocean and cryosphere to past and current human-induced greenhouse gas emissions and ongoing global warming include climate feedbacks, changes over decades to millennia that cannot be avoided, thresholds of abrupt change, and irreversibility. {Box 1.1,1.2}",27
2163,"Human communities in close connection with coastal environments, small islands (including Small Island Developing States, SIDS), polar areas and high mountains8 are particularly exposed to ocean and cryosphere change, such as sea level rise, extreme sea level and shrinking cryosphere. Other communities further from the coast are also exposed to changes in the ocean, such as through extreme weather events. Today, around 4 million people live permanently in the Arctic region, of whom 10% are Indigenous. The low-lying coastal zone9 is currently home to around 680 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), projected to reach more than one billion by 2050. SIDS are home to 65 million people. Around 670 million people (nearly 10% of the 2010 global population), including Indigenous peoples, live in high mountain regions in all continents except Antarctica. In high mountain regions, population is projected to reach between 740 and 840 million by 2050 (about 8.4-8.7% of the projected global population). {1.1, 2.1, 3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 9, Figure 2.1}",27
2164,"In addition to their role within the climate system, such as the uptake and redistribution of natural and anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, as well as ecosystem support, services provided to people by the ocean and/or cryosphere include food and water supply, renewable energy, and benefits for health and well-being, cultural values, tourism, trade, and transport.

2212,Box SPM.1 I Use of Climate Change Scenarios in SROCC,27
2213,"Assessments of projected future changes in this report are based largely on CMIP510 climate model projections using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCPs are scenarios that include time series of emissions and concentrations of the full suite of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols and chemically active gases, as well as land use / land cover. RCPs provide only one set of many possible scenarios that would lead to different levels of global warming. {Annex I: Glossary}",27
2214,"This report uses mainly RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in its assessment, reflecting the available literature. RCP2.6 represents a low greenhouse gas emissions, high mitigation future, that in CMIP5 simulations gives a two in three chance of limiting global warming to below 2°C by 210011. By contrast, RCP8.5 is a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario in the absence of policies to combat climate change, leading to continued and sustained growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Compared to the total set of RCPs, RCP8.5 corresponds to the pathway with the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The underlying chapters also reference other scenarios, including RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 that have intermediate levels of greenhouse gas emissions and result in intermediate levels of warming. {Annex I: Glossary, Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}",27
2215,"Table SPM.1 provides estimates of total warming since the pre-industrial period under four different RCPs for key assessment intervals used in SROCC. The warming from the 1850-1900 period until 1986-2005 has been assessed as 0.63°C (0.57°C to 0.69°C likely range) using observations of near-surface air temperature over the ocean and over land.12 Consistent with the approach in AR5, modelled future changes in global mean surface air temperature relative to 1986-2005 are added to this observed warming. {Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1}",27

Since 1993, the rate of ocean warming has more than doubled (likely). Marine heatwaves have very likely doubled in frequency since 1982 and are increasing in intensity (very high confidence). By absorbing more CO2, the ocean has undergone increasing surface acidification (virtually certain). A loss of oxygen has occurred from the surface to 1000 m (medium confidence).

It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analyzing current and past environmental policy, and identifying future options for achieving sustainable development by 2050. The original request to prepare GEO-6 came from Member states at the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), when, in paragraph 8 of resolution 1/4, the Executive Director of UNEP was requested, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook, supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global, intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNEP/EA.1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer-reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policymakers, to be endorsed by the Environment Assembly no later than in 2018. At its third session, the Environment Assembly, in paragraphs 1 and 2 of its decision 3/1, requested the Executive Directorio issue the sixth Global Environment Outlook at least three months before the fourth session of the Assembly; to schedule the negotiations on the Summary for policymakers at least six weeks in advance of the fourth session of the Assembly; and to present the Outlook and the Summary for consideration and possible endorsement by the Assembly at its fourth session.

2785,"1. What is the Global Environment Outlook? The Global Environment Outlook (GEO) is the result of a consultative and participatory process to prepare an independent assessment of the state of the environment, the effectiveness of the policy response in addressing environmental challenges and the possible pathways to achieving various internationally agreed environmental goals. The GEO is a series of studies that inform environmental decision-making for Governments and other stakeholders. {1.1}",27
2786,"The sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), under the theme ""Healthy Planet, Healthy People"", aims to provide a sound, evidence-based source of environmental information to help policymakers and all of society to achieve the environmental dimension of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and internationally agreed environmental goals, and to implement the multilateral environmental agreements. It does so by assessing recent scientific information and data, analysing current and past environmental policies and identifying future options to achieve sustainable development by 2050. {1.1}",27
2787,"Since the first edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO) in 1997, there have been many examples of environmental improvement, especially where problems have been well- identified, manageable, and where regulatory and technological solutions have been readily available. Much more can be achieved in that regard through more effective implementation of existing policies. {Chapters 12 to 17}",27
2788,"Nevertheless, the overall condition of the global environment has continued to deteriorate since the first edition of GEO, despite environmental policy efforts across all countries and regions. Environmental policy efforts are being hindered by a variety of factors, in particular unsustainable production and consumption- patterns in most countries and climate change. GEO-6 concludes that unsustainable human activities globally have degraded the Earth's ecosystems, endangering the ecological foundations of society. {Chapters 4 to 9}",9
2789,"Urgent action at an unprecedented scale is necessary to arrest and reverse this situation, thereby protecting human and environmental health and maintaining the current and future integrity of global ecosystems. Key actions include reducing land degradation, biodiversity loss, and air, land and water pollution; improving water management and resource management; climate change mitigation and adaptation; resource efficiency; addressing decarbonization, decoupling and detoxification; and the prevention and management of risk and disasters. Those all require more ambitious and effective policies, including sustainable consumption and production, greater resource efficiency and improved resource management, integrated ecosystem management, and integrated waste management and prevention.1 2 3 4 {Chapter 22}",27
2790,,27
2791,"Mainstreaming environmental considerations into social and economic decisions at all levels is of vital importance. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, GEO-6 shows that environmental issues are best addressed in conjunction with related economic and social issues, taking into account synergies and trade-offs between different goals and targets, including consideration of eguity and gender dimensions. Governance can be improved at the local, national, regional and global levels, including broad coordination between policy areas. More ambitious and effectively implemented environmental policies are necessary, but alone they are not sufficient to meet sustainable development objectives. At the same time as ensuring sustainable sources of financing for sustainable development and aligning financing flows with environmental priorities, capacities have to be strengthened and scientific information taken into account for environmental management. Strong commitment from all stakeholders, partnerships and international cooperation would greatly facilitate the realization of environmental goals. {Chapters 22, 23, 24}",27
2792,"GEO-6 shows that a healthy environment is the best foundation for economic prosperity, human health and well-being. As figure SPM.1 illustrates, human behaviour has had various impacts on biodiversity, atmosphere, oceans, water and land. That environmental degradation, which ranges from serious to irreversible, has had a negative impact on human health. Atmospheric pollution has had the most severe negative impact, followed by degradation of water, biodiversity, ocean and land environment. It is therefore important that opportunities for prosperity and well-being that maintain or regain the integrity of ecosystems should be attained through sustainable development pathways that are shared and pursued globally. {24.4}",27
2793,"The following sections highlight the main global drivers of environmental change, the condition of the environment, the scale and effectiveness of policy responses, the potential pathways for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in an increasingly complex world, and the data and information needs and opportunities that can support decision-making towards achieving those Goals. NOTE: Dotted arrows show how things may be experienced differently in various parts of the world",27
2794,"Source: Gupta et al. (2019). Note: The figure shows the degree of impact of human activity on the health of the planet (ranging from good health to irreversible damage) and the impact of the health of the planet on human health (ranging from low damage to high damage). Some environmental and health impact may be remediable in the short or long term, but ""irreversible"" environmental impact can only be remedied over the very long term, if at all. 2. What is happening to our environment and how have we responded? 2.1 Drivers of environmental change, megatrends and governance challenges",27
2795,"Human population dynamics or trends, particularly population pressure, and economic development have been acknowledged for many decades as the primary drivers of environmental change (well established). More recently, rapid urbanization and accelerating technological innovation have been additional influences. There are wide disparities globally in the consumption and production patterns that lie behind those drivers. {2.1.1,2.2}",27
2796,"Those driving forces are also strongly intertwined, complex, and spread widely and unevenly across the world (well established). They are megatrends, developing at speeds with which responses by established governance structures at all levels - urban and rural, local, national, regional, global and supranational - are thus far insufficient to keep pace. {2.1.1}",27
2797,"The global population in 2018 is some 7.5 billion, with median projections estimating nearly 10 billion by 2050 and nearly 11 billion by 2100 (United Nations figures) (well established). Increases in life expectancy and reductions in infant and other mortality mean that population growth rates will continue to remain positive in all regions except Europe and certain parts of Asia. Unequal access to education, and lack of empowerment of women, as well as their lack of access to sexual and reproductive health services, all contribute to high birth rates. Without changes in production and consumption patterns, population growth will continue to increase environmental pressures. {2.3, 2.3.4, 2.1.1}",27
2798,"Urbanization is happening at an unprecedented rate globally and cities have become the foremost drivers of economic development across the world (well established). More people, especially in emerging and developing economies, are living in cities and towns, and the world's urban population is expected to rise to 66 per cent by 2050 (well established). Approximately 90 per cent of city growth will occur in Africa and Asia. Africa is the most rapidly urbanizing region, and is also the region expected to experience the highest population growth (well established). Some 30 per cent of urban residents globally have no access to basic services or social protection, with poor women in low-income urban neighbourhoods being particularly vulnerable. {2.4, 2.4.3}",27
2799,"Almost all coastal cities of any size and small island developing States are increasingly vulnerable to rising sea-levels, floods and storm surges caused by climate change and extreme weather events (established but incomplete). In general, those cities in developing countries that are urbanizing most rapidly are in a more vulnerable situation. In contrast, sustainable urbanization can represent an opportunity to increase citizens' well-being while decreasing their environmental impact. Lower- impact urban lifestyles can be facilitated by improved governance, infrastructure, services, sustainable land-use planning and technological opportunities. Investment in rural areas can reduce pressure to migrate. {2.4.4,17.3}",27
2800,,27
2801,"Economic development has lifted billions of people out of poverty and enhanced access to health and education in most regions of the world (well established). Nevertheless, the ""Grow now, clean up later"" economic approach used in certain regions has not accounted for climate change, pollution or degraded natural systems. That approach has also contributed to increasing inequality within and between countries and will ultimately be more costly. It will not be able to sustainably support 10 billion healthy, fulfilled and productive people in 2050 without profound and urgent changes in consumption and production patterns. {2.5.1}",27
2802,"Decoupling of environmental degradation and resource use from economic growth and associated production and consumption patterns is required for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (well established). Partial decoupling between environmental pressures and economic growth can already be observed for some impacts and resources in certain countries. Further decoupling reguires the scaling-up of existing sustainable practices and more fundamental transitions in the ways in which we produce, consume and dispose of goods and materials across society. Those transitions are likely to be more effective if supported by long-term, comprehensive, science- based targets that provide the objective basis for future directions and actions. {2.5.1}",27
2803,"The growth in technological innovation since the 1990s has been unprecedented, both globally and historically, bringing many benefits to people's lives, but has also had some negative consequences (established but incomplete). Some technological and social innovations can reduce the environmental pressures associated with unsustainable consumption and production. Enhancing access to existing environmental technologies that are adapted to domestic circumstances could help countries to achieve environmental objectives more quickly. Application of precautionary approaches, according to international agreements (where applicable), to new technological innovations can reduce unintended negative consequences for human and ecosystem health. {2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4}",4
2804,"Countries that prioritize low-carbon, resource-efficient practices may gain a competitive advantage in the global economy (established but incomplete). Well-designed environmental policies and appropriate technologies and products can often be implemented in tandem at limited or no cost to growth and competitiveness and can expand the capacity of countries to develop and diffuse innovative technologies. That may be positive for employment and development, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and, ultimately, facilitating sustainable development (established but incomplete). {2.5.1}",4
2805,"Climate change is a priority issue affecting both human systems, including human health, and natural systems - air, biological diversity, freshwater, oceans and land - and which alters the complex interactions between those systems (well established). Historical and ongoing greenhouse gas emissions have committed the world to an extended period of climate change (well established), which is leading to global warming of air and ocean; rising sea-levels; melting glaciers, permafrost and Arctic sea ice; changes in carbon, biogeochemical and global water cycles; food security crises; fresh water scarcity; and more frequent and extreme weather events. Higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide also lead to ocean acidification and affect the composition, structure and functionality of ecosystems. Time is running out to prevent irreversible and dangerous impacts of climate change. Unless greenhouse gas emissions are radically reduced, the world is on course to exceed the temperature threshold set out in the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That makes climate change a global driver of environmental, social, health and economic impact and heightened society-wide risks. {2.7.3}",27
2806,"Society-wide risks associated with environmental degradation and climate change effects are generally more profound for people in a disadvantaged situation, particularly women and children in developing countries (established but incomplete). Many of the impacts outlined above are serious or irreversible and may lead to loss of livelihood, increased morbidity and mortality, and economic slowdown, and have greater potential for violent conflict, human mass migration and decreasing social resilience. Measures for more effective adaptation are now urgently required, especially for populations and regions which are in a vulnerable situation. {2.7.3}",27
2807,"The increasing scale, global reach and speed of change in those drivers of environmental change pose urgent challenges for managing environmental and climate change problems",27

In many domains, our scientific understanding of adverse, increasingly high impact is becoming more widespread, as is the understanding that the nature of change may sometimes be irreversible. The thematic priorities addressed by GEO-6 have been chosen and analysed with that context in mind and the summaries by theme have been organized to provide decision-makers with the most crucial insights within themes, including links to drivers and optional avenues for action. {2.7.3}",27

2813,"Emissions generated by human activity continue to alter the composition of the atmosphere, leading to air pollution, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion and exposure to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic chemicals (well established). {5.3}",27
2814,"Air pollution is the main environmental contributor to the global burden of disease, leading to between 6 million and 7 million premature deaths (well established) and welfare losses estimated at US$5 trillion annually (established but incomplete). Air pollution exposure, especially to fine particulate matter, is highest for urban residents in some countries with rapid urbanization trends (established but incomplete) and for the approximately 3 billion people who depend on burning fuels such as wood, coal, crop residue, dung and kerosene for cooking, heating and lighting (well established). The elderly, very young, ill and poor are more susceptible to the impact of air pollution (well established). {5.2.4, 5.4.1}",25
2815,"Globally, decreasing emission trends from local air pollutants in certain sectors and regions have been offset by larger increases in others, including some rapidly developing countries and areas of rapid urbanization (well established). Available data indicate that emissions decrease significantly when regulations are put in place. {5.2} International agreements have been successful in addressing specific chemicals. Both improvement of energy efficiency and pollution control techniques may be used to achieve lower air pollutant emissions. As controls have been placed on power plants, large industrial facilities and vehicles, the relative contribution of other sources, including agriculture, domestic fuel use, construction and other portable equipment, and forest or open fires, has grown in importance (established). Electricity generated from non-renewable resources and the fossil fuel production and consumption sectors (""energy"") is the largest anthropogenic emitting sector of S02 and non-methane volatile organic compounds and the main emitting sector of other air pollutants, including greenhouse gases. Global increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities have taken place in many parts of the world. Globally, economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in C02 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric concentrations of long-lived greenhouse gases continue to increase, driven primarily by fossil fuel extraction and use for electricity generation, industry and transport, although they are also affected by land use, land-use change, agriculture and forestry (well established). The evidence of current global climate change is unequivocal (well established). Since 1880, the global average surface temperature has increased by between approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius and 1.2 degrees Celsius (very likely). Eight of the ten warmest years on record have occurred within the past decade (virtually certain). If greenhouse gas emissions persist, global average temperatures will continue to increase at the current rate, crossing the temperature target agreed as part of the Paris Agreement between 2030 and 2052 (very likely). The Paris Agreement committed countries to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that doing so would significantly reduce the risks and impact of climate change. Current nationally determined contributions, presented in Paris in 2015, constitute only one third of the mitigation required to establish a least- cost pathway for staying well below 2 degrees Celsius (well established). {2.2, 2.7, 4.2.1, 5.2, 5.3.4} To maintain a good chance of remaining well below a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase, emissions need to drop by between 40 and 70 per cent globally between 2010 and 2050, falling to net zero by 2070. {2.7.4}",27
2816,"Achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires transformational changes leading to deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of emission sources and sinks (established but incomplete). In addition to emissions reductions for C02 the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (also called forcers), specifically black carbon, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons, provide opportunities to limit warming in the short term and are a critical component of an integrated climate change mitigation and air-quality management programme. However, since long-lived greenhouse gases dominate climate forcing in the long term, decreasing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants in the short term needs to be combined with mitigation of long-term greenhouse gases. (well established). {4.2.1, 5.3.4} Non-C02 emissions in pathways that limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius show deep reductions that are similar to those in pathways limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Government capacity and political will to manage air pollution and climate change varies significantly (well established). Some regions have well-developed systems of national-to-local policies and compliance and enforcement programmes (well established), although ambition levels in terms of both scope and policy may differ. In other regions, international agreements or national legislation may exist, but implementation and compliance and enforcement are often affected by weak national-to-local institutional capacity (established but incomplete). Future policy efforts can build upon renewed attention to those issues in international forums and several decades of experience with various governance strategies in different countries. Between 1998 and 2010, there was a five-fold increase in the number of national climate laws (more than 1,500 laws and policies worldwide) and by 2012 those laws covered 67 per cent of all emissions (well established). Some city and subnational governments are leading the way with benefits for other parts of their countries (well established). {5.4, 5.5,12}",27

Biodiversity refers to the diversity of living things at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels. It helps to regulate climate, filters air and water, enables soil formation and mitigates the impact of natural disasters.

A holistic and evidence-based approach, taking into account the full life-cycle approach to waste management should be applied. Cleaning up coasts and beaches can provide environmental, social and economic benefits, and trapping surface litter in the ocean may be effective in small areas, but such efforts should not distract from action to stop litter entering the ocean.

In doing so, synergies could be realized between improving health and nutrition, while reducing biodiversity loss, advancing habitat restoration and preventing land degradation and water scarcity. Phasing out the use of fossil fuels and moving towards lower-carbon-emission fuels, including sustainable bioenergy, would lead to important cobenefits, achieving both climate and air-quality targets, the latter also having synergies with improving human health, increasing agricultural production and reducing biodiversity loss. {22.4.2}",27

Land-based climate change mitigation, namely bioenergy crop production, and agricultural intensification are key measures for achieving climate and food targets respectively, but could have significant detrimental effects on other environmental targets if not managed carefully (well established). While nearly all scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement rely on land-based mitigation measures, their use increases demand for land and could thus have a potentially massive influence on land-use patterns and eventually lead to higher food prices, which would in turn affect food security. Increasing agricultural yields would improve overall food availability and reduce pressure on natural land. Applying unsustainable agriculture practices could lead to land degradation, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms, biodiversity loss and an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. {22.4.2}",27

Furthermore, such approaches can highlight gaps and blind spots in distributional equity, responsibility and capacity to address global environmental problems and their solutions. Participatory approaches can help to deliver context-relevant solutions. For example, decentralized renewable energy and microgrids fit neatly into many bottom-up sustainable visions that challenge traditionally modelled large- scale, centralized energy transitions. Accounting for regional differences, gender and other demographics are important for assessing and addressing problems, including the need for disaggregated data. Sustainable Development Goal policy design and implementation requires alignment of the collective wellbeing of actors from the local to other levels, taking into account in particular the needs of the vulnerable and most marginalized in society.

A healthy planet will result In people who live longer, healthier lives: nearly one quarter of all deaths globally in 2012 could be attributed to modifiable environmental risks, with a greater portion occurring in populations In a vulnerable situation and in developing countries. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goal targets on hunger, access to safe drinking water and sanitation and modern energy services could reduce deaths in children under 5 related to malnutrition, diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections by more than 400,000 per year by 2030. Furthermore, air pollution is the largest environmental health risk and is projected to continue to have significant negative effects on health, with scenario studies estimating between 4.5 million and 7 million premature deaths by mid-century under a business-as-usual scenario. Combined climate and air pollution policies could reduce those numbers significantly. {5.4.1, 21.3.3, 21.3.6, 22.3.2, 22.3.5, 23.12, 24.4}",27

Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, multilateral environmental agreements, internationally agreed environmental goals and science-based targets will require an integrated approach that considers linkage across different environmental and non-environmental components, building upon disaggregated data generation and incorporating traditional knowledge and citizen science. Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets needs to be followed up upon and reviewed, using the global indicators, complemented by indicators at the national and regional levels, and work is needed to develop the baselines for those targets for which national and global baseline data do not yet exist. Integrated data and analysis can prioritize needs, shape effective policies and strengthen monitoring and evaluation outcomes. {3.1,25.1}",27
2954,"Advances in collecting official statistics and other evidence that feed into geographic information systems for environmental monitoring and accounting have expanded knowledge, while highlighting data gaps in every environmental domain (well established). Such gaps limit our capacity to formulate and implement policy solutions. More data will assist in linking people with the environment. Time series data is vitally important in that regard, as it forms the basis for monitoring change. Regular standardized data collection can be translated into statistics and indicators that highlight vulnerabilities within and between communities. Disaggregated data that captures information by gender, ethnicity, race, income, age and geographic region identify critical differences and promote effective policy design. {3.5, 3.7}",27

Common frameworks, initiatives and political will are needed to merge data sources and make better use of what is available. In that context, the Framework for the Development of Environment Statistics, the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting and the System of National Accounts are robust consensus statistical frameworks and methodological approaches that could be broadly adopted (see figure SPM.9). Rationalizing both existing and newly collected data is essential for the development of indicators. {3.3}",27
2956,"Whether an indicator can be measured by Earth observation is a major factor in data availability (well established). A revolution in the quality and cost-effectiveness of Earth observation data means that indicators that can be measured remotely have far greater spatial coverage than those that cannot. For example, satellites can estimate deforestation and land use change with increasing accuracy, but cannot monitor all aspects of subsurface ocean environments. Data are particularly sparse for biodiversity, which is measured mostly by in situ observation and genetic analysis. Some freshwater components, such as groundwater and water use, are also data-deficient due to measurement challenges. The dichotomy in the volume of remotely sensed data versus in situ data will Inevitably grow as Earth observation technologies improve. {3.4}",27

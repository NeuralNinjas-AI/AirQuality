Strong demand for solar energy, triggered by concerns about global warming and oil prices, lifted profits at PV Crystalox Solar.

The company, one of the biggest manufacturers of silicon components for the solar electricity generation industry, said it expected 2007 profit to be ahead of analysts' estimates after ""a strong financial performance"" at the end of the year.

Earnings before interest and tax, excluding one-time costs, would not be less than Euros 70m (Pounds 52.2m) for the year to December 31, it said. Analysts had expected the company to report Ebit of about Pounds 46m for 2007.

Iain Dorrity, chief executive, said interest in renewable energy had grown rapidly as governments pushed companies to reduce carbon emissions and oil prices had climbed. ""The outlook for the industry is very good,"" he said. ""Demand shows no sign of abating.""

The European Photovoltaic Industry Association estimates the global market for solar power, measured by sales, will grow by an average of 37 per cent a year through to 2010.

Established in 1982, when the solar market was very small, PV Crystalox became the UK's largest solar energy float when its shares joined the main market last June.

The company exports 75 per cent of its products to Japan, where its biggest customer is Sharp. The rest is sold in Europe.

The company said the limited availability of feedstock was the only limitation in meeting demand for the multicrystalline silicone wafers used in solar electricity generation.

A new factory in Germany is expected to give the company its own source of silicon from 2009.

Shares in PV Crystalox Solar fell 2p to 153 1/2p. They are still trading 18 per cent above the 130p float price."

Paris and Berlin are among seven capitals to have written to Brussels urging clarity on the overhaul of the bloc's emissions trading scheme. The move reflects the challenge raised by the EU's efforts to fight climate change and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The letter, sent on Friday to both the European Commission and the Slovenian EU presidency, is signed by Christine Lagarde, France's economy minister, and Michael Glos, minister for economic affairs in Germany, among others.

Other supporters include Austria, Luxembourg, Finland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.

The countries say industries - especially those that are energy-intensive - need more clarity on their contribution to climate change measures.

""Medium and long-term investment planning requires certainty on the future framework as soon as possible,"" they say."
"NATIONAL NEWS, Tuesday, February 19, 2008 345 mots, p. Page 4",,Top executives slow to adopt climate change strategy,By JOHN WILLMAN,,"Very few senior executives have a strategy in place for dealing with climate change, despite the overwhelming view that it is a serious issue for business, a survey has found.

Most top executives in the survey were not aware that the government had committed itself to a 60 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The findings also showed half the corporate leaders thought the government was doing too little to educate business on how to tackle climate change.

Carried out by YouGov Stone for KPMG, the study also found the number of executives who think climate change a significant issue rose sharply last year, from 52 per cent in May to 85 per cent six months later.

Three-quarters of the 200 corporate leaders - from the FTSE-350 and similar-sized private companies - thought climate change would grow in importance as an issue over the next few years.

Seventy per cent said reducing greenhouse gas emissions was the most important method of reducing global warming, while 76 per cent said businesses and individuals needed to change the way they worked and lived and take steps to tackle climate change

However, the number with a clear strategy for tackling climate change increased much less over the period, from 14 to 17 per cent.

While 40 per cent in the latest survey said they felt they had a good understanding of the issue and were working on a strategy, 36 per cent had only a vague or no understanding and 6 per cent did not believe climate change was happening.

A third of the companies had not put climate change on their board's agenda, while a fifth said it was unlikely to be discussed by the board in the near future.

The most popular measure for tackling climate change was recycling and using recycled products - adopted by more than three-quarters of the companies. Two-thirds were using energy-efficient appliances, and half were educating and training staff on environmentally friendly business practices.

Just 22 per cent were aiming for carbon neutral status, while 31 per cent were reviewing their business model in the light of climate change. ""Our survey shows the majority of business leaders still don't treat climate change as an economic issue that can have an impact on the bottom line,"" said Richard Sharman, head of KPMG's carbon advisory group.

""Knowing your carbon number is becoming a key performance indicator that employees, regulators and shareholders demand accuracy and assurances on."""
"COMMENT, Thursday, February 28, 2008 642 mots, p. Page 13",,Stop penalising consumers for climate change,By DAVID HOWELL,,"T he campaign for a sustainable, low-carbon future is not going well. A Norwegian Arctic measuring station last week reported that carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere had reached a new peak, at 394 parts per million, heading for the danger levels at which we are told violent climate change will set in.

Meanwhile, an FT/Harris poll tells us that two-thirds of western European consumers are reluctant to pay more on their sky-high energy bills to cut emissions and subsidise renewables, while European industry's grumbles at the prospect of higher energy costs and even more ferocious lower-cost competition from Asia are growing louder.

And although China and India are worried about the long-term impact of global warming, their colossal programmes of coal-fired power stations are going ahead as fast as ever, guaranteeing that, however virtuous the western example, CO 2 will continue to rise fast in the atmosphere.

What is going wrong? The green establishment, which has captured the attention of policy-thinkers and makers, has a simple explanation - market failure. Its ""answer"" is more taxes, penalties and charges on the demand side and more public spending on the supply side. But it is not working. People are duly worried about the planet's future, but when it comes to action their concerns are more immediate - how to stay warm and pay utility bills; how to keep down manufacturing costs in the west; and, in the poorer half of the world, how to find food and water, how to lift themselves out of poverty and achieveeconomic growth - based on plentiful cheap energy.

The grand ""penalise and subsidise"" strategy, proclaimed at global gatherings and by the European Commission, is therefore in serious danger of hitting a political brick wall. When long-term aspiration meets short-term desperation the outcome is predictable. The speeches will be made, the targets will be set, the elaborate schemes for pricing carbon will be promulgated,large sums of public money will be spent. But carbon levels will go on rising and the sustainable planetary future will remain out of reach.

Might it not be time to pause and listen to voices telling us that the whole approach badly needs changing?

Step one would be to prevent ministers talking about the extra power bills it is our painful duty to pay and start offering an immediate future of lower energy costs. The need is to associate a greener future not with still higher gas and electricity bills, or with dubious payback calculations decades ahead, but with lower utility bills now.

Step two is to let Dollars 100 oil do the ""taxing"" and incentivising. No further green consumer taxes - over and above the already ferocious ones on petrol - are required. The driving factor is that this time (as opposed to experience in the 1980s) oil will stay expensive.The private sector will research, develop and deliver the biofuels that make commercial and environmental sense.

The same goes for wind farms, for which the UK consumer is paying some of the highest subsidies in Europe on their already inflated electricity bills - with questionable results. Markets will filter out the unprofitable wind projects and leave the few good ones to make money. The same goes for new nuclear power. Press the nuclear industry to compete and deliver even safer plants, built more quickly and with less toxic waste, and it will do so - maybe with a bit of planning help but without levies on the already overlevied consumer.

Step three - probably the least popular in some circles - is to face the fact that the multiple opportunities for innovation and development in low and clean energy are going to come from private sector technology and privately financed research. Government-funded research will make the wrong choices and crowd out the market winners.

There are hundreds of new energy and energy-saving technologies ready to be marketed as demand grows in richer societies for cleaner energy. By all means rejig the tax systems to make ""green"" commercial innovations increasingly attractive, but at all cost avoid subsidising energy scams such as dubious carbon offsetting schemes.

The renewables that can survive only on subsidy and the technologies that get by only on ill-judged government grants are delaying and crowding out the real advance towards a low-carbon world. And the levies, fines and taxes being piled on to users to finance them are turning what ought to be a positive cause into one that is not only negative in its appeal but certain to founder in face of political obstacles.

"COMMENT, Friday, February 29, 2008 580 mots, p. Page 11",,"If climate sceptics are right, it is time to worry",By PAUL KLEMPERER,,"Al Gore says the science on global warming is clear and there is a major problem. Vaclav Klaus, Czech president, contends that climate change forecasts are speculative and unreliable. Whose claims are scarier?

Of course, Mr Klaus exaggerates (he is a politician) but if he is partly right, we should be more concerned, not less. Consider an analogy. If, like many of my neighbours in Oxford, you believe that new building exacerbates flooding, how would you feel if models that predicted bad news were discredited?

It depends. If the original models were biased, your best guess of the height of future floods is now lower. But if the models merely underestimated the uncertainty, the range of plausible outcomes is now greater, so flood defences would need to be higher for us to feel safe.

Likewise, if our understanding of climate systems is flawed, our best guess about the dangers we face may be less pessimistic, but extreme outcomes are more likely.

Mr Klaus is probably right that there are fewer certainties than many claim. Even commentators who support the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change point to methodological weaknesses in its economics. A High Court judge recently required that a list of ""scientific errors"" be sent to schools that show Mr Gore's remarkable polemic, An Inconvenient Truth - confirming the impression that the film goes some way beyond established facts (Mr Gore is also a politician).

But we hardly need Mr Klaus to teach us that experts' models can be incomplete and a strong consensus can be badly flawed. Financial Times readers do not need reminding that, only last summer, hedge fund managers found their stock market models' predictions were, in their own words, ""25 standard deviations"" from the outcomes; that, less than two years ago, a new drug nearly killed six human volunteers in tests in London, even though the dose was 1-500th of the amount administered to animals; or that it was a complete ""out of model"" surprise to biologists that feeding bonemeal to cattle would cause an epidemic of mad cow disease.

How confident can we be about the way a system as complex as earth will respond to conditions it has never encountered before? Although greater uncertainty means climate change might be less bad than we fear - for example, an ""iris"" effect means increases in cloud cover may slow global warming - it also means it might be much worse. While the central predictions of climate change models are arguably not so much worse than many other difficult problems the world faces, the worst possibilities are far, far nastier.

Consider the ""clathrate gun hypothesis"" that warming seas could lead to clathrates (the frozen chunks of methane at the bottom of the sea) exploding into the air, which is what might have caused mass extinction at the end of the Permian era. Or the concern that the carbon dioxide could cause hydrogen sulphide gas to build up first in the oceans then in the atmosphere, exterminating most of life (and potentially also attacking the ozone layer, permitting the sun's ultraviolet radiation to kill remaining life) - this, too, has been blamed for previous mass extinctions.

I am not losing any sleep about these specific scenarios. In part that is because they seem so improbable (in spite of Mr Klaus's eloquent expositions of how little we really know). But it is also because the fact that we have already thought of these risks means that, if it becomes necessary, we probably have time to organise a last-ditch geoengineering solution (seeding the ocean with an antidote, for example) that would at least mitigate the very worst consequences.

But what of completely unanticipated possibilities? Even Donald Rumsfeld, former US defence secretary, understood that it is the ""unknown unknowns"" that should really worry us. Serious scientists worry that feedback effects such as release of methane from the Siberian permafrost (or those underwater clathrates), or reductions in the earth's reflectivity due to polar ice loss, could cause

runaway greenhouse warming, with unforeseeable outcomes that would look like bad science fiction from today's perspective.

The continuing scientific uncertainty about the pace of climate change should make us more concerned, not less. And it is those who doubt the climatologists' models who should be the most frightened.

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, March 3, 2008 183 mots, p. Page 2",,Climate change poses 'security risk',By ANDREW BOUNDS,,"Climate change poses ""serious security risks"" and fighting it should be part of ""preventive security policy"", according to the European Union's top diplomats, writes Andrew Bounds in Brussels.

The warning is contained in a paper prepared for an EU summit this month by Javier Solana, the bloc's foreign policy chief, and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, external relations commissioner.

The paper, seen by Financial Times Deutschland and the FT, says increased natural disasters and shortages of water, food and other resources in the developing world could affect European security.

The threat of water wars is particularly grave in the Middle East. Two-thirds of the Arab world relies on external supplies.

""Existing tensions over access to water are almost certain to intensify in the region, leading to further political instability with detrimental implications for Europe's energy security and other interests. Water supply in Israel might fall by 60 per cent over this century,"" the paper says.

It anticipates falling harvests in Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Saudi Arabia, creating instability there.

""Climate change will fuel conflicts over depleting resources, especially where access to those resources is politicised,"" it says, citing the fighting in Darfur.

It points to seven threats, including disappearing islands and coastlines, increased migration, a new scramble for resources in the Arctic and greater competition for access to energy."

The European Environment Agency said that the EU would have hit its Kyoto protocol target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions 8 per cent between 1990 and 2012 years ago had it not been for the fast increase from transport. All other sectors of the economy cut emissions between 1990 and 2005, its report said, while transport grew 26 per cent.

""Transport has been a free-rider for too long when it comes to the fight against global warming and carbon emissions,"" said Jacqueline McGlade, chief executive of the agency.

She said investment was still skewed towards roads and airports rather than rail and sea.

"COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL, Monday, March 10, 2008 338 mots, p. Page 21",,US airlines pressed on climate change,By JONATHAN BIRCHALL,,"US airline companies are facing shareholder resolutions on climate change for the first time this year.

This reflects the spread of investor concerns over environmental risks, which were previously focused largely on the power and energy -sectors.

US Airways and SouthWest Airlines are both facing resolutions that call on them to report on strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

A similar resolution against Continental Airlines has been withdrawn, after the company agreed to respond.

The airlines join retailers such as Best Buy, RiteAid and Kroger and home building companies Standard Pacific and Centex, which are also being asked to give details of their efforts to assess and reduce their output of greenhouse gas.

The resolutions are among 54 climate change-related resolutions filed by investors this year.

This is more than double the number filed two years ago, according to Mindy Lubber of Ceres, a non-profit partnership of investors and environmental groups.

""The bottom line is the growing interest in investors and their need for this kind of information . . . investors need this information in order to make smart investment decisions,"" said Ms Lubber.

Calstrs, the powerful California teachers' retirement fund, has also filed its first climate-change resolutions this year.

These are aimed at Dynegy, the power company, and Oneok.

ConocoPhillips and Chevron, the oil and gas companies, are also facing new resolutions reflecting concern about the environmental impact of oil sands mining in Canada.

Citigroup will face a resolution calling on it to end financing of ""mountain top removal"" coal mining, and for coal-fired power plant projects.

Bank of America won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject a similar proposal.

More than a dozen of the resolutions have been withdrawn so far, after companies responded to the issues raised.

Four have been blocked by the SEC in response to company claims that they had interfered in ""ordinary business"".

Last year, 43 similar shareholder resolutions secured an average 21 per cent of shareholders' votes.

Laura Shaffer, of the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which has filed resolutions, calling on US homebuilders to report on efforts to increase energy efficiency in their houses, said the sector had yet to respond to concerns about the environment.

""At this point the industry as a whole is not doing so much disclosure,"" she said.

In September, 11 state institutional investors joined a petition calling on the SEC to require companies to report regularly on how climate change may affect their business."
"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, March 11, 2008 425 mots, p. Page 8",,Climate change 'threatens' Europe's energy resources,By TONY BARBER,,"Climate change poses serious security risks for the European Union, ranging from sharper competition for global energy resources to the arrival of numerous ""environmental migrants"", warns a report prepared for an EU summit this week.

""The core challenge is that climate change threatens to overburden states and regions which are already fragile and conflict-prone,"" says the report, drafted by Javier Solana and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU's two highest-level foreign policy officials.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc are expected to endorse the report's conclusions at their summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday and to ask for recommendations for follow-up action by December at the latest.

The report is the EU's first in-depth study of the impact of global warming on the bloc's foreign and security policies. It identifies several regions where climate change appears all too likely to threaten the EU's security or damage its political and economic interests.

In the Middle East, for example, ""existing tensions over access to water are almost certain to intensify . . . leading to further political instability with detrimental implications for Europe's energy security and other interests"".

The report hints at possible problems with Russia over the Arctic's vast energy and mineral reserves, recalling how Russian scientists last year planted a Russian flag on the seabed under the North Pole. ""A further dimension of competition for energy resources lies in potential conflict over resources in Polar regions which will become exploitable as a consequence of global warming,"" the report says.

It says the EU must expect a substantial increase in the number of migrants attempting to enter the EU, because millions of people will flee poverty, political and ethnic conflicts, ill health and environmental damage in other parts of the planet, especially Africa.

Higher temperatures, less rainfall, rising sea levels and worse harvests are increasing migratory pressures from Africa to Europe, the report says. ""Already today climate change is having a major impact on the conflict in and around Darfur.""

As global warming submerges land, perhaps even causing some island states to disappear, and as coastlines recede, ""more disputes over land and maritime borders and other territorial rights are likely"", the report predicts.

It warns of environmental disasters and humanitarian crises in Asia, the Caribbean and Central America that will place ""immense pressure on the resources of donor countries"" such as the EU's member-states.

Competition for resources will intensify because of ""reduction of arable land, widespread shortage of water, diminishing food and fish stocks, increased flooding and prolonged droughts"", it says.

Climate change could also fuel conflicts between ethnic and religious groups, make populations more radical in their political views and make it harder for the EU to uphold its vision of a rule-based international order.

""The multilateral system is at risk if the international community fails to address the threats. Climate change impacts will fuel the politics of resentment between those most responsible for climate change and those most affected by it...and drive political tension nationally and internationally,"" the report warns."
"MARKETS & INVESTING, Thursday, January 10, 2008 281 mots, p. Page 27",,UBS to launch climate change derivatives index,By PAUL J DAVIES,,"The first derivatives index designed to track the greenhouse effect is set to be launched in coming days by UBS, allowing investors to bet on the combined impact of carbon emissions and rising global temperatures.

The index follows on from the Swiss bank's launch of the first global warming index last year and adds to a growing number of products from banks aimed at encouraging a broader range of investors to bet on the effects of climate change.

Both retail and institutional investors will be able to buy exposure to, or short sell, the UBS Greenhouse Index in much the same way they would the FTSE or Dow Jones stock market indices.

The level of the index will rise as the price of carbon emissions credits and global temperatures rise.

Ilija Murisic, executive director of hybrid derivatives trading at UBS, said that the new index increased the sophistication of the climate exposure investors could take oncompared with its global warming index, which had attracted more than Dollars 100m of trades since its launch last April.

""If the Global Warming Index was the iPod, the Greenhouse Index is the iPhone,"" he said.

The index will be based half on the global warming index, which uses weather derivative contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and half on exposure to emissions futures from two sources.

The larger part of the emissions side is based on the European Climate Exch-ange, the most liquid market for EU carbon emissions credits, which traded about 1bn tonnes of carbon last year. The remainder is based on the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism traded on Nord Pool, which tracks the value of credits awarded to groups for investment in clean energy or emissions reductions projects.

Barclays Capital launched a global carbon index last month based on the same two markets.

The EU emissions trading system and the Kyoto carbon credits created a market worth Dollars 30bn in 2006, said the World Bank, which should release data for last year in coming weeks."
"LEADER, Monday, March 17, 2008 343 mots, p. Page 8",,Climate protection Europe must be bolder to tackle global warming,,,"For the European Union to venture out of the slow lane with a pledge to adopt by 2009 binding targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions is therefore a bigger achievement than it sounds.

The agreement by 27 nations at last week's EU summit could go on to shape a wider international deal. More is the pity, then, that special pleading to protect some of the bloc's biggest industrial polluters risks undermining that progress.

Tough targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions should be an important part of a successor treaty to the Kyoto protocol, which is due to expire in 2012. As long as the targets are legally binding, and not merely voluntary, they could provide a robust framework for making the deep cuts in emissions that will be needed to avert global warming.

Yet targets will achieve little on their own. Make them too ambitious - the EU wants a 20 per cent cut from 1990 levels by 2020 - and they are unlikely to be met. Impose too many and they become valueless. They can only be effective if there are strong economic incentives in place to change consumer and business behaviour. That means putting a price on carbon dioxide.

On this trickier issue, instead of forging common ground on how to reform the EU's emissions trading scheme so it contributes to a stable carbon price, the summit exposed divisions between member states.

Germany led a group of nations who wanted to set out next year measures that would protect energy-intensive industries from rivals in countries such as China that have less ambitious carbon emissions programmes. They fear production could move elsewhere if the EU takes the lead on penalising emissions. A compromise agreed on action if there was no accord at a world conference in December 2009.

The erosion of margins and risk to jobs should other countries fail to impose tough standards are valid concerns. But this was the wrong moment to try to water down commitments. America's policy on global warming - it has opposed binding emissions cuts - may change after a new US president is elected in November. The EU would have no credibility if it drew up get-out clauses now, while America would have less cause to shift its position.

Calls, too, for import tariffs to be imposed on countries with lower environmental standards smack of protectionism and encourage a tit-for-tat response. If Europe's leaders are serious about setting an example, they will have to be bolder."
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, March 24, 2008 613 mots, p. 06",,Investment is key in climate change battle,By Kevin Parker,,"Until recently, it was remarkably difficult for ordinary investors to put their own money behind the fight against global warming. Mutual funds, most people's investment vehicle of choice, offered few options.

That has changed thanks to government legislation and a new awareness among many of the world's investment professionals that climate change is an opportunity, not a threat. In a little more than two years, we estimate retail investors all over the world have pumped around $66bn (£33bn, €42bn) into more than 200 newly launched mutual funds and exchange traded funds investing in companies that help to mitigate or adapt to climate change.

This is a mere drop in the ocean of the $26,000bn held globally in mutual funds of all kinds. But that just emphasises how much further climate change investing can and, indeed, must go as the world economy reshapes itself to adapt to the greenhouse effect.

Government regulation makes the rules and can set the world on the path of change but ultimately it will be the alignment with business that will drive the process forward. This is where the fund management industry will play a central, transformative role.

On the one hand, it must raise the awareness of retail and institutional investors on the issues of climate change, both scientific and economic. Better informed investors are the key to unlocking a potentially vast store of capital.

Two things stand out about the money that has flowed into climate change funds so far. One is that the response so far has been strongly retail. The other is that a mere $55m of the money invested in new funds has come from the US. In short, the institutional and US markets have as yet hardly entered the fray.

On the other hand, the fund management industry will be chiefly responsible for mobilising and funnelling capital towards those companies that are engaged in adapting to or mitigating climate change. Fund managers will be guided not by their individual whims but by the imperative of producing healthy investment returns.

While climate change began as an ethical issue, the impact of government regulation and corporate business decisions is turning it into a major economic force.

At Deutsche Asset Management, we see it as an economic theme with associated ""green"" attributes - not the other way around. It will be a large enough economic force for the foreseeable future to lead to market information inefficiencies and offers significant alpha opportunities for those investors who can discern the trend.

So where do we expect to find these opportunities? Investors have recently paid a lot of attention to renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar.

For a total solution to global warming, those technologies will have to be perfected but they still have a very long way to go and they tend to be expensive - high risk, in other words. That's shown through in the volatility and fanciful valuations of some companies in this sector, prompting dire warnings of a ""bubble"" in climate change investing. It's more accurate to regard it as the inevitable ups and downs of a new market, particularly where capital can at times chase the speculative end of the spectrum.

We believe that the less risky area for investors, at least in the near term, is the wide range of existing, tested and often low-cost technologies. Most of them fall under the heading of ""improved efficiency""; building insulation, fuel efficiency in lighting systems, air-conditioning, water heating, and so on.

To take one example, the Clinton Climate Initiative has pointed out that buildings contribute about 40 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, and about 70 per cent of the emissions of major cities such as London and New York. Action will have to be taken to reduce this output. That will create a potentially explosive market for investors in the known technologies required to improve buildings' carbon footprint.

The fact that most of these technologies are relatively low cost compared with trendier technologies such as most renewable energy and carbon capture is a bonus because this is where cost-conscious governments will focus first.

Moderate cost plus simplicity will encourage their use through government regulation.

That does not mean it will always be simple to identify alpha. Many of the industry themes are global but local and regional variations are likely to be large.

Different conditions and regulations in different countries will produce specific local opportunities. It will take the resources of professional asset managers to find them."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Monday, March 24, 2008 419 mots, p. 10",,EU's dangerous decision on climate change that may lead to a trade war,,,"Sir, A profoundly ill-conceived decision by the European Union leaders on March 14 could pave the way for a global trade war over climate policy. The decision opens up the possibility for the EU to impose trade barriers on countries with a less ambitious climate agenda than the EU. The risk of ""carbon leakage"" can be allowed to trigger compensatory tariffs on products imported from countries outside of the EU's emission trading system. Sadly, the decision satisfies a cynical alliance of environmentalists and Europe's energy intensive industry.

First, EU-initiated trade barriers could provoke a global trade war between the EU on the one hand and countries such as the US, China, India and Brazil on the other. European climate tariffs would in turn lead to raised tariffs on EU products exported to these countries. China, for instance, could insist on tariffs that reflect western Europe's three times higher emissions per capita - a potentially high cost for European companies selling to China.

Above all, a global trade war would hurt the prospects of successful negotiations for a new global agreement on capping greenhouse gas emissions. Winning trade disputes in the World Trade Organisation could become a higher priority than an agreement fighting climate change. EU climate tariffs would be construed as confirming developing countries' old suspicion that rich countries' environmental arguments is protectionism in disguise. The follow-up agreement to the Doha round is another likely victim.

Second, German and French governments are wrong and follow lobbyists' train of thought when they argue for border protection of energy-intensive industries. In fact, it is not sectors that compete with each other on the global market, but the quality and price of individual products are being compared. The steel industries in Europe, for example in my home country Sweden, rarely produce the same products as their competitors in China, India or the US. To survive, European steel companies should produce more sophisticated and skill-intensive products than China and India. The argument is also often applicable to EU competition with energy-intensive US companies. Border protection formulated to cover entire sectors and affecting hundreds, or thousands, of different products would in any case be far too encompassing.

Third, how should EU deal with countries outside the its climate policy, but with which it wants close relations and preferential trade agreements? Should they be exempted from the EU's climate tariffs? This concerns all countries around the Mediterranean, EU candidate states such as Croatia and Turkey, countries with a ""membership perspective"" and a large group of former colonies. Exempting these countries would make them attractive places for re-exportation of goods to the EU from, for example. China, India, the US and Brazil, as the goods could escape the EU's climate tariffs with the help of a little corruption and a change of origin.

From every perspective, climate tariffs would create a big bag of problems for the EU's external relations and be a counter-productive climate policy.

However, for many organisations ,travel is the lifeblood that enables them to deliver quality of service and forge commercial relationships crucial to their success.

Although travel will clearly have a big impact on a businesses' environmental credentials, it is important to remember that emissions relating to aviation are only one element of an organisation's carbon footprint. Aviation in the UK accounts for about 38m tonnes of carbon dioxide compared with the country's overall carbon footprint of 555m tonnes.

Businesses should take steps to avoid excessive or unnecessary flights and sustainability must be factored into their travel policies. However, for a company serious about its credentials, efforts to address the carbon impact of international travel should form part of its broader attempts to reduce carbon emissions - both in its own operations and across its supply chain.

In recent months the need to tackle climate change has become increasingly apparent. Legislative pressure in the form of the Energy White Paper and the Climate Change Bill, which made the UK's commitment to a 60 per cent reduction in its carbon emissions by 2050 legally binding for the first time, will no doubt weigh heavily on companies across the country. Following the recent budget announcement, the Climate Change Bill targets may increase even further to 80 per cent, so there is little sign this pressure will ease. Recent severe weather has also served as an immediate and tangible reminder of the consequences of climate change, disrupting the day-to-day running of some UK organisations and - as with last summer's floods - prompting concerns about business continuity. Carbon Trust research shows larger organisations in the UK are most likely to have seen the impact of climate change, with 43 per cent of business leaders saying they have already been affected.

So there is no denying the threat climate change poses but what of the associated opportunities? Cutting carbon use makes good business sense, especially in light of increasing consumer pressure. In research undertaken by Ipsos Mori in 2007, more than 75 per cent of consumers agreed that if they had more information about a company's social, environmental and ethical behaviour, this would influence their purchasing decisions. As climate change becomes an important issue for corporate reputations, it makes sense for companies to differentiate themselves from their competitors by proving to customers that they are serious about it.

Essentially, saving carbon saves money. Quick-win, low- and no-cost measures can have a substantial impact on most businesses and, once short-term savings are realised, the money can be re-invested in cost- effective measures that require higher levels of capital investment, such as installing energy efficient equipment. In the longer term, these savings can filter down to benefit stakeholders, employees and customers.

Only 1 per cent of UK businesses actually know their carbon footprint and 93 per cent of small and medium-sized businesses say their company does not measure carbon emissions because of a lack of expertise. Measurement of an organisation's carbon footprint is often seen as the first step in the process of cutting emissions so these make for worrying findings. By calculating the impact businesses have in terms of carbon emissions, companies can set manageable targets and create policies and action plans for change. Given that there is a great deal of advice and support available - the Carbon Trust has a free carbon calculator - there is clearly still a long way to go if UK businesses are to become the international leaders in the fight against climate change. However, given the economic benefits, the legislative pressures and consumer's increasing propensity for green products and services, inaction is no longer an option.

The debate around business travel is no doubt one that will continue, particularly in the light of the proposed Heathrow expansion. Despite the media attention that developments of this nature invariably generate, it is important organisations remain focused on the bigger picture, and make efforts to reduce all elements of their carbon footprint, rather than simply fixating on an important, but nonetheless isolated, component.

However, change is definitely in the air. Last year will be remembered as the year that business sat up and really took notice of climate change. The Carbon Trust received an unprecedented level of interest from businesses asking for advice. We need many more businesses to explore innovative ways in which they can respond to the impact of climate change. Whether it is re-thinking products, saving money through lower energy bills or opening up new markets, 2008 should be remembered as the year in which carbon reduction took centre stage."
"LEX COLUMN, Saturday, April 5, 2008 251 mots, p. 16",,Climate change risks,,,"Such analysis is problematic. Irrespective of one's view on climate change, very long-term risk assessment is anathema to most companies, as KPMG acknowledges. Management incentive plans, not to mention the time horizons of even the most conservative institutional investors, are unable to confront risks beyond a few years. Even if they could, computer models or highly paid futurists cannot forecast outcomes with the accuracy needed to generate a measurable economic return.

There are shorter-term trends to consider, but navigating these risks is what shareholders expect from management. Most companies have already pushed environmental issues to the front of their homepages and annual reports. But tomorrow's concerns may be different. Just as Aids or developing-world poverty drifted from the forefront of public consciousness, the focus on climate change may dim if the global economic slowdown gathers pace. Then, say, how a company's workers are treated may be the hot topic.

Companies spend a lot protecting their reputation and trying to avoid litigation. Regulations are also monitored closely. But the intensity of all three risks is linked to the mood of the day. KPMG may be right that the tourism sector, in particular, fails to appreciate the physical effects of climate change. But the other risks are next to impossible to prepare for in the long run. One day food companies may find themselves on top of European regulation, only to discover a Hollywood actor has converted the entire US to veganism."
"COMMENT, Monday, April 7, 2008 671 mots, p. 13",,Stop this foolish overreaction to climate change,Nigel Lawson,,"Over the past five years I have become increasingly concerned at the scaremongering of the climate alarmists, which has led the governments of Europe to commit themselves to a drastic reduction in carbon emissions, regardless of the economic cost of doing so. The subject is such a complex one, involving science, economics and politics in almost equal measure, that to do it justice I have written a book, albeit a short one, thoroughly referenced and sourced. But the bare bones are clear.

First, given the so-called greenhouse effect, the marked and largely man-made increase in carbon dioxide concentrations in the earth's atmosphere has no doubt contributed to the modest 20th century warming of the planet. But what remains a matter of unresolved dispute among climate scientists is how great a contribution it has made, compared with the natural factors affecting the earth's climate.

The majority view among climate scientists, as set out in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is that ""most"" of the slight (0.5ºC) warming in the last quarter of the 20th century was ""very likely"" caused by man-made carbon dioxide emissions. On that basis, and relying on computer models, its ""best guess"" of the likely rise in mean global temperature over the next 100 years is between 1.8ºC and 4ºC.

These projections were made, incidentally, before the recent acknow-ledgement that so far this century there has been no further global warming at all - in spite of a continuing rapid rise in carbon emissions.

Be that as it may, the IPCC goes on to estimate what the impact of the projected warming would be. It does so on the explicit basis of two assumptions. The first is that, while the developed world can adapt to warming, the developing world lacks the capacity to do so. The second is that, even in the developed world, adaptive capacity is constrained by the limits of existing technology - that is to say, there will be no further technological development over the next 100 years.

The first, distinctly patronising, assumption is almost certainly false. But even it were true it would mean only that, should the need arise, overseas aid programmes would be tailored to ensure that the developing world did acquire the necessary adaptive capacity. The second is self-evidently absurd, not least in the case of food production, given the ongoing developments in bio-engineering and genetic modification.

It is, however, on this flawed basis that the IPCC reckons that, if the rise in global temperature over the next 100 years is as much as 4ºC, it would be likely to cost anything between 1 per cent and 5 per cent of global gross domestic product, albeit much more than this in the developing world and less in the developed world.

Even if that were so, what would it mean? Suppose the loss to the developing world were as much as 10 per cent of GDP, then - given the IPCC's economic growth assumptions, on which its emissions assumptions, and hence its warming assumptions, are based- it would imply that, by 2100 or thereabouts, people in the developing world, instead of being some 9.5 times as well off as they are today, would be ""only"" some 8.5 times as well off - which would still leave them better off than people in the developed world today. This, then, is the scale of the alleged threat to the planet - based, to repeat, on the IPCC's grossly inflated estimate of the likely damage from further warming, arising from its absurdly gloomy view of mankind's ability to adapt.

Indeed, given that warming produces benefits as well as costs, it is far from clear that for the people of the world as a whole, the currently projected warming, even if it occurs, would cause any net harm at all. By contrast, slowing down world economic growth, by shifting to much more expensive noncarbon sources of energy, would be massively costly, as Dieter Helm, Britain's foremost energy economist, has recently spelt out.

That is one good reason why the sought-after global agreement to cut back drastically on carbon dioxide emissions, embracing China, India and the other major developing countries, is not going to happen. But two very real dangers remain.

The first is that the European Union, which already has the bit between its teeth on this issue, will severely damage its own economy by deciding to set an example to the world. And the second is that it will seek to limit that damage, as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and others are already urging, by imposing trade barriers against those countries that are not prepared to accept mandatory cuts in their emissions.

A lurch into protectionism, and the rolling back of globalisation, would do far more damage to the world economy in general and to the developing countries in particular than could conceivably result from the projected resumption of global warming.

It is high time this folly ended.

"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, April 8, 2008 267 mots, p. 4",,WHO sends climate change distress call,By Frances Williams in Geneva,,"Countries must make urgent preparations to cope with adverse health impacts of climate change that could kill millions, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.

Rising global temperatures threatened more deaths and disease from malnutrition, storms and floods, water shortages, heat waves and pollution, and insect-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, the UN agency said.

""The core concern is succinctly stated: climate change endangers human health,"" Margaret Chan, the WHO director-general, said in a statement to mark World Health Day. ""While the reality of climate change can no longer be doubted, the magnitude of consequences, and most especially for health, can still be reduced.""

Poorer nations needed help to shore up fragile health systems and better systems for disease surveillance and forecasting. She urged leaders of the Group of Eight industrialised nations to address this at their Japan summit next month.

Estimates of health impact of climate change vary, but there is widespread agreement at a global level they will be negative, substantial and affect developing countries most severely.

In a November report, the UN development programme said 600m more people in sub-Saharan Africa would go hungry from collapsing agriculture. Another 400m people would be exposed to malaria and other diseases.

Malnutrition causes about 3.5m deaths each year. Periodic drought, a main cause, is to increase. Extreme weather, especially storms and floods, threatens more deaths and injuries, and outbreaks such as cholera.

Water scarcity and torrential rainfall increase the risk of diarrhoeal disease. Changing temperatures and rainfall patterns will spread malarial mosquitoes and other insect vectors.

Heatwaves in crowded urban ""heat islands"" could kill many elderly, as during the European heatwave of 2003, and aggravate allergies - such as hay fever - and atmospheric pollution.

""Climate change can affect problems that are already huge, largely concentrated in the developing world, and difficult to combat,"" Dr Chan said."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Wednesday, April 9, 2008 331 mots, p. 12",,IPCC report's findings ignored,,,"Sir, Nigel Lawson's promotion of his new book (""Stop this foolish overreaction to climate change"", April 6) does his readers a disservice by ignoring the Stern review and the new literature on the risks of climate change. The review estimated the costs at between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of world gross domestic product, depending on an assessment of the risks and treatment of the discount rate.

The review used the ethical principle that the valuations of human lives and health should not be discounted at market rates, and this assumption, together with a better treatment of risk yielded much higher costs than the 1 to 5 per cent from earlier studies quoted in the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report.

Lord Lawson has not explained that the climate problem is one of stocks of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and since CO2 is a very long-lived gas, each tonne emitted gives rise to damage over the indefinite future. Since we are very likely to be experiencing damage at present, the outlook is that this will get progressively worse.

Taking loss of life into account means that future costs are already likely to be immeasurable, and warrant strong urgent action for all of us, but most of all from governments acting together. Far from damaging the economy of Europe, the European Union's unilateral climate policies will improve the well-being of its citizens, and benefit its economy through development of new technologies, such as wind power, to export to the rest of the world. However, the point of the EU policy is to support global action.

Lord Lawson has also ignored the Stern review's and IPCC report's conclusions on the costs of mitigation. The literature suggests that these costs will be in the range of 1 per cent of GDP with a range of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The IPCC reports that world GDP could be higher if policies are well-designed and encourage technological co-operation. At this time of collapsing credit, concerted Group of Eight action to establish long-term prices of carbon, perhaps around $100 per tonne of CO2 by 2020, together with new standards and agreements for low-carbon technologies, would support new business investment and the global economy.

"BOOK REVIEW, Monday, April 14, 2008 637 mots, p. 8",,The climate heretic's handbook,,,"Now that the matter has been settled to almost everyone's satisfaction, sceptics are derided as ""climate-change deniers"" - akin to Holocaust deniers in their moral turpitude and refusal to face the truth. Increasingly, they talk to each other. Nobody else is listening.

This is a shame, because on many points the sceptics happen to be correct. Nigel Lawson's short, splendid book on the subject can leave no fair-minded reader in doubt on that score.

He points out that this was the first book he had trouble placing with a publisher. No British firm would touch it. You will have to read the book to understand how scandalous this is. An Appeal to Reason is elegantly written, thorough, entertaining and, above all, convincing. The foreword quotes a rejection letter: ""My fear, with this cogently argued book, is that it flies so much in the face of the prevailing orthodoxy that it would be very difficult to find a wide market."" Please, no more cogent arguments: what we want is prevailing orthodoxy.

Lord Lawson is a former energy secretary and chancellor of the exchequer (a former journalist too), not a scientist - but then, as he points out, ""neither are the vast majority of those who pronounce on the matter with far greater certainty than I shall do here"". Typically, the genuine experts on climate science are cautious in their statements and honest about how little they know. Most of those who claim to speak on their behalf supply the certainty from their own resources.

Lord Lawson appears to know the literature and draws on his experience as a policymaker and member of a House of Lords committee that reported on climate change. The science is clear, he says, that carbon dioxide warms the planet and that the amount of the gas in the atmosphere is rising. Exactly how much it warms the planet, though, is harder to judge. The climate system is complicated and the models far from perfect. The recent warming trend seems to have paused since 2000 - the models did not predict that.

Projecting trends forward a century or more requires not just climate models but long-range economic forecasts as well (because emissions depend on economic activity). The uncertainties multiply.

Still, suppose that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is right and temperatures will rise by between 1.8°C and 4°C by 2100. How much harm would that do? There would be costs, but some benefits as well: the net cost might be modest or negative. Even with the IPCC's pessimistic view of net costs, living standards in the developing world would be 8.5 times higher by 2100 than they are today (compared with 9.5 times higher with no warming). That is not, so to speak, the end of the world.

Admittedly, much of the concern about warming arises not from a gradual increase in temperatures but from the risk of a sudden catastrophe, such as an abrupt rise in sea level, a breakdown of the gulf stream, or a surge in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes. The book looks briefly at the science on each of these. It finds gross exaggeration in the claims of climate prophets and no cause (yet) for alarm. Even by this short book's standards, that section seemed a bit brisk. No doubt authorities such as Al Gore exaggerate the likelihood of such calamities. But even small chances of great disasters may justify policies that provide insurance against them.

As the author emphasises, the eminent economists Partha Dasgupta and Martin Weitzman fiercely criticised the Stern report - the sacred text of climate alarmism - for the way it dealt with risk and inter-generational equity. But soon after pointing this out the book concedes, with less emphasis, that both men think the report's recommendations might still be right, albeit for the wrong reasons. Depending on the degree of catastrophic risk and on society's aversion to it, they concluded that aggressive Stern-like measures could be justified.

Lord Lawson thinks not, and his policy suggestions are mild. They do include a moderate, revenue-neutral carbon tax - but as much to head off worse ideas as for its own merits. The book's great value is not in its policy recommendations but in its assault on the unreason of global-warming alarmism and its secular priesthood.

""The PC at the heart of the IPCC, as it were, is the most oppressive and intolerant form of political correctness in the western world today,"" says the author. He is right.

"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Tuesday, April 15, 2008 385 mots, p. 12",,Misguided case against climate change action,,,"Sir, Nigel Lawson's perspective that the UK and Europe are over-reacting to the threat of human-induced climate change is substantively wrong and ignores a significant body of scientific, technological and economic evidence (""Stop this foolish overreaction to climate change"", April 7). While global action is needed to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, UK and European leadership is essential.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which shared the 2007 Nobel peace prize, is the most authoritative voice on the current understanding of climate change. Unfortunately, Lord Lawson selectively quotes the IPCC report while perhaps not completely understanding the current scientific and economic debate. There is no doubt that the earth's climate has warmed since the pre-industrial revolution and that future warming is inevitable, primarily due to human activities; ie, the use of fossil fuels to produce energy and tropical deforestation. The rapid rise in surface temperature since 1950 cannot be ascribed to any natural phenomena, and in contrast to what Lord Lawson reports, global average temperatures continued to increase between 1998 and 2007.

The IPCC reported in 2007 that without concerted international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions the planet could warm an additional 1.1°C to 6.4°C during this century, with predominantly adverse consequences for most ecological and socio-economic sectors and human health, with poor people being most vulnerable. Climate change is a major environmental, development and security issue that, left unaddressed, threatens a sustainable future for both developed and developing countries. As noted by the Stern Report the costs of inaction exceed the costs of action, ie mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. There are many cost-effective energy production and use technologies that can currently be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, there are many technologies that are pre-commercial that can be brought to the marketplace in the near future (with appropriate policy frameworks) to further reduce emissions cost effectively, for example, carbon capture and storage, future generation biofuels, electric cars.

Basically, Lord Lawson's argument that action to reduce emissions will hurt the economy is misguided. It is inaction that will impact adversely on economic growth, cause social disruption and lead to further destruction of the world's natural resources, land, water and biodiversity.

The time for action is now. The UK is demonstrating appropriate political leadership and is committed to addressing this issue by funding scientific research, investing in new low-carbon technologies, which has already become a significant growth industry in the UK context, adapting to projected changes in climate and providing international leadership in developing and implementing a long-term equitable global regulatory agreement involving all major emitters to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

This is not the case; there is no row. In recent research the FSB revealed the overwhelming majority of small businesses are socially and environmentally responsible but need more guidance on the practical steps they can take to tackle climate change.

"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Wednesday, April 16, 2008 246 mots, p. 12",,Stern review critic still sees climate change risks,,,"Sir, In a favourable review of Lord Lawson's concise and controversial book An Appeal to Reason (""The climate heretic's handbook"", April 14), Clive Crook brings to bear Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta's elegant critique of the Stern report. But Prof Dasgupta's rigorous methodological argument hardly confirms Mr Crook's characterisation of the Stern review as a ""sacred text of climate alarmism"".

To be sure, Prof Dasgupta deplores the lack of sensitivity analyses of the Stern review and he disputes its elasticity estimates of social weights for consumption. But he is equally critical of the macroeconomic models used by climate change sceptics and he endorses Stern's fundamental premise that we should not discount the well-being of future generations simply because they will only appear in the future. Indeed, Prof Dasgupta views climate change as one of the most significant environmental issues facing humanity.

Furthermore, he argues that the poor world will bear much of the burden of a damaged earth and he stresses that the rich world has a particular responsibility to provide funding for mitigation and adaptation since it is the now developed world that has generated a disproportionate share of greenhouse gas emissions. Prof Dasgupta also notes that the rich in the industrial democracies have been paying more than the 2 per cent of the gross domestic product proposed by Stern to combat climate change.

Since technological solutions (carbon sequestration, alternative energy, etc) may be harder to realise than currently hoped, Prof Dasgupta concludes that it would not be unreasonable for rich countries to invest more to mitigate the effects of climate change than recommended by Stern.

This is hardly supportive of the former chancellor's spirited but misguided attack on climate change activists.

"MARKETS & INVESTING, Thursday, April 17, 2008 313 mots, p. 3",,Stern underestimated global warming risks,By Fiona Harvey and Jim Pickard in London,,"The Stern report on climate change underestimated the risks of global warming, its author said yesterday, and should have presented a gloomier view of the future. ""We underestimated the risks . . . we underestimated the damage associated with temperature increases . . . and we underestimated the probabilities of temperature increases,"" Lord Stern, former chief economist at the World Bank, told the Financial Times yesterday.

In retrospect, he would have taken a much stronger view in the report on the drastic changes that would occur if greenhouse gas emissions were not abated.

In the report, he put the costs of climate change at between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of global gross domestic product. But these would be far higher if the report had taken a more ag-gressive stance on probable consequences of warming.

Lord Stern said data published since his report came out, in October 2006, had led him to change his mind.

Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the body of the world's leading climate scientists convened by the United Nations, published the most comprehensive study of climate change science. It predicted a temperature rise of 3°C within the next 100 years with catastrophic consequences for the planet, unless greenhouse gas emissions were stabilised and then cut within the next decade.

""The damage risks are bigger than I would have argued. Things like the damage associated with a 5° temperature increase are enormous. We can't be precise about what it would be like but you can say it would be a transformation,"" he said.

But he defended his estimate of the cost of taking action on emissions - about 1 per cent of global GDP.

""Subsequent reports, [from] McKinsey, the International Energy Agency, the IPCC have pointed to the [Stern report's] costs of action being roughly in the right ball park. Nothing [since] has led me to revise the cost of action.

""I probably would have emphasised the importance of good policy [if writing the report today] and how bad policy puts up the costs [of cutting emissions].""

Lord Stern has come under attack from economists and climate change sceptics since his report, which some sceptics regard as scaremongering. Some argued he underestimated the cost of taking action to cut emissions and overestimated the benefits to future generations."
"LEADER, Saturday, April 19, 2008 376 mots, p. 6",,Climate policy must be credible,,,"It is not hard to see why. Those were the days when the formidably named duo of Gore and Stern were rewriting the politics of climate change. Sir Nicholas Stern (now Lord Stern) offered a heavyweight analysis of its economics. Former US vice-president Al Gore campaigned with his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, earning both an Oscar and a Nobel Prize. Heady days indeed for environmentalism.

What a difference a year makes. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have taken Mr Gore's place in the hearts of the Democratic faithful, while Britons look to the Treasury for a response to the credit squeeze, not a view on carbon emissions. Given the price of oil and petrol, energy security has replaced the environment as a key concern.

That is hardly a surprise. The risks of climate change are far smaller in the short term than the long term, and can seem remote. The credit squeeze has provided people with tangible, immediate concerns: their jobs, their mortgages, the safety of their investments and even their savings.

Interest in green issues will ebb and flow, but while climate change remains a threat, it will return to the agenda again and again.

That is why companies that have adopted green initiatives must stick to them for their own good. Consumers may have other worries right now but, when environmental concerns resurface, they will remember the companies that abandoned their principles. While consumers are fickle, companies cannot afford to be; life is unfair.

Of far more concern is the response of governments. Their whimsical changes of direction are worse than useless, achieving many of the economic costs of emissions regulation with few of the environmental benefits.

The UK government spews green- trimmed red tape while subsidising domestic fuel. The European situation is no better: the European Unions emissions trading scheme, which should have been a model of how to reduce emissions efficiently, has exemplified only confusion. As for the US, this week President George W. Bush effectively kicked the post-Kyoto negotiations into touch by proposing an emissions target so timid and so distant as to be ridiculous. Nothing serious can now be achieved on climate change until his successor is in place.

None of this bodes well for the planet. Effective policy on climate change need not be draconian - indeed, it should not be - but it must be credible. In a world where politicians are even more whimsical than the electorate, that credibility will remain elusive."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Thursday, April 24, 2008 257 mots, p. 14",,Complex tally of climate change mitigation gainers and losers,,,"Sir, Wilfred Beckerman (Letters, April 22) attacks the Stern review treatment of discount rates as ""pathetically feeble"". But it is instead Prof Beckerman's letter that proposes a simplistic and misleading approach to a complex issue.

Prof Beckerman defines the ethical issue as ""how much certain sacrifice is one prepared to impose on people living today, most of whom are desperately poor, in the interest of future generations who are projected to be much richer"". But nobody is proposing or should propose sacrifice by today's desperately poor people. The (relatively small, as it happens) economic sacrifice should initially be concentrated in the rich developed world. And analysis suggests that the future adverse consequences of climate change are likely to fall disproportionately on the world's poor people, many of whom are likely even in the late 21st century to have a standard of living below that of today's average European or American. To the extent that this is the case, the theoretically appropriate discount rate, as Prof Beckerman must know, should be not merely low but negative.

In fact, the balance of winners and losers from climate change mitigation is likely to be extremely complex, with some future gainers likely to be richer than today's average person but some poorer, and with estimates of who will be winners and losers needing to take account of the full range of climate change effects on human welfare, not just those that are measured in gross domestic product statistics. The appropriate overall discount rate should therefore in theory reflect detailed empirical assessment as well as inherently subjective ethical judgments. To derive a discount rate instead by assuming that the future winners from climate change mitigation are all rich and that those making current sacrifices are desperately poor is an absurd (and indeed feeble) simplification.

"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Saturday, April 26, 2008 292 mots, p. 8",,A Green New Deal could tackle credit and climate crises,,,"Sir, Your editorial ""Climate policy must be credible"" (April 19/20) is far too gloomy about the potential for the credit crunch to displace environmental concerns. This financial crisis could be turned into a massive opportunity to tackle climate change.

As the debt-induced deflation beginning to be experienced turns into rapidly rising unemployment, predictions from the likes of the International Monetary Fund and economist Joseph Stiglitz that this could be the worst crisis since the Depression will gain credence.

The logical next response is to see what can be relearned from Roosevelt's New Deal. In a forthcoming report we and a group of finance and environmental experts will propose a ""Green New Deal"". This would fund the infrastructure needed to tackle today's great global threat - climate change - starting with a programme to make every building in the UK energy-efficient.

A proportion of the net savings from lower energy bills could then be used to repay the public and private sector investment needed. In addition to the public purse, pensions and other savings could provide such funding, channelled for example through local authority bonds. In the US there is a $2,000bn municipal bond market, and in the UK, Transport for London recently raised £600m using such bond issues to help improve the capital's rail system.

New jobs and business opportunities would come in the wake of such a national initiative. It would need to be augmented by the training of a ""carbon army"", with skills ranging from energy finance and analysis, large-scale engineering for combined heat and power projects, through to draft-stripping and loft-lagging.

Such a ""Green New Deal"" would combine politicians' desire to be business friendly, with a solution to the urgent quest for labour-intensive solutions, as unemployment rises. This approach would help tackle both the credit crunch and climate change. In this way Gordon Brown could preside over a revived economy, while setting a practical example for the international community.

"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, April 29, 2008 490 mots, p. 6",,Global warming fans the flames of seal cull debate,By Daina Lawrence,,"The fierce debate surrounding Canada's annual seal ""harvest"" intensified last month when the European Union proposed a ban on importing seal products from the country, a move that would severely damage the cull.

But the seal hunters face another obstacle looming ever larger on the horizon: global warming.

The impact of climate change in the northern regions of the globe - with melting ice and more open waterways - is well documented. Recently, more attention has turned to what impact weather conditions are having on the seal population.

Those against the hunt say it is not sustainable because volatile ice conditions are causing seals to die in greater numbers.

Global Action Network claims the Canadian government's ""agenda to exterminate seals"" comes at a time when climate change is ""causing the very habitat of the ice-breeding seals to disappear"".

But the sealers say global warming is being improperly used to undermine the hunt.

""There is a huge differ-ence between climate and weather,"" says Jim Winter, founding president of the Canadian Sealers' Association. He describes the claims that climate change is creating an unsustainable hunt as ""disingenuous at best and manipulative at the worst"".

Phil Jenkins, an official at Canada's department of fisheries and oceans, says: ""We keep track of the ice itself and over the years we have known situations where we have poor ice, or poor ice for a seal.""

The government sets quotas every year for how many seals can be killed, based on a list of variables. Last year the ice was so thick off the coast of Newfoundland that sealers had to be rescued in their boats by coast guard ice-breakers.

""Usually we incorporate ice condition in our regular advice, but last year was such an unusual condition that we provided an update, once we saw what was going on,"" adds Dr Garry Stenson, a colleague of Mr Jenkins.

Seals are sensitive to the environment and rely on the presence of ice to deliver and nurse their pups. Ice cover is also important because new-born pups do not have fully developed swimming abilities and can easily drown if the ice sheets break apart.

""As conditions change, the conditions of the females change, their reproductive rates will change,"" says Dr Stenson.

The government says this is the type of variable it factors in when setting the annual quota. For example, in the Gulf of St Lawrence last year ""we assumed a very high mortality in the southern gulf, but that's 25 per cent of the whole population"", says Dr Stenson. The quota was reduced from 325,000 to 270,000. This year's total allowable catch is set at 275,000.

The Canadian government reports that the country's seal population is flourishing and, at almost 6m, is nearly triple that of the 1970s. Anti-hunt campaigners say these numbers are inflated.

Paul Watson, one of the leading figures in the campaign, has been making headlines since the late 1970s, sailing his ship, the Farley Mowat, into icy waters to try to stop the hunt. He says each year he sees the direct effect of global warming on the ice.

""It's been going on for years and it's getting worse. I don't think the government takes any of that into account,"" he says. Despite the changes in the ice conditions, Mr Watson says he will continue making the dangerous trek every year, but adds: ""I will be happy to no longer go back there.""

For the sealers, ice conditions and extreme weather are part of the job, says Mr Winter. ""Any time you untie the lines you take a risk."""
"NATIONAL NEWS, Friday, May 2, 2008 377 mots, p. 4",,Climate change imperils City,"By Daniel Thomas, Property Correspondent",,"London and the Thames Gateway are at particular risk of flooding caused by climate change, a report says today, pointing to the scale of housing development planned in the region and danger to the capital's financial district.

The comprehensive study, commissioned by Hermes, the fund manager, to advise on future risks to its £10bn property portfolio, warns that the highest danger is flooding in city centres. There are also dangers from excess heat, drought and wind speed, with both commercial and residential property at risk.

The analysis, by researchers at University College London, assesses the vulnerability of 14 strategic UK cities and towns. There is a clear north-south divide, with cities such as Southampton and Bristol bearing the highest risk to all aspects of climate change, compared with comparatively safe areas in the north such as Glasgow, Belfast and Edinburgh.

Southampton is identified as the UK's most vulnerable location, while London and the Thames Gateway areas are seen as particularly at risk of flooding. Though the government has identified the climate risks to development on flood plains in England, the UCL report highlights the unforeseen problems facing city centres, where it says there is a lack of ""coping strategies"".

""There are a number of major office developments in harbourside and riverside locations - such as Cardiff - which may find themselves at risk over the longer term,"" it says. ""This is a particular concern in London, where the cost implications of major flooding due to the overtopping of the Thames Barrier would be considerable.""

The report breaks down the main risks as: increased temperatures and heat waves affecting the internal comfort levels of buildings and storage; extreme rainfall and flooding, leading to property damage; drought affecting water supplies; reduced soil moisture leading to damaging ground movement; and increased wind speed, with subsequent risk of structural damage.

The report found that extreme rainfall and associated local flooding would be the greatest climatic threat to commercial property. Flooding is expected to affect all sectors of UK property.

""Flooding is the key right now,"" said Yvonne Rydin, professor of planning, environment and public policy at UCL's Bartlett School of Planning. ""There needs to be more work done on urban drainage and the permeability of urban areas.""

Prof Rydin pointed to greater risks among older and lower-quality properties. ""Secondary and tertiary properties are not well equipped to deal with these changes,"" she said.

Hermes has also conducted a survey to identify buildings in its portfolio most at risk of flooding.

Keith Bugden, development director at Hermes, said the company was still deciding what to do with the properties revealed as most in danger. ""We wanted to see how resilient our buildings were and where the potential risks were,"" added Rupert Clarke, chief executive of Hermes.

"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, May 15, 2008 382 mots, p. 5",,Study finds hard proof of man-made climate change,By Fiona Harvey in London,,"Scientists have been able to say with virtual certainty for the first time that the climate change observed over the past four decades is not the result of natural phenomena but is man made.

The research compounds the conclusion of the biggest scientific report on global warming to date, the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year, which asserted a strong likelihood that human action was changing the climate.

The new study raises the likelihood of ""unnatural"" causes of global warming to near certainty.

Authors of the study, published today in the peerreview journal Nature, examined a greater range of data than any other study so far. ""Changes in natural systems since at least 1970 are occurring in regions of observed temperature increases, and these temperature increases at continental scales cannot be explained by natural climate variations alone,"" they say.

They give warning that man-made climate change is having ""a significant impact on physical and biological systems globally"". The authors of the Nature study, including scientists from the Australia, China, the US and several other countries, found that more than 90 per cent of the data sets they examined showed evidence that natural systems were responding to warming.

Spring is coming earlier, permafrost is melting and coastal erosion is increasing under the influence of rising sea levels, while animals and birds are changing their migration and reproductive patterns.

Barry Brook, director of climate change research at the University of Adelaide, said: ""[We should] consider that there has been only 0.75º Celsius of temperature change so far, yet the expectation for this century is four to nine times that amount.

""So these changes are only a minor portent of what is likely to come, especially if we continue on our carbon-profligate pathway.""

Climate scientists know they may be facing difficult times ahead in persuading the public and politicians of the urgency of global warming, as research published recently in Nature suggested that global temperatures were not likely to increase in the next decade, and could even decline.

Scientists from Germany's Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences and the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre say natural variations in the climate linked to the Pacific cooling system known as La Niña, and a cooling phase of a system of Atlantic currents called the meridional overturning circulation, may push down temperatures despite the effects of greenhouse gases.

After those effects wear off, within about a decade, temperatures are likely to rise much more strongly as the warming effect of carbon emissions regains the upper hand in altering the climate.

Scientists fear that the expected lull in temperature rises might dispel any sense of urgency in tackling global warming and provide ammunition for climate change sceptics."
"SCIENCE BRIEFING, Friday, May 30, 2008 192 mots, p. 5",,Ice age 'trigger' threatens climate,,,"The most severe ice age in history, a period of total glaciation known as Snowball Earth, ended suddenly 635m years ago when large amounts of methane were released from areas of permafrost.

Each methane molecule is 30 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, though methane has caused less global warming so far because it is much less abundant in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.

That could change if vast quantities of methane are released from frozen deposits called ""clathrates"", say geologists at the University of California, Riverside.

Martin Kennedy and colleagues analysed hundreds of samples of ancient marine sediments from south Australia. They concluded that the vast ice sheets covering the planet 635m years ago started to emit clathrates when changes in pressure made them unstable and this led to a runaway greenhouse effect.

""Our findings document an abrupt and catastrophic global warming,"" said Prof Kennedy. ""What we now need to know is the sensitivity of the trigger. How much forcing does it take to move from one stable state to the other, and are we approaching something like that today with current carbon dioxide warming?""

Clathrates exist in large quantities in Arctic permafrost and, under great pressure, beneath oceans."
"WORLD NEWS, Monday, June 2, 2008 542 mots, p. 4",,Climate bill points way to US carbon trading scheme,By Stephanie Kirchgaessner in Washington and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Senators will begin a debate in Washington today on proposals for climate-change legislation seen as a blueprint for a future US carbon-trading programme.

The US is the only developed country not to have ratified the Kyoto protocol, which instituted a worldwide system of greenhouse gas emissions trading. A US carbon-trading system would be the world's biggest and would vastly increase the global market in emissions.

Senator Joe Lieberman, co-sponsor of the bill, said it would sharply reduce his country's output of the gases responsible for climate change ""and drive the technologies that will make us energy-independent"".

The climate security bill would establish a cap on carbon emissions from industry, cutting greenhouse gases by 1.8 per cent a year between 2012 and 2050, based on 2005 levels. Companies covered by the bill, including electrical utilities and some transport and manufacturing groups, would be allowed to trade their emissions quotas with each other which, in theory, should encourage reduction of emissions at the lowest cost.

President George W. Bush has been staunchly opposed to the creation of a cap-and-trade programme, but the three main presidential contenders - Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton of the Democrats and the Republican John McCain - have all endorsed mandatory cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.

Point Carbon, a carbon market analyst company, forecast that the global emissions trading market would expand from $64bn (€41bn, £32bn) last year to more than $3,000bn by 2020 if the US took part.

While it is not likely to win sufficient votes to pass the Senate, it will be closely watched because the next Congress - expected to have a stronger Democratic majority - may well use it as a foundation for future legislation, which could pass as early as 2009 with the support of the next president.

Opponents of the bill - sponsored by the independent Mr Lieberman and the Republican John Warner - are expected to base their attack on claims that it would raise petrol prices and weaken US competitiveness.

Views on climate change have evolved on Capitol Hill since 2003, when global warming-related legislation proposed by Mr McCain received scant support. Since then, the political environment has changed. While the debate in Washington once revolved around the science of global warming, it now centres on policy. Evangelicals have also joined the debate, making stewardship of the Earth a moral issue.

But while the political climate has generally become more favourable, some observers say Democratic supporters of the bill are worried about the timing of this week's debate. In April, Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said nearly all Democrats would back the cap-and-trade legislation. But now, Mr Reid might not be able to count on the support of moderate Democrats from states suffering because of high petrol prices and the weak economy.

Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, has said he will oppose the bill because he believes that it does not take energy-sensitive industries, including chemical and steel foundries found in his state, into account.

Eric Washburn, a Democratic energy lobbyist, said: ""Six months ago, when the bill was being drafted in the Senate, there was more political steam and expectations. There has been backsliding since then, given the high gas prices and recession. There is now more political trepidation about passing this than there was six months ago.""

A group of environmental organisations that support the bill say it contains protections for families on low incomes and safeguards to ease the transition to a lower-carbon economy in the US. These include a rebate programme for utilities and tax relief.

Another provision would allow the import of cheaper carbon credits from developing countries.

Steve Cochran, campaign director at the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund, said: ""Every credible assessment of cap-and-trade tells the same story: we can afford an ambitious climate policy if we act soon, and we can grow the economy at the same time."""
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Friday, January 18, 2008 126 mots, p. Page 12",,Climate change interventions are long-term investments,,,"Sir, Ofgem's findings that government interventions to reduce carbon and expand the renewable industry are increasing electricity prices is fully consistent with the fact that historically the true cost of carbon has not been effectively priced (""Green policies push up energy prices"", January 16). However, the analysis misses the big picture.

The Stern review on the economics of climate change made clear a year ago that interventions such as the European Union emission trading scheme and the UK's renewables obligation should be viewed, not as short-term costs, but as long-term investments essential to deliver a low-carbon economy. Failure to invest in these and other measures that deliver deep cuts in carbon while also catalysing new low-carbon technologies will cost us much more in the long term.

"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, June 3, 2008 448 mots, p. 5",,Tokyo mayor leads on climate,By Jonathan Soble in Tokyo,,"Faced with a government dragging its feet over climate change, the celebrity governor of a country's most populous territory decides to go it alone by imposing strict curbs on local greenhouse gas emissions. In doing so, he risks clashing with a national administration run by his own conservative political party.

This is not California but Tokyo, which will impose Japan's first mandatory carbon cap-and-trade scheme from 2010 as part of a plan to cut local emissions by a quarter by 2020.

The initiative threatens to overshadow more modest emissions proposals being prepared by Yasuo Fukuda, prime minister, ahead of a meeting of G8 leaders to be hosted by Japan in July. The measures, which are still being debated, are expected to focus on longer-term reduction targets and industry-by-industry measures for improving energy efficiency.

Tokyo's climate programme has been championed by Shintaro Ishihara, its 75-year-old three-term governor, a rightwinger best known outside Japan for his 1980s polemic The Japan that Can Say No and for periodic verbal slights against women, foreign immigrants and China.

The governor - who hails from the same long-ruling Liberal Democratic party as Mr Fukuda and was once considered a dark horse candidate for prime minister - traces his green conversion to a stint as head of the national environment agency in the late 1970s.

At the time, Japan was dealing with the gruesome effects of Minamata mercury poisoning, a product of industrial pollution. ""I saw the kind of tragedy that the government can cause when it fails to act,"" Mr Ishihara said in an interview.

The clash of policies has drawn comparisons with the battle in the US between California, under the governorship of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the Bush administration over the right to set tougher vehicle emissions standards.

Yurika Ayukawa, a climate activist and academic, believes Tokyo's effort could be ""crucial"" to shaping national policy ahead of the G8 summit, where Mr Fukuda has promised to put global warming high on the agenda. ""There is pressure for Japan to show more leadership,"" she said.

Tokyo will impose mandatory emissions caps on its largest polluters from 2010, along with European-style credit trading for those who overshoot their limits. The city has budgeted Y20bn ($191m, €123m, £97m) for green initiatives this year, including subsidies to help small businesses comply with tighter environmental standards.

It is also tightening building regulations and sharpening scrutiny of the energyefficiency plans the city has required businesses to draw up since 2002. Some 1,000 hectares of new greenery will be planted in the decade to 2016 - a project it hopes will help it win the right to host the Olympics that year.

The measures, however, will do little on their own to reduce Japan's contribution to global warming, something Mr Ishihara acknowledges. Tokyo has little heavy industry and, in spite of its population of 13m, is responsible for only about 5 per cent of Japan's emissions.

Although Mr Ishihara rattles off environmental statistics with the vigour of Al Gore, the former US vice-president, he says he is a ""pessimist"" about political leaders' ability to turn things around.

Even if Japan as a whole follows Tokyo's lead - an unlikely scenario, he says, given the ""pride"" of its top-down bureaucracy - there is still the problem of China, his long-time bugbear. ""As Minamata disease showed, when you try to catch up to developed countries, you end up ignoring environmental issues."""
"WORLD NEWS, Friday, June 13, 2008 305 mots, p. 6",,By Andrew Bounds in Brussels,,,"Mogens Peter Carl, who as head of the European Commission's environment directorate spearheaded EU efforts to combat global warming and reduce fossil fuel use, has agreed to join the staff of Jean-Louis Borloo, French environment minister, as a special representative.

Mr Carl will be seen in Paris as a vital addition to Mr Borloo's team. The minister has spent little time in Brussels but has responsibility for one of the most substantial dossiers of the EU presidency.

France would tap Mr Carl's expertise and network of contacts as it pushes through an ambitious programme on the environment during its six-month presidency, which starts on July 1.

This includes reducing emissions from cars, extending the emissions trading scheme and setting targets for renewable energy use.

But his appointment has yet to be sanctioned by José Manuel Barroso, Commission president.

Some diplomats said Mr Barroso was not happy about losing such a key figure when the Commission was involved in bruising debates with member states about how far and fast to cut emissions from cars, aircraft and other important industrial sectors. It is rare for senior eurocrats to join a national civil service.

Mr Barroso's spokesman said: ""He is not blocking anything."" Terming it an ""unusual request"", he said the procedure was following its course.

A spokeswoman for Mr Borloo said she expected Mr Carl to take up the post soon, praising his expertise.

Mr Carl's appointment would alarm some European governments.

The Dane is a backer of a French plan to exempt heavy industry such as steel and chemical makers from its cap-and-trade carbon emission system. This could come through giving heavy industry a limited number of free permits to pollute or, more controversially, by forcing importers of such goods to buy permits.

Mr Carl, a trade specialist, was moved sideways to the environment directorate in 2005 after clashing with his political boss, Peter Mandelson, the trade commissioner. The Dane was dubbed ""Darth Vader"" by US trade negotiators for his aggressive style,

Mr Carl, who has a French wife and speaks the language fluently, has declined to comment on his proposed move.

"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, June 14, 2008 398 mots, p. 8",,G8 urged to finance fight against global warming,By Chris Giles and David Pilling in Osaka,,"Japan, the US and Britain launched a political drive on the eve of the Group of Eight finance ministers meeting in Osaka yesterday to encourage rich countries to pay into new international funds totackle climate change in developing nations.

Saying it was ""important to get a head start"" while the UN negotiations on a successor to the Kyoto protocol were under way, Hank Paulson, the US Treasury secretary, ex-pressed confidence that other members of the group of leading countries would also donate money to the funds.

The two funds will be administered by the World Bank. One, a clean technology fund, would help developing countries, particularly large polluters such as China and India, to mitigate the effects of global warming by investing in cleaner technology for new power generation. The other, a strategic climate fund, would assist poor countries most at risk from the effect of rising temperatures to adapt to a changing climate.

Mr Paulson said the US would hold a pledging conference later this year aimed at raising an initial $10bn for the funds. The three countries have already promised $5bn of that amount.

Shifting resources from rich to poor countries has always been seen as a potential stumbling block for any agreement on climate change. With developed countries having pumped large quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere for over the past 100 years as they grew rich, emerging economies have insisted they also have the right to increase emissions as their economies expand.

Alistair Darling, the UK chancellor, denied that China and India were being unfairly blamed for adding to global emissions, saying that both were ""seized of the need to act urgently"". Last week, John Hutton, UK industry secretary, said it was important that China and India were not ""demonised"" for being heavy polluters.

Financial compensation, with the aim of achieving both growth and a lower-carbon economy, has been seen as the best way of ensuring that development does not automatically lead to increased emissions.

Calling climate change ""a problem we can resolve"", Mr Darling said: ""You can have strong economic growth at the same time as ensuring it is economically sustainable. That prize is in our grasp.""

Fukushiro Nukaga, the Japanese finance minister, said he would do his ""utmost to urge other countries to come on board"" at the G8 finance ministers meeting this weekend and at the leaders' summit next month.

Even if the three finance ministers are successful in attracting new pledges for the World Bank's two funds, the initial $10bn over three years is only a drop in the ocean compared with the eventual sums needed to be transferred from rich to poor countries in a successful global climate change deal.

The World Bank estimates that $30bn a year will be ultimately be needed to ensure that the $10,000bn likely investment in power generation over the next 22 years in developing countries uses lower carbon technologies."
"FT REPORT - ENERGY 2008, Monday, June 30, 2008 957 mots, p. 10",,Consensus on climate change goals,,,"But there is also cause for optimism. There is momentum coming out of last December's Bali climate change summit. And a clear consensus has emerged on the policy goals that need to be agreed at next year's crucial Copenhagen meeting.

First, a long-term global emissions cap, a trajectory for achieving it over time and a burden-sharing agreement that defines regional and national responsibilities. Second, a basket of policies to do the three most important things to reduce emissions against business-as-usual projections: taking energy out of gross domestic product through a revolution in energy efficiency; taking carbon emissions out of energy through changing the mix of energy we use; and preserving carbon-rich assets, notably the world's forests. And third, a policy framework for climate change adaptation.

Yet there has been comparatively little discussion on the institutions that will be needed to deliver these goals.

Stronger international governance than today will undoubtedly be needed. But tearing up existing institutions - the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and G8 - and starting from scratch would be counterproductive. The evolution of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to the World Trade Organisation suggests a more promising approach: institutional seeds, if properly fed and nurtured, can grow into strong players over time. Existing institutions need principles to help them widen, strengthen and link together. I offer four suggestions.

The first is that international climate institutions must be inclusive: they should convene the operators that count.

By 2030, developing countries will contain 80-90 per cent of the world's population and, under business-as-usual projections, be responsible for 60-70 per cent of emissions. A climate change solution without the involvement of developing countries would be highly inefficient.

A recent survey by Accenture, the consultants, suggests people in Brazil, China and India care more about climate change than those in Europe and North America. But these countries will only come to the table if the agreement struck at Copenhagen is equitable. And that means industrialised nations must take a lead: above all, demonstrating that carbon-constrained growth is possible.

Developing countries should commit to binding cuts in the future - say, after 2020. They should be allowed to grow without hindrance in the interim, although also commit themselves to verifiable steps to place their economies on a low-carbon trajectory. The obvious places to start are where cutting carbon emissions align with other goals.

Another crucial constituency is business. It is striking to compare the relative lack of business engagement at the international level with engagement at the domestic level.

This leads to the second main principle: institutional arrangements should be enduring. The most important features of any policy framework designed to mobilise investment dollars are that it is clear, stable and predictable. Uncertain and intermittent climate change policies are choking low-carbon energy investments.

However, stability must be balanced with the need for institutions to learn: to evolve as science, technologies, economics and politics inevitably develop. This points to the medium term as being the critical time frame. Five-year compliance periods would be too short. Fifty years too long. Fifteen years strikes me as about right.

The third principle is enforcing. Lessons of history - not least the recent history of the WTO - suggest that heavy penalties can hinder co-operation. Carrots, rather than sticks, are more successful in ensuring compliance in a world where power is devolved to nation states.

The carbon market will be the key: access to the carrot of international carbon finance flows. Today the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is the closest thing we have to the policy required.

I believe the CDM has a future, though its rules must be tightened and bureaucratic obstacles removed. The CDM must also be augmented with additional carbon mechanisms to incentivise emissions reductions across industrial sectors and from forestry.

The final principle is enabling. Reducing energy consumption, decarbonising the energy mix and preserving carbon-rich assets will be driven primarily by national policies. But international institutions can play an important enabling role.

As I argued in the FT a year ago in a piece co-authored with Nick Butler, I believe a new body, an International Carbon Fund, will be needed to manage the exchange of multiple carbon currencies of different relative values, as state, national and regional cap-and-trade programmes become linked.

International institutions must also help with capacity building: making the ground fertile for carbon finance to flow and for the transfer of low-carbon technologies. Examples include removing barriers, improving administrative capacity and education and training. Some of these efforts will require hard technical work. Others will require funding - which could be substantial in time. More thinking needs to be done about how to disburse funds held internationally in a way that is efficient, equitable and transparent.

There is talk today of an energy and environment crisis. And at times like this, when policymaking is prolific, it is important to highlight some bad ideas - the don'ts as well as the dos. Half a dozen come to mind.

First, be careful where you put energy subsidies. Incentives will be needed, for example to stimulate technology innovation, but energy in general should not be subsidised.

Second, establish facts before acting. Biofuels are a good example. There are good biofuels, such as ethanol from Brazilian sugar cane, but also bad biofuels. Policies must distinguish between the good and the bad.

Third, beware technology silver bullets. A suite of technologies, including all types of renewables, carbon capture and storage and nuclear will be needed.

Fourth, there are no silver bullets in policy either. For example, cap-and-trade programmes will establish a carbon price for large stationary emitters but a basket of fiscal and regulatory measures will be needed to change consumer behaviour to encourage energy efficiency.

Fifth, resist the siren call of protectionism. Combating climate change - and mitigating energy security, our other great challenge - will require global markets in oil, gas, coal, carbon and biofuels and regional markets in power.

And finally, do not rob the long term to pay for the short term. Doing what is needed will require enlightened, long-term political leadership - leadership that transcends short-term economic cycles and the day-to-day tussle of politics.

We have seen this kind of leadership before: for example after the second world war. As J.M. Keynes remarked at the closing plenary session of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944: ""We have shown that a concourse of nations is actually able to work together at a constructive task in amity and unbroken concord.""

Let us hope that these words ring true at Copenhagen next year.

"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION, Monday, July 7, 2008 361 mots, p. 1",,"China and India key on climate, says Bush",By David Pilling in Rusutsu,,"US President George W. Bush said he was prepared to be ""constructive"" in discussions on climate change yesterday, although he insisted that any agreement depended on the participation of China and India.

Group of Eight leaders, who today begin a three-day summit in Toyako, northern Japan, are seeking to advance from last year's commitment at Heiligendamm when they pledged to ""consider seriously"" halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Some G8 leaders would like the statement upgraded to ""agree to halve emissions"", though the US has been reluctant to commit.

Today the G8 will meet African leaders for discussions expected to focus on finding solutions to the crisis caused by sharp rises in food prices. Japanese officials said leaders might consider proposals to create stockpiles of grain that could be released in a co-ordinated way to stabilise prices.

The summit, the biggest in G8 history with leaders of 14 countries outside the group invited, will discuss issues including rising oil prices, the financial crisis and ways of preventing nuclear proliferation even as the use of ""carbon-free"" nuclear energy becomes more attractive.

José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, would like G8 leaders to commit to carbon emission cuts by 2020. ""We will be working for real commitments from this G8, not only reinforcing ones taken last year but also, if possible, to go beyond that with a mid-term commitment.""

Mr Bush and Yasuo Fukuda, Japan's prime minister, yesterday said they would press big developing nations, particularly China, to agree to carbon cuts as part of a global agreement to succeed the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012.

After meeting his Japanese counterpart in Toyako, Mr Bush said: ""I've always advocated there needs to be common understanding and that starts with a goal."" However, he added: ""I am also realistic enough to tell you that, if China and India don't share the same aspiration, we're not going to solve the problem.""

China and India have said they cannot be expected to cut emissions before they have industrialised.

Although Mr Fukuda has spoken about a convergence of views on climate change, he has also sought to play down expectations of a breakthrough at Toyako.

Experts say significant agreement is unlikely, largely because the deadline for a post-Kyoto deal is still 18 months away.

Marthinus van Schalkwyk, South Africa's environment minister, described a pledge to cut emissions in half by 2050 as an ""empty slogan"". Many experts are pressing for rich nations to commit to cut carbon emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020.

Separately, Mr Fukuda said that he would attend the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics next month: ""I don't think there has to be a link to politics.''

"COMMENT, Wednesday, July 9, 2008 867 mots, p. 13",,Why the obstacles to a deal on climate are mountainous,,,"This is to ignore the debate on whether man-made climate change is either plausible or correctly assessed. I find the arguments sufficiently cogent to justify action. Above all, I find persuasive the argument of Professor Martin Weitzman of Harvard University that it is worth paying a great deal to eliminate the risk of catastrophe.* Those who reject such views need read no further.

Professor Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics, author of the UK government's 2006 report on climate change, has analysed the issues in an interesting recent paper.** He starts from a few simple propositions: first, the concentration of carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere is now 430 parts per million and rising at the rate of two parts per million a year; second, the aim should be to stabilise concentrations at between 450 and 500 parts per million; finally, to achieve this, global emissions of greenhouse gas equivalents must peak in the next 15 years and fall by at least 50 per cent, relative to 1990 levels (about 90 per cent of 2005 levels), by 2050, when global average emissions per head must be as low as two tonnes per head.

Historic trends and current emission levels indicate how big a change from ""business as usual"" these goals are: two tonnes per head is 10 per cent of recent US levels and half China's. Yet, argues Prof Stern, this must happen if one takes the risks seriously. Worse, the longer the world waits, the bigger reductions must be, because the gases stay up for centuries.

How is this to be achieved? Any set of policies has to be effective, efficient and equitable. Let us examine each of these criteria in turn.

To be effective, the policy will need to reduce emissions sharply. The implication is that every activity and virtually every country will be affected. Developing countries, which will contain close to 90 per cent of the world's population and generate the bulk of the world's emissions by 2050, must make a substantial contribution. On this, Mr Bush is correct. The long-run world average of two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per head is so low that no country can be allowed to go much above it.

The sectoral implications are also dramatic: big efforts will be needed to halt deforestation, for example, which currently contributes some 17 per cent of man-made emissions; electricity generation will need to be carbon-free by 2050; and the global vehicle fleet, projected by the International Monetary Fund to increase by 2.3bn vehicles between now and 2050, must become largely carbon-free, as well.

Efficiency is as easy to define as it is hard to accept: the marginal cost of reducing emissions should be the same in all activities everywhere. The price of carbon - whether set by a ""cap and trade"" scheme on emissions, a carbon tax or a hybrid - should also be the same everywhere. That China is now the world's single largest emitter shows how vital it is for emissions to be priced there, too.

China's emissions per unit of gross domestic product (at purchasing power parity) are double those of the US and three times those of Japan. So far as possible, therefore, the best technology must be used everywhere. Yet the existing set of low-emitting technologies is not fully diffused across the globe. Achieving this could, argues Prof Stern, reduce emissions by between five and 10 gigatonnes per annum by 2030 (10-20 per cent of 2005 emissions). Big efforts must also be made to develop and scale up nearly commercial technologies and create new ones. The fact that all the needed technologies do not yet exist makes estimates of what it will cost to achieve the targets an educated guess. This includes Prof Stern's figure of 1 per cent of global gross output.

Yet the most intractable challenge of all is equity. Emissions have to be reduced everywhere, but the cost of doing so need not be borne by everyone. There are three powerful arguments why costs should be borne by high-income countries: first, they created the current problem; second, they still emit far more per head; and, third, they can afford it. Three-fifths of the stock of man-made greenhouse gases was put up by the high-income countries. In 2004, US emissions per head were also five times those of China and 17 times those of India.

So how is it possible to ensure the same price for carbon everywhere, while imposing the costs on rich countries? One answer is by paying for reductions in emissions in developing countries, while not penalising them for failure to meet targets. Such a scheme exists: the ""clean development mechanism"". Its principle is reasonable. The difficulty is defining and measuring benchmarks, monitoring achievement and covering entire economies.

Yet this, however difficult, is the way Prof Stern suggests the world should go up to 2020, when developing countries should also adopt limits. He suggests, specifically, that the current mechanism needs to move from a projects-based one to a ""wholesale mechanism, perhaps based on sector-specific efficiency targets or on technology benchmarks"". Can this be made workable in China, India and other emerging economies? To be honest, I doubt it. But it seems to be the only way forward. Moreover, persuading developing countries to accept binding limits even in 2020 is bound to be hard, given the gross inequity of the starting point.

The G8 leaders claim to have made a breakthrough. This is nonsense. They have not begun to reach all the needed agreements, particularly with the developing countries. They have merely taken a first step among themselves. They have not even put in place policies to achieve the necessary reductions in emissions in their own countries, of between 75 and 90 per cent by 2050.

This is much the most complex collective action problem in human history. Solving it requires concerted action among unequal participants over at least a century. Yet the right thing to do is to try. If not us, who? And if not now, when?

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, August 11, 2008 395 mots, p. 4",,Climate threat to Brazil soya exports,By Jonathan Wheatley in São Paulo,,"Brazil's soya exports could slump by more than a quarter over the next 12 years as the result of climate change, according to a study to be presented at an agribusiness conference opening in São Paulo today.

The study will add to concern over worsening food shortages around the world. It shows that even moderate rises in temperatures would cause significant damage to a range of agricultural produce in Brazil, which has emerged over the past decade as one of the world's biggest suppliers of food crops.

By 2020, the study says, the value of six of Brazil's food crops - rice, coffee, beans, manioc, maize and soya - could fall by between 6.5bn reals ($4bn, €2.7bn, £2bn) and 7.1bn reals if average temperatures rose by between 1ºC and 2ºC.

""The result will be a significant drop in Brazil's farm exports,"" Hilton Silveira Pinto, one of the authors, told the Financial Times.

The study is based on models of climate change developed at the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research and applied at local level to all of Brazil 5,562 municipalities by researchers at Unicamp, a university at Campinas in São Paulo state, and Embrapa, a Brazilian -govern-ment agricultural research institute.

It takes account of different rates of temperature change under best and worst-case scenarios that would result in average temperature rises by 2020 of between 1ºC and 2ºC from a baseline of average temperatures between 1961 and 1990. In parts of Brazil, such as in the rich agricultural hinterland of São Paulo state, temperatures have already risen by about 1ºC since then, said Prof Pinto.

The most serious damage would be to soya, he said. The amount of land suitable for soya cultivation would fall by more than 21 per cent under the best-case scenario, which assumes that action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and by almost 24 per cent if emissions continue at present rates.

That would result in a loss of 11.3m tons of soya from current production of 52.4m tons under the best-case scenario. Brazil last year exported about 38.5m tons of soya beans, meal and oil. Assuming that the Brazilian government maintains its policy of exporting only what is excess to domestic consumption, the study implies a drop in exports by 2020 of at least 29 per cent.

In contrast, the amount of sugar cane could increase dramatically, as it thrives in high temperatures and in atmospheres rich in carbon dioxide, one of the main greenhouse gases.

Prof Pinto stressed that the report was based on the most advanced crop varieties planted in Brazil and said damage could be mitigated by the development of strains resistant to higher temperatures. However, he warned that few crops would withstand average temperature rises of more than 2ºC.

The study considered the impact of climate change up to 2050 and 2070, showing a fall in the value of the six crops of 9.3bn reals and 11bn reals, respectively, under the best-case scenario. However, Prof Pinto said predictions beyond 2050 were unreliable."
"COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL, Tuesday, December 30, 2008 313 mots, p. 12",,Munich Re highlights climate change impact,By James Wilson in Frankfurt and Andrea Felsted in London,,"Financial damage and loss of life caused by natural disasters made 2008 one of the most devastating years on record and showed the impact of climate change, one of the world's biggest reinsurers said yesterday.

Munich Re said weather-related catastrophes helped push losses to $200bn compared with $82bn in 2007.

Insured losses of $45bn were 50 per cent more than in the previous year.

This made 2008 the third most expensive year to the industry for catastrophe damage, continuing a long-term trend, the group said.

""Climate change has already started and is very probably contributing to increasingly frequent weather extremes and ensuing natural catastrophes,"" said Torsten Jeworrek, a member of Munich Re's executive board.

Insurance companies are concerned by the impact of climate change on risk modelling and hence on financial performance.

Munich Re said the next UN climate summit, scheduled for late next year in Copenhagen, needed to ""quite clearly fix the route"" to halve output of greenhouse gases by 2050.

More than 220,000 people are estimated to have been killed by natural catastrophes during the year, including 135,000 in Burma during cyclone Nargis, where deforestation allowed a storm surge to reach further inland, said Munich Re.

Hurricane Ike was the year's most expensive event for insurers, with $15bn of insured losses.

The year was the fourth-worst hurricane season since reliable data have been compiled, while the US tornado season was ""unusually severe"", Munich Re said. It was also the planet's 10th-warmest recorded year. All have occurred in the past 12 years.

""The loss statistics for 2008 fit the pattern that the calculations of climate models lead us to expect,"" said Peter Höppe, the reinsurer's head of geo-risks research.

Atmospheric warming meant ""the weather machine runs in top gear"".

But the number of ""loss-producing events"" fell compared with 2007, Munich Re said.

The year's death toll included 70,000 in the earthquake that hit China's Sichuan province in May.

Munich's figures echo those of Swiss Re, which put insured losses from natural catastrophes at $43bn, of which Ike accounted for $20bn.

But Swiss Re estimates that there was another $7bn of insured losses from man-made disasters, taking total insured losses to over $50bn."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, December 18, 2008 582 mots, p. 8",,EU climate bill paves way for hard year of talks,By Fiona Harvey in London and Joshua Chaffin in Strasbourg,,"The world's most stringent climate change package was approved by the European parliament yesterday, setting the scene for the toughest talks ever undertaken on climate change.

A packed year of international negotiations on climate change culminates in a crunch meeting next December in Copenhagen, at which 190 countries will gather to forge an agreement on cutting emissions that will replace the Kyoto protocol when its main provisions expire in 2012.

The clearing of the European Union's final hurdle means the bloc is now committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020; generating at least 20 per cent of its energy from renewable sources by 2020; and committing billions of euros in funding to develop carbon capture and storage technology.

Many parliamentarians complained that changes to the emissions trading system at the centre of the package were too generous to corporate interests and that the legislation allowed member states to undertake most of their emissions reductions outside of Europe. Nonetheless, they voted in favour.

""Of course, it's not a perfect agreement. But if we say 'no', we're left with nothing - with our arms empty,"" said Lena Ek, a liberal democrat from Sweden, echoing a common refrain.

Europe is expected to play a leading role in Copenhagen in brokering a deal with the US, Japan and rapidly developing countries such as India and, most importantly, China - which has overtaken the US to become the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.

Europe's stringent measures - and its offer to up its target to a cut of 30 per cent in emissions compared with 1990 levels by 2020 if other countries come to an agreement - will put pressure on other developed countries to seal a deal.

But the most hopeful sign for a deal is the change of administration in the US. George W. Bush, the incumbent president, was accused by many other countries of stalling on global warming for years.

Barack Obama, who will take office in January, sent Senator John Kerry to a UN climate change meeting in Poznan, Poland, last week. Mr Kerry promised a fruitful partnership with Europe and said Mr Obama was determined to forge a deal on emissions cuts and invest in a low-carbon programme that would yield millions of new jobs.

""Mr Obama has made it clear he supports mandatory targets,"" the senator said. ""This is a significant departure from where we have been [under Mr Bush].""

But in spite of any newfound partnership between Europe and the US, next year's negotiations are likely to be tough.

One of the faultlines - over how the burden of emissions cuts should be shared between rich and poor nations - was exposed towards the end of the Poznan conference, when developing countries, including Brazil and India, accused richer countries at the talks of a lack of generosity.

Yvo de Boer, the UN's senior climate change official, said: ""Poznan achieved what it was supposed to but it ended on a rather grim note . . . It's a worrying sign that people are taking up positions for a hard negotiation.""

Few would expect developing countries to sign up for absolute cuts in emissions of the kind that developed countries have taken on. But Mr Kerry made it clear that rapidly emerging economies, such as China, would have to commit to curb their emissions to ensure they do not rise as fast as they have in the recent past - in the UN jargon, to ""deviate from business as usual"".

China's leadership has shown an increasing willingness to negotiate on these points but is likely to demand some incentives in order to agree. Other developing countries might take a much harder line.

Among developed countries, a consensus is lacking. Australia unveiled a climate package this week but agreed only to cut emissions 5 per cent compared with 2000 levels by 2020 and by 15 per cent only in the ""unlikely"" event that other nations agreed to do the same. Japan is yet to come forward with a 2020 target and is wary of any agreement that penalises its industry compared with less efficient companies in China.

The world's environment ministers will meet for UN negotiations at least twice and probably more often next year. Heads of state and government are likely to meet at least once, at a conference being mooted at the UN in September.

If scientific warnings are correct, the talks will decide whether or not global warming reaches catastrophic levels. The stakes could scarcely be higher."
"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, December 13, 2008 463 mots, p. 9",,Europe sets targets on climate for all to follow,By Tony Barber in Brussels,,"European Union leaders urged the world to follow their example yesterday and adopt ambitious climate change targets, rebuffing critics who said their latest plan conceded too much to heavy industrial polluters.

""Our message to our global partners is, 'Yes, you can. Yes, you can also do what we are doing',"" said José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, in a turn of phrase that recalled the election slogan of Barack Obama, the US president-elect.

Mr Barroso was speaking after a two-day summit at which the EU's 27 national leaders endorsed a 20 per cent cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and a €200bn ($266bn, £179.6bn) fiscal stimulus to haul Europe out of recession.

The climate change deal ran into immediate criticism from environmentalists and leftist critics in the European parliament, without whose approval the agreement cannot be passed into binding legislation next year, as EU leaders want.

""The climate package deal represents some kind of step forward, but it falls far short of the action we need to take to combat climate change,"" said Monica Frassoni, co-president of the parliament's Greens political group.

Industrial sectors such as cement, chemicals and steel will receive free carbon emission permits at least up to 2020, instead of having to buy them under an auction scheme, as envisaged in a Commission plan published last January.

The concession represented a victory for Germany, by far Europe's largest manufacturing nation. It means revenues from the auctions are expected to be closer to €30bn a year by 2020 than the €50bn previously forecast.

For central and east European countries that are burdened with highly polluting power sectors from the communist era, a deal was struck to ease the financial pain of switching to a low-carbon economy. They will be offered a share of the revenues from permit sales to help them invest in cleaner technologies, and their power sectors will be partly exempt from paying for permits between 2013 and 2020.

Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, which hands over the EU's six-month rotating presidency to the Czech Republic on January 1, said the summit negotiations on climate change ""turned out to be much easier than people predicted"".

""We are starting to change the way we do things in Europe, talking less and doing more,"" Mr Sarkozy declared.

EU diplomats said pressure from industrialists on the climate change plans had been relentless this year and had become impossible to resist once it was clear Europe had fallen into a serious recession and risked losing millions of jobs.

Mr Barroso acknowledged the terms of the accord created the risk of windfall profits for some of the EU's biggest polluters. ""It's precisely why we at the Commission don't like the extension of the allowances. But sometimes you have to do a deal,"" he said.

The leaders agreed unanimously on the fiscal stimulus plan, worth about 1.5 per cent of the EU's gross domestic product, and called on Mr Obama to join them in a ""transatlantic economic recovery plan"".

But at German, Dutch and Swedish insistence they stressed the need for a prompt return to fiscal discipline, under the EU's stability and growth pact, after the emergency was over.

The leaders stopped short of backing the use of €5bnin unspent EU budget funds to expand trans-European energy links and broadband internet connections, and asked the Commission instead to come up with precise proposals."
"WORLD NEWS, Monday, January 21, 2008 398 mots, p. Page 4",,"Fight climate change with tax not targets, say economists",By TONY BARBER,,"The European Union should fight climate change with a broad-based carbon tax rather than by setting precise targets for the use of biofuels and renewable energy, according to a team of British economists.

Europe Economics, a London-based consultancy, says biofuels targets amount to ""a form of state support for an environmentally and economically harmful activity designed to consolidate existing price support mechanisms for vested interest groups, most notably farmers"".

The European Commission on Wednesday will present a plan for tackling climate change that aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 20 per cent of their 1990 levels by 2020.

The Commission's proposal that biofuels should account for 10 per cent of road transport fuels has been questioned in many quarters, including by the Joint Research Centre, the Commission's in-house science institute.

According to Europe Economics, the target would lead to annual subsidies to the biofuels industry of at least Euros 11bn (Dollars 16bn, Pounds 8bn) and possibly as much as Euros 23bn by 2020. This compares with the Euros 40bn that the EU now spends each year on its Common Agricultural Policy.

""It is clear that a European biofuel industry cannot be viable without political support by means of tariffs and very high levels of subsidy,"" the economists say.

The study was commissioned by Open Europe, a UK think-tank campaigning for a loosely structured, economically liberal EU.

The economists recommend that governments introduce tax breaks for energy-efficient products, a step already under consideration in the UK and France. The EU could play its part by reducing import duties.

The EU imposes a 66 per cent tariff on low-energy light bulbs from China, Pakistan, the Philippines and Vietnam, partly - the report suggests - because of protectionist lobbying from Osram, the German manufacturer owned by Siemens. Without the import duty and value-added-tax, the cost of an imported energy-efficient 60 watt bulb in the UK would be 66p (Dollars 1.29, Euros 0.88) instead of Pounds 4, the report estimates.

Cycling to work could be encouraged by removing tariffs and VAT from standard high-quality imported bicycles, slashing their cost to Pounds 80 from Pounds 250.

""Other green products which should be subject to similar tax and tariff incentives include insulation, condensing boilers, water management systems and heat exchangers,"" the economists say.

They are highly critical of the EU's carbon emissions trading scheme, saying the allocation of free permits has become ""a vehicle for delivering covert industrial subsidies to politically favoured industries on a truly epic scale"". They calculate that power generators in the EU have netted Euros 6bn-Euros 8bn in windfall profits since the launch of the ETS in 2005.

""We consider that the most cost-effective way of reducing carbon emissions is to introduce an economy-wide carbon price, and that the best way of doing this would be to abandon the ETS and to tax the consumption of primary fuels in proportion to their carbon content,"" the economists say."
"COMMENT, Friday, December 12, 2008 855 mots, p. 9",,Global warming: the way not to mobilise the masses,,,"The trouble is, as the angry passengers at Stansted would have told him, mobilisation in the cause of greenery is not invariably popular. With the recession biting, it is about to get less so. Faced with threats to their jobs and homes, voters are disinclined to worry about global temperatures half a century hence.

The parallels Mr Miliband had in mind - the Make Poverty History campaign or, farther back, the anti-apartheid and equality movements - might have been more compelling during the boom times. Doing good is easier when you are feeling good. Now, though, people power is more likely to be on the side of delay at best, denial at worst.

You can see these forces at work in the European Union. Europe has not had much to boast about these past few years, even if Nicolas Sarkozy, the energetic French president, has lately given it a profile in global affairs. That said, the EU has been in the vanguard of the campaign to clean up the atmosphere.

The EU leaders have set a target of cutting greenhouse emissions in the EU by 20 per cent by 2020. They have pledged to increase energy efficiency by 20 per cent and to draw 20 per cent of energy from renewable sources. There must be something special about the number 20.

All this seemed challenging, but possible at a time of prosperity. The voters would surely accept a degree of pain to safeguard the future for their children and grandchildren. Industry had the cash (or cheap credit lines from the banks) to adjust.

No longer. European businesses, denied funds from a frozen banking system and facing collapse in consumer demand, want EU leaders at today's Brussels summit to dilute the package. Italy and Germany have been demanding free permits for their manufacturing companies in a revised EU emissions trading scheme. The former communist states want extra compensation to clean up Soviet-era coal-fired power stations.

Mr Miliband has his own experience of such pressures. Britain has the tightest legal framework of any European state to make sure it meets its targets. But the Treasury, Whitehall's most powerful department, is openly scornful of ""greenery"", especially when it threatens its monopoly control of taxation and spending. It recently vetoed an eminently sensible plan to install energy-saving gas and electricity meters in every household as part of an economic stimulus plan.

Britain's energy minister also faces some tough calls on whether to approve construction of new (and dirty) coal-fired power stations. Mr Miliband's instincts are said to lie with those who say that all new permissions must carry an obligation to retro-fit the stations with carbon capture technology. But Gordon Brown, Mr Miliband's boss, has been heard to mutter that he is paying too much attention to CO2 emissions and not enough to energy security.

Such conflicts are inevitable - and trivial against the task of securing a global pact to reduce greenhouse gases to a sustainable level. If British government departments cannot agree between themselves, many will ask what hope is there of persuading China and India to clean up their act?

European diplomats tell me that the circle will be squared at today's summit and the Union will emerge with something resembling a plausible strategy to achieve its ambitious targets. We shall see. If nothing else, the leaders should know that their credibility with Barack Obama's new administration in Washington will be shredded if they do not reach a deal.

The debate has exposed the broader problem. Much as I sympathise with the suggestion that people power will be essential in the effort to slow, and eventually, halt global warming, governments cannot allow the climate change argument to be framed either by self-interested businesses or by well-intentioned activists.

The young campaigners at Stansted had a point. There is something odd about the British government's twin commitments to lower carbon emissions and to promoting a headlong expansion of London's several airports. But like most other such groups, the protesters seemed concerned only with sacrifice.

In this mindset saving the planet demands that people give up their foreign holidays, abandon their cars, turn down the heating and clean their teeth in the dark. Through this prism, pain is a virtue and the halting global warming metamorphoses into a much broader attack on consumerism, materialism and, at the extreme, anything that smacks of the market.

Whatever one makes of the intent, such zealotry is doomed to failure. Self-flagellation does not sell. If keeping the planet cool is seen to be the project of affluent middle-class do-gooders the masses will mobilise all right - against it.

The case must be framed as an opportunity rather than a burden. Technological innovation - in automobile design, energy efficiency, renewable energy and the rest - is more than a useful adjunct to an austere low carbon lifestyle. It is a vital pillar of any plan to reduce the build-up of CO2. Bluntly stated, unless we find a way to capture emissions from coal-fired power stations, the game will be lost.

The response of politicians must be to accentuate the opportunities: in business, jobs and technological advance in rich economies; in fostering security in poorer regions; and in binding the rising powers into an equitable international system.

Mr Obama makes the case that less gas guzzling will enhance America's security by reducing dependence on unreliable or hostile foreign regimes. A glance towards Moscow should carry the same message for Europeans.

Instead of talking about the cost of doing something, leaders would do better to emphasise the price of doing nothing. Of course, the shift to a low carbon economy will not be painless. But nor is global warming. The way to mobilise the masses is to recast the argument. Opportunity sells a lot better than do hair shirts."
Europe Ed1,"EU SUMMIT, Friday, December 12, 2008 315 mots, p. 2",,Obama team vows climate partnership with Europe,Fiona Harvey in Poznan,"Europe will find the US a willing partner in its efforts on climate change, Barack Obama's representative at talks in Poznan said yesterday.

Senator John Kerry, who has been asked by the US president-elect to report back to him on the United Nations climate change talks in Poland, said the new administration's approach to Europe would be ""as different as night from day"" on climate policy compared with that of George W. Bush.

""Europe has been waiting with baited breath for someone to partner with,"" he said.

José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, told the Financial Times this week a partnership with the US on global warming and the economy was a vital part of his plans.

Mr Kerry laid out some of the areas in which the US could work closely with the European Union: linking a US carbon trading system to that of the EU; joint ventures on technology; and combined efforts to develop commercial carbon capture and storage projects.

While declining to give specifics, he hinted at the level of emissions cuts the US would have to consider. The science showed a need for cuts of 25 to 40 per cent in developed country emissions by 2020, he said.

The EU has agreed to cut its emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 if other large economies adopt the same target.

A programme of billions of dollars worth of measures to encourage the development of environmentally friendly technology and create ""green"" jobs would be a key part of the economic stimulus to be unveiled by Mr Obama shortly after his inauguration on January 20, Mr Kerry said.

But it was unlikely that a cap-and-trade programme, which has been promised by the president-elect, would be part of the January package. Mr Kerry said it would be too complex to try to pass a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme so soon.

However, he said the US would sign up to a new global agreement on climate change mandating substantial emissions cuts at a UN conference in Copenhagen next December, the deadline the UN has set for forging a deal to replace the Kyoto treaty, the main provisions of which expire in 2012.

Some observers doubt the US could make such a deadline, given the time taken to hand over to the new administration. Mr Kerry dismissed such fears as ""inappropriate"".

While in Poznan yesterday, Mr Kerry talked to Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, of Mr Obama's plans. Mr Ban said he was considering hosting a meeting of world leaders next September to help forge an agreement."
"WORLD NEWS, Monday, December 8, 2008 328 mots, p. 4",,Paris to press Germany and UK on climate change fund,By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels and Ben Hall in Paris,,"Germany and the UK are being pressed to agree a bigger subsidy to eastern European countries as France makes a last-minute effort to rescue an ambitious climate agreement.

Nicolas Sarkozy, president of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, will raise the matter with Gordon Brown, UK prime minister, during talks today in London following discussions with Angela Merkel, German chancellor, yesterday.

Mr Sarkozy is seeking their agreement to bolster the climate package's so-called ""solidarity fund"" ahead of a two-day summit of European heads of state that begins on Thursday.

The fund was proposed by the European Commission to redistribute to poorer EU member states a 10 per cent share of the auction revenues from an expanded EU emissions trading scheme - to help them refit outdated power plants and invest in cleaner technology.

The fund emerged as a central point of discussion during Mr Sarkozy's meeting in Gdansk on Saturday with Donald Tusk, Polish prime minister, and other eastern European leaders, who have mounted stubborn resistance to the climate package.

Mr Tusk cited ""progress"" in those talks, but Polish officials warned that they would scupper a deal if Germany and the UK, in particular, did not drop their opposition to to increasing the fund. ""If the solidarity money is not there . . . there will be no agreement at the council next week,"" one said.

The fund has come under further pressure in recent days as Germany has led a campaign to grant more free pollution allowances to steel, cement and other heavy industries instead of requiring them to buy them at auction.

Industry lobbyists have argued they should receive allowances for free so they are not put at a disadvantage to foreign competitors.

Yet Poland and other eastern European countries worry that such a move would reduce auction revenues and deplete the solidarity fund.

Mr Sarkozy told a news conference in Gdansk that the eastern European member states wanted the solidarity mechanism to become ""a little more ambitious"" and that he was trying to establish ways of bringing that about.

Germany argues it is already helping out eastern European countries by shouldering a heavy burden by boosting the share of energy it generates from renewable sources.

""Germany does not want to question the principle of solidarity but to calculate it in a different way,"" he said.

Mr Sarkozy has also sought to assuage Poland's concern that the auctioning system - to begin in 2013 - would push up electricity prices for consumers."
"NATIONAL NEWS, Tuesday, December 2, 2008 593 mots, p. 4",,Climate pledges to hit energy bills,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Homes and businesses will have to pay higher energy bills if Britain is to meet the estimated £15bn-a-year cost of its ambitious climate change commitments, ministers were told yesterday.

Household electricity costs could go up by more than 25 per cent by 2020 if greenhouse gas emissions are to be cut by a third from 1990 levels, said Lord Turner, chairman of the climate change committee.

In its first report yesterday, the government taskforce sketched out the world's first ""carbon budgets"" that ministers will be expected to follow when introducing new policies.

Lord Turner gave warning that the extra costs for the new technologies required could push 1.7m people into fuel poverty unless the government took steps - such as ""social tariffs"" on fuel use - to protect low-income groups and pensioners.

But he said: ""The cost of not achieving the reductions . . . will be far greater [because of the threat posed by global warming].""

The proposed changes mean that, by the end of the next decade, most people buying new cars can expect them to be electric. Inefficient electrical appliances will be phased out, and new houses will be ""zero-carbon"".

In addition, thousands of new onshore wind turbines and a massive expansion of offshore wind farms will be required, and new nuclear power stations will be built.

""The budgets we have proposed are achievable, given available and developing technologies, and provided the policies in place are implemented and where necessary reinforced,"" Lord Turner said yesterday.

He described roads dominated by quiet electric vehicles with no traffic fumes, of houses kept warm with less energy through wide use use of insulation, of renewable energy sources installed in homes and factories, and where travellers used rail instead of air for short distances.

Lord Turner talked of the almost complete ""decarbonisation"" of the power sector by 2030, achieved through renewables and carbon capture and storage. Many businesses would face higher costs from having to buy carbon permits, predicted to reach £40 a tonne by 2020, from about £14 today.

Businesses not covered by the European Union's emissions trading scheme could also expect to be covered by other policies designed to reduce their emissions, mostly through encouraging energy efficiency.

The government would raise income by selling emissions permits to businesses, but would also face costs as the revenue from green taxes, such as fuel duty, fell as people moved away from fossil fuels.

It was ""an extremely bold target"", said Gareth Stace, head of environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' group. Britain could hit the target, but only ""with a lot of government help directed at the real economy"".

The report did not signal an end to new coal-fired power stations, as some campaigners had hoped. New coal-fired plants could go ahead, but only if they were fitted with carbon capture and storage technology when built, or retro-fitted with the technology from about 2020, the report said.

Ed Miliband, the energy and climate change secretary, said ministers would consider the report. If it is accepted, the chancellor is likely to have to present a ""carbon budget"" setting out how fiscal measures would affect emissions levels, alongside the national Budget from next spring.

How industry must adapt

Road transport Drivers will have to embrace electric vehicles if the UK is to meet its climate change targets, and the UK could become a manufacturing centre for this new breed of cars. More public transport will also be needed Aviation and shipping Policies may have to be introduced to encourage rail use over air. But it may be impossible to cut emissions from aviation and shipping by 80 per cent by 2050, even with new technologies and the use of biofuels Heavy industry Manufacturing sectors covered by the European Union's emissions trading scheme will pay higher prices for carbon permits - about £30 to £35 by 2020, according to the report. Most companies will see their allocation of permits cut, by about 1.7 per cent a year from 2013 to 2020 Construction More jobs in the short term in equipping homes with insulation. Homebuilders will also have to look to renewable energy technologies, which will be more expensive initially but repay costs over time Overall costs More than £15bn a year, increasing as the economy grows

The climate change committee, chaired by Lord Turner, says the estimated £15bn a year cost of cutting emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels is no reason to hold back on measures ranging from electrifying public transport to a large expansion of renewable energy.

It is advocating that by 2020 the UK should cut emissions by more than 26 per cent compared with 1990 levels. Exceeding the EU goal of a 20 per cent cut by this deadline is necessary, Lord Tur-ner will say, so the UK can meet its legal obligation of an 80 per cent cut by 2050.

Many of the measures needed to achieve the reductions will raise prices to consumers, at least in the short to medium term.

But Lord Turner will say that failing to tackle climate change now will lead to far higher costs in the medium and long term. He will also call for measures to protect the low-paid, pensioners and other vulnerable consumers from initial price rises.

The emission cuts are to be made in the framework of three five-year ""carbon budgets"" running to 2022. These show how far emissions must be cut and by when, implying drastic changes to the way government operates. ""In a world with carbon budgets, every important decision will have to be made on the basis of whether it fits the budget, whether emissions savings can be made elsewhere, or whether it simply can't be done,"" Ed Miliband, secretary of state for energy and climate change, warned fellow ministers last week.

Other measures likely to be set out in the report include stricter enforcement of the 70mph speed limit on motorways and a national programme of home insulation, both of which save fuel.

But, in a disappointment to the government, the committee is cautious on the prospect for ""green-collar jobs"". ""You have to bear in mind that if you are creating green jobs, you may be destroying jobs elsewhere,"" warns one official.

The report will not categorically rule out new coal-fired power stations, such as the one proposed at Kings-north, the first to be built in the UK in decades. But any new power station using the most carbon-intensive fuel would have to be built with carbon capture and storage or be fitted with the technology afterwards.

""Power companies are not planning to run unabated coal through the 2020s,"" one official said, adding that they expected to retrofit carbon capture and storage technology if it was not in-corporated from the outset.

Ministers will be able to justify plans for a third runway at Heathrow, but only if they can make substantial emission savings elsewhere.

The committee also urges stronger measures to ""decarbonise"" home heating.

"WORLD NEWS, Wednesday, November 19, 2008 399 mots, p. 10",,Indonesia setback on climate change,By John Aglionby in Bali,,"Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil producer and emitter of greenhouse gases through deforestation, yesterday dealt a blow to hopes it would step up efforts to combat climate change.

Anton Apriyantono, the agriculture minister, told the annual conference of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil that sustainability criteria should not be made a priority, particularly for smallholders, ""when economic needs are not being met"" in the global financial crisis.

The announcement contradicts the views of many of the RSPO's 261 members who believe that, to remain relevant, the movement has to update its principles in the face of emissions caused by clearance of tropical forests for oil palm plantations.

Environmental groups, surprised by the frankness of the Jakarta government's admission, said it reinforced Indonesia's reputation for being committed to conservation only when there was a revenue stream to be developed.

Jakarta acknowledged its position as the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases only after it learnt it could make billions of dollars a year through carbon credits by not cutting down trees.

Indonesia's current deforestation rate is equivalent to clearing the area of several football pitches a minute.

It is unclear how much of this cleared land is being converted to oil palm plantations because the industry is not closely regulated and there is much illegal felling.

The industry is suffering from a massive collapse in prices, with benchmark futures yesterday on the Malaysian stock exchange down 68 per cent from last March's record high.

Indonesia now has 6.7m hectares under oil palm, generating 18m tonnes of oil. It wants to increase this to 8.1m hectares and 23.2m tonnes by 2010.

The RSPO is a voluntary organisation comprising producers, buyers, traders, banks, smallholders and non-governmental organisations. Its members account for half of the world's 41m tonnes of annual production and the first-ever shipment of sustainable palm oil reached Europe last week.

The amount of sustainable oil that will be produced in 2009 is estimated at 1.5m tonnes.

The organisation's eight principles were proposed in 2005 when less attention was paid to climate change. They include a commitment to environmental responsibility and conservation. Many members want a commitment to mitigating climate change stated openly.

Jan Kees Vis, the RSPO president and director of sustainable agriculture at Unilever, the convenience goods company, said: ""We should boost our credibility by making the emphasis on [mitigating] climate change more explicit."" But Mr Anton said: ""Not all problems can be solved at once and we should avoid making new requirements before the previous ones have been met.""

Derom Bangun, an RSPO vice-president and chairman of the Indonesian palm oil producers' association, said: ""We think it's good enough to stick to what we have and apply it with continuous reinforcement.""

Brihannala Morgan, of the Rainforest Action Network, said the government had shown ""environmental conservation, climate conservation, is taking a back seat to economic development. And right now, economic development looks like oil palm expansion."""
"BUSINESS LIFE, Thursday, November 13, 2008 710 mots, p. 16",,In search of the hottest thinking on climate change,,,"At a time of global financial crisis and economic downturn, the temptation to focus on the most urgent short-term problems is strong. The FT Climate Change Challenge, backed by Hewlett-Packard, the information technology company, and Forum for the Future, the sustainable development group, aims to highlight businesses and other organisations with ground-breaking approaches to what is arguably the greatest long-term danger we face.

Lionel Barber, editor of the Financial Times, says: ""The FT is delighted to support this initiative. We believe it should encourage innovation in tackling the problem of climate change, which is widely recognised as one of the most important public policy challenges of our time.""

The objective of the competition is to harness the collective brainpower of FT readers to identify ideas that have the potential to be scaled up to a significant size, both to build a successful business and to have a material impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

Over the next 11 weeks, FT readers will be invited to submit suggestions of companies with imaginative ideas for addressing the threat of climate change.

From those suggestions, a short-list of five will be chosen by a judging panel including Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco, Sir Richard Branson, Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Mark Hurd, chairman and chief executive of HP.

The short-listed ideas will then be presented in the FT newspaper and online in March 2009, and readers will have a chance to vote for their favourite. The winner in the vote will receive a $75,000 prize, sponsored by HP, to help develop their product and bring it to market.

Peter Madden, chief executive of Forum for the Future, says: ""We have to innovate our way out of the climate crisis, and that means unleashing a wave of creativity not seen since the Industrial Revolution. By showcasing some of the world's most exciting innovations, we want to show there are solutions to climate change, and money to be made from finding those solutions.""

We are looking for ideas that have progressed further than the drawing board, but are not yet fully commercial; proposals that are sufficiently worked-up to demonstrate their potential, but not yet established businesses.

We are also ruling out large corporations. BP, the energy giant, may have a compelling plan for carbon capture and storage, or General Electric, the US conglomerate, may have succeeded in building a new kind of wind turbine, but all have the resources they need to develop their innovations to the full potential.

Our winner will be an idea that deserves to go big, but will only be able to do so with an extra push from the recognition and cash it will gain from winning the FT Climate Change Challenge.

The innovation need not be technological, although such entries are certainly eligible. Creativity could equally come in marketing, financing, analysis or in an entire business model.

Among the ideas that readers uncover - along with contributions from the FT and Forum for the Future experts - we would hope to find proposals that could match up to flourishing initiatives such as Streetcar and Zipcar, SolarCity and Grameen Shakti.

Streetcar and Zipcar are car-sharing clubs that rent pay-as-you-go small cars, typically for short trips. Members pick up and drop off cars parked at designated bays. They have experienced rapid growth: US-based Zipcar had 225,000 members worldwide by last summer, and London-based Streetcar, which started with eight cars in 2004, is trebling in size every year and aims to have 250,000 members by 2012.

Because car clubs give members the freedom of having a vehicle when they need one, they encourage people to give up owning a car; as a result they drive less and their motoring emissions are cut.

SolarCity is an example of innovation in marketing and finance. The California-based provider of solar energy systems has surmounted the problem of consumers' resistance to making the initial commitment to invest in solar panels by leasing the equipment to home owners.

The result is that consumers can install solar power without a large upfront payment and split the benefit of future savings, including government subsidies, with the company. SolarCity even guarantees the savings that consumers can make.

Grameen Shakti is another innovator in marketing and finance, as well as in economic and social development. Founded by the Nobel prize-winner Muhammad Yunus of the Grameen Bank, the micro-credit pioneer, Grameen Shakti provides solar panels, improved cooking stoves and biogas plants in Bangladesh. It supplies poor communities at affordable prices, and also trains local people as engineers to fit and maintain its products.

These businesses are sufficiently well-established not to require any help from this competition. But we know that there are many more companies with great ideas out there; indeed, we have already come across a few.

With your help, we want to get them noticed and give them a chance to show what they can do.

"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, November 13, 2008 330 mots, p. 10",,Watchdog in plea to avert 'shocking' climate change,By Ed Crooks in London,,"Restricting the rise in global temperatures to only 2°C will require the use of new technologies that are not yet widely available and a price for carbon dioxide emissions well above today's levels, the International Energy Agency warned yesterday.

The developed countries' watchdog said in its annual World Energy Outlook that continued growth in energy use with ""business as usual"" policies would have ""shocking"" consequences for the climate - raising average temperatures by up to 6°C.

Warming on that scale would be catastrophic, causing the melting of the ice at both poles, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Nobuo Tanaka, the IEA's executive director, said it would be ""possible, but very hard"" to cut carbon emissions to keep atmospheric concentration of CO2 no higher than 450 parts per million - a level consistent with a rise of only 2°C in average temperatures.

Keeping atmospheric CO2 to 550ppm would be easier and would not require any technologies that have not yet been deployed. But it would still demand significant changes to the world's energy system and would imply a temperature rise of up to 3°C, with damaging effects including droughts in some regions and increased flooding in others.

Renewable energy, particularly wind power, is growing fast and is set to overtake gas as the world's second largest source of electricity generation, after coal, not long after 2010, the IEA believes.

However, to reach its 450ppm scenario, there would still need to be enormous changes. Wind power capacity, for example, would have to increase more than 13-fold from its present level by 2030 and nuclear power would need to double.

By the same date, coal and gas-fired power stations equivalent to 15 per cent of today's global capacity would need to be fitted with equipment to capture and store CO2 emissions - a technology that is not expected to be demonstrated in a large-scale project until well into the next decade.

Other technologies that are not yet available on a commercial scale, such as advanced ""second generation"" biofuels made from algae or plant waste, would also be needed.

The IEA highlighted the importance of the world's developing countries' signing-up to international emissions-reduction plans.

If the countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continued along the ""business as usual path"", even the complete cessation of all carbon dioxide emissions from OECD members would not be enough to reach the IEA's 450ppm scenario."
"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, November 11, 2008 358 mots, p. 12",,Climate change drives Maldives to buy land,By Judith Evans in Malé,,"The Maldives will divert cash from tourism, to buy land in case rising sea levels submerge its low-lying coral islands, the vice-president-elect said yesterday.

Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik said the ""worst-case scenario due to sea level rise would be that some or even all of our islands would become uninhabitable and we would have to look for alternative places for Maldivians to live.""

A new sovereign wealth fund, modelled on those established in oil-rich Middle Eastern states, is ""part of our longer-term perspective,"" Mr Waheed said. It will be preceded by an overhaul of state finances in the tourism-dependent country.

Eighty per cent of the Maldives' 1,200 islands - of which 200 are inhabited - are less than a metre above sea level.

Studies have said the Indian Ocean state could be submerged within 100 years.

The government of Mohamed Nasheed will be sworn in on Tuesday after the country's first democratic election, ending 30 years of authoritarian rule by Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the president.

Mr Gayoom, who has been accused of human rights abuses and criticised for his tight control over the nation's 380,000 residents, has raised the link between climate change and the human rights of potentially displaced citizens in international forums.

But Scott Leckie, director of Displacement Solutions, a Swiss-based refugee consultancy, warned, ""We don't know where they plan to buy this land or whether they have thought it through . . . Are they actually asking to re-establish the Maldives elsewhere?""

Other states with lowlying land, such as Tuvalu and Papua New Guinea, have already started to feel the effects of rising sea levels, Mr Leckie said.

A formal request was made by Australia's Green party in October for the country to grant special visas to Tuvaluan climate change refugees but the request was denied.

""The question [of relocation] needs to be sorted out by all 50 territories that stand to be affected by rising sea levels,"" said Mr Leckie. He added that there were ""rumours Maldivian officials have already started to buy plots of land in Sri Lanka for the future"".

Mr Waheed said the new government would seek international help to strengthen the natural barriers of the Maldives' coral reefs, and create artificial sections of reef as a buffer against rising seas.

It has also pledged to introduce solar power and seek foreign investment in other alternative energy technologies.

But like the previous government, Mr Nasheed has no plans to cut the polluting long-haul flights on which the Maldives' tourism industry depends.

Instead, his Maldivian Democratic party said it would introduce corporate taxation in the industry as part of a raft of fiscal reforms."
"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, November 8, 2008 224 mots, p. 5",,China tells west to boost climate effort,By Geoff Dyer in Beijing,,"The developed world should abandon its ""unsustainable lifestyle"" and do more to help poor nations adapt to climate change, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, said yesterday.

The slowdown in the global economy caused by the financial crisis should not be allowed to hamper efforts to deal with global warming, said Mr Wen, and more technology should be transferred to poorer countries.

""It took developed countries several decades to solve the problems of saving energy and cutting emissions, while China has to solve the same problem in a much shorter period. So the difficulty is unprecedented,"" Mr Wen said at a UN-sponsored climate conference in Beijing. on climate change. ""Developed countries should shoulder the duty and responsibility to tackle climate change and should alter their unsustainable lifestyle,"" he added. The comments reflect the more assertive tone that China has been taking in talks about climate change, especially given the expectation that a Barack Obama administration will shift the position of the US.

China has previously tended to play a secondary role on issues such as climate change. But with several research institutes calculating that China has overtaken the US to be the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases - even though it is still well behind on a per capita basis - the government is worried that its record could become the focus of negotiations.

A senior European diplomat said: ""Everyone is waiting to see what the new US administration does but China very much does not want to become a pariah on this issue. You will see them being more constructive and also trying to shift the argument much more."""

Page 9",,Oil chief fears climate inaction,,,"Mr Mulva, a keynote speaker at this year's Cambridge Energy Research Associates conference, said such stonewalling would cause ""incalculable damage"" to efforts to fight terrorism and encourage trade.

""The US has missed opportunities to show leadership because it lacks a coherent approach,"" he said, noting that any national policy may be 1-2 years off, although individual US states are taking action on their own.

If the ""prevailing confusion"" continued, said Abdallah Jum'ah, president and chief executive of the Saudi Arabian Oil Company, there was a risk that necessary expansion of energy supplies would be compromised. ""The world community needs to reach a consensus on this issue.''

Mr Mulva said climate change concerns were likely to constrain the ability to provide sustainable energy."
"NATIONAL NEWS, Monday, October 27, 2008 201 mots, p. 5",,MPs reach climate bill deal on transport,"By Alex Barker, Political Correspondent",,"A compromise deal has been reached to include shipping and aviation in the climate change bill after ministers bowed to pressure from backbench MPs and environmental campaigners.

Under the deal, the government will ""take account"" of shipping and aviation as it plans to meet emission reduction targets, but leaves the method of measurement to be set in coming years.

The concession by Ed Miliband, energy secretary, is likely to defuse a growing revolt in the House of Commons and ease the passage of a bill setting a target to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.

Ministers initially resisted including aviation and shipping in the bill because there was no agreed method for allocating emissions from international transport.

Friends of the Earth welcomed the change of tack to close what they regarded as a loophole in the law.

""The final piece of the jigsaw is in place. The world's first climate change law will also be a world-class climate change law,"" said Andy Atkins, chief executive.

More than 50 Labour MPs, including a former environment minister, had signed a parliamentary amendment demanding that aviation and shipping be included.

The government will accept an amendment by Elliot Morley tomorrow, stating that ""the emissions of greenhouse gases from international aviation or international shipping"" will be taken into account by ministers setting ""carbon bud-gets"".

""We're bringing forward the date by which these emissions should be included in those covered by the bill to the end of 2012,"" said an aide to Mr Miliband."
"GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS, Friday, October 17, 2008 523 mots, p. 2",,French footwork keeps climate plans on track,By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels and Ed Crooks and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, used some smart diplomatic footwork yesterday to quell a rebellion by eight European Union countries that had threatened to stall the bloc's effort to agree on a wide range of -climate reforms by the end of the year.

The key question now is whether the EU can assuage enough of its member states' concerns, while keeping its goals intact. For each group that receives special consideration, others are bound to demand similar treatment.

""The problem is that it's like opening a Pandora's box,"" one Commission official said, predicting a frantic period of bargaining in the weeks ahead.

Reaching an agreement is important not only to France's EU presidency but also to the EU itself, which has staked much of its political credibility on its ability to lead the world in environmental policy. Time is of the essence, with an international conference scheduled next year to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto treaty.

Poland looms as one of the biggest obstacles, because it is almost entirely reliant on coal for its electricity. The country has complained that the next phase of Europe's emissions trading scheme - in which utilities would be forced to buy carbon allowances at auction, beginning in 2013 - would result in enormous cost increases.

Along with other east European countries, it complained that poorer EU countries were being forced to shoulder an unfair share of the emissions burden.

""There are a number of legitimate concerns for the new member states that have not been sufficiently taken into account,"" said Christian Egenhofer, an energy specialist at the Centre for European Policy Studies. Mr Egenhofer suggested that there might be ways to appease Poland by giving its power companies more free allowances or a longer phase-in period to comply fully with auctions.

Another possibility might be to steer a bigger share of the annual projected auction revenue - some €50bn ($67bn, £39bn) or more, depending on the price of carbon - to Polish energy projects. Poland is not the only party angling for adjustments. Italy has been among the most vociferous in arguing for a reassessment of the EU's climate change strategy.

Umberto Quadrino, the chief executive of Edison, Italy's second biggest electricity company, told the Financial Times yesterday that the EU's targets were ""simply not achievable"" with existing technology.

Some of the loudest complaints have come from industry, where executives question why they will have to meet emissions targets when competitors in the US, India and China have yet to make similar commitments.

European industrialists wield the threat of ""carbon leakage"", warning that they will be forced to move production outside Europe unless they receive help.

""We play in a global market,"" said Russel Mills, director of energy and climate policy at chemical group Dow Europe. ""If you look at our industry, we would be subject to massive carbon leakage if a transitional approach isn't found."" Dow and other companies have proposed that they receive their emissions allowances free but also agree to benchmarks for reductions.

There are signs that industrial concerns are winning some sympathy. French officials floated a proposal that would extend the deadline by three years to meet new emissions standards.

Opponents of such concessions note that the cost of fighting global warming will only increase the longer it is delayed. Some argue that the economic downturn, cited by industrialists as a reason for loosening EU targets, could in fact ease the cost of compliance because reduced industrial activity will limit greenhouse gas emissions.

That could leave cement and steelmakers, for example, with more emissions permits, reducing the impact of the trading scheme.

As they try to shepherd though a deal, French officials have pledged to examine each case independently. They will have to decide whether Polish and other complaints are legitimate or an opportunistic attempt to strike better terms."
"FT REPORT - SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS 2008 - FRONT PAGE, Thursday, October 9, 2008 1106 mots, p. 1",,Staying on course in a tougher climate,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Concerns over climate change have not been at the forefront of most chief executives' minds in recent weeks: the financial crisis and economic downturn have eclipsed all other issues. While managers are worried about whether their businesses are sustainable economically, the question of whether they are sustainable environmentally seems less pressing.

Before the crisis wiped out other concerns, companies were increasingly eager to trumpet their environmental credentials. Large companies, including household names such as Wal-Mart and General Electric, Ford and Coca-Cola, HSBC and News Corporation, made pledges to cut their greenhouse gas emissions and lessen their environmental impact.

What will happen to companies' environmental commitments when businesses are fighting for their survival? Will the pledges made in a sunnier economic climate be forgotten?

Talk to any of the companies that have taken a lead on environmental issues, and the answer is the same: no. Environmental sustainability is just as important in a downturn, they insist.

""Our goal is still to be one of the world's leading brands in corporate sustainability and we regard it as central to business strategy,"" says Francis Sullivan, deputy head of corporate sustainability at HSBC.

""We continue our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint and implementing our sustainability risk policies. We also maintain that sustainability offers diverse business opportunities [such as investment in renewable energy].""

Bank of America announced last March it was embarking on a $20bn 10-year strategy to tackle climate change, and help its customers do the same. The company insists that the crisis engulfing the sector will not deflect it from this purpose.

""[We] continue to move forward with our environmental initiative to address climate change,"" the company says. ""Now, more than ever, there is a critical need for financing to develop environmentally sustainable products and technologies, accelerate the deployment of existing technologies, and increase energy efficiency.""

Retailers and consumer goods companies are equally adamant that they will stay the course.

""Sustainability will remain critical to our business, even during an economic downturn,"" says Ian Cheshire, group chief executive at Kingfisher. ""As a major international retailer, we have a responsibility to tackle issues such as climate change and work towards a more sustainable future.""

Mr Cheshire says the company's customers are ""increasingly aware of environmental issues"" and seeking to buy products accordingly.

Indeed, companies would be foolish to abandon their green credentials at the first sign of difficulty, says Solitaire Townsend, chief executive of Futerra Sustainability Communications, which advises companies on their green strategies.

""How would it look,"" she asks. ""If companies drop [their interest in green issues], everyone will understand that they didn't mean it after all. What will that do to their relationship with their customers - or with their staff?""

Consumers are still interested in environmental matters, despite their economic worries, argues Jenny Dawkins, research director at Ipsos Mori, the polling company. She points to polls from the UK to prove the point: the environment was mentioned as a top concern by 8 per cent of people surveyed in September.

This is far below the number concerned about the economy - 55 per cent, the highest recorded since this series of polls began in 1974 - and below the peak of 19 per cent of people who rated it a top concern in early 2007, shortly after the release of Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth . But it is much higher than the 2 to 4 per cent of people who rated the environment a top concern in the period 2002 to 2004. The environment remains relatively high among people's priorities.

""The environment has been overshadowed [by the economy] but it has not dropped off the radar,"" says Ms Dawkins.

People in the US are also still interested in climate change, says Michael Allegretti, head of government relations in the US for the Climate Group, a non-profit organisation that works with businesses on cutting emissions. Although the economy may be a more pressing concern, public opinion is in favour of taking action to tackle global warming, he says.

Businesses should take note, advises Ms Dawkins. ""Seven out of 10 people think that in tough economic times it is more important for a company to behave responsibly,"" she says. ""The onus is very much on companies to continue to behave responsibly in line with consumer expectations. That pressure is not going away.""

What is more, companies have much to gain from taking steps to improve their environmental performance, says Ms Townsend. ""This is not some fluffy issue. It is a business issue. Companies should understand that.""

The guiding principles behind behaving in an environmentally sound manner are the same as the principles of thrift and economy, she points out.

Using fewer resources is at the core of environmental sustainability, and leads to cost savings. ""Thrift and being green go hand in hand,"" she says.

Jan Babiak, global climate change and sustainability services leader at Ernst & Young, says that companies should realise that there are substantial savings to be made: from cutting down on the wasteful use of energy to economising with other materials.

She says: ""Insightful managements realise that having an environmental policy in place will save them a lot of money. There are some very simple but impactful changes that can be made. Double-sided printing and switching lights to movement sensitive activation are just two small examples.""

The current high energy prices only make the issue more important in a downturn, adds Andrew Caveney, partner for business advisory services at Ernst & Young. He explains: ""Rocketing energy and commodity prices represent a far more powerful driver of green business practices than the existing level of legislation or consumer pressure.""

Managers can learn much about how to improve their business processes from looking at their carbon dioxide emissions, he says. ""Carbon in the supply chain is not only a liability in itself but an indicator of an inefficient operating model and exposure to rising energy prices.""

Businesses that ignore climate change may also expose themselves to large risks. For instance, they may be challenged by lawsuits from plaintiffs arguing that companies have caused damage to property by failing to take action to cut their emissions.

Companies also face the risk of the damaging effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, droughts, floods and fiercer storms. Tightening environmental regulations - such as the introduction of a cap-and-trade system for cutting carbon emissions in the US, which has been promised by both presidential candidates - present a further risk for unwary companies.

Mr Sullivan of HSBC says: ""Managing risk and promoting business opportunity is critical and, in the context of sustainability issues, is as important today as it was before the current challenges in the financial markets surfaced.""

As well as posing a threat, climate change opens opportunities for companies beyond efficiency savings. If the global economy is to move to lower-carbon means of production, then many industries will have to change.

The energy industry is the most obvious, as renewable forms of energy will have to take precedence over fossil fuels. New carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage are also being developed, opening up a new market.

Other sectors will also have to change, opening opportunities for new products and business techniques. Construction companies, for instance, will have to find ways to make greener buildings, using more environmentally sound materials and designs. Car companies are looking to use new technologies such as electric engines and hydrogen fuel cells. Airlines are testing new designs and fuels made from plants.

The downturn will have some effect on the number of companies bringing out ""green"" initiatives, predicts Ms Townsend at Futerra.

""Companies that just wanted to dip their toe in the water, or that wanted to gush about climate change rather than really doing anything real about their environmental impact - they will go away,"" she says.

""There will be a lot fewer 'have-a-go greenies' around, those companies that just talk about green issues because they think it's fashionable.""

But companies with a longer-term vision, and companies that perceive the benefits of environmental management, will continue to seek to improve their green performance, she says. ""Consumers will trust those companies more."""
"MARKETS & INVESTING, Wednesday, October 8, 2008 268 mots, p. 29",,Climate groups' revenue hits $300bn,By Fiona Harvey,,"Companies providing goods and services that tackle climate change now form a bigger industry grouping than the global software and biotechnology sectors combined, according to new research.

Global annual revenues from such businesses - which include renewable energy companies, nuclear power and energy management specialists - have surpassed $300bn for the first time, HSBC's global banking and markets research team have found.

HSBC said that 390 companies around the world could now be classed as providing goods or services that tackle climate change, up from 300 companies a year ago and about 166 in early 2004.

""During the last year we've seen a massive growth in the number of companies providing goods and services designed to address climate change,"" said Joaquim de Lima, global head of quant research for equities at HSBC. ""This demonstrates that companies are taking the issue seriously and are willing to adapt their businesses to the challenges.""

That had not been uncovered before, because companies providing climate change products are not normally considered together, but are spread across many existing sector categories.

The companies include large multinationals such as Siemens and Philips, which are usually considered as general industrials; large renewable energy companies, such as Vestas and Suzlon, the Danish and Indian maker of wind turbines; and a large number of smaller start-ups, such as energy management software specialists.

But the HSBC index of climate change companies excludes those that derive only a small proportion of their revenues from low-emissions products or services. The company's index was designed to help investors gain exposure to companies that are expected to profit from dealing with climate change. HSBC said there was now a ""clearly identifiable sector"".

The UK-listed global bank's index represented about 4 per cent of global market capitalisation in September, up from about 2.5 per cent last year."
"NATIONAL NEWS - LABOUR CONFERENCE, Wednesday, September 24, 2008 479 mots, p. 2",,Climate change move chills business,"By Jean Eaglesham, Chief Political Correspondent",,"Business expressed concern at Gordon Brown's signal of a potentially dramatic rise in climate change targets, but insisted it was ""quite comfortable"" with the rest of a speech welcomed by the unions as a lurch to the left.

The seemingly paradoxical reactions from the business groups and trade unions - both welcomed the prime minister's apparent support for their members - appeared a sign of battles postponed, rather than an outbreak of consensus. Once Downing Street spells out what lies behind the rhetoric, it seems inevitable that some of the expectations springing from the speech will be confounded.

One area of prime ministerial rhetoric being analysed carefully by business was climate change.

Mr Brown's statement that he was ""asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for by 2050 not a 60 per cent cut in our carbon emissions but an 80 per cent cut"" was welcomed by green groups.

Meanwhile, the unions, which have spent the conference calling for a windfall tax on utilities and lambasting City fat cats, appeared to scent a triumphant reversion to old- style socialism.

Derek Prentis, general secretary of Unison, hailed the speech as showing ""clear red water between Labour and the Conservatives"". Derek Simpson, joint leader of the Unite union, applauded a ""real Labour speech from a real Labour leader"".

But business focused instead on Mr Brown's assurance that ""we are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government"".

The Forum of Private Business said it was ""incredible"" Mr Brown could laud the creation of 1m small and medium-sized businesses under Labour as ""not just a number"" but evidence of changes such as ""the local businessman who's taken on two local teenagers as apprentices"". The forum pointed out the number of businesses employing people had remained static at 1.2m since 1997. ""In future, Mr Brown should remind himself of the arithmetic of his own statistics when he is called to defend his record on supporting small businesses,"" said Phil Orford, the forum's chief executive.

Employers reacted positively less to what the prime minister said than to what he deliberately did not say, in terms of resisting the left's demands for punitive taxes or regulation.

""It was a good speech - much stronger and better delivered than he usually does, with an overall positive message,"" said Miles Templeman, director-general of the Institute of Directors. ""We're quite comfortable from a business point of view. He didn't say much about business but he didn't throw a sop to the left wing either.""

Richard Lambert, director-general of the CBI employers' group, said the words on business and markets were ""unexceptional stuff"".

Business found nothing in the broad brush statements of regulatory principles on which the prime minister intended to ""rebuild the world financial system"". The commitments to ensuring ""transparency"" and ""sound banking"" were seen as a statement of commonsense. The way such objectives are implemented may be an-other matter altogether.

Mr Lambert told the FT ""no one could disagree"" with the assertion that markets should not be left to function untrammelled by any regulation. But he warned: ""There were no details about how we're going to get there, other than that regulation needed to be global. There's an awful lot to be fleshed out before we can understand what he meant.""

Stuart Fraser, chairman of the City of London's policy committee, said it was essential the ""inevitable"" changes to financial services regulation after the markets turmoil were ""carefully thought through, fully consulted on with the industry and not just a knee-jerk reaction to the current crisis"".

"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, September 23, 2008 354 mots, p. 9",,Climate change fears after German opt-out,"By Chris Bryant in Berlin, Fiona Harvey in London and Tony Barber in Brussels",,"A German government decision to back an almost total exemption for industry from new rules that would force companies to pay for the carbon dioxide they emit threatens to undermine a key tenet of European Union climate policy, climate campaigners warn.

The decision is a victory for German industry, which feared European Commission proposals for an auction of carbon emission permits would cost billions of euros and restrict its ability to compete internationally.

Angela Merkel, chancellor, warned recently that although she supported the need to tackle climate change, she ""could not support the destruction of German jobs through an illadvised climate policy"".

Climate campaigners said the move would open the door to a slew of objections from other states seeking to protect their own key industries during the next phase of the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS).

""There are a lot of countries that want to protect their own industries without the economic arguments to back this up,"" said Joris den Blanken, senior policy advisor at Greenpeace.

The European parliament's industry committee last week voted to replace the current free distribution of carbon-dioxide permits with a mandatory auction between 2013 and 2020 in a bid to help cut European greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent from 1990 levels.

The proposals are likely to face a vote at a plenary session of the parliament later this year but must then be ratified by the heads of member states.

The German government is not alone in seeking opt- outs. Poland is anxious that auctioning could severely affect its power companies while Italy is pushing for free carbon permits for specific sectors.

After months of internal wrangling, Germany has accepted that from 2013, power companies, including those that construct new power plants, should take part in the auction process.

However, because this is expected to lead to higher electricity costs, the government is to insist that energy-intensive industries like aluminium producers should be compensated with free carbon permits.

Germany will also push for an exemption for large emitters like the steel industry, subject to these companies using the best available emission control technology.

Remaining companies would have their purchase of certificates capped at 20 per cent of total emissions.

The German government defends its stance by claiming there is a risk of carbon-emitting industries relocating to countries where they would be free to pollute.

""As long as European companies are governed by stricter climate protection regulations than their competitors in countries like China, we have to seek to establish special rules,"" said Sigmar Gabriel, environment minister.

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, September 22, 2008 340 mots, p. 8",,Investors weigh risks of not fighting climate change,By Emma Byrne and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Investors are using information on companies' carbon dioxide emissions to manage their portfolios, according to an annual survey of the world's leading businesses.

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), backed by hundreds of institutional investors, asks the world's biggest companies to report their greenhouse gas emissions. This year, almost two-thirds of the 385 institutional investors behind the project, whose findings are published today, said they used the survey to identify companies not adequately addressing climate change.

The Axa Group, for instance, said: ""In terms of investment policy, companies which are ill-prepared for more stringent environmental regulation may face unexpected new expenses and decreasing ability to sustain their returns and share price.""

The investors are basing their decisions on the belief that emissions will be more closely regulated around the world in future, giving companies that already manage their emissions a competitive advantage. They are also weighing other factors, such as the risk that companies may face future litigation, and the possible illeffects of climate change, such as floods and storms.

Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the CDP, said: ""[The survey is] effectively an audit of climate-change risk. Over 1,500 companies have gone through that process this year, with 77 per cent of the Global 500 responding. Whilst it's hard to evaluate definitively, the CDP is likely to have had a pivotal role in developing consciousness of those risks.""

This year's report found that companies were starting to manage environmental risk at board level. Of the 383 groups that responded to the Global 500 survey, nearly two-thirds said they had an executive with overall responsibility for climate-change management, compared with half of respondents in 2007, and most had put in place some risk management measures to prepare for climate change.

Companies in all sectors said that uncertainty about future regulation was a stumbling block. Arcelor Mittal told the survey: ""There is significant risk in the lack of predictability in climate-change regulation.""

Another survey, by McKinsey and the UK government-funded Carbon Trust, found that companies were failing to respond adequately to the need to reduce emissions.

Tom Delay, chief executive of the Carbon Trust, said: ""Our findings show that we are not on the path to a low-carbon economy. This is something that will impact on all investors - it will have a damaging effect on shareholder value. Shareholders should be demanding that the companies they invest in address these issues."""
"MORE COMMENT ONLINE, Friday, September 5, 2008 378 mots, p. 8",,The EU adds up climate change,,,"It assesses six recent studies, from the UK's Stern review of the economic impact of climate change and a World Bank analysis to research prepared by Vattenfall, the Swedish energy company. In these reports, the average annual global costs for mitigating and adapting to climate change are put at anything from €230bn to €614bn, based on 2006 data.

The EU is not, these days, one of the world's great polluters. In 2004, the global economy emitted about 49bn tons of greenhouse gases (measured in carbon dioxide equivalent). The share of the 27-nation bloc was only 5.2bn tons, or 10.6 per cent.

However, as western Europe is one of the world's richest areas, and as Europe has historical responsibility for the CO2 emissions of its industrial heyday, the EU will surely have to pay more than 10.6 per cent of the global costs of fighting climate change.

According to the CEPS study, the smallest bill the EU could expect to pick up is €24.4bn a year, while the biggest is €194.3bn. The think-tank's own estimate, based on what it calls ""the limited likelihood of a global burden-sharing according to current emissions"", is that the EU will face annual costs of at least €60bn.

This figure is close to the forecast provided by the European Commission last January, when it published its all-encompassing proposals on energy and climate change policy. At the time, the Commission said €60bn - or about 0.5 per cent of the EU's annual gross domestic product - might seem a lot of money, but the cost of doing nothing would be even higher.

Has the message got through, I wonder, to Germany's car manufacturers and their friends in the European Parliament?

This week, the legislature's industry committee tried to weaken a Commission proposal for capping CO2 emissions from new cars. Rather than imposing a target of 130 grammes per kilometre on all new cars by 2012, the committee voted to apply it to only 60 per cent of new cars and to delay full introduction of the target until 2015. The vote was unmistakably aimed at helping German carmakers, whose models are bigger and less green than those of France and Italy.

This is, of course, hardly the last word on the subject. The parliamentary committee's vote isn't binding. But when it comes to converting the EU's high-sounding principles on climate change into concrete legislation, the devil is always in the detail."
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, September 1, 2008 596 mots, p. 13",,Climate changing in favour of SRI,By Owen Walker,,"The traditional view of an investment approach that takes account of environmental, social and governance issues has been one of compromise: conscienceburdened investors having to forgo returns for the warm inner feeling that their investments were not being used to manufacture weapons.

But things have changed: investors no longer worry about settling for lower returns in order to satisfy their scruples.

Fund management style has evolved so that investors - in particular pension funds - are moving away from blocking out companies involved in certain industries and are looking to engage with them instead.

The largest growth area for this kind of investing has been climate change funds. The increasing acceptance that the environment is under threat from human activity has also meant more general socially responsible investment funds have attracted greater interest.

Lord Stern's 2006 report for the UK government into the economics of climate change predicted the value of low-carbon energy markets would be $500bn (£271bn, €340bn) by 2050, so it is no wonder many funds are seeing the green light.

Emma Howard Boyd, head of SRI and governance at Jupiter, says the company's green fund managers believe they are ""currently seeing the most interesting juncture in 20 years in terms of green investing"", despite economic volatility. She says this is due to attractive valuations and a huge uplift in activity and interest.

According to Ms Howard Boyd there are three key drivers for this: governments taking more action, consumers demanding sustainable products and businesses looking to exploit this opportunity. She says this triumvirate is positively engaged, resulting in a virtuous circle.

William Page, chair of State Street Global Advisor's socially responsible investment team, has been keeping his eye on international agreements on climate change quotas such as the Bali roadmap. He believes they could directly affect investments.

""Potential legislation may include incentives for the development of environmentally sustainable products and services across the economy. Not only is there a need to respond to and combat the effects of climate change, there is also a need to adapt,"" he says. ""We believe demand will increase for services that, for example, enable better agricultural yields and more efficient management of natural resources. Legislation will soon require carbon dioxide emissions to carry a defined price. With CO2 recognised as an internalised cost to doing business, companies with greater CO2 emissions will be penalised.""

The recognised need to tackle climate change has led to the launch of funds focused on investing in green technology. Craig Mackenzie, director of the Carbon Benchmarking Project at Edinburgh University and an ESG consultant for Hymans Robertson, describes the buzz being generated around two such funds - from BlackRock and Pictet Asset Management - as being similar to the dotcom boom.

""Lots of pension funds are really interested,"" he says. ""One attraction for those funds is there is no muddying the waters with ethics. There is no ethical judgment involved.""

Pension funds looking to invest ethically have often found themselves in a legal minefield. The ruling in the Cowan v Scargill case of 1985 has been widely seen as setting a precedent that pen sion funds should invest solely for the purpose of getting the best returns for members rather than taking an ethical stance.

This view was challenged by a report on behalf of the United Nations in 2005 by lawyers Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer, which suggested that failing to take ESG issues into account might constitute a breach of fiduciary duties. However, this has not been tested in court and Cowan v Scargill continues to act as a powerful deterrent.

But investors can get around this by using positive engagement rather than negative screening, according to Tim Currell, head of sustainable investment and corporate governance at Hewitt,. ""Where SRI would usually exclude tobacco stocks because it would seem immoral, an ESG approach would take a view on the litigation risk when assessing whether or not to invest,"" he says.

Mr Currell believes green investment is now less about trying to change the world, and more about seeing how the encompassing green agenda will affect investments.

""Climate change is the biggest issue of the moment,"" he says, ""only a fool would think about investing without considering the impact.""

"COMPANIES - INTERNATIONAL, Thursday, August 21, 2008 314 mots, p. 19",,Climate resolutions 'having big impact',By Jonathan Birchall in New York,,"A coalition of investors and environmental groups claimed yesterday that climate change-related shareholder resolutions filed in the US this year had achieved breakthrough results, reflecting growing investor concerns over global warming.

Of 57 resolutions filed by a range of socially concerned investors, almost half were withdrawn after companies ranging from Continental Airlines to El Paso made commitments on setting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other issues.

According to Ceres, a group that co-ordinates environmental initiatives by investors and activist groups, the 24 resolutions that went to a vote secured a record high average of voting support of 23 per cent, up from just over 17 per cent for the resolution votes two years ago.

While activist resolutions are always defeated in a vote, they have frequently contributed to US companies adopting policies that they initially resist - with Wal-Mart's new embrace of environmental and social sustainability targets the most high-profile example.

This year's tally included four climate-change related resolutions presented to ExxonMobil that were supported by the Rockefeller family, the company's longest continuous shareholders, causing significant embarrassment to its management.

In reviewing this season's effort, Ceres highlighted new commitments made this year on energy-efficient building from two leading US homebuilders, KB Home and Centex, which have both been targeted by resolutions calling for clearer reporting of their policies on energyefficient building.

A resolution calling on KB Home to set targets for reducing CO2 emissions was withdrawn after it said it was publishing a sustainability report that included a commitment to new energy-efficiency standards from next year.

Centex opposed a similar resolution at its annual meeting, but subsequently also announced new standards for the energy efficiency of its homes.

Laura Shaffer, of the Nathan Cummings Foundation, the investor that filed with the two homebuilders, said it was ""difficult to draw a direct line"" between resolutions and company actions. ""But the resolutions are a very valuable tool for getting an issue before the board of directors and shareholders.""

In a sign of changing attitudes towards climate change, all the resolutions filed with US homebuilders this year had the support of Risk Metrics and Proxy Governance, two of the big three US proxy vote advisory firms.

Three years ago, neither firm supported similar resolutions at the companies."
"OBSERVER, Thursday, February 14, 2008 194 mots, p. Page 8",,Observer: Defeating climate change by air,,,"The Virgin Atlantic chief told the United Nations this week that he was planning to set up a ""war room"" on climate change.

Funded with a few million dollars of his own money, the organisation will consider ""new and radical"" ideas on climate change. He warned global warming would only be tackled if people took it as seriously as they did the British effort to win the second world war.

Sir Richard is tight-lipped on his favourites for the post of ""the new Churchill"" needed to head the war room, but Al Gore might have some free time while, if former British prime minister Tony Blair doesn't get to be president of Europe, he too will be looking for a new challenge.

What will be the first task of the new Churchill? Climate experts tell us our runaway consumption of fossil fuels and the goods we make with them are causing the problem. That would have been familiar to the original Churchill, one of whose first actions in fighting Hitler was to ration essentials such as food, clothing and petrol.

During the war, British train stations and roadsides were plastered with posters asking: ""Is your journey really necessary?""

So surely the new climate Churchill will put up the same posters at Virgin check-in desks."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, August 14, 2008 552 mots, p. 4",,US presidential candidates resist watering down climate plans,,,"Observers of the increasingly commuter-focused presidential debate in the US could be forgiven for thinking that the pain of high petrol prices has driven the issue of global warming off the political agenda.

But they would be wrong. Both Mr Obama and John McCain are promising to implement radical cap-and-trade plans that would curb US carbon emissions - in Mr McCain's case a 60 per cent cut below 1990 levels by 2050, in Mr Obama's an 80 per cent decline.

Given the economic climate, neither candidate finds much profit in drawing attention to their plans - and when they do it is usually in the context of achieving ""energy independence"" rather than tackling global warming. Yet neither has given in to the temptation to water them down.

""I hate to be fair to the Obama campaign but it is remarkable that we have two presidential candidates who are proposing mandatory plans to reduce -America's carbon emissions,"" says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr McCain's senior economic policy adviser.

That is where the similarity ends. The difference between Mr McCain's plan, which would initially -allocate tradeable carbon permits for free, and Mr Obama's, which would start with a 100 per cent auction of permits, is large.

The McCain camp describes its opponent's plan as imposing too steep a burden on businesses too quickly without easing the transition costs.

The Obama campaign describes Mr McCain's plan as a recipe for ""corporate welfare"" since it would incentivise Washington's corporate lobbyists to push for more free permits to be awarded to their sectors.

""The lesson from the European experience is that you don't want to give away -permits - you should move immediately to a marketdetermined price for carbon,"" says Jason Furman, Mr Obama's economic policy director. ""You should aim for as much predictability and reliability as possible in terms of the number of -permits. And you should ensure the carbon caps are as comprehensive as possible. McCain meets none of these criteria.""

Mr Obama's plan promises to allocate $15bn (€10bn, $8bn) of the annual revenues from the auctions to investment in alternative energy and to create 5m ""green-collar jobs"" over the next decade. A large part of the remainder of the proceeds would be returned to consumers to help them deal with the transition effect of higher carbon prices.

Mr McCain, in contrast, has yet to develop a clear formula for how to allocate the permits and what to do with the much smaller -proceeds.

The shorter the time -horizon, the larger the differences between the two. Mr McCain, who has been portrayed by Democrats as being increasingly in the ""pocket of big oil companies"", has poured scorn on Mr Obama's alleged reluctance to consider mainstream alternatives to imported oil, such as nuclear power, new coal plants or lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling in the US.

Describing his energy plan as ""all of the above"", Mr McCain has attracted criticism for proposing a temporary waiver on the federal petrol tax at the pump - a move that Mr Obama dismisses as a gimmick. But Mr Obama has gimmicks of his own, in the view of most economists, including his continued support for subsidising corn-based ethanol production.

Both are playing short-term politics with high -petrol prices. But neither has so far wavered from his commitment to impose a cap-and-trade system.

""Setting up a cap-and-trade system is a strong -priority for Senator McCain that he is committed to -pursuing early into his first term,"" said Mr Holtz-Eakin. ""He has been committed for many years to achieving this goal.""

Whichever candidate wins the election, much of corporate America might suddenly find it has a battle on its hands.

""We are completely opposed to setting up a US system of cap-and-trade until you have a treaty that includes China and India,"" says William Kovacs at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington.

""Even then, we don't believe in imposing mandatory targets. We would -continue to lobby against it whoever is putting it -forward."""
"SCIENCE BRIEFING, Friday, August 8, 2008 109 mots, p. 7",,Rainfall alert on global warming,By Clive Cookson,,"Global warming will exacerbate rainfall extremes - both deluges and droughts - more than most climatologists have predicted, according to a study of satellite data and climate models in the journal Science today.

Experts agree that heavy rain will fall more frequently in a warmer world, because higher temperatures increase the amount of energy and water vapour that can be stored in the atmosphere. But computer models underestimate the likely intensification of rainfall, say Richard Allan of Reading university and Brian Soden of Miami.

Floods will become more frequent in wet regions while dry regions will suffer droughts, says Mr Allan. ""Because rainfall worldwide is not expected to change much, the very heavy rainfall events will have to be balanced by other places becoming more dry."""
"COMMENT, Thursday, February 14, 2008 605 mots, p. Page 9",,Pentagon faces a battle on climate change,By PETER OGDEN and JOHN PODESTA,,"In the run-up to the United Nations climate change conference in Bali, businesspeople implored political leaders to take bold steps to combat global warming. They insisted that their ability to undertake effective long-term planning was undermined by uncertainty about the future cost of carbon emissions. Yet their calls for action were ignored.

Perhaps the outcome would have been different if the world's single largest organisation - the Pentagon - had joined the chorus. After all, it also needs to know what kind of environment to prepare for to allocate its vast resources efficiently. Planning for future contingencies is a long-term process, as force structure and weapons systems have to be co-ordinated at least a decade in advance.

The stakes are high. The consequence of the Pentagon's failure to prepare could result not just in lost dollars but also in lost lives.

There are five key areas in which effective military planning can be undermined by uncertainty over when and how the major carbon-emitting countries combat climate change.

First, climate change poses a threat to fragile states that lack the capacity to adapt to environmental shifts. The Pentagon needs to know if the military will be called upon to operate more often in countries that have collapsed or are on the brink of doing so. The risk of a regional conflagration sparked by global warming is particularly severe in east Africa and south Asia. How urgently should the Pentagon begin planning for such contingencies?

Second, the US military needs to know how significantly to expand its capacity to act as a first responder in times of natural disaster. Climate change will increase the frequency of large-scale disasters over the next three decades. But the scope of this threat will vary depending on what action is taken to minimise emissions. Although some of the emergencies created or exacerbated by climate change may be managed by the UN, the US military has an unrivalled capacity to act as a first responder in these situations.

Recall the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck a little more than three years ago: only the US could or would so rapidly have deployed and sustained the 15,000 troops, two dozen ships and 100 aircraft needed for the mission. But if the US military anticipates being called upon more often to respond to such disasters then it needs clarity about how soon it should invest more resources into planning such missions.

Third, the US military will have to conduct traditional missions in increasingly adverse weather conditions. Planners must decide how soon to invest in equipment that worksbetter in storms, floods and other hostile climates.

Fourth, rising sea levels and other climatic factors could threaten the viability of bases on islands or low-lying coastal areas. The US military must know how urgently it needs to plan to protect or, in extreme circumstances, compensate for the loss of bases in strategic areas. The Diego Garcia atoll in the Indian Ocean, which serves as a major hub for US and British missions in the Middle East and is vital to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, may be at risk from climate change.

Moreover, expanding existing bases or creating new ones is often expensive and politically challenging. If the Pentagon had a clear sense of what steps were going to be taken to combat global warming, it might choose to invest more in developing its own offshore ""sea basing"" platforms that do not require host-country consent.

Fifth, the roles of the army and National Guard will need to evolve according to the degree of global warming. National Guard troops are responsible for responding when necessary to domestic natural disasters, but this may not be viable if their deployment overseas leaves the US short of troops and equipment at a time when extreme weather occurs more often at home. The Pentagon might need to begin helping to create a state-level home guard to take over domestic disaster duties from the National Guard.

While these challenges may seem far off, they are not. It is not too soon to begin factoring them into US security calculations. President George W. Bush knows today whether the US will build the national and international frameworks needed to forge a low-carbon future. The business, scientific and political community has failed to coax that information from him. Perhaps if the Pentagon asks, he will answer.

John Podesta is president of the Center for American Progress and was White House chief of staff from 1998 to 2001. Peter Ogden is senior national security analyst at the centre."
"WORLD NEWS, Friday, February 15, 2008 471 mots, p. Page 3",,UK space plan to help combat climate change,By SALAMANDER DAVOUDI,,"Tackling the threat of climate change on earth will be at the heart of Britain's civilian space strategy under plans laid out yesterday by the government.

British scientists are to develop satellites and advanced observation technologies capable of looking back at earth from orbit to monitor deforestation, the melting of ice caps and -violent weather, according to a strategy drawn up by the British National Space Centre, the agency that co-ordinates the country's non-military space activities.

""Global satellite-based monitoring systems underpin our understanding of the health of the planet, alert us to dangers and speed up our responses,"" said the report.

These satellites will help to develop early warning systems for natural disasters such as hurricanes and -tsunamis, as well as monitoring carbon reduction agreements.

Under the plans, which run until 2012, an international space facility will be built west of London to focus on climate change and robotic space exploration.

Hopes for a British astronaut were lifted as officials are to review a decision taken 20 years ago by Margaret Thatcher not to take part in human space missions, which are hugely costly. The review is expected to take between six and 12 months.

Britain is the only G8 member not to have a manned space programme. It spends Pounds 207m (Dollars 408m, Euros 280m) a year on civil space activities, a third of the amount spent by France, which has a manned programme. Almost two-thirds of the UK's money is channelled to the European Space Agency.

China launched a manned mission in 2003 whereas India and Japan have yet to do so. Despite being one of Asia's richest and most technologically advanced countries, Japan's rocket and satellite programmes have been plagued by failures.

Ian Pearson, UK minister for science and innovation, said the international community was on ""the cusp of a wave of new space exploration"" and that it was important to make sure Britain ""did not get left behind"".

The BNSC is to examine the economic, scientific and technological benefits - and costs - of manned missions.

In 2006, the European Space Agency's budget was Euros 2.9bn but many European countries have their own space budgets, which are independently funded. In the US, Nasa's budget last year was Dollars 17.5bn. Russia's space agency is believed to have had a budget of Dollars 800m-Dollars 900m in 2006. Space exploration contributes Pounds 7bn to the British economy. By 2020 the global market for space technology is set to rise from Pounds 62.5bn to Pounds 543bn.

""Space technology is a vital part of our everyday life and satellite communications and space technology provide strong business opportunities for the future,"" Mr Pearson said. ""Applications from space underpin major business -sectors.""

A national programme to develop specialised space technology will be set up offering grants to attract engineering companies. The government hopes to double the number of British companies involved in the space business by 2012. Britain will look at conducting missions outside the European Space Agency by collaborating with Russia and emerging space-faring nations such as China, Brazil and India.

Moon mission

British scientists have proposed sending an unmanned mission to the moon by 2011.

The MoonLITE project is expected to win initial support today from Nasa and the UK government space authority, the British National Space Centre.

The mission would fire four darts into the moon's surface from an orbiting satellite. Data from the darts would be sent to earth via the satellite.

"Thursday, December 17, 2009  Financial Times • London Ed1 • p. 14 • 332 words",,"Leaders must now agree climate deal  Today some 115 heads of government will descend on the Danish capital to try to agree on a global climate deal. They must succeed even if just to set out broad political principles. If there was ever a time for statesmanship, it is surely now. A lack of action would be shameful not just because of the risks climate change brings, but because an agreement could be to everyone's benefit.  Yet a deal is looking less likely by the day. The greatest stumbling block has turned out to be the question of financial assistance. Developing countries have been making increasingly strident calls for money on the table on the basis that they need help to adapt to a low-carbon economy and that they did not cause the problem.  These arguments have merit. But threatening to scupper a climate deal on the question of government-to-government aid is making red lines out of red herrings.  It is politically impossible for rich country governments to write cheques for any significant amount of money with their finances in as parlous a state as they are today especially in the US, which has turned its back on a global climate agreement before. If anything is finally contributed, it will probably be sluiced away from existing aid budgets, diminishing the net increase in transfers. The greater danger is that rich-country  voters and parliaments may reject a global deal altogether.  This is exasperating, since a vastly superior solution is available. If a global system for tradeable carbon emissions permits is agreed, poor countries with low emissions stand to make much more than they can ever hope for in government-to-government aid.  If caps along the lines of current proposals are agreed, the market value of global CO2 emissions could easily top half a trillion dollars yearly in the next decade, perhaps much more as caps tighten and prices rise. As long as poor countries receive generous quotas which they can sell to rich-country companies in this global market, they will draw from a larger pot of money to less political resistance than there is to public financing.  By clamouring for public money instead of quotas in a global market, poor countries are shooting themselves in the foot egged on by China which, even if it cannot expect to receive financing, fancies itself a leader of the poor world.  True global leadership is different. Cap and trade can only work with verifiable, legally binding caps. By not signing up to binding targets, China does a disservice to the countries it affects to lead.",,,
"DECADE OF DISRUPTION: THE NEW WORLD ORDER, Wednesday, December 30, 2009 344 mots, p. 6",,EU in cold as climate deal redefines global relations,,,"By Andrew Ward in Copenhagen

It could go down in history as the moment that defined the new, multipolar world.

At 7pm on the final evening of the Copenhagen climate conference, Barack Obama, the US president, walked into an unscheduled meeting with Wen Jiabao, Chinese premier, and the leaders of India, Brazil and South Africa. ""Mr Premier, are you ready to see me? Are you ready?"" asked Mr Obama.

During the next two hours, the five leaders and their advisers ended two weeks of diplomatic deadlock by thrashing out a tentative deal on global warming that became known as the Copenhagen Accord. Conspicuously absent from the room was the European Union and Japan. America's two main postwar allies were left on the sidelines as Mr Obama cut a deal with China and other emerging economies.

""We've been taught some lessons about the realities of the so-called multipolar world,"" Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister, said. ""These lessons will have to be taken into account when we go for a more comprehensive global agreement.""

Until the US-brokered compromise, the conference had been characterised by stalemate and bickering between rich countries and the big emerging economies, with neither bloc dominant nor united enough to prevail.

Poorer countries, meanwhile, revelled in their role as swing voters between the rival powers.

Writing in the FT, Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, senior director for policy and programmes at the German Marshall Fund in Washington, said the climate conference heralded an ""age of transition"" in international relations. ""Decisive action is inhibited as the power structures of a new world order are only just emerging and thus produce insecurities about where power rests,"" he said. ""Copenhagen was multipolarity as chaos.""

The EU had hoped to use its much-trumpeted pledge to deepen emissions cuts as a bargaining chip to coax the US and China into stronger action.

Instead, Mr Obama brushed aside EU demands and forged a non-binding deal that José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, derided for its ""commitment to the lowest common denominator"".

Some might argue it was a telling indictment of Europe's failure in Copenhagen that, when Mr Barroso announced the EU's grudging backing for the accord on the final night of the conference, some journalists in the front row slept through the whole event.

""Europe is the big loser from Copenhagen,"" wrote Mr Brockhoff. ""Climate has been the one issue where Europe has led the world. In the end, the continent was too weak to succeed when it counted."""
"WORLD NEWS, Friday, October 16, 2009 343 mots, p. 8",,Hopes for deal on climate boosted,By Fiona Harvey in London,,"Developing countries have dropped long-standing demands for access to rich countries' technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions, removing a big obstacle to an international deal on climate change, European officials said yesterday.

Countries such as China and India have pushed for rich countries to grant them free access to lowcarbon technologies ever since the lead-up to the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The demand has been a sticking point in negotiations before this December's climate change summit in Copenhagen with rich countries, arguing that any such move could force private sector companies to give away their intellectual property.

The softening of the developing countries' position comes close to resolving one of the five key elements the United Nations says are necessary for a deal on climate change at Copenhagen this December.

The other elements are: binding targets for mid-term emissions reductions from developed countries; a long-term global emissions target; actions by developing countries to curb their emissions; and financing for developing countries to adapt to the effects of global warming.

One European Union official said the ""language of the discourse"" on technology transfer had changed in recent weeks. Instead of demanding the transfer of intellectual property, developing countries are now willing to discuss collaborating on the development of low-carbon technologies. Such a scenario would see rich world companies encouraged to co-develop new technology with developing country partners.

Officials within the European Commission, the EU's executive body, confirmed there had been ""a broadening"" of the terms of the discussion, with ""more mutuality"" between rich and poor countries. Other non-European officials involved in the talks said there had been agreement on the need for an international plan on technology development, with incentives to encourage private sector investment in developing countries. This could take the form of carbon trading.

In part, the shift reflects the reality of the world economy. The rush of western companies to set up factories building wind turbines and other low-carbon technology has made China one of the biggest exporters of environmental goods.

Ed Miliband, the UK's climate and energy secretary, yesterday praised developing countries such as China and India for instituting domestic measures to curb emissions growth.

But on the biggest sticking point of the negotiations - financial assistance from the rich to the poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with climate change - Mr Miliband said that agreement would not come until the very end of the negotiations"
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, June 1, 2009 622 mots, p. 8",,Mutual funds take their stand on climate change,,,"“The business case for these resolutions is becoming undeniable,” says Robert Berridge, manager of investor programmes at the environmental group Ceres and author of a new report on the subject. “Climate change is now in a financial box, not just a social, environmental box.” The business case for climate change preparation is being strengthened by what is seen as imminent regulation of greenhouse gases under the Obama administration. The US Environmental Protection Agency put a proposal up for public comment in April that considers carbon dioxide dangerous to public health and would regulate it under the Clean Air Act. The move was in stark contrast to the agency’s inaction on this specific issue under President George W. Bush.

A total of 61 mainstream mutual funds voted for climate change-related shareholder proposals an average of 23.6 per cent of the time during the 2008 proxy season – up from 13.6 per cent the previous year, according to the Ceres study. That does not include socially responsible investing funds, which voted for these types of resolutions 100 per cent of the time.

RiskMetrics Group, the largest and most influential proxy advisory firm, has issued more recommendations to its investor clients advising them to vote for climaterelated resolutions in 2008 and 2009 than in years past, according to Mr Berridge. He cites that fact as another reason funds are beginning to shift their support.

The Wells Fargo Advantage Funds amended its proxy voting guidelines on social and environmental resolutions last year. The new policy has the fund voting more in step with RiskMetrics.

The amendments “reflect both our ongoing commitment to social and environmental issues and our confidence in the capabilities of our proxy voting administrator, [RiskMetrics Group]”, a company spokesman says. Of the 11 environmental and social proposals Wells Fargo Advantage Equity Index voted for since 2004, nine of the votes were in 2008, according to ProxyDemocracy.org.

As more funds vote in support of climate resolutions, the proponents of these proposals see mutual funds as the key to getting majority support for their cause.

At Ultra Petroleum Corporation, The Nathan Cummings Foundation has filed a resolution calling for the independent directors of the board to prepare a report on the company’s plans to address climate change for the past four years.

In 2006, 2007 and 2008, the proposal received 22 per cent, 31 per cent and 37 per cent support respectively. A big part of the rise in support has been because of mutual funds.

Last year, Wells Fargo, Van Kampen, Schwab, Parnassus, Morgan Stanley and Fifth Third all voted for the proposal at Ultra Petroleum, according to ProxyDemocracy.

org. The year before, Morgan Stanley voted against the proposal. The company did not return calls for comment.

“It would make sense that mutual fund companies have changed their support,” says Laura Shaffer, director of shareholder activities at Nathan Cummings.

Ultra Petroleum, she says, is a laggard in environmental disclosure compared with other companies in oil and gas industry.

As shareholder activists see funds’ attitude begin to shift, they are experimenting with ways to get backing from funds. Ms Shaffer says Nathan Cummings tried dialogue with one of its managers to get them to vote for their climate proposals. The dialogue has been unsuccessful so far, but she says they plan to reach out to other funds in the hope that they can persuade them.

Meanwhile, proponents of four shareholder proposals up for a vote at ExxonMobil’s annual meeting on May 27 launched a website (www.ExxonMutualFund- Shares.org) that allows mutual fund shareholders to send messages to their fund representatives asking them to vote for the resolutions.

Three of the resolutions were climate change-related and one was a binding proposal asking Exxon to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, partly because of the company’s lack of leadership on preparing for a low-carbon world, according to the filer of the resolution, Robert Monks.

About a week before the annual meeting nearly 500 messages had been sent to mutual funds from their shareholders urging them to support the resolutions at Exxon.

Mr Monks says the group of shareholders that launched the website will see how its success bears out and determine whether it is an effective means of engaging mutual funds in the future.

"Monday, August 24, 2009 262 mots",,Climate activists target London institutions,"By Jim Pickard, Political Correspondent",,"The Bank of England, the Treasury, Heathrow and energy companies including Shell and Eon will be among the targets for up to 3,000 climate activists who will descend on London on Wednesday.

The protesters are set to form their week-long annual ""Climate Camp"" - complete with shops, lavatories and daily events - at an undisclosed location somewhere within the London area.

From there, they intend to carry out protests at a series of targets across the capital.

The full list of 22 locations on the demonstrators' list include the business department, transport department, stock exchange, London City airport, British Sugar, Rio Tinto, Unilever and BAA.

""One of the main aims of the Climate Camp is to take direct action against the root causes of climate change,"" said a spokesman for the movement.

""The City of London represents the epicentre of a failed economic system whose obsession with endless growth makes it impossible for us to move forward and deal with climate change.""

The organisers said they would protest against issues ranging from the expansion of Heathrow airport to plans for new coal-fired power stations.

The Metropolitan police are under pressure ahead of the event after criticism of their handling of G20 protests earlier this year, where one bystander died.

Climate Camp organisers have urged the police to ""stay as far away from it as possible"".

A Met official said police were expecting to have to deal with between 1,000 and 1,500 activists - fewer than half the figure suggested by the event organisers.

He said there was no expectation of disorder from the protesters because most were ""passionate about a cause"".

However, the Met still expects to have 500 officers policing Climate Camp on any given day. It has called in police from elsewhere in the UK because it will also have to provide a strong presence at the Notting Hill Carnival this coming weekend."
"COUNTDOWN TO COPENHAGEN, Saturday, December 5, 2009 275 mots, p. 8",,Global warming a 'hoax',,,"By Anna Fifield in Washington

Interview

Jim Inhofe has one mission for the Copenhagen climate change summit: to be a self-declared ""one-man truth squad"", writes Anna Fifield in Washington.

""I want to make sure that people from around the world understand that there is no way that the United States is going to ratify any kind of treaty that is anything at all like Kyoto,"" the cowboy-boot-wearing senator from Oklahoma told the Financial Times.

""And there is no way in the world that the Kerry-Boxer Bill on the floor of the Senate will even come up for a vote. It's dead, gone,"" said Mr Inhofe, referring to the climate change bill now languishing in the upper chamber.

President Barack Obama has conceded that the Copenhagen summit is not going to result in a binding international treaty. But next week he will state that the US is working towards cutting its carbon emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020.

To counteract that message, Mr Inhofe, ranking Republican on the Senate's environment and public works committee, plans to attend too. ""I think it's important that people who come to an event like that, from countries all around the world, get accurate information as to the standing of different countries,"" he said.

Mr Inhofe, who prides himself on being an arch-sceptic ""long before it was fashionable"", according to his aides, is one of the loudest anti-climate change voices on Capitol Hill. He denounces ""environmental thuggery"", Al Gore and his ""science fiction movie"" An Inconvenient Truth , and labels the whole idea of global warming a ""hoax"".

Mr Inhofe arrived at his position on climate change after the Kyoto protocol, which the US never ratified, was drafted in 1997.

""I thought that man-made gases must cause global warming because everybody says they do,"" he says. Then he saw reports that it would cost the US as much as $330bn (£201bn) a year to live by it. ""So I thought, it's my responsibility to make sure that the science is there. One by one, the scientists started coming in with the truth,"" he says."
"Thursday, December 17, 2009 501 mots",,Hopes for new order from climate chaos,By Clive Cookson,,"Copenhagen has involved the most complex negotiations of any global conference in recent history, so it is perhaps not surprising that the past fortnight has not gone well. But even those who had low advance expectations have been disappointed by the dominance of nakedly political, self-interested horse-trading - and what seems from 950km away a general air of chaos.

Many participants seem to have lost sight of the reason why they are in Copenhagen: to save the world from what the overwhelming majority of climate scientists insist is an impending disaster, caused by human beings pumping more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and oceans.

Although climate sceptics are attending (one of their pranks on Thursday was to hang a ""Propaganda Warrior"" banner from Greenpeace's ship Rainbow Warrior), they form a small minority of the tens of thousands of activists, politicians, bureaucrats and scientists in and around the conference.

A steady stream of new scientific evidence is emerging - and none of it is reassuring. Most importantly, the latest research suggests that the climate is more sensitive to rising levels of man-made carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than scientists had previously feared.

This will make it even harder to limit the global temperature rise to 2°C, a level widely accepted as the maximum compatible with the survival of modern industrial civilisation in something like its present form.

Critics often accuse climatologists of deliberately exaggerating the threat, so as to scare the world into action against climate change. In my recent experience, the opposite is the case. Some experts have privately become so frightened by the outlook over the next few decades that they are toning down their public statements to avoid accusations of alarmism.

A temperature increase of 3°C this century - which many scientists now think is the best achievable in any realistic scenario of decarbonising the global economy - would have catastrophic consequences for the whole world.

Regions that might at first seem to benefit from global warming, such as inland Canada, Russia or northern Europe, could not avoid a threat to their national security. Even if uncontainable nuclear or biological warfare does not break out, it would be hard for any country to withstand the pressure from millions of migrants trying to escape from places made uninhabitable by climate change.

The world's response to such a grave threat should not be to give up in despair - nor to leap to embrace extremely risky geo-engineering projects - but to wean itself off fossil fuels as quickly as possible, starting on Friday with the concluding discussions in Copenhagen.

Given what has happened so far at the conference, the best we can hope for is a firm declaration signed by the world's leaders, which will lead to a globally binding treaty next year.

That means avoiding at all costs an acrimonious last-minute collapse that would destroy any chance of building in 2010 on what has been achieved this year. Because there are a lot of positives.

While the US has been hamstrung by the reluctance of many members of Congress to pass climate change legislation, the Obama administration has engaged far more constructively than its predecessor with the rest of the world - for example over building up a $100bn-a-year fund (€69bn, £61bn) to help the developing world mitigate and adapt to climate change.

Copenhagen has seen significant advances towards finding ways to spread new, low-carbon technology round the world and to protect forests, whose loss is responsible for an estimated 10-20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Such achievements will be important ingredients in reaching an overarching agreement. So let us hope the leaders will surprise the world and bring order from the chaos generated by their subordinates."
"Monday, December 21, 2009 466 mots",,UN agrees to reform climate process,"By Fiona Harvey in London, Joshua Chaffin in Brussels and Harvey Morris in Washington",,"The United Nations bowed to intensifying pressure on Monday to start sweeping reforms of its processes for reaching agreement on climate change.

Developed and developing countries have condemned the bureaucratic and unwieldy process of reaching unanimous agreement from 192 countries, which many blamed for the chaotic end of the Copenhagen climate change conference at the weekend.

Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, acknowledged the problems and promised: ""We will consider how to streamline the negotiations process. We will also look at how to encompass the full context of climate change and development in the negotiations, both substantively and institutionally. Early next year, I will establish a high-level panel on development and climate change to strategically address such issues.""

Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, led the calls for reform on Monday, saying: ""What happened at Copenhagen was a flawed decision-making process.""

He attacked, without naming, the small group of countries that prevented the formal adoption of the accord. The group is known to include Venezuela, Bolivia and Sudan.

Ed Miliband, the British climate secretary, also blamed China on Monday for the outcome, as China had vetoed two important commitments that other countries wanted left in.

In Brussels, policymakers echoed the same complaints about the UN procedures and pledged to do more work at regional and bilateral levels in order to minimise future diplomatic choke points. Privately, many countries and even some UN insiders were also saying drastic reform of the UN process was the only way to ensure success in turning the accord reached in Copenhagen into a legally binding treaty.

The diplomatic effort on climate change is now focusing on this and on the crucial task in the next month of attempting to persuade countries to increase the level of the emissions cuts they have agreed. Targets on the cuts were left out of the Copenhagen accord, but must be submitted by January 31, 2010.

Many countries, including China and other emerging economies, have publicly agreed to a possible range of emissions reductions, and negotiators are now trying to persuade them to go to the top of the ranges.

Critics of the European Union also said on Monday that the chaotic final scenes of the talks laid bare the bloc's limited clout on the world stage, as leading developing countries claimed to have struck a deal with the US at a meeting to which the EU was not invited. ""This was a climate Waterloo for the EU,"" said Axel Eggert, a climate specialist at Eurofer, a European steel industry trade group. ""There was the motivation to be the clear driver in the negotiations, but they were more or less kicked out at the end.""

For much of the past year the EU has touted itself as the global leader in the fight against climate change. It was the first bloc to pass binding legislation to reduce its emissions and the first to pledge aid to developing nations to help them cope with the effects of rising temperatures.

The other remaining question is how the EU and the US deal with a more assertive China. They need China to give its backing to a legally binding treaty, which China is resisting. But as China has repudiated the idea of accepting financial assistance, diplomats have few levers with which to try to manoeuvre China into agreement.

One of those few, being talked about in Europe on Monday, is the idea of putting carbon-related import taxes on goods from countries left out of a legally binding treaty.

"Wednesday, March 18, 2009 733 mots",,The five fighters of climate change,"Ed Crooks, energy editor",,"From a solar-powered cardboard cooker for Africa to a giant industrial microwave that locks underground carbon sucked from the atmosphere by vegetation, innovation and ingenuity still offer hope that it is not too late to tackle climate change.

That at least is the encouragement offered by the five varied finalists in the FT Climate Change Challenge.

The competition, organised by Forum for the Future, the not-for-profit sustainable development group, and backed by Hewlett-Packard, the information technology company, aims is to raise the profile of innovations that can be both commercially successful and bring about material reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Financial Times readers, having been invited to nominate entries over the past few months, now have the chance to vote online for the winner, who will receive a prize of $75,000.

The credit crunch and economic downturn have undoubtedly dealt a blow to investment in environmental technologies such as renewable energy, with smaller companies often the hardest hit. At the same time, however, ""green stimulus"" plans in the US, the European Union and elsewhere point to a political resolve to tackling climate change. The downturn, many now say, offers opportunities to restructure economies and put them on a path to lower carbon dioxide emissions.

As Peter Madden, chief executive of Forum for the Future, puts it: ""It is clearly more difficult to raise money now, but a lot of the ideas we have been looking at are going to save money as well as greenhouse gas emissions.

""There are things we can do that will both help us get through the recession and change industry structures to put in place the low-carbon economy that we need to create if we are to avert the threat of climate change.""

Against that background, the outlook for our five finalists is challenging, certainly, but not discouraging. Nearly 300 entries were submitted. A few were grandiose, large-scale projects, but the majority were highly practical ideas that have realistic hopes of being converted into successful commercial applications relatively quickly.

Alas, many highly promising ideas did not make the final shortlist: among them, a proposal to use mobile telephone texts to arrange shared taxi rides in London, and an idea for solar-powered internet centres for Africa.

The five chosen were the ones that seemed to offer the greatest potential for growth in the eyes of the panel of judges: entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson; Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change; Mark Hurd, chairman and chief executive of HP; Sir Terry Leahy, chief executive of Tesco; Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; Leon Sandler, executive director of the Deshpande Center for technological innovation at MIT; Jonathon Porritt, founder of Forum for the Future; and Lionel Barber, editor of the FT.

The finalists are:

Carbonscape

A New Zealand company that has developed a machine to turn biomass such as agricultural waste into carbon-rich material, locking up the carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. The material, known as biochar, could also be used as fertiliser or fuel.

Mr Barber commented: ""Carbonscape has the potential to be an efficient and effective solution to the problem of rising greenhouse gas levels. Its feasibility has been proven and it could have a truly global impact.""

ADEF

A US company founded by a former truck salesman, which has a $50 wheel cover for heavy trucks called the Deflektor. It is estimated to reduce fuel consumption by 2 per cent, giving a very quick return on the investment.

Sir Richard commented: ""I cannot see a world without trucks. This simple idea could make a huge difference.""

Kyoto Energy

A Kenyan company selling $5 solar cookers made of cardboard and acrylic. The cookers, which have recently gone into production in Nairobi, fight both deforestation in Africa and the health problems caused by cooking on wood fires.

Sir Terry said: ""As well as reducing carbon emissions and deforestation, this cheap and simple idea could save people in developing countries time and money.""

Neem Biotech

A British company producing a feed additive called Mootral, to be fed to cows and sheep to reduce their flatulence. Farm animals make a significant contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and are attracting increasing interest from policymakers.

Sir Terry praised ""a novel idea with the potential to have a real impact inreducing carbon emissions from the food chain"". Sir Richard was also impressed: ""Can they stop cows farting and save the planet?""

Loughborough University

British academics have designed ceiling tiles that can cool rooms, to be used alongside or instead of conventional air-conditioning systems.

Air conditioning accounts for a significant proportion of electricity use, particularly in the US, and is growing rapidly in the developing world: reducing its demand for power could make a real difference to energy consumption.

Ms Claussen said: ""This design will be well received by investors in the heating and ventilation industry.""

On FT.com, you can read more about the companies and the competition, and vote for your favourite idea. While the contest organisers hope all five entries will prosper, the key criteria is to identify the idea that most deserves to grow, but needs the extra push that the publicity of winning would give it - the one, perhaps, you would choose to invest your own money in. Voting closes on April 1 and the results will be announced in the FT on April 3."
"Sunday, May 3, 2009 563 mots",,Business of climate change,By Andrew Bolger,,"The head of Edinburgh University Business School is intrigued by a fundamental question: why do business school academics not spin out more businesses?

Nick Oliver raises the issue as Edinburgh reveals it has secured significant investment from Haymarket Media Group to support its ambition to become a leading centre for studying the business implications of climate change.

Haymarket, which publishes ENDS Report, the environmental business publication, is backing an Edinburgh academic in launching ENDS Carbon, which aims to provide companies with the information they need to reduce their carbon emissions.

The venture will give organisations detailed reports, benchmarking their performance against their peer group. The first report - to be published this month - will evaluate the climate-change performance of the UK supermarket sector and is backed by Tesco, Asda, Marks and Spencer and Waitrose.

""Lots of companies have calculated their carbon footprint, but they don't know whether it's big or small compared to their competitors,"" says Craig Mackenzie (pictured above), the Edinburgh Business School academic who will be director of ENDS Carbon.

Figures such as total carbon emissions, he says, do not mean much unless they are related to the size of a company and the nature of its operations.

""We will use like-for-like measurements - such as how much energy is used for each metre of refrigeration, which is by far the largest source of supermarkets' carbon emissions.""

Prof Oliver (pictured left), who joined Edinburgh two years ago from Judge Business School in Cambridge, sees the focus on climate change as a key element in a strategy of developing specialisations to raise the profile and status of the business school.

Although Edinburgh University has been teaching business since 1916, there was a general recognition across the university and wider Scottish business circles that the school had not matched the international reputation of its host institution - or succeeded in tapping into the outstanding science base on its doorstep.

In 2007 when the school decided to make climate change an area of specialisation, it worked closely with the university's internationally recognised school of geoscience. Last year Edinburgh launched an MSc in climate change and it is also developing an MSc in carbon finance, which will examine international schemes for trading emissions.

Given that options in business climate change are also offered in MBA and undergraduate courses, Prof Oliver estimates the school could have 300 students a year studying the subject.

""The idea is to send out a new cadre of people, primarily into the business world, which could mean the public as well as the private sector, who are well equipped in an understanding of the science of climate change.

""Lots of companies, faced by the prospect of regulatory pressure, are appointing or hiring carbon co-ordinators, so we see our people as being well equipped to take on those kinds of roles.""

Although Mr Mackenzie started life as an academic, he has spent more than 10 years running the socially responsible investment research teams at Insight Investment, the asset manager now part of Lloyds Banking Group and Friends Provident, the life assurance group.

He believes his background helped him to land the deal with Haymarket.

""I'm not sure conventional academics have the skills for becoming entrepreneurs. Preparing articles and teaching undergraduates does not necessarily equip you to write a business plan or market your idea to investors.""

Prof Oliver identifies a number of factors behind the scarcity of spin-outs by staff. One is that much of what academics can do commercially - such as consulting or executive education - is regarded as the core business of their department.

That said, he believes there is a ""grey economy"" around most business schools and the issue of private work.

""My own view is that those academics who want to do a bit of private work are usually able to do it and get enough to meet their needs without the hassle of creating a company. So the grey economy mops up the vast majority of the entrepreneurial drive.""

He would like to see more spin-outs from schools.

""The business of building a business from nothing, creating revenue streams, employing people, debating what is really of value to the people that will pay for it - all these are hugely valuable."""
"Thursday, June 18, 2009 341 mots",,Benn warns on climate challenge,"By Clive Cookson, Science Editor",,"Britain faces a century of sweltering summers, with more extremes of both flooding and drought, according to the latest assessment of the impact of global warming on the UK climate. Sea level is likely to rise by 36cm by 2080 - with an outside chance of a 1-metre rise.

""The real message of these projections is that we have got to respond, we've got to act,"" Hilary Benn, environment secretary, said yesterday. ""Climate change is the greatest challenge that we face as a world.""

The study, carried out by the Meteorological Office, is a much more elaborate and detailed reworking of the UK Climate Impact Projections originally published in 2002. It uses the latest scientific models to produce what the Met Office calls ""the most comprehensive set of probabilistic climate projections at the regional scale compiled anywhere in the world"".

The conclusions are broadly consistent with those reached seven years ago, though the projected temperature changes are more alarming and the rainfall changes less so. While southern England is likely to have 20 per cent less summer rainfall in the 2080s than today, the risk of a severe decline leading to desert-like conditions is less than previously estimated.

But average summer temperatures are projected to rise by 1.6ºC during the 2020s and about 4ºC in the 2080s. The build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that has already taken place through human activities means that summers will be at least 2ºC hotter in the 2040s, whatever international agreements are reached to cut future emissions.

""We now know that some further climate change over the next two to three decades is already unavoidable,"" said John Beddington, the government chief scientist. ""But what the projections also show is that strong mitigation action now can start to make a real difference by 2050 and lead to very different climate outcomes by the 2080s.""

In a business-as-usual high-emissions scenario, peak summer temperatures in the south-east could be 12ºC above today's, with summer highs in London regularly exceeding 40ºC. That is 2ºC above the record UK temperature, recorded in Gravesend during the heatwave of August 2003.

Winter rainfall is projected to rise by 10-20 per cent over most of the country by the 2080s. And the number of intense rainstorms will increase throughout the year, leading to a greater risk of flooding.

The report drew strong support from all sides of the political spectrum and from environmental campaigners. ""This extremely valuable report is an important wake-up call on the need for urgent action to slash emissions,"" said Andy Atkins, executive director of Friends of the Earth."
"Thursday, August 13, 2009 431 mots",,Climate change report urges cut in costs,By Kate Mackenzie in London,,"Avoiding a global temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists regard as the safe limit, will be prohibitively expensive, while a far less ambitious target would produce a more cost-efficient result for the world economy, according to a new study.

The report, published Friday by the Copenhagen Consensus , a group of economists brought together by a Danish academic, Bjorn Lomborg, is at odds with the prevailing view that large sums should be spent over the next decade to ward off climate change.

Mr Lomborg, long known as a climate change sceptic, told the Financial Times last week he now believed questions over the science ""have been answered pretty unequivocally"" and that an agreement at the next UN climate change meeting in Copenhagen in December would be crucial.

However, he believes the measures being considered are unnecessarily costly.

The report, by Richard Tol, an environmental economist, says a less ambitious plan would fare better on a cost-benefit basis than a big, early investment. ""Coming up with over-ambitious targets is not credible,"" says Mr Tol. ""It signals that it's just a gimmick to win voters, that it's not for real.""

The cost of stabilising atmospheric carbon dioxide at 450 parts per million - the level thought necessary to avoid the worst effects of climate change - would be 12.9 per cent of global gross domestic product, Mr Tol says. That would require a tax of $68 per tonne of CO2 worldwide, from 2010.

However, that scenario would cost $50 over the course of the century for every dollar saved, Mr Tol argues. By contrast, a much lower worldwide CO2 tax of 50 cents per tonne would cost only 66 cents for every dollar saved, but under this scenario concentration would stabilise at 850ppm - a level scientists say would have catastrophic effects on climate.

Dimitri Zenghelis, who contributed to the UK's influential 2006 Stern Review on the costs of climate change, agreed that keeping CO2 concentrations at 450ppm without overshooting could be expensive. But he said a target any higher than 500ppm would be dangerous.

""Tol downweighs future impacts and overstates the lack of affordable options to bring emissions down,"" said Mr Zenghelis. ""Using his assumptions he would also recommend not committing any noticeable investment to counter a known meteor heading for earth, or a devastating global pandemic due in 50 or 100 years, because it is not our current concern.""

Mr Tol's report excluded the uncertainty of the effects of climate change, which economists such as Mr Zenghelis argue is one of the most important reasons to invest heavily immediately.

Early emissions cuts would be cheaper or even have a negative cost, Mr Zenghelis said, and would be easier than removing carbon-intensive infrastructure later, or removing carbon from the air.

However Mr Tol's scenarios assume that spending is perfectly optimised, which he says is far from reality and therefore strengthens the argument for more cautious investment.

The paper is published on Friday with accompanying reports saying that curbing greenhouse emissions such as methane and soot would be much more cost-effective than focusing exclusively on carbon dioxide.

""We're not saying this is the best solution - we're just coming out with a lot of different options,"" he said of Mr Tol's scenarios."
"Friday, December 18, 2009 580 mots",,Obama warns 'climate deal in the balance',By Ed Crooks and Fiona Harvey in Copenhagen,,"US president Barack Obama warned on Friday that a global agreement to fight the threat of climate change was ""in the balance"" at the United Nations talks in Copenhagen.

Speaking to about 120 world leaders gathered to agree a deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, he warned that the negotiations were running out of time, and urged them to be part of a ""historic decision"" to agree a deal, even if they were not happy with every aspect.

""As the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt. It hangs in the balance,"" he said.

""We are running short of time, and at this point the question is whether we will move forward or split apart; whether we prefer posturing to action""

Mr Obama's speech was made in a plenary meetingUnited Nations climate talks of about 120 heads of state and government. The meeting was delayed by almost two hours, as a group of about 20 leaders and their representatives, including Mr Obama but not Wen Jiabao, China's premier, met to try to thrash out a deal.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said the world was closer than ever to a first global deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but ""only hours remain to close these final gaps"".

The turbulent negotiations on Friday morning delayed what could be a decisive meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Wen.

Addressing the gathering of leaders, Mr Wen said he was ""deeply aware of the heavy responsibility"" he faced, and promised that China would ""continue to make unremitting efforts"" to fight climate change.

However, developed and developing countries still seemed some way from a deal on Friday, with bargaining continuing over both a political agreement that could be issued from the meeting and the details of any formal decisions from the UN process.

Achim Steiner, the executive secretary at the UN Environment Programme, said: ""The talks are in crisis.""

Mr Wen took a tough line in his speech, insisting that any agreement should be based on established UN processes, not new streamlined proposals put forward by developed countries.

Leaders and ministers from many of the largest countries met until 1am on Friday and then reconvened later in the morning to discuss the outlines of the possible political agreement.

Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the prime minister of Denmark who is the president of the talks, said the discussions had been ""very fruitful"".

However, Jairam Ramesh, India's finance minister, said no agreement had been reached.

Officials from leading developed countries said all the elements of a deal were on the table but countries were still wasting time discussing technical details rather than the substantive issues.

There is a consensus on setting a goal that the global temperature should rise by no more than 2ºC, a decision already adopted by big economies, including China and India,in the summer.

Developed countries are also close to agreeing an offer of funding for poor countries worth $100bn a year by 2020, from both government and private sector finance, after Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, backed the plan on Thursday morning.

However, there is still haggling over scale of the emissions curbs that leading economies should make, with some countries pressing for deeper reductions and others resisting.

The bilateral meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Wen will bring together the world's two largest emitters of carbon dioxide, between them responsible for about 40 per cent of global emissions.

The positions of the two countries have become closer in recent days, thanks to the US backing for the funding plan, and a Chinese offer to be ""transparent"" about the actions it is taking to curb its emissions, even though it has not given full details of the form that transparency would take. China continues to insist it will not accept any international scrutiny that violates its national sovereignty.

If Mr Obama and Mr Wen can reach agreement, China should be able to swing many of its allies in the developing world behind a deal.

Such a deal, if converted into a treaty next year, would be the first to bind all countries to take action on climate change.

The 1997 Kyoto protocol was never ratified by the US, and made no demands on developing countries, notably China."
"Wednesday, March 4, 2009 240 mots",,"Climate is rights issue, says Maldives minister",By Frances Williams in Geneva,,"Ahmed Shaheed, foreign minister of the Maldives, is calling on the world to make global warming a human rights issue and prevent his homeland from disappearing beneath the waves by the end of the century.

""If nothing is done, it is the nightmare - no Maldives. But if there are no Maldives there may be no Bangladesh, no Pakistan, no others. So we are optimistic about the possibility of change. Saving the Maldives is about saving the world as well.""

While destruction wrought by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 was the most dramatic signal of the dangers of global warming, the 1,000-island archipelago is already suffering other damaging effects from coastal erosion, growing water salinity, encroachment of tropical diseases such as malaria, and loss of coralian ecosystems that support the country's fishing industry.

And shortly after winning the country's first truly democratic elections last October, Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to create a sovereign wealth fund financed from tourism, the main industry, that could be used to buy a new homeland in India, Sri Lanka or even Australia for the 300,000 inhabitants of the Indian Ocean paradise.

Kiribati in the Pacific, another cluster of tiny tropical islands in even more imminent danger of submergence, has already asked Australia and New Zealand to accept its citizens as permanent refugees.

But Mr Shaheed said the Maldives government would do its utmost to avoid such a fate, with adaptation measures at home and a vigorous lobbying effort for strong international action to limit global warming.

Part of that lobbying effort was a push to have climate change treated as a human rights issue. ""There's a tendency to think in economic terms and we need to shift the focus to the moral case for tackling global warming,"" Mr Shaheed said."
"Friday, December 18, 2009 700 mots",,Obama warns climate deal in the balance,By Ed Crooks and Fiona Harvey in Copenhagen,,"US president Barack Obama warned on Friday that a global agreement to fight the threat of climate change was ""in the balance"" at the United Nations talks in Copenhagen.

Speaking to about 120 world leaders gathered to agree a deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, he warned that the negotiations were running out of time, and urged them to be part of a ""historic decision"" to agree a deal, even if they were not happy with every aspect.

""As the world watches us today, I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt. It hangs in the balance,"" he said.

""We are running short of time, and at this point the question is whether we will move forward or split apart; whether we prefer posturing to action""

Mr Obama also reiterated the need for developing countries, and particularly China, to allow international monitoring of their emissions reductions.

""We must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments, and to exchange this information in a transparent manner,"" he said. ""These measures need not be intrusive, or infringe upon sovereignty. They must, however, ensure that an accord is credible, and that we are living up to our obligations. For without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on a page.""

Beijing has thus far resisted attempts by industrialised nations to allow foreign verification inspections of their emissions reductions.

Earlier, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president, suggested that the leaders should not sign a bad agreement.

""I don't know if an angel or wise man can come down and provide us with the intelligence we have lacked until now,"" he said. ""Since I believe in God, I believe in miracles, and miracles can happen.""

The leaders' meeting was delayed by almost two hours as a group of about 20 leaders and their representatives, including Mr Obama but not Wen Jiabao, China's premier, met to try to thrash out a deal.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said the world was closer than ever to a first global deal to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but ""only hours remain to close these final gaps"".

The turbulent negotiations on Friday morning delayed what could be a decisive meeting between Mr Obama and Mr Wen.

Addressing the gathering of leaders, Mr Wen said he was ""deeply aware of the heavy responsibility"" he faced, and promised that China would ""continue to make unremitting efforts"" to fight climate change.

Andy Atkins, Executive Director of Friends of the Earth, said: ""The President is right that the endeavours in Copenhagen will go down in history - but unless we see a massive shift in the US position, it will be for all the wrong reasons.

""If the President's idea of action is to cut US emissions by 4 per cent on 1990 levels then we're heading for climate catastrophe.""

Jeremy Leggett, Executive Chairman, Solarcentury, said: ""We needed him to seize his moment and show us the political will of Churchill, taking the summit to a new place, shaming the pessimists and foot draggers into silence, assuming greatness as a global leader forever.

""Instead he gave us a dose of Chamberlain. He wants to wave a piece of paper that will not get us on course for keeping the carbon enemy caged."""
"Tuesday, December 22, 2009 362 mots",,EU reflects on climate 'disaster',By Joshua Chaffinin Brussels,,"Europe's environment ministers added to the chorus of gloom over the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit as they confronted the broader question of how the bloc could gain influence over a negotiation dominated by China and the US.

Andreas Carlgren, environment minister of Sweden, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, called the Copenhagen accord ""a disaster"" and ""a great failure"" as Tuesday's EU meeting began.

""It was obvious that ministers broadly expressed their disappointment with the results of Copenhagen, which didn't at all meet the expectations or ambitions of the European Union,"" Mr Carlgren added after lunch with counterparts from the EU's 27 member states.

One immediate target of criticism was the unwieldy United Nations negotiating process, which several nations blamed for Copenhagen's failure. EU states have asked the European Commission to draw up recommendations to streamline the process, and to limit obstructionist tactics. They are expected to discuss them at a meeting in Seville on January 15-17.

Mr Carlgren reiterated the EU's commitment to reaching an ambitious, legally binding agreement. The pressure, he said, was now on the US after the public pleas made in Copenhagen by Barack Obama, the US president.

But members were grasping for answers on how to proceed after Copenhagen revealed a gap between the EU's ambitions to lead the fight against global warming and its limited clout on the world stage. The EU had believed its stature as the first bloc to pass binding emissions reductions targets and its leadership on climate finance for developing countries would give it a prime seat at the table. Yet it was not even invited to a final meeting at which leading developed countries struck the decisive deal with the US.

""We've been taught some lessons about the realities of the so-called multi-polar world,"" Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister, told the Financial Times. ""These lessons will have to be taken into account when we go for a more comprehensive global agreement.""

Diplomats acknowledged that the EU's strategy of offering to deepen its emissions cuts - from 20 per cent below 1990 levels to 30 per cent - if other nations showed comparable effort had failed to provide leverage over the US or China.

In the wake of Copenhagen, the 30 per cent pledge has faced renewed attacks from European business, which fears being left at a competitive disadvantage.

Mr Carlgren said he expected rising calls for the EU to adopt a tougher line by threatening to impose carbon border taxes against countries unwilling to sign up to an ambitious agreement. But he warned that such a move risked greater ""fragmentation"" of the global community, while Germany and others opposed it as it would hurt exporters.

""This is a time for reflection,"" Mr Carlgren said."
"Monday, April 27, 2009 469 mots",,ADB warns of Asian climate change disaster,By John Aglionby in Jakarta,,"The economic impact of climate change on four of south-east Asia's biggest nations will be 2.5 times more severe than the global average by 2100 if carbon emissions continue at their current level, the Asian Development Bank is warning in a new study.

Annual losses incurred by Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are predicted to be $230bn, or 6.68 per cent of their combined economic output, according to the regional development bank. This compares with a global mean prediction of 2.6 per cent.

The four countries are likely to be hit so hard because they have long coastlines, largely agrarian economies and are experiencing rampant deforestation. They will thus be more at risk from rising sea levels, higher temperatures, falling agricultural yields and more frequent extreme weather events.

Juzhong Zhuang, the ADB's assistant chief economist, said such a disastrous scenario can be averted if Asian countries start acting now and in concert to adapting to the impacts of climate change and transitioning into low-carbon economies.

""But if a specific country wants to pro-actively adapt to climate change it can't be done alone,"" he said. ""They need regional level activity and it is needed now. If the action is delayed then south-east Asia will suffer much more than most other regions of the world.""

Mr Zhuang said the ADB conducted the study, the first of its kind for Asia, to raise awareness about the need for action now. ""What's needed is better government policy, better coordination between agencies and between central and local government, and better research by all countries.

The annual economic losses are broken down into market losses, such as lower crop yields, non-market losses such as increased healthcare costs and community relocation, and risk of catastrophe due to more frequent severe weather events.

By 2100 these will be, respectively, $70bn, $120bn and $34bn. They were calculated using similar techniques as the influential 2006 Stern Review commissioned by the British government.

One example of the economic losses would be as a result of changing water flow patterns in the Mekong River. The study quotes research that estimates in the river basin the maximum monthly flow could increase by 41 per cent and the minimum monthly flow fall by 24 per cent. This would result in increased flooding in the wet season and greater likelihood of water shortages in the dry season.

Land use change, and particularly deforestation, currently accounts for 75 per cent of south-east Asia's emissions. Experts say that these should be relatively easy to reduce if there is sufficient political will.

Fitrian Ardiansyah, a Jakarta-based climate change specialist with World Wildlife Fund warned that at the governments' current rate of progress the worst-case scenario cannot be ruled out. ""I believe the governments do understand what climate change is but that's different to knowing what to do about it, let alone actually doing it,"" he said. ""They need to mainstream both adaptation and mitigation into their regular development plans.""

Disseminating the need for action and what should be done to regional administrations is also proving difficult. ""The speed of the process is not as fast as the speed of the impacts of climate change on the people,"" Mr Fitrian said.

The ADB is highlighting places like the Philippine province of Albay as an example of best-case practice. It is pioneering a prototype for local climate change adaptation that aims to embed disaster risk reduction into all policies and to enforce climate-proofing and disaster-proofing practices."
"Friday, October 30, 2009 466 mots",,EU proposes climate change funding deal,By Tony Barber in Brussels,,"The European Union proposed on Friday that rich countries should transfer up to €50bn a year by 2020 to help developing countries fight climate change, but stopped short of stating how much the EU was willing to contribute.

Leaders of the 27-nation bloc agreed that the EU's less well-off member-states in central and eastern Europe should pay less than rich countries in western Europe, but did not reach a deal on how to split the costs.

Speaking after a two-day summit in Brussels, where climate change funding proved the most contentious issue, EU leaders put a brave face on an outcome that failed to set out a detailed European negotiating position for December's global climate change conference in Copenhagen.

""We can now look the rest of the world in the eye and say, 'We Europeans have done our job. We're ready for Copenhagen,'"" said José Manuel Barroso, European Commission president.

However, he acknowledged that the question of central and eastern European financial contributions to an international fund for developing countries remained open. ""This matter has to be decided fully after a successful outcome at Copenhagen,"" Mr Barroso told reporters.

Nine countries, led by Poland, dug their heels in at the summit, demanding that the western Europeans lighten the financial burden on the EU's former communist states.

""We don't want a situation where Romania or Bulgaria is going to pay Brazil to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions, because it's absurd,"" said Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, Poland's EU affairs minister.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

Fredrik Reinfeldt, prime minister of Sweden, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said he and his fellow leaders had agreed that developing countries would need an annual €100bn by 2020 to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

Developing countries themselves and an expanded world carbon market would provide at least half this amount, but rich nations ought to provide €22bn-€50bn in ""international public support"", the EU leaders agreed. They said the EU was willing to provide ""its fair share"", but did not name a precise sum.

They also agreed that the developing world would need €5bn-€7bn a year from 2010 to 2012 in so-called ""fast-start"" financing, Mr Reinfeldt said. In a victory for the central and eastern European countries, the leaders agreed that EU governments would be free to contribute to the fast-start funds on a voluntary basis.

Reflecting arguments presented at the summit by Angela Merkel, Germany's chancellor, Mr Reinfeldt and Mr Barroso emphasised that the EU offer of financial help was conditional upon similar gestures from the US and other rich countries such as Japan, Australia and Canada.

""Our offers are not a blank cheque,"" Mr Barroso said.

He predicted that climate change financing would figure prominently in discussions that the EU leadership will hold in Washington on Tuesday with Barack Obama, the US president, and in New Delhi on Friday with Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister.

All the financial aid figures endorsed by EU leaders at the summit came from a Commission proposal first made public in September.

Some governments wanted the EU to suggest a more precise figure for international aid to developing countries than €22bn-€50bn, arguing that such a huge range made the proposal unconvincing.

However, the insistence of Poland and its allies that the EU should first establish the financial obligations of each member-state prevented an agreement."
"Friday, April 10, 2009 639 mots",,Ice loss sparks new climate change fears,By Fiona Harvey in Bonn,,"Evidence of ice loss from both poles this week has sparked fresh fears that global warming is progressing faster than scientists had predicted.

Arctic ice has thinned dramatically, as well as shrinking in area, according to US research. Thin seasonal ice, which melts and refreezes each year, now makes up about 70 per cent of the Arctic winter ice, up from about 40 to 50 per cent in the 1980s and 1990s, leaving far less of the older, thicker ice that is harder to melt.

In the Antarctic, an ice bridge connecting an island to the Wilkins ice shelf - a sheet of ice about the size of Northern Ireland - shattered as scientists monitored it through satellite observations.

""What we're seeing is very dramatic,"" said Andrew Fleming, remote sensing manager at the British Antarctic Survey. ""It's very worrying.""

Scientists believed the effects were linked to the ""very strong warming"" at the poles, he said. The Antarctic peninsula has warmed by more than 3ºC in the past 50 years. ""That's a staggering rate of warming, and it's still going up,"" said Mr Fleming.

Ice shelves take centuries to form, but when they start to break up it can be sudden. The bridge at the Wilkins ice shelf was a 40km strand of ice, at its narrowest point a few hundred metres wide, connecting the shelf to Charcot and Latady islands.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

Last year, scientists from the BAS landed on it in an aircraft to examine the ice. They had known for some time it was under strain, but it remained intact until at the end of last week satellite images showed new cracks appearing.

The next day, the ice sheet had ""exploded from the centre outwards"", said Mr Fleming, who was monitoring the break-up through satellite images from the European Space Agency.

""It was very fast, very dramatic,"" he said. ""It's now completely shattered.""

The break-up of the ice bridge alarms scientists because it could accelerate the break-up of the rest of the Wilkins shelf. This was at least the 10th shelf to start disintegrating quickly in recent years, said Mr Fleming, and several more were in danger.

Rapid melting of polar sea ice is of particular concern for two reasons: disappearing ice leaves areas of open sea that are dark, and - unlike the reflective ice - absorb the sun's heat, accelerating the warming process; the break-up of ice shelves exposes glaciers that then begin to move faster to the sea.

The Arctic and some of the Antarctic float on the sea. Ice takes up more space than water, and when this floating ice melts, it does not directly raise sea levels, in the same way that the melting of ice cubes in a full glass of water would not cause the glass to overflow.

However, the glaciers of the Antarctic peninsula are on land, so when they tumble into the sea, they contribute directly to rising sea levels. In the north, the Greenland ice sheet is also on land, and its glaciers are flowing faster to the sea.

If Greenland's ice sheet melted, it would raise sea levels by seven metres, and if both the east and west Antarctic ice sheets went, the figure would be 10 times higher. That would take hundreds of years, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Long before the land ice disappeared, however, sea levels would rise significantly - a 1 per cent loss of the Antarctic land ice would probably raise levels by 65cm, estimates the Norwegian Polar Institute.

Two conferences this week were addressing the problems of the poles and climate change. At a joint meeting of the Antarctic Treaty and the Arctic Council in the US, Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, said the news of the Wilkins ice shelf showed ""global warming has already had enormous effects on our planet, and we have no time to lose in tackling this crisis"".

In Bonn, governments met for the first meeting to thrash out the details of a successor to the Kyoto protocol on climate change.

One factor that could help to slow the melting of the Arctic, but which has not yet received serious consideration internationally, would be to cut the amount of ""black carbon"" - soot - that we spew into the air. Black carbon darkens ice when it falls, causing it to absorb more heat, and may be responsible for half of the warming effect in the Arctic, according to research. Cutting soot would not only remove large amounts of air pollution, but, say some scientists, could be quicker and easier than cutting carbon dioxide emissions."
"uesday, December 1, 2009 498 mots",,Australia opposition picks climate sceptic as new chief,By Peter Smith in Sydney,,"Australia's main opposition Liberal party appointed a climate change sceptic as its leader on Tuesday in a move that all but kills plans by Kevin Rudd, primer minister, to have an emissions trading scheme passed into law ahead of the Copenhagen climate change summit.

Tony Abbott ousted Malcolm Turnbull to become Australia's fourth leader of the Liberal party in just over two years but only after securing 42 votes against Mr Turnbull's 41.

Mr Abbott, who earlier this year said the argument for climate change ""is absolute crap"", used his first press conference to take on Mr Rudd's Labor government over the proposed ETS.

A final vote on the ETS has been held up for days in the Senate, Australia's upper house, where the government needs the support of at least seven non-Labor senators to have its legislation passed.

Mr Turnbull last week said the Liberal party backed amended legislation after the government agreed to more than A$7bn (US$6.4bn) of additional compensation payments to polluting industries and excluded the agricultural sector from the scheme.

However, Mr Turnbull's move back-fired as hard-line climate change sceptics within the Liberal party sought to force him from office over the issue.

Mr Abbott, a former health minister in the previous government who trained to be a Catholic priest before entering politics, said on Tuesday he would demand the government's ETS legislation be referred to a Senate committee.

If that demand was refused, the opposition coalition, which also includes the junior National party, would vote down the ETS in a move that would provide Mr Rudd with a trigger to call an early election.

On current polling, the opposition would suffer a bloodbath in an early election, a fact that will not be lost on Mr Rudd who will be angry that his attempt to take a leadership role at Copenhagen has been undermined by the Liberal party's decision to renege on its deal to back the ETS.

Labour party figures said Mr Abbott's elevation had exposed the Liberal party's ""jugular"". They also noted that Mr Abbott had failed to put forward any original themes during his first press conference as leader.

Mr Abbott said the ETS was an energy tax that would cost the Australian public A$120bn.

He claimed that Mr Rudd simply wanted to ""take a trophy"" to Copenhagen and there was no point bringing in the ETS prematurely.

He admitted to past mistakes.

""At times I have stuffed up but I believe when you become a new leader you make a new start.""

He tried to distance himself from his comment that climate change arguments were ""crap"".

""That was a bit of hyperbole and it was not my most considered opinion,"" he said.

""I think that climate change is real and that man does make a contribution,"" he said.

He also claimed the Liberal party would have a ""strong and effective"" policy on climate change but provided no detail.

Mr Abbott's rise is a surprise even to himself, who until Monday night said he would not stand in the event that Joe Hockey, shadow treasurer, put his name forward.

However, Mr Abbott changed his mind after Mr Hockey, seen as the front runner, indicated he would allow Liberal party parliamentarians to make a ""free"" or ""conscience"" vote on the ETS in the event he was elected.

Senator Penny Wong, Australia's climate change, said ""extremists"" were now in control of the Liberal party.

""We will not tackle climate change without a global agreement but we will not get a global agreement if Australia is not prepared to stump up.""

She added that the time for talking was over.

Australia has had close to a dozen inquiries into climate change and the ETS in the last two years."
"Sunday, December 13, 2009 714 mots",,Trust the public on climate change,By Clive Crook,,"It is not enough for climate scientists and environment ministers to go to Copenhagen and tell each other how right they are. They also need to convince the public. National politics - the democratic process - is awfully inconvenient sometimes, but cannot be waved away.

The climate-science establishment - scientists subscribing to the global warming consensus and most governments, judging by words not deeds - understands this. This is why the Copenhagen meeting has a theatrical aspect; it is as much about public relations as about serious efforts to confront global warming.

The experts are intent on stirring up - they would say ""educating"" - public opinion. From their own point of view, however, they are making a hash of it.

The evidence for the climate consensus, they say, is stronger year by year. But in the US, public confidence in their statements is falling: less than half the electorate now regards man-made global warming as a proven fact. Admittedly, the US is an outlier in this, but few electorates anywhere seem sufficiently convinced to support, when push comes to shove, the policies that many climate scientists are calling for.

I recognise the consensus and believe it justifies, on prudential grounds, a big effort to curb emissions. But the climate-science establishment is making itself an obstacle.

Consider the response to Climategate - the scandal over e-mails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. The e-mails showed some of the world's leading climate scientists talking about a statistical ""trick"" to ""hide the decline"" in a proxy measure of temperature, musing over how to keep dissenters out of the literature, discussing the deletion of data that might be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, and more.

Any fair-minded person would regard those exchanges as raising questions. On the face of it, these are not the standards one expects of science. Nor is this just any science. The work of these researchers is being used to press the case for economic policies with colossal adjustment costs. Plainly, the highest standards of intellectual honesty and openness are called for. The e-mails do not attest to such standards.

Yet how did the establishment respond? It said that this is how science is done in the real world. Initially, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change defended the scientists and played down the significance of their correspondence. Al Gore said he had not read the e-mails (they were stolen, for heaven's sake) and that they were reassuring.

When, inexplicably, that did not quell the scandal, the climate-science establishment argued that even if CRU's work was excluded from consideration, plenty of other evidence supported its findings. Maybe so, thinks the fair-minded voter. But the independence of other big research groups is not entirely clear. In any case, many scientists had just called the e-mailers exemplars of best practice. Why should one expect other researchers' standards to be any different?

Which leaves smearing the doubters as opponents of science itself. They are either stupid or evil; ""flat-earthers"" or ""deniers"" (akin, that is, to Holocaust deniers). Supporters of the consensus no doubt lap this up. The voters who need to be convinced are less likely to. On the whole, people object to being called ignorant or evil. That is not how you bring them round.

Some dedicated climate sceptics are beyond persuasion. Some are batty. One can understand how exasperating it is for climate scientists to deal with them. But given what is at stake, they had better get over it. Expert dissenters, of whom there are many on this issue, have an honoured place in science. Sometimes, they turn out to be right. Strong consensus supports key findings of the climate orthodoxy, but the details matter and the science is far from settled. Aiming to smear the doubters and shut them up is just bad science, and from a public-relations point of view is wholly counter-productive.

The key mistake is this: governments and many climate scientists have decided this subject is too difficult for voters. Complications will only confuse them, poor things.

As one Climategate e-mailer noted, we do not understand why global warming has paused lately: the models cannot account for it. But this is not for public consumption. It is best never mentioned, think governments and their scientific advisers. Just keep saying ""flat-earthers"" or, as the White House spokesman said the other day, ""the notion that there is some kind of debate . . . is kind of silly.""

Once scientists are engaged as advocates, science is in trouble. Like intelligence agencies fitting the facts to the policy, they are no longer to be trusted. The IPCC may be serving a righteous cause, but it is not the honest broker this process needs. It has made itself a political agency - at times, a propaganda unit. All this, the public can see.

For the sake of their own credibility, scientists should maintain a cautious distance from politics, and those who take up politics should not expect the deference to disinterested scholars they would otherwise deserve.

Governments should be honest and base their case for action on what they know - that is, on a balance of probabilities, not on exaggerated certainties. The public, they will find, can cope. Voters are not fools."
"Wednesday, June 10, 2009 343 mots",,Japan unveils long-awaited climate target,By Mure Dickie in Tokyo,,"Taro Aso, Japan's prime minister, on Wednesday unveiled the country's long-awaited medium term target for action against global warming, saying the world's second largest economy would cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 15 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020.

However, climate change activists immediately denounced the target - which amounts to only an 8 per cent reduction compared with Japan's 1990 emissions - as a disappointing concession to industry that could cost Tokyo any chance of playing a leadership role in international climate change negotiations.

Japan's target also underlines the gulf between rich and poor nations on action to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases blamed for global warming. China last month demanded that developed nations cut greenhouse gases by 40 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990.

Tokyo's mid-term targets for the world's fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, were announced amid climate change talks in Bonn intended to pave the way for conclusion of a new international treaty in December to replace the emissions-capping Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

Speaking in a nationally televised press conference, Mr Aso said the new mid-term target would maintain Tokyo's ""leadership"" in international action to prevent climate change, a topic that has been at the centre of Japanese diplomacy in recent years.

Mr Aso's decision to reject more ambitious proposals for emissions cuts of up to 25 per cent from 1990 levels reflects fierce opposition from business groups, which argue that Japanese industry is already the most energy efficient in the world and that further curbs could disastrously undermine its competitiveness.

The Keidanren, Japan's main business lobby, which had called for emissions to be allowed to rise by 4 per cent from 1990 levels, said Mr Aso's ""political decision"" had resulted in ""a target that can only be described as exceedingly tough"".

Climate change activists, however, dismissed the Keidanren's stance as putting short term profit concerns over long-term interests and opportunity.

Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Tokyo committed itself to cut emissions by at least 6 per cent from 1990 levels by 2012 - but Japan remains far from meeting that goal. In 2005, emissions were actually 7.8 per cent higher than in 1990.

Mie Asaoka, head of the anti-climate change group Kiko Network, said the government's decision to now make 2005 its baseline for future reductions was a ""very tricky use of numbers"".

""It's completely unsatisfactory...and will be the subject of fierce criticism from international society,"" Ms Asaoka said."
"GOVERNMENT IN TURMOIL, Friday, June 5, 2009 201 mots, p. 2",,Mandelson warms to action on climate,"By Jean Eaglesham, Chief Political Correspondent",,"Mainstream politics is entering a ""precarious time"" in the UK, with ""pretty high"" levels of cynicism and scepticism, Lord Mandelson will warn today.

The Blairite business secretary will use a speech on climate change to argue that the issue can be tackled effectively only through the political system.

Rebuilding political trust in Britain matters not just for its own sake but because ""politics is the only way that we will be able to legitimately make the huge decisions that need to be made now"" to tackle climate change, Lord Mandelson will say.

Labour has failed to provide sufficient strategic direction on energy policy for most of its time in office, the business secretary will admit.

""Up until recently there has been too much ambiguity or uncertainty in UK climate policy - in nuclear energy or renewables, for example,"" he will say. ""Clear leadership on these questions over the course of the last year has now unlocked billions of pounds of investment in UK capacity. We need to get that sense of clear strategic direction right through our action as a government.""

The broad political approach to climate change needs to stress the economic opportunities, as well as the costs, the business secretary will assert.

In a joking reference to his encounter with a protester, Lord Mandelson will say that mainstream environmental politics can inherit the ""passion and urgency"" of green campaigners. ""But it obviously can't be totally anti-politics, anti-business and anti-growth - we can't just throw green slime at the problem."""
"Thursday, June 11, 2009 359 mots",,Climate change for richer and poorer,,,"The biggest impasse is between China and the US, which together emit 40 per cent of the world's carbon. The US is considering legislation that would cut emissions by 16-17 per cent from current levels by 2020 - roughly flat on 1990 levels, Kyoto's baseline year. Japan this week went slightly better, offering an 8 per cent cut from 1990. The European Union offers 20 per cent; but with the EU already making good headway on cuts, this is a lesser concession than it looks.

China and India are dismissive. Beijing has raised the stakes by urging rich countries to cut emissions 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, and to pay huge sums to help poor countries cope with climate change. But everyone, China included, knows this is unrealistic. Its tough stance is an opening gambit, not a target outcome.

That stance is based on old arguments, but they are not less potent for being well-worn. The west has been polluting for 200 years and China's per capita emissions are only one-fifth of those of the US. Some 40 per cent of Chinese energy use produces exports for western consumers. That Beijing has logic and morality on its side, however, does not mean we will not all perish by applying them.

Not all is lost. China, and even India, are doing more than they are letting on. But they cannot be seen as being lectured by the west: much of their tough talk is for domestic display. So neither wants to be penned in by binding commitments - but they do want to be more energy-efficient and less polluting. Notwithstanding the smog hanging over Chinese cities, Beijing really is trying to implement stricter environmental standards.

Developing countries will not accept absolute cuts. But there is talk behind the scenes of China ""bending the curve"" - slowing the rate of increase. That would be a start. The best outcome would be if poor-country emitters were willing to quantify such promises.

To achieve this, rich countries must lead. They must put money on the table so poor countries see financial gains from combating climate change. They should also offer genuine research and technology collaboration - cheap, but symbolically important for countries such as China. If rich countries move, they may find China and others are willing to respond."
"COMPANIES - UK, Friday, June 12, 2009 274 mots, p. 19",,Climate spending poised to propel AEA,By John O'Doherty,,"Heavy spending by the Obama administration on environmental measures will boost sales at AEA Technology, the energy and climate change consultancy said, as it digests its recent acquisition of PPC, a US-based environmental data group.

""The stimulus package that [President] Obama has put forth includes $40bn (£24bn) to invest in emerging technologies and energy efficiency initiatives,"" said Mike Nigro, former chief executive of PPC and now chief operating officer at AEA.

""The administration has already appropriated much of the monies and we've written six proposals already for $150m that we couldn't have written had it not been for the AEA capabilities . . . over the next three years we see about $2bn worth of opportunities that we now can go after because of the relationship between AEA and PPC.""

So called ""secure sales"" - a measure of orders received by the company to date that are expected to be delivered in the coming year - stand at £57.5m, up 14 per cent from the £50.5m reached this time last year.

AEA Technology grew out of a subdivision of the UK's Atomic Energy Association, advising the British government on measures to reduce smog in London in the 1950s. It now advises the UK's Climate Change Committee and consults with governments and private sector organisations in Europe and China on environmental policy.

Andrew McCree, AEA's chief executive, said the acquisition of PPC would add expertise from the US in the collation and analysis of emissions and climate data to PPC's existing skills in policy formulation in Europe. ""The two markets are at different points in their cycle,"" he said.

""In the US, they're starting to formulate policy, whereas in the UK, the policy is all done and in place, and it's now in the space of implementation.""

For the full year ending in March, pre-tax profit fell 6 per cent to £7.5m on revenues that increased by 16 per cent to £93.7m. much of the profit decline was due to a £2.2m investment in sales and marketing operations, and AEA's operating profit increased by 5 per cent to £10.4m.

"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, June 13, 2009 523 mots, p. 8",,Climate change talks move at slow pace as nations hold on to bargaining chips,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Time is running out for climate change talks, with another meeting of world governments ending yesterday, this time in Bonn, with little progress towards a new agreement on greenhouse gases.

Officials are now pinning their hopes on the summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations next month, where the subject will be discussed by world leaders. They may feel more freedom to make compromises than their environment and finance ministers, who failed to do so at the United Nations conference in Bonn.

US president Barack Obama has also called a follow-up meeting in Italy immediately after the G8 summit, where the world's 15 biggest emitting countries - including emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil - will attempt to find common ground.

At least two more important UN meetings are planned before a crunch conference in Copenhagen in December. There, officials will attempt to replace the Kyoto protocol, whose main provisions expire in 2012.

Much of the two-week meeting in Bonn that ended yesterday was taken up with technicalities.

But China has reinforced the sense of discord by calling on developed countries to cut their emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 - far more than any plan to do - and to give up to 1 per cent of their gross domestic product in assistance to the developing world.

The lack of progress so far on the big issues - the extent to which rich countries will cut emissions, the commitments poor countries will make and how these will be funded - was underlined this week when Japan unveiled a plan to cut its emissions by 8 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 - only 2 per cent below Tokyo's commitment under the 1997 Kyoto protocol.

Kim Carstensen, leader of the climate initiative at the green campaigning group WWF, called Japan ""dangerously lacking any level of ambition"". ""This is a great shame, and sets the wrong tone for the negotiations,"" he said.

However, the positions adopted by Japan and China are privately viewed by officials from other leading countries as posturing. ""There are six months to go. We are still at the stage of people setting out their initial positions,"" said one.

By this analysis, the announcements suggest many of the key players plan to keep their best bargaining chips for the later stages of the UN talks.

For rich countries, those chips are money, technology and the extent to which they will cut emissions.

No such country has yet set out how much money it will provide to help poor countries to cut emissions.

Most, including the US and the European Union, have laid out their plans for emissions cuts. The US will, broadly speaking, return to 1990 emissions levels by 2020, while the EU will cut its emissions by 20 per cent compared with 1990 levels by 2020, or by 30 per cent if other countries take part.

Emerging economies, led by China and India, are holding out for funds and ""technology transfer"".

In return for funding, and the possibility of a global carbon trading mechanism that would benefit emerging economies, rich countries want legally binding commitments that developing countries will ""deviate from business as usual"". That is, curb their emissions so they do not reach the levels expected if economic growth continues along a high-carbon path.

Developing nations could undertake to increase renewable energy generation and improve energy efficiency. China, India and others have already started drawing up such plans.

""China does not need to take the same actions that developed countries are taking, but it does need to take significant action. When it comes to climate change, China must be part of the solution,"" David Sandalow, US assistant secretary of energy, told the Beijing Energy Club this week.

For the months to come, all eyes are on China."
"Monday, June 15, 2009 389 mots",,Climate change groups urge Australia probe,By Peter Smith in Sydney,,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to launch an investigation into alleged ""misleading and deceptive conduct"" by a group of companies over public statements on the impact of Australia's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

The call has been made by the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Australian Climate Justice Program, which have named six companies in their complaint to the ACCC. The list comprises miners Rio Tinto and Xstrata, petroleum groups Woodside and Caltex, as well as Boral, the building products group, and Bluescope Steel.

The competition commission said it had received a letter from the ACF and was considering its contents before deciding whether it would take action.

A number of Australian companies have been vocal in their criticism of the country's proposed CPRS legislation, complaining about about likely job losses, rising costs and disparities with companies in other jurisdictions which are not subject to similar laws. There have also been claims that energy and mining projects would be less competitive if Australia introduced laws ahead of other nations.

The ACF complaint sets out 14 instances where company statements are alleged to be ""exaggerated and contradictory"" when compared with disclosures made to shareholders, and independent analysis.

Don Henry, ACF executive director, said he wanted the competition commission to examine whether Australia's Trade Practices Act has been breached.

""Some of Australia's biggest corporate polluters appear to be presenting the worst case to government and the public in an effort to gain excessive free permits while presenting the best case to investors in order to keep their share prices up.

""We are asking the ACCC to investigate whether our politicians, policymakers and the public have been deceived,"" he said.

RiskMetrics, the corporate governance adviser, estimates that the value of free permits Canberra has agreed to make to the country's six heaviest polluting industries will reach A$12.6bn in the first five years after CPRS is introduced.

The complaint from the conservation group comes as Australia's Labor government prepares to introduce its CPRS legislation to the country's upper house, the Senate, next week. The introduction of the scheme has already been delayed and the government faces an uphill battle to get the bills passed into law.

Woodside said the ACF's claims had ""no substance,"" adding that: ""The ACF makes specific allegations against Woodside of no apparent disclosure, yet overlooks a series of relevant disclosures made to the Australian Securities Exchange over many months.""

Rio said it had made three major submissions to the Australian government on the issue but said it would be inappropriate to make a statement to its shareholders until the CPRS legislation was passed into law.

It added that the chances of the legislation being passed in its current form appeared remote."
"Tuesday, July 7, 2009 511 mots",,Key polluters focus on climate action,By Fiona Harvey,,"Representatives of the world's 16 largest greenhouse gas emitters held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to try to salvage backing for a strong statement on climate change at this week's Group of Eight meeting in Italy.

Signals that China and India would not sign up to headline emissions reductions led the US on Friday to call the closed-doors meeting in Rome.

It aims to smooth the passage of a key climate change debate tomorrow at L'Aquila, at which eight countries will join the G8 industrialised nations, including China, India, Mexico and Brazil. The European Union also participates as a member of the G8, as does Denmark which hosts a key conference in December aimed at forging a successor to the Kyoto protocol.

Barack Obama, the US president, called together the leaders of the world's biggest emitters for the first time in a bid to revive sluggish progress in global warming negotiations.

The 16 countries in the Major Economies Forum, which was begun under former US president George W. Bush, produce 80 per cent of the world's carbon emissions.

A key issue at the MEF, which will be co-chaired by Mr Obama and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, will be whether to include a formal commitment to hold global warming to no more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety.

If agreed by the MEF, it would be the first time such a commitment has been formally adopted by an international forum.

But the commitment was in doubt on Tuesday as China sought to achieve additional concessions on funding for poor nations to cut emissions and adapt to climate change, and for more of the burden of emissions cuts by 2020 to be taken up by rich countries.

""The G8 must agree more investment for the developing world and stronger mid-term targets on CO2 to get China's backing,"" said Tobias Muenchmeyer of Greenpeace. ""They must show leadership.""

The debate at L'Aquila is intended to give momentum to the separate United Nations negotiations under way to update the Kyoto protocol, which culminate at Copenhagen. The original Kyoto deal required rich countries but not poor nations to cut emissions, and was never ratified by the US.

The idea behind the MEF is to provide an alternative to the UN, in which progress is slow because 192 countries must be included in discussions.

""If we don't get anything on climate change from the G8 and the MEF, then we will really have a problem at Copenhagen,"" said one EU diplomat who declined to be named.

Last year's G8 summit displayed a clear rift between developed and developing countries. The rich nations committed to cut global emissions by 50 per cent by 2050. But the so-called ""plus five"" nations - China, India, Brazil, Mexico and South Africa - called on them to make cuts of more than 80 per cent to allow developing countries to increase their emissions.

One of the main achievements of the MEF is to bring together heads of government. The UN talks involve environment ministers, who often lack the authority to make significant concessions. The White House hopes that if leaders meet face to face, they may establish common ground that will help give their ministers more freedom to negotiate.

Connie Hedegaard, climate and energy minister for Denmark, said: ""[The negotiators] have been sitting opposite each other for years arguing from the same positions. That is why it is so crucial that the leaders say [forging an agreement in Copenhagen] is what they want to do. That will let [the negotiators] depart from here.""

Mr Obama heads to Italy armed with the passage of cap-and-trade legislation through the US House of Representatives. Although the vote was narrow, the move towards a federal carbon-cutting regime signals the US is serious about tackling climate change.

Jonathan Lash, president of the World Resources Institute, said: ""The problem that we face with the negotiations is not scientific or technical, but political."""

The G8 leaders were due to begin their summit later on Wednesday with a discussion on the global financial crisisand ""exit strategies"" - how to deal with the massive debt overhang and threat of inflation once recovery starts.

A draft communiqué obtained by Reuters notes signs of stabilisation in major economies. But G8 leaders are expected to follow the cautious approach set out by their finance ministers a month ago.

""We agreed the need to prepare appropriate strategies for unwinding extraordinary measures once the recovery is assured,"" the draft communiqué says. ""Exit strategies will vary depending on economic conditions and public finances. Analytical work will be carried out by the IMF.""

Preparatory talks on another agenda item - climate change - held by senior diplomats of the 16-nation Major Economies Forum late on Tuesday dropped a reference in the draft communiqué to the goal of halving greenhouse gas omissions by 2050.

Leaders of the 16 countries were due to meet on Thursday during the three-day summit at L'Aquila in central Italy. But Hu Jintao, China's president, had to cut short his visit and return to deal with unrest in Xinjiang.

Barack Obama, US president, arrived in Rome on Wednesday morning. After meeting Giorgio Napolitano, Italy's head of state, he was due to fly the 120 km to L'Aquila for the summit which is being held in the compound of a finance ministry police college.

Anantha Guruswamy, Greenpeace programme director, said India and China had so far refused to sign up to the commitment on emissions targets because the G8 club of rich nations had not shown leadership by putting enough incentives and financing on the table. ""It is up to Obama to show leadership on this,"" Mr Guruswamy said.

""There is a real danger that the G8 text will go backwards as a result of this,"" he warned.

The 16 countries in the MEF produce 80 per cent of the world's carbon emissions.

Leaders of 16 of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries are meeting today at the request of Barack Obama, US president.

He called the meeting, called the Major Economies Forum, which he is co-chairing with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, in order to break the deadlock in climate change talks, aimed at producing a successor to the Kyoto protocol at a conference in Copenhagen in December.

Yesterday, the G8 produced a communiqué resolving to try to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety.

This was the first time such a target has been formally adopted in a leading international forum.

However, in order to curb temperature rises to this extent, scientists calculate that global emissions must be at least halved by 2050. A target to this effect was included in the draft communiqué, but it had to be dropped after China - the world's biggest emitter - failed to agree to it.

The absence of Mr Hu will make further progress difficult. One of the aims of the MEF was to bring leaders of the main emitting countries together for the first time to discuss climate change, so that they could allow their environment ministers - who attend the UN negotiations - greater latitude in making a deal. But China was reluctant to sign up to the 2050 target without first gaining key concessions.

Anantha Guruswamy, Greenpeace programme director, said China and India had refused to sign up because the G8 club of rich nations had not shown leadership by putting forward proposals for financing emissions cuts and measures to adapt to climate change in poor countries. ""It is up to Obama to show leadership on this,"" Mr Guruswamy said.

""There is a real danger the G8 text will go backwards as a result of this.""

Beijing and Delhi also want rich countries to agree far higher targets on cutting emissions by 2020 than any have yet come up with.

A sombre Barack Obama, US president, who chaired the meeting of the Major Economies Forum in Italy, said he acknowledged that progress would not be easy and that it would be ""no small task"" to bridge the differences.

The MEF countries, which produce 80 per cent of global emissions, agreed that the world should not heat up more than 2ºC above pre-industrial levels. But India and China resisted a push from the G8 developed nations to set a target of reducing emissions by an overall average of 50 per cent by 2050.

However, Ed Miliband, UK secretary of state for energy and climate, told the Financial Times that a pledge by developed nations to limit global warming to less than 2ºC ""significantly increases the chances of success at Copenhagen"".

NGOs and environmental activists were dismayed at the outcome, calling it a missed opportunity that risked undermining the UN conference in Copenhagen in December, which must set a climate change programme to replace the Kyoto framework expiring in 2012.

""The blame lies squarely with the G8,"" said Anantha Guruswamy of Greenpeace. ""The blame game will start. The EU and others are blaming India and China and then there will be a harsh pushback.""

While the G8 club of rich nations agreed on Wednesday in what Mr Obama described as a ""historic consensus"" to cut their emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, they failed to set near-term goals. They also refused to commit themselves to the huge funding required - estimated by experts at some $150bn (€107bn, £92bn) a year - to help developing countries adapt to climate change and cut their own emissions. Mr Obama only said that the MEF had agreed to a ""substantial increase"" in contributions to poor countries.

Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, who will chair the Copenhagen meting, was quoted as saying the G8 summit had ""missed a unique opportunity"".

China in particular wanted assurances from the G8 that intellectual property rights would be relaxed so it could benefit from new technologies to take a lead in clean energy markets.

Joanne Green, head of policy for the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, said the 2ºC limit agreed by MEF was ""forward movement but it is woefully inadequate compared to what is needed"".

Climatico, a network of climate change experts, said that, to limit temperature rises to 2ºC, emissions needed to peak in the next 10-15 years. It said the US Senate was the best hope for breaking the impasse by giving Mr Obama a strong cap-and-trade bill.

Summit round up: Day two

- Triumphant pro-Berlusconi media lorded it over the leftwing opposition, describing the opening success of the summit as a blow to his political rivals. ""The G8 opening turns into a boomerang for those plotters,"" headlined Il Giornale, a daily owned by the prime minister's brother.

Instead of photos emerging of ""kissing lesbians and orgies""- referring to alleged scandals plaguing the prime minister - Il Giornale pointed out that Italy's front pages were dominated by images of Silvio Berlusconi showing Barack Obama, the US president, around the earthquake ruins of L'Aquila.

Most Italian dailies also focused on how Mr Obama and the US delegation had strongly dismissed reports in US and UK newspapers of chaotic preparations for the summit and suggestions that Italy's place in the rich club should be taken by Spain.

- ""There is no such thing as a free lunch,"" Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, told a news conference more than once after lunch at the G8 summit, expressing his concerns that world leaders had to start thinking seriously about their ""exit strategy"" after massive fiscal stimulus packages. Asked by the FT who had paid for his lunch, Mr Strauss-Kahn replied: ""Probably you.""

But he defended these ever more frequent gatherings of world leaders - in April in London, this week in L'Aquila and then next to Pittsburgh in September. ""Globalisation is not just a topic for FT editorial pages,"" he added.

- Mr Obama was due last night to sit four seats from Muammer Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, at a summit dinner, 23 years after former US president Ronald Reagan bombed the colonel's tent.

Mr Gaddafi is attending the summit as chairman of the African Union. Italy is credited with saving his life in 1986 when Bettino Craxi, the former premier, warned him of the US raid.

- The G8 leaders finalised details of an estimated $15bn fund to help feed starving people in the developing world over the traditionally lavish summer dinner: this time a six-course banquet washed down with a choice of six local wines.

Local chefs prepared a menu including truffles and roasted lamb from the Sangro hills, as the summiteers discussed today's agricultural fund for developing countries.

However, some diplomats praised Mr Berlusconi for his restraint in not going over the top in his catering. Last year's G8 summit in Hokkaido, Japan, was criticised after hosts brought in a battery of chefs to deliver a bewildering range of dishes.

Friday's agenda

- Working breakfast for G8 and leaders from Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and African Union to discuss impact of global economic crisis on Africa.

- Meeting followed by joint statement on food security and the launch of an initiative to fund farming and tackle global hunger.

- Mr Obama meets the Pope.

Q&A: Greenhouse gas emissions cuts are the next hot topic

What are rich and poor countries fighting about?Rich countries are committed to substantial cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but poor countries - chiefly China and India - have been reluctant to sign up to emissions targets.

This is because they see a global target on emissions as a bargaining chip to be played later in talks on climate change. The talks are set to culminate at a conference in Copenhagen in December where governments will try to forge a successor to the Kyoto protocol, the main provisions of which expire in 2012.

What have countries agreed to?The G8 has agreed to cut emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. A wider grouping, known as the Major Economies Forum - made up of the world's 16 biggest emitters plus the EU and Denmark, as host of the Copenhagen conference - has agreed to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

Is this good?It is a big step forward. Previously, developed countries had only agreed a target of halving global emissions by 2050. And this is the first time the 2°C target has been adopted in a major international forum.

Why is 2°C so important?An increase in temperatures of 2°C is widely regarded by climate scientists as the limit of safety. Beyond that, the effects of climate change - floods, droughts, sea level rises and crop failures - are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Scientists base their estimates on studies of the earth's past climate.

Where's the catch?The G8 was hoping that the developing countries would agree a general global target of halving emissions by 2050. But China and India refused without concrete promises on financing from rich to poor countries to help them tackle emissions and cope with the effects of climate change.

Also making promises for 40 years' time is easy but fulfilling them is another matter. For a meaningful agreement, countries would also have to set a mid-term target for emissions, preferably involving hefty cuts by 2020.

What else needs to be done?Emissions need to be cut. An aim of holding the world to 2°C of warming is rather vague, not least because once emitted, carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for decades. Stopping warming at 2°C would be hard to judge accurately and could only be measured retrospectively.

Where do we go from here?Copenhagen. There are a series of meetings, including another of world leaders, before December, but many important issues - financing, mid-term emissions cuts, what to do about forests - are likely to remain unresolved until the conference."
"Thursday, July 9, 2009 425 mots",,Climate change talks grind to halt,By Guy Dinmore in L'Aquila,,"Leaders of the world's 16 biggest polluters on Thursday were on the brink of failing to agree targets to cut greenhouse gases, jeopardising the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit set for December.

""The G8 missed a unique opportunity on climate change,"" Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, said as the talks stuttered to a halt.

However, Barack Obama, US president, said there was still time to reach a climate change agreement this year. Failure to agree targets would set the stage for recriminations between rich and poor nations.

The Major Economies Forum managed to agree that average global temperatures should not rise more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels, but India and China resisted developed nations' pressure to set a target of cutting emissions by an average of 50 per cent by 2050.

""This is a huge missed opportunity. With new leadership in the US there was great optimism. It could have been a dramatic turning point,"" said Anantha Guruswamy of Greenpeace.

""The blame game will start. The EU and others are blaming India and China and then there will be a harsh pushback . . . I don't see how they can resolve this in the next months before Copenhagen,"" he said.

Although the G8 developed countries had agreed among themselves on Wednesday to set a target of reducing their emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, they failed to tackle concrete measures, establish more immediate targets or provide the huge funds needed to help developing nations cope with climate change and cut their emissions.

Gordon Brown, UK prime minister, has led the way in saying $100bn (€72bn, £62bn) a year will be needed by 2020. Scientists and NGOs have talked of $150bn.

China in particular demanded, but failed to get, G8 assurances that intellectual property rights would be relaxed so it could benefit from new technologies to become a leading player in clean energy markets.

Joanne Green, head of policy for Cafod, the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development, said agreement on the two degree limit was welcome but overdue, and represented just an ""inching forward"" that put success at Copenhagen at risk.

The UN conference in December is intended to set a global programme to combat climate change to replace the Kyoto framework which expires in 2012.

""The G8 on Wednesday failed to live up to their responsibilities [as the main initiators of global warming] and make concrete commitments on finance and technology transfer,"" Cafod said, arguing that ""China was moving towards a greener economy more quickly than any of them"".

Western officials sought to minimise the differences between the two blocs, with India and China in effect representing the Group of 77 developing nations. One EU diplomat called the two degree accord ""the big success story of the week"".

Oxfam, the aid agency, said: ""If the G8 dealt with the climate crunch as fast as they did the credit crunch, millions of poor people would be saved.""

Meanwhile, John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: ""Without specific short-term targets and immediate financial commitments to help developing countries, all we're being offered is words which will require future governments to be a thousand times better at delivery than our current leaders."""
"Thursday, July 9, 2009 281 mots",,Obama insists world climate accord possible,By George Parker and Guy Dinmore in L'Aquila and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Barack Obama, US president, insisted on Thursday there was still time for the world to agree binding commitments to cut greenhouse emissions, in spite of stalemate at the G8 summit in L'Aquila.

Mr Obama takes centre stage in the Italian town on Thursday when he chairs a session on global warming, bringing together 17 rich and emerging economies, including China and Brazil.

US diplomats say there is no chance that the countries will agree to cut world emissions by 50 per cent by 2050 - from a still undecided baseline of 1990 or later. They are however likely to agree on an aspiration to stop temperatures rising more than 2 degrees centigrade compared with pre-industrial levels.

The early departure of Hu Jintao, China's president of China, from the meeting made any change in position on cuts even less likely.

But Mr Obama believes an agreement on binding intermediate targets - for a deadline sometime before 2050 - can be reached before a UN climate change summit in Copenhagen in December.

Robert Gibbs, White House spokesman, said Mr Obama told President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil that ""there was still time in which they could close the gap on that disagreement in time for that important [meeting]"".

Mr Obama is seen as a pivotal figure in reaching any Copenhagen agreement, but months of tense negotiations lie ahead.

India, China and other big emerging economies want to be sure the west is serious about meeting medium term targets for cutting emissions before they commit themselves. They also want money to help them clean up their industries.

The credibility of the G8 on climate change was challenged by Russia, which had earlier signed up to a communique by the group committing wealthy nations to an even more ambitious 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050 - again with a still undecided baseline. The Russian delegation however has questioned whether such a long-term target is meaningful.

Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, said progress on climate change at the G8 was so far ""not enough"". He added: ""This is politically and morally [an] imperative and historic responsibility ... for the future of humanity, even for the future of the planet Earth."""
"Sunday, July 12, 2009 344 mots",,Patents spat looms at climate change meeting,By Frances Williams in Geneva,,"Ways of averting a damaging clash over patents at a climate change meeting later this year, pitting the US against the big emerging economies, will top the agenda at a conference organised by the UN's intellectual property agency that opens on Monday.

At the G8 summit in Italy last week, China, backed by India and Brazil, repeated its call for easier access to patented clean energy technologies in return for signing on to a new global climate change accord in Copenhagen in December.

China, in a submission last year to the UN body handling negotiations on the accord, called for new rules allowing confiscation of patents through compulsory licensing of ""environmentally sound technologies"".

India and Brazil say they want explicit recognition that compulsory licensing can be used in the interests of mitigating climate change under World Trade Organisation intellectual property rules, drawing parallels with a 2001 WTO declaration relating to intellectual property and public health.

Alarmed US industry groups, with strong support in the Congress, are pressing the Obama administration to resist any weakening of patent protection in the Copenhagen talks, raising fears among environmental groups that wrangling could scuttle an accord aimed at limiting global greenhouse gas emissions.

In May, the US Chamber of Commerce launched a Coalition for Innovation, Employment and Development specifically to lobby for maintaining strong IP rights in the climate change and other international negotiations. The coalition argues that patents, copyright and trademarks are essential to stimulate innovation.

However, more neutral experts, including the World Intellectual Property Organisation, organiser of the two-day conference on IP and public policy, say more creative use of the existing system could enable a wider spread of clean technologies without recourse to confiscation of patents.

David Lammy, UK minister for intellectual property, who will speak at the conference on Monday, says that in addition to more voluntary licensing of technologies such as solar power and fuel cells, poorer countries need help to develop their own knowledge base.

Incentives he will mention include cross-national research collaboration, patent pooling and ""licences of right"", which cut patent fees if rights holders agree to license their invention to anyone requesting it.

With China, the UK is developing model agreements for collaboration on research and development to ensure the benefits of innovation are both shared and protected. Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, said earlier this year she hoped to explore collaborations between universities in the US and China ""where we can jointly develop intellectual property, where we can jointly come up with new technologies""."
"Wednesday, July 22, 2009 613 mots",,Atkins likens climate change to industrial revolution,By David Fickling,,"Climate change presents a challenge as great as the industrial revolution and many construction companies are unprepared to deal with it, according to the head of Europe's biggest engineering consultant.

Accounting for carbon as mandated emissions caps bite into profit margins will make and break companies, says Keith Clarke, chief executive of Atkins and chairman of the Construction Industry Council, a professional body.

""This decarbonising of our economy is going to be a massive threat to some parts of our industry. This is like the moment when chip manufacturers started to replace valves: some companies will thrive and some will not cope.""

Such talk is unusual in the construction industry, an energy-intensive sector where innovation is often slow and commitment on climate change usually stops at lip service.

Nigel Meir, a fund manager at Ludgate Environmental Fund, says that although green interest in the construction industry has been picking up rapidly, it is still ""not well advanced"" compared with other sectors.

But meeting the government's target of cutting carbon emissions by 34 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 must involve changes on the building site. At least 40 per cent of the UK's carbon emissions come from heating and running buildings. A further 5 per cent comes from the activities of the construction sector itself, according to the Green Building Council.

Mr Clarke speaks with the zeal of a convert. Climate change mitigation is a ""moral imperative"" which will involve ""revolutionary change in our society"", as well as a ""staggering opportunity"" for the economy.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

""It won't be comfortable,"" he says, with just a hint of glee. ""It's horrifying, it really is. But it is extremely exciting to think about a change that has so many unpredictable effects. Intellectually it's about as exciting as it gets.""

Regulation has made the business of decarbonising the construction sector a reality. The government, which announced its carbon strategy last week, set targets for all new homes to be zero-emission by 2016, with domestic energy efficiency to be improved by 25 per cent as soon as next year.

The government wants those codes to spread to the rest of the industry so that all new buildings would be zero-emission by 2020. On top of that, the cap on the European Union's emissions trading system will start tightening from 2013, ratcheting up the price of carbon and forcing companies to account for their emissions.

That gives hard financial reasons to be ready. ""There's dynamic change coming to the marketplace and you should be ready for it,"" says Mr Clarke. ""That's what CEOs get paid to do: guess the future and try and dance their way through it.""

But the scale of the change means this is easier said than done. ""Every aspect of our society will have some carbon rationing,"" he says. ""A lot of companies have environmental groups but I don't think many are thinking about this as a fundamental change to all their products.

""All of our clients are going to start to have some kind of carbon budgeting in the next five years, but carbon accountancy is behind double entry book-keeping at the moment,"" he says. ""We've just invented it and we have to get up to international accounting standards pretty quickly.""

With a view to hastening the process, Atkins has funded a chair in sustainability at the British University in Dubai, trained its 18,000 staff in emissions mitigation and invested in modelling programmes to embed carbon accounting in design tools. He says this progress means the Bahrain World Trade Center, which Atkins designed and engineered, is looking out of date a year after it opened.

The company also aims to reduce its electricity usage by 12.5 per cent in the next 12-18 months. At present, Atkins' declared emissions from office energy and business travel do not look particularly efficient compared with its peers. While the company consumed 25.8 tonnes of carbon for every £1m of turnover last year, Amec used 19.79 tonnes and WSP's UK operations (the only ones for which complete figures are available) 14.4 tonnes.

Mr Clarke's road to Damascus moment came only recently: he cites the Stern review, Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and the influence of his daughter Jo, 25, who works for Otesha, a sustainable lifestyle charity. ""She made me think about it far more than the general nice middle-class awareness about being green.""

""If we materially miss these targets we're into scenarios that are so bad you just don't want to think about them. Your children certainly won't need a pension. They'll need a shotgun."""
"Thursday, July 23, 2009 715 mots",,India widens climate rift with west,"By James Lamont in New Delhi, Joshua Chaffin in Are and Fiona Harvey in London",,"A split between rich and poor nations in the run-up to climate-change talks widened on Thursday.

India rejected key scientific findings on global warming, while the European Union called for more action by developing states on greenhouse gas emissions.

Jairam Ramesh, the Indian environment minister, accused the developed world of needlessly raising alarm over melting Himalayan glaciers.

He dismissed scientists' predictions that Himalayan glaciers might disappear within 40 years as a result of global warming.

""We have to get out of the preconceived notion, which is based on western media, and invest our scientific research and other capacities to study Himalayan atmosphere,"" he said.

""Science has its limitation. You cannot substitute the knowledge that has been gained by the people living in cold deserts through everyday experience.""

Mr Ramesh was also clear that India would not take on targets to cut its emissions, even though developed countries are asking only for curbs in the growth of emissions, rather than absolute cuts.

His stance was at wide variance with that of Andreas Carlgren, his Swedish counterpart. Sweden holds the European Union's revolving presidency until a conference in Copenhagen in December at which governments will try to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse emissions - the main provisions of which expire in 2012.

Mr Carlgren said in Are, Sweden, that developing countries such as India, China and Brazil must propose more ambitious plans to reduce emissions if they were to receive finance from wealthy nations.

Rich and poor countries have been squabbling over the issue of financing for months, imperilling the outcome of the Copenhagen talks. Rich countries have not agreed to provide the funding that poor nations say is necessary to help them cut their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Mr Carlgren went on the offensive on Thursday, saying poorer countries must come up with firm plans to cut emissions before financing will be forthcoming.

States such as China and India have produced plans for curbing the growth in their emissions but these have not been formalised within the negotiating process.

Mr Carlgren also criticised rich countries for failing to agree to cut their emissions by the amounts needed. ""So far, what we have seen from other countries is too low. We expect more from developed countries,"" he said.

But the Swedish environment minister said poor countries must also do more to forge an agreement. ""We are prepared to put money on the table. But it should also be said that if we don't see significant reductions that will really deviate from business as usual . . . then there is no money,"" Mr Carlgren said, singling out China, India, Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia. ""We are also prepared to deliver financing, but we must see that there is something to pay for.""

India has taken the hardest line in the negotiations so far. Along with China, India refused at the meeting of the Group of Eight industrialised nations this month to sign up to a target of cutting global emissions by half by 2050. The countries were holding out to gain concessions from the west on financing.

The claims from Mr Ramesh that Western science was wrong on the question of melting Himalayan glaciers appeared to reinforce Delhi's recalcitrant stance.

Mr Ramesh on Friday reiterated that India would not accept emissions caps to held curb global warming, Bloomberg reported. ""The world has nothing to fear from India's development ... An artifical cap is not desirable and not even necessary as we haven't been responsible for emissions in the first place,"" he said.

Earlier this week, he also challenged Hillary Clinton, US secretary of state, over her appeal to India to embrace a low-carbon future and not repeat the mistakes of the developed world in seeking fast industrialisation.

The consequences of depleted glaciers - sensitive to rising temperature and humidity - would be dire.

Seven of the world's greatest rivers , including the Ganges and the Yangtze, are fed by the glaciers of the Himalayas and Tibet. They supply water to about 40 per cent of the world's population.

Water supply is likely to become an increasing national security priority for both India and China as they seek to maintain high economic growth rates and sustain large populations dependent on farming. Some scientists have warned that rivers such as the Ganges, Indus and Brahmaputra could become seasonal rivers as a result of global warming.

Indians are also fearful of weakening monsoon rains. Some parts of India, including Delhi, the capital, are still waiting anxiously for this year's rains to come in earnest. A late, or a poor, monsoon would be a drag on economic growth.

Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, has described melting glaciers as a ""canary in the climate-change coal mine"", warning that billions of people depend on these natural water storage facilities for drinking water, power generation and agriculture.

Mr Ramesh said the rate of retreat of glaciers in the Himalayas varied from a ""couple of centimetres a year to a couple of metres"", but that this was a natural process that had taken place occurred over the centuries. Some were, in fact, growing, he said.

The glaciers - estimated by India's space agency to number about 15,000 - had also been affected by debris and the large number of tourists, he said."
,,Beijing hints at softer line on emission cuts in climate talks,By Kathrin Hille in Beijing and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Beijing hinted yesterday at room for compromise in global climate change talks, as its negotiator left open the possibility China could commit itself to reducing carbon emissions beyond 2012.

Yu Qingtai, Beijing's special representative for climate talks, indicated that more generous financial and technological support from developed countries could help China reach a peak in its carbon emissions sooner than expected.

Along with other developing nations, China wants developed countries to be legally bound to help pay for curbing emissions in poorer ones. ""When China's emissions will peak depends on our development stage, our GDP per capita, our resources structure and technology level,"" he said.

""It will also depend on the dynamics of international co-operation, especially technology transfer.""

Mr Yu's remarks to journalists appeared to show a new willingness to converge with the western approach, in contrast to previous communications characterised by demands for western countries to do more, rather than an emphasis on what China will do.

China has also sounded a more moderate tone recently on how much developed countries should curb their emissions under a new global agreement to be sealed in December in Copenhagen. While Beijing demanded in May that rich nations must cut greenhouse emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 from 1990 levels, it has lately spoken only of ""large reductions"".

Mr Yu said China still considered the 40 per cent target fair, but added that it would be set through negotiations. His moderate tone contrasts markedly with the attitude shown by India.

Last week, Jairam Ramesh , India's environment minister, said New Delhi would not discuss signing up to legally binding obligations for absolute cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for at least another decade.

Rich countries are not asking for developing states to be obliged to cut their emissions from current levels. Instead, they would like emerging economies such as China and India to commit themselves to curbing future emissions. This would mean that such countries could continue to increase emissions as their economies developed, but that measures should be taken to ensure the increase is less than historical levels.

This could involve national action plans, including energy efficiency schemes, renewable energy generation and investment in new technologies such as carbon capture and storage.

China has set targets to increase its proportion of renewables and increase its energy efficiency, and now has one of the most buoyant renewable energy sectors in the world. Negotiators from other countries, and particularly the US, praise such actions in the hope of encouraging more from Beijing.

The country is on track to meet a target to reduce energy consumption per unit of its gross domestic product by 20 per cent by 2010 over 2005 levels, said Mr Yu.

He rejected the idea of a rift between China and India. The two countries were closely co-ordinating in the multilateral climate talks, and their positions on the principles of the Copenhagen negotiations were ""quite identical"", he said.

China's hope

'I can say that as a Chinese, there is no one in the world who hopes more sincerely than we ourselves to see China's emissions peak as early as possible. Because this is in the Chinese national interest, and it is also in the interest of the people of the world' Yu Qingtai, China's special representative for climate change talks"
"Friday, June 12, 2009 572 mots",,Climate change talks move at glacial pace,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Time is running out for climate change talks, with another meeting of world governments ending on Friday, this time in Bonn, with little progress towards a new agreement on greenhouse gases.

Officials are now pinning their hopes on the summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations next month, where the subject will be discussed by world leaders. They may feel more freedom to make compromises than their environment and finance ministers, who failed to do so at the United Nations conference in Bonn and at other recent side meetings.

US president Barack Obama has also called a follow-up meeting to take place in Italy immediately after the G8 summit, where the world's 15 biggest emitting countries - including emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil - will attempt to find common ground.

There are at least two more important UN meetings planned before a crunch conference in Copenhagen in December. There, officials will attempt to hammer out an accord to replace the Kyoto protocol, whose main provisions expire in 2012.

Much of the two-week meeting in Bonn that ended on Friday was, of necessity, taken up with bureaucratic technicalities, which must be painstakingly sorted through before an agreement can be forged.

China has reinforced the sense of discord by calling on developed countries to cut their emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 - far more than any plan to do - and to give 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of their gross domestic product in assistance to the developing world.

The lack of progress so far on the big issues - the extent to which rich countries will cut emissions, the commitments poor countries will make and how these will be funded - was underlined this week when Japan unveiled a plan to cut its emissions by 8 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020 - a level only 2 per cent below Tokyo's commitment under the 1997 Kyoto protocol.

Kim Carstensen, leader of the climate initiative at the green campaigning group WWF, called Japan ""dangerously lacking any level of ambition"".

""This is a great shame, and sets the wrong tone for the negotiations,"" he said. ""[It] makes reaching a good deal even harder.""

However, the positions adopted by Japan and China are privately viewed by officials from other leading countries as posturing. ""There are six months to go. We are still at the stage of people setting out their initial positions,"" said one.

By this analysis, the announcements suggest many of the key players plan to keep their best bargaining chips for the later stages of the UN talks.

For rich countries, those chips are - in order of importance - money, technology and the extent to which they will cut their emissions.

None of the big developed countries has yet set out how much money they will provide to help poor countries cut emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change.

Most, including the US and the European Union, have laid out their plans for emissions cuts. The US will, broadly speaking, return to 1990 emissions levels by 2020, while the EU will cut its emissions by 20 per cent compared with 1990 levels by 2020, or by 30 per cent if other countries participate.

Emerging economies, led by China and India, are holding out for funds and ""technology transfer"".

In return for funding, and the possibility of a global carbon trading mechanism that would benefit emerging economies, rich countries want legally binding commitments from developing countries that they will ""deviate from business as usual"". That is, curb their emissions so they do not reach the levels expected if economic growth continues along a high-carbon path.

Such commitments could take the form of ""national action plans"" whereby developing nations undertake to increase renewable energy generation and improve energy efficiency.

China, India and others have already started drawing up such plans.

""China does not need to take the same actions that developed countries are taking, but it does need to take significant action. When it comes to climate change, China must be part of the solution,"" David Sandalow, US assistant secretary of energy, told the Beijing Energy Club this week.

For now, and for the months to come, all eyes are on China."
"Thursday, August 27, 2009 260 mots",,Estimated cost of climate adaptation soars,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Adapting to the damage caused by climate change will cost hundreds of billions of dollars a year, a group of scientists said on Thursday - putting the price tag far higher than previously estimated.

The worldwide cost of adaptation - including better flood defences, improving transport infrastructure and better resilience to drought - would probably reach sums in the region of $140bn to $210bn a year by 2030, said the group of climate experts brought together by Imperial College London and the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development.

These sums are far in excess of the $100bn (€70bn, £61bn) a year that Gordon Brown, the UK's prime minister, has said rich countries should be prepared to spend by 2020 on helping poor nations adapt to global warming and cut their greenhouse gas emissions.

Funding from the rich to the developing world to assist with adaptation is proving a big sticking point in the negotiations to forge a new global treaty on climate change, set to culminate this December at the Copenhagen summit. Poor countries say the developed world is failing in its responsibilities.

The scientists acknowledged, however, that studies were so far incomplete and required much more work before a more accurate picture of the costs could be presented.

""These estimates are based on studies of a selection of sectors,"" said Martin Parry, lead author of the report, entitled Assessing the Costs of Adaptation to Climate Change. ""The true cost is probably much greater.""

Climate change is expected to wreak havoc on many parts of the globe, particularly hitting poor countries, which will suffer declines in agricultural productivity and whose infrastructure may be overwhelmed by the need to cope with more frequent and intense storms.

Rich countries will not be immune. Buildings will need to be overhauled to cope with the expected increased incidence of droughts, storms and floods. Water and sanitation, electricity and transport networks will need to be improved."
"Friday, September 4, 2009 673 mots",,French winemakers fear climate change,"By Esther Bintliff in Condrieu, France",,"Christine Vernay was on holiday in Missouri when she got the call. It was August 12 2003 and the French vineyard owner was not due to return home for 10 days; the harvest on her Rhône valley estate would begin in late September. But then a friend from the same village, Condrieu, called her husband's mobile phone. ""The grapes have ripened early. You need to come home now,"" he said.

France was sweltering in the most extreme heat wave on record. Christine and her husband, Paul Ansellem, caught the first flight back but by the time they reached the vineyards most of the grapes in their 18 hectare estate had shrivelled on the vine.

Instead of rows of plump, light golden fruit, the couple found shrunken berries, burnt brown by the sun.

""We'd never seen anything like it,"" says Christine, a52-year-old mother of two, who took over the renowned Vernay estate from her father in 1997. She scrambled to arrange a harvest within three days of their return. Even so, the vineyards produced only half its usual volume of wine that year. The grapes were simply too desiccated.

Ms Vernay's experience offers a stark preview of what scientists say could be the future of the wine industry in southern Europe. Heat waves like that of 2003 will occur with increasing frequency in coming decades, they predict, while average yearly temperatures will continue to rise.

Martin Beniston, a senior climate scientist at the University of Geneva, and a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says: ""Current research suggests that by the end of the 21st century, one summer out of two will be at least as hot as 2003, which implies that certain summers may be even hotter. Where one heat-wave summer can have a beneficial effect on some grapes, several in a row would take a heavy toll on all but the most robust species.""

Since 2003, every summer but one, 2007, has been hotter than the average of the 30 years before, according to France Météo, the meteorological office. This summer was France's fifth hottest since 1950, with the average temperature 1.3º C above normal.

In August, for five days in a row, temperatures in southern France reached 40º C; in Languedoc and Beaujolais, grape-picking began in late August, while even in northern France winegrowers are preparing for a premature harvest.

""It will be a very early vintage, without a doubt,"" says Jean-Louis Vézien, director of CIVA, the Alsace organisation of wine growers and handlers.

Franck Thomas, European sommelier of the year in 2000, believes the result is already altering French wine ""profoundly"". ""If you harvest earlier . . . the alcohol content is higher [and] it unbalances the wine. For instance, with red wine, you have the maturity of the alcohol but not the tannins coming from the skin. So you lose the freshness, and the wine becomes tart and unpleasant.""

He is not alone in his concern. In August, Thomas and 49 of France's top chefs, sommeliers and wine producers wrote to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, arguing that climate change was threatening the survival of the wine industry and pushing for France to demand a 40 per cent cut in global carbon emissions by 2020 at this December's Copenhagen conference.

""French wines, jewels of our shared, cultural heritage, elegant and refined, are in danger,"" they wrote in the letter, which was published in Le Monde. Their fear is that rising temperatures in southern Europe could render centuries-old practices of wine growing irrelevant. Grapes across the Mediterranean would roast on the vine before reaching full maturity.

France's position as a revered producer of wine is thanks to centuries of cultivation, after the Greeks and the Romans imported techniques of viticulture into the Burgundy, Bordeaux and Rhône regions. But it rests on the delicate balance of climate and soil, and location.

""France's primacy at the top level of winemaking is an accident of nature,"" says Alun Griffiths, wine director at Berry Brothers & Rudd. ""France just happens to be in the perfect position to make a range of fantastic wines. It's considered a reasonably marginal climate - just a bit farther north in Britain it's not quite hot enough: Africa is too hot.""

If that changes, the specificity of certain wines could be destroyed for ever, according to Mr Thomas. ""In 2003, the wines lost their identity. It was very bizarre. Wine from the Loire valley tasted like wine from the Rhône. If we don't do something now, in 30 years we will have that problem every year.""

Ms Vernay's father, Georges, made 54 harvests before handing over the running of the estate to his daughter. In all but two of those years, they fell at the end of September, says Ms Vernay. ""Since I took over we've had 10 consecutive years in which our harvests have been about 10 days earlier than normal.

""It's most important that we start stopping or slowing down the change in climate. Otherwise we are facing real catastrophe."""
"Thursday, September 10, 2009 233 mots",,Offer of deal for climate talks,By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels,,"The European Union's environment chief challenged developing countries on Thursday to agree at the Copenhagen climate summit in December to rein in their emissions growth in return for greater financial aid.

Stavros Dimas, the environment commissioner, set out the conditions as he unveiled the European Commission's long-awaited financing proposal, under which the EU would contribute anywhere from €2bn ($3bn, £1.7bn) to €15bn per year to developing countries, including China, India and South Africa.

""This cannot be a blank cheque,"" said Mr Dimas. ""The level of funding will depend on how ambitious the Copenhagen agreement turns out to be.""

Mr Dimas also urged the US and other wealthy countries to suggest proposals of their own. ""As I have said before: no money from developed nations - no deal in Copenhagen.""

The Commission is hoping that its proposal will unblock discussions that have become bogged down over the question of how much money wealthy nations should offer to poorer ones to help them limit greenhouse-gas emissions and deal with the effects of climate change.

The Commission's proposal, which will be discussed at next week's meeting of European heads of state, pegs developed nations' needs at €100bn per year from 2020.

It envisages EU governments contributing up to 30 per cent of an international fund that would range from €22bn to €50bn.

The Commission suggested that the EU could pay with revenues from its emissions trading system. It also predicted that €38bn in private-sector funds could flow to the developing world each year through ""robust"" carbon markets, which encourage companies to invest in green technologies in poorer countries.

""The more the carbon market can provide, the less demand there will be on public finance,"" the proposal states."
"Thursday, September 17, 2009 313 mots",,Finance groups demand tough climate targets,By Fiona Harvey in London,,"Some of the biggest names in finance called on governments on Wednesday to strike a tough deal on emissions reductions in Copenhagen this December, in an effort to boost investment into climate change.

The investors, with a combined $13,000bn in assets under management, demanded higher commitments on emissions reductions than nations are likely to agree. Signatories include investors such as HSBC, Hermes, ING Group, Société Général, Swiss Re, Allianz Global Investors and numerous US and European public sector pension funds.

They called on rich countries to agree to cut their emissions by between 25 per cent and 40 per cent by 2020, compared with 1990 levels - a cut much deeper than the US has said it would sign up to but in line with what scientists have estimated will be necessary to avoid dangerous consequences from climate change.

Investors and companies should see climate change as a threat to the global economy and a business opportunity, Lord Stern, author of the influential review of the economics of climate change, said at a conference on Wednesday to launch the investment groups' call.

""Building a low carbon economy creates opportunities for investment in new technologies that promise to transform our society in the same way as the introduction of electricity or railways did in the past,"" he said.

The signatories also want developed nations to cut their emissions by between 80 per cent and 95 per cent by 2050, and called on the developing world to participate in a plan for global emissions to be slashed by 50 per cent to 85 per cent by the same date.

Big developing countries such as China and India have opposed such a global target, fearing it would be used as a weapon to try to force upon them more stringent emissions curbs than they are prepared to undertake.

A system of carbon trading would also be needed, the group said, and the current system under the United Nations - called the clean development mechanism - should be reformed.

The companies were brought together by several groups, including the Investor Network on Climate Risk in the US and the European Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change.

Their call reflects a growing belief among many businesses that a worldwide agreement on climate change and greenhouse gases is essential to create a level playing field among companies and to give them greater certainty and ­clarity in making investments, such as in building programmes."
"Global Insight, Thursday, September 17, 2009 549 mots",,Heat rises on climate change,By Edward Luce in Washington,,"Who would want to be Barack Obama in Copenhagen this December? His election last year was the cause of much delight around the world since it signalled that the US was finally ready to talk seriously about global warming.

But Mr Obama, who is the first US president to push strongly for Congress to enact cuts in carbon emissions, is beginning to suffer from the problem of high expectations - an exact reversal of how George W. Bush was treated.

Unless something miraculous happens on Capitol Hill, Mr Obama is almost certain to undershoot expectations at the climate-change summit in Denmark. Some time in the next two weeks, liberal Democrats will introduce a cap and trade bill in the Senate that will unleash the latest bout of infighting within their party amid its continuing divisions over healthcare reform.

Their differences on climate change are as wide as the Grand Canyon. On the progressive side, there are senators such as John Kerry and Barbara Boxer who want the upper chamber to pass a bill modelled on what went through the House of Representatives in June. This committed the US to cut its carbon output to 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020.

The bill was riddled with loopholes including the fact that it gives away 85 per cent of carbon permits for free and will only move to a system of full auctions in 2030. But against America's past record, most notably the Senate's refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in the 1990s, it marked a big leap forward.

The Senate is very unlikely to pass an equivalent bill between now and December. Against the likes of Mr Kerry and Ms Boxer are a growing caucus of centrist Democrats, from states such as Virginia, Nebraska and Michigan, which have either strong coal-based manufacturing or agricultural lobbies to appease.

Most ominously for supporters of the bill was the ascension last week of Blanche Lincoln, the embattled Democratic senator from Arkansas, to head the Senate agricultural committee. Ms Lincoln, who is facing a re-election battle next year, has described the House cap and trade bill as a ""complete non-starter"".

Worse from Mr Obama's point of view is the insistence by a group of 10 Democratic senators, mostly from the Midwest, that they would only support a bill if it included a mechanism to impose ""green tariffs"" on imports from countries that had not embraced domestic carbon-reduction targets. That means China and India.

Such a move would wreck global climate talks before they got under way. Consider this: the US and other western countries are responsible for at least three-quarters of the existing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Both India and China will take a growing share of future emissions but at a fraction of the per capita output of the US.

The average Indian, for example, emits two tonnes of carbon a year, against 20 tonnes for the average American. Given India's level of development, any move to reduce its level of emissions would lead to a rise in poverty.

More than a third of Indians still have no electricity. Having watched the west grow fat on a high-carbon diet, India would now be asked to lose weight.

Mr Obama will make no such demands on India or China in December. But the fact that he is unlikely to be able to persuade the Senate to pass a reasonable cap and trade bill by then will only underscore foreign scepticism over his ability to deliver.

Unlike the Republicans, who are almost unanimous in opposing limits to US emissions, which they depict as a vast tax increase on Americans and a ""jobs killer"", Mr Obama's party is a highly diverse outfit.

Some Democrats, such as Mr Kerry, believe nothing can be accomplished in Copenhagen and beyond unless America shows credible leadership.

Others believe that a vote for cap and trade would be electoral suicide. The cost to the American consumer of the bill passed in the House is estimated at between 22 and 49 cents a day - the price of a postage stamp. That, according to most Republicans and a large minority of Democrats, is too high a price. That argument is not likely to cut much ice in Beijing or New Delhi."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, April 9, 2009 313 mots, p. 6",,Solar-powered cooker wins climate contest,By Emma Saunders,,"A solar-powered cardboard cooker will today be announced the winner of a $75,000 competition to tackle climate change.

The Kyoto Box uses the sun's rays to cook food and boil water. It is targeted at the 3bn people who use firewood. The box costs just $5 (€3.80, £3.40) to make and will be given away free.

Jon Bøhmer, the cooker's inventor, said: ""It's a great feeling. The prize is just what's needed to get this project off the ground. There's only so much I can do on my own.""

The FT Climate Change Challenge sought to find and publicise the most innovative and scalable solution to the effects of climate change.

Sponsored by Hewlett Packard, the technology company, the competition was organised by Forum for the Future, a sustainable development charity, and the Financial Times. Sir Richard Branson and Dr Rajendra Pachauri, a Nobel prize winner, were among the judges, who chose the winner in conjunction with a public vote.

That public support helped the Kyoto Box beat nearly 300 entries to win the competition. The cooker consists of two cardboard boxes, one inside the other, with a clear acrylic cover on top that lets in and traps heat from the sun, and acts as a hob. Black paint, foil and insulation work together to raise the temperature high enough to boil water.

The box is appealing because of its simplicity. ""There are too few people looking at simple research,"" said Mr Bøhmer. ""We need the basic stuff too.""

The box is so easy to make that it can be produced in existing cardboard factories. A more robust version has been developed in corrugated plastic, which costs the same and is ready for testing across 10 countries.

By replacing firewood, the cooker could save up to two tonnes of carbon emissions per family per year. Mr Bøhmer hopes the box will be eligible for carbon credits, hence the name Kyoto box, making a yearly profit of €20-€30 ($26-$40, £18-£27) per stove, which would enable further expansion and easily cover the cost of replacing the cooker after five years.

The stove could also save lives: it can boil 10 litres of water in two hours, destroying the germs that kill millions of children each year."

The world cannot achieve food security without first tackling global warming, the United Nations secretary-general said yesterday, warning that failure at next month's international climate change negotiations would result in a further rise in hunger.

The warning by Ban Ki-Moon at the start of a three-day UN world food summit in Rome came one day after Barack Obama, US president, backed European and UN views that the Copenhagen summit would not produce a legally binding agreement to tackle global warming.

""There cannot be food security without climate security,"" Mr Ban said. ""Today's event is critical,"" he added, referring to the food summit, ""so is Copenhagen"".

His comments signal how leaders are grappling with the need to respond coherently - and simultaneously - to energy, food and climate challenges . ""The three are key for political security and stability,"" said Alexander Muller, assistant director-general at the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Jim Fitzpatrick, UK minister for food, farming and environment, told the Financial Times that food and climate security were ""two sides of the same coin"".

The summit was convened in response to last year's food crisis, which saw record prices for staples, food riots in about 30 countries and pushed the number of chronically hungry people above 1bn for the first time.

The summit's declaration, approved yesterday, reflects that sentiment. ""Climate change poses additional severe risk to food security and the agriculture sector,"" it said. But the declaration was short on targets and timeframes, non-governmental organisations cautioned."
"WORLD NEWS, Monday, December 14, 2009 493 mots, p. 8",,Schwarzenegger urges US to lead climate battle,By Matthew Garrahan in Los Angeles,,"California governor tells cities to actObama's struggle wins sympathy

Arnold Schwarzenegger has urged the White House to emulate California in taking a lead in the fight against climate change, saying ""it would be good for the whole world . . . if the US becomes the power behind the movement"".

The California governor told the Financial Times in an interview that he could sympathise with Barack Obama's struggles in securing backing in Congress for national emissions targets. But Mr Schwarzenegger added ""it would be incredible if America makes a commitment"" that helps secure a global framework on climate change.

""America within 10 years could get 20 per cent of its power needs from renewables,"" he said. ""We have sun, wind - you can even now get oil from algae. There is a green revolution [in California] but the whole US could be leading like that.""

Mr Schwarzenegger, who flies to the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen this week, also called on cities, states and other ""sub-national"" governments, urging them not to wait for a binding deal before taking action to curb emissions.

""International agreements, as critical as they are, will never do enough,"" he said he would tell the conference this week, when he will also meet Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, and Boris Johnson, London's mayor.

""The world's governments alone cannot make the progress that is needed on global climate change . . . they need the cities, the states, the provinces, the regions,"" said Mr Schwarz-enegger. ""California is the eighth largest economy in the world and also America's trendsetter, so what we do has consequences. And we in California do not believe, and we do not behave, as if progress has to wait for Washington or Beijing or Kyoto.""

Angered by the refusal of the Bush administration to take meaningful action against global warming, the Republican Mr Schwarz-enegger became one of the leading advocates for the environmental movement after introducing tough emissions and renewable energy targets in California.

In September, Mr Obama's administration said the US Environmental Protection Agency would adopt a vehicle emissions standard closely modelled on a standard first introduced by Mr Schwarzenegger in California. The state was also involved in the launch of China's first greenhouse gas emissions registry this year.

He told the Financial Times he could ""relate"" to Mr Obama's struggles in securing national emissions targets.

The US president, who is also due in Copenhagen this week, is backing new EPA rules after failing to push legislative targets through Congress. ""[Mr Obama] believes in cap and trade and he believes in reducing greenhouse gases,"" said Mr Schwarzenegger. ""He knew that Congress wouldn't ban anything - he's stuck on healthcare. But I think [going through the EPA] is a wise thing.""

Mr Schwarzenegger hinted that the president would need the support of the US Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the EPA move, to secure a meaningful deal.

The California governor has become an environmental standard bearer for the Republican party, which is split on the merits of curbing emissions. Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election, has attacked cap and trade and questioned any link between man-made emissions and global warming.

Mr Schwarzenegger said: ""You have to ask: what was she trying to accomplish? Is she really interested in this subject or is she interested in her career and in winning the nomination [for president]?""

The governor also addressed leaked ""Climategate"" e-mails that indicated some scientists had been selective in their use of data to back up research on global warming. ""I understand there are mistakes made in the environmental community but I see [the impact of global warming] first hand, with the fires we have in California and the lack of water in the state,"" he said."
"BOOK REVIEW, Thursday, May 28, 2009 586 mots, p. 14",,EU's global warming policy blazes a trail,,,"David Buchan, a former energy editor of the Financial Times and now a senior fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, has produced one of the first books to map out this uncharted territory.

In an admirably concise but comprehensive 214 pages, he covers all of the salient features of the new landscape for European energy.

His book will be indispensable for anyone who wants to understand the progress the industry has made in the past decade, and where it is likely to go in the next.

The framing narrative is the story of how the European Union's politicians and officials tried to forge collective approaches to meet three often conflicting challenges: competitiveness, energy security, and climate change.

Many of the EU's attempts to meet those challenges have failed. Initiatives to agree concerted policies for energy security, or to set common standards for nuclear power, have made little headway.

In its drive to tackle the threat of global warming, however, the progress made by the EU has been impressive. European policies such as the carbon dioxide emissions trading scheme and targets for the use of renewable energy are being taken up all over the world.

If there is ever a global framework for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, a system like the European ETS is likely to form the basis of it.

In many ways, the EU was ideally placed to rise to the challenge of global warming. Unlike the US, its governments have generally shared a view that the problem deserves serious attention, and many European countries have a tradition of pre-emptive action to address environmental concerns.

Even so, climate change has emerged as the central issue in European energy policy only relatively recently. Mr Buchan's story begins with the drive for energy liberalisation that began in 2005, following ineffectual earlier attempts.

That campaign is now just about finished, through the legislative route at least. The attempt to break up the large incumbent energy suppliers that also own their electricity and gas transmission networks - ""ownership unbundling"" as it is known - faced implacable opposition from countries such as Germany and France that were determined to defend national energy champions.

Their resistance meant the attempt to force unbundling through legislation was probably always doomed to failure.

Attempts at collective action on energy security have, if anything, been even less effective. EU member states have been determined to preserve national powers over energy supplies. As Mr Buchan observes: ""Outside suppliers know this, and are only too happy to exploit it.""

Brussels has been reduced to generally fruitless exhortations in its attempts to forge a concerted response to challenges such as Russia's dispute over gas with Ukraine, a key transit country for the EU's imports.

Russia gets a chapter to itself, which it deserves as ""the EU's most important but most difficult energy partner"". Mr Buchan does not give in to the fatalistic view that all the EU can do is take its gas and oil imports on Russia's terms, and trust in the Kremlin's commitment to preserving good relations with its customers.

He argues: ""The EU as a whole can do more to assure its energy security. And it must do more."" In the long run, he says, the best policy for securing energy supplies is the same as for tackling climate change: the ""low-carbon revolution"", to end Europe's dependence on oil, gas and coal.

Energy savings, renewables and nuclear power will all have a role to play. The emissions trading scheme, which rewards low-carbon energy, is at the heart of the strategy, and Mr Buchan concludes that ""for all its early trials and errors"", the ETS works.

The EU has gone for a ""belt and braces"" approach: setting targets for emissions reduction, energy efficiency and the use of renewables which are in danger of conflicting. But Mr Buchan concludes that the multiple targets and subsidies are needed to ensure success. ""In normal peacetime, policy failure is not catastrophic,"" he writes. ""But climate change is more like war: you don't have time to return to the drawing board.""

"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, November 12, 2009 381 mots, p. 4",,Hong Kong and Singapore warned over global warming,By Kevin Brown in Singapore,,"WWF highlights serious flood riskCosts from typhoon damage to soar

Hong Kong and Singapore, Asia's two biggest international financial centres, are at serious risk of disastrous flooding and other catastrophes caused by global warming, according to a report published today.

The report, produced by WWF, the environmental pressure group, puts the two financial hubs in the top 10 cities threatened by climate change in Asia, the region widely believed to be most vulnerable to rising global temperatures.

It warns that Hong Kong is in danger from higher sea levels, which are likely to rise by 40cm-60cm in China's Pearl River delta by 2050, increasing the area of coastline that is vulnerable to flooding by up to six times.

Costs imposed by typhoons are also likely to rise dramatically, the report says, noting that 14 of the 21 extreme storm surges between 1950 and 2004 occurred after 1986.

The number of nights when Hong Kong temperatures rise above 28°C has risen almost fourfold since the 1960s, while the number of winter nights when the temperature falls below 12°C is predicted to fall from an average of 21 to zero within 50 years.

For Singapore, the report says, the sea level is forecast to rise by 60cm by the end of the century, eroding coastal protection and decreasing the shoreline of the city state, making it more vulnerable to storm surges and flooding.

The report says climate change could also increase the prevalence of dengue fever. The number of cases has been rising in periodic outbreaks and the last significant peak, in 2007, saw the third highest number of outbreaks ever.

Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, heads the list of the most vulnerable cities, mainly because of its position in a big river delta already subject to periodic flooding, its low average height above sea level and its poverty, which makes protection and adaptation more difficult.

Other cities at risk include Jakarta and Manila, which rank equal second, Calcutta and Phnom Penh, which are equal third, Ho Chi Minh and Shanghai, equal fourth, Bangkok, fifth, and Kuala Lumpur, which ties with Hong Kong and Singapore for sixth place.

The report calls on developed countries to agree to shoulder the bulk of the costs required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to finance an adaptation fund to pay for changes required in developing countries, and to provide recompense for losses and damage caused by climate-related catastrophes.

However, the report also says that vulnerable cities and national governments should take action themselves, including better management of coastal habitats and ecosystems.

The report is timed to influence the 21 heads of government attending this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Singapore, ahead of the global climate change summit in Copenhagen next month.

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, March 23, 2009 386 mots, p. 6",,Money proves stumbling block in global warming battle,By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels,,"At the end of their two-day summit in Brussels last week, European leaders pledged to pay a ""fair share"" to developing nations to help them fight global warming and adapt to its consequences. Yet they failed to deliver the one thing that environmentalists most desired: money.

The omission of a specific contribution, as well as unresolved questions about how the EU would pay for it, has become the latest stumbling block along the path to a global climate deal that world leaders will try to negotiate at Copenhagen in December. ""The risk is that with the delay, the negotiations will not make significant pro-gress. The developing nations are only willing to take further steps when there is money on the table,"" said Joris den Blanken, a policy analyst at Greenpeace.

The money issue, Mr den Blanken said, had overshadowed other elements of the meeting's final communiqué that environmentalists should applaud - including a commitment to create a global carbon trading market.

The EU and other wealthy nations committed to providing financing to developing nations at a United Nations summit in Bali in 2007. The money would be used to invest in new technology to reduce emissions, as well as to improve seawalls and other infrastructure to prepare for the effects of a warmer planet.

In a draft paper prepared this year, the European Commission estimated that the EU could contribute some €30bn a year, beginning in 2020.

But that figure was deleted from the final communiqué, and the commission instead concluded that it was incumbent on developing nations to first detail the level of emissions cuts they were prepared to make.

Member states have not yet agreed on the size of their contribution - let alone how to finance it - either through a market-based system or emissions taxes or some combination. Yet most agree that it would be foolish for the EU to reveal its hand first in what is likely to be a complex global negotiation with the US, India, China and Brazil.

""It is important that the United States, Japan and other major contributors signal what will be their position,"" said José Manuel Barroso, the Commission president.

Nonetheless, the EU will be on the spot again in June, after heads of state promised that they would discuss the matter in greater detail at their next council meeting.

If they are not able to table an offer then, environmental groups fear the process could drag dangerously close to Copenhagen because of the disruption of the June European elections and then the summer holidays.

Rebecca Harms, the Green party MEP, said the EU was squandering the credibility it had built up after closing a landmark climate deal in December to reduce emissions 20 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.

""The Europeans, in my view, have become the new hesitant and shy partner in the international climate negotiations,"" Ms Harms said."
"COMMENT, Wednesday, December 23, 2009 867 mots, p. 11",,We should change tack on climate after Copenhagen,Bjørn Lomborg,,"After 12 days of protests, posturing and seemingly endless palaver, the elephantine gath ering that was the Copen-hagen climate summit has laboured mightily and brought forth . . . a mouse. As vague as it is toothless, the accord on curbing greenhouse gas emissions that emerged from the Bella Centre this weekend imposes no real obligations, sets no binding emissions targets and requires no specific actions by anyone.

So should we be disappointed? Well, actually, no. It is not that man-made global warming isn't real or that we don't need to take meaningful action to combat it. It is and we do.

Nonetheless, the dismal outcome of the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference should make us hopeful. Why? Because its failure may be just the wake-up call the world has needed - the splash of cold water that may finally get us to face the facts about what works and what does not work to cure climate change.

For 17 years now, ever since the Rio ""Earth Summit"" back in 1992, the effort to combat global warming has been dominated by a single idea - the notion that the only solution is to drastically cut carbon emissions. Anyone incautious enough to suggest that there might be more effective ways of controlling climate change, or that it is simply not politically or economically feasible to try to force a world that gets 80 per cent of its energy from carbon-emitting fossil fuels to suddenly change its ways, was dismissed as a crackpot or, worse, a secret global-warming denier. The fact that the Rio-Kyoto-Copenhagen approach to global warming was clearly getting us nowhere was apparently one of those inconvenient truths that people prefer to ignore.

Well, call me a cock-eyed optimist, but Copenhagen's failure strikes me as being too abject to ignore. For all of President Barack Obama's talk of an ""unprecedented breakthrough"", all the world leaders really did was try to paper over their differences with a three-page communiqué that basically asks us to cross our fingers and hope for the best. They would have done better to have acknowledged their impotence and gone home empty-handed. Never has the fundamental bankruptcy of the carbon-cutting strategy seemed more obvious.

So I am hopeful that political leaders may finally be ready to face the truth about global warming - namely, that if we are serious about wanting to solve it, we need to adopt a new approach. Promising to cut carbon emissions may make us feel virtuous, but that is all it does. If we actually want to cool down the planet, we need policies that are technologically smarter, politically more feasible and economically more efficient.

The stark lesson of Copenhagen is that the world is neither willing nor able to go cold turkey when it comes to ending its addiction to fossil fuels. The problem, particularly for China, India, and the rest of the developing world, is that there simply are not any affordable alternatives.

Keep in mind that global energy demand is expected to double by 2050. What this means is that if we want to reduce (if not actually eliminate) our use of fossil fuels without totally crippling the world economy, we are going to have to increase our reliance on green energy technologies by several orders of magnitude.

In a paper for the Copenhagen Consensus Centre in July 2009, Isabel Galiana and Professor Chris Green of McGill University examined the state of non-carbon based energy today - including nuclear, wind, solar and geothermal energy - and came to some disconcerting conclusions. Based on present rates of progress, they found that, taken together, alternative energy sources could, if hugely scaled up, get us less than halfway towards a path of stable carbon emissions by 2050, and only a fraction of the way towards stabilisation by 2100. The technology will simply not be ready in terms of scalability or stability. In many cases, the most basic research and development is still required. We are not even close to getting the needed technological revolution started.

The Copenhagen accord attempts to deal with this reality by offering a vague promise that developed nations will eventually contribute as much as $100bn a year to help poor countries cope with climate change. If this money were to be spent on helping developing countries adapt to climate change, the pledge might make sense, since it would be likely to make a real and immediate difference in people's quality of life. But that is not where the money is supposed to go. The text of the agreement specifies that most if not all of the funds are to be spent ""in the context of meaningful mitigation."" In other words, the money would be used to subsidise carbon cuts, a pointless exercise that would do nothing to ameliorate current miseries - and at best might reduce temperatures slightly a century from now.

But what if we put these funds to better use? What if, instead of condemning billions of people around the world to continued poverty by trying to make carbon-emitting fuels more expensive, we devoted ourselves to making green energy cheaper? As solutions go, it is quicker, more efficient and far less painful.

Right now, solar panels cost so much that only well-heeled, well-meaning westerners can afford to install them. But if we could make them or other green energy technologies cheaper than fossil fuels over the next 20 to 40 years - and there is no reason to think that we cannot - we would not have to force (or subsidise) anyone to stop burning carbon-emitting fuels. Everyone, including the Chinese and the Indians, would shift to the cheaper and cleaner alternatives - solving global warming.

So how do we get to this happy place? We need to increase spending on green-energy R&D by a factor of 50. For 0.2 per cent of global gross domestic product, or $100bn a year, we could bring about the technological breakthroughs it will take to make green energy cheaper and fuel our carbon-free future. For both developed and developing world governments, it would be a lot more politically palat-able than carbon cuts.

The millions of concerned people around the world who put their hopes in Copenhagen may have been bitterly disappointed by the paltry outcome. But the summit's failure could be a blessing in disguise. For the last 17 years, we have been putting the cart before the horse, pretending we could cut carbon emissions now and solve the technology problem later. Perhaps now, as they limp home from Copenhagen, our leaders will recognise the deep flaws in their current approach and chart a smarter course.

"G8 SUMMIT, Thursday, July 9, 2009 298 mots, p. 3",,China's departure puts cloud over climate change deal,"By Fiona Harvey in London, Guy Dinmore in L'Aquila and George Parker in Rome",,"The early departure of Hu Jintao, president of China, from the Group of Eight summit yesterday dealt a serious blow to the prospects of a strong agreement on climate change.

Leaders of 16 of the world's biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries are meeting today at the request of Barack Obama, US president.

He called the meeting, called the Major Economies Forum, which he is co-chairing with Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, in order to break the deadlock in climate change talks, aimed at producing a successor to the Kyoto protocol at a conference in Copenhagen in December.

Yesterday, the G8 produced a communiqué resolving to try to hold global temperature rises to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety.

This was the first time such a target has been formally adopted in a leading international forum.

However, in order to curb temperature rises to this extent, scientists calculate that global emissions must be at least halved by 2050. A target to this effect was included in the draft communiqué, but it had to be dropped after China - the world's biggest emitter - failed to agree to it.

The absence of Mr Hu will make further progress difficult. One of the aims of the MEF was to bring leaders of the main emitting countries together for the first time to discuss climate change, so that they could allow their environment ministers - who attend the UN negotiations - greater latitude in making a deal. But China was reluctant to sign up to the 2050 target without first gaining key concessions.

Anantha Guruswamy, Greenpeace programme director, said China and India had refused to sign up because the G8 club of rich nations had not shown leadership by putting forward proposals for financing emissions cuts and measures to adapt to climate change in poor countries. ""It is up to Obama to show leadership on this,"" Mr Guruswamy said.

""There is a real danger the G8 text will go backwards as a result of this.""

Beijing and Delhi also want rich countries to agree far higher targets on cutting emissions by 2020 than any have yet come up with.

The 16 countries in the MEF produce 80 per cent of the world's carbon emissions. The European Union and Denmark, as host of the Copenhagen conference, are also invited to its meetings."
"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION, Saturday, December 19, 2009 401 mots, p. 1",,Climate 'deal' confusion,"By Fiona Harvey, Ed Crooks and Andrew Ward in Copenhagen",,"Disarray as leaders differ over outcomePoor nations slam 'low level of ambition'

The United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen ended in apparent disarray last night with some world leaders hailing a ""meaningful agreement"", while others said no deal had been struck.

The US, China, Brazil, India and South Africa claimed, after a four-hour meeting, to have secured a partial pact. But their optimism was quickly undermined by a string of more pessimistic assessments.

Barack Obama, US president, acknowledged that the deal was ""not sufficient to combat the threat of climate change but [was] an important first step"" on cutting greenhouse gases.

""We have made a meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough. For the first time in history, all of the major economies have come together to take action [on global warming],"" he said after a meeting with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Jacob Zuma, South African president.

No senior UN officials were available to comment on Mr Obama's announcement.

Mr Obama said further talks were needed to secure a formal treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto accord. ""What we have achieved in Copenhagen will not be the end but the beginning of a new era of international action,"" he said. ""This is going to be hard.""

The agreement contained a commitment to try to hold global warming to no more than 2°C, a level scientists have suggested is probably the limit of safety, beyond which climate change could become catastrophic and irreversible.

Rich countries have also included commitments to cut their emissions and developing countries to curb the growth of theirs. There were also promises to transfer money from rich to poor countries, to help them tackle climate change.

But there was confusion as some countries appeared to be less optimistic than Mr Obama. While he was leaving for the airport, European officials were denying a deal. ""If there had been a deal, the prime minister [of Sweden] and the president [of the Commission] would have been here. They still have not formalised the deal,"" said Roberta Alenius, spokeswoman for the EU presidency.

Some poorer countries made clear support was far from unanimous. Lumumba Di-Aping, Sudanese head of the G77 group of developing countries, said the US-backed plan represented the ""lowest level of ambition"" and would be devastating for the world's poor. ""This is an idea not a deal,"" he said.

His remarks raised doubts over whether a deal brokered by a small group of big industrialised and emerging economies would win the support needed to turn it into a binding treaty.

One key sticking point was China's refusal to allow monitoring of its emissions. But in a last-minute compromise, Beijing and Washington agreed to a process of ""international consultation and analysis"".

Brazilian representatives said negotiators would continue their work into next year in the hope of having a legally binding document that can be signed by the end of 2010.

"COMMENT, Friday, December 4, 2009 555 mots, p. 9",,Trade could hold the key to a climate agreement,By Bård Harstad,,"Our leaders' recent confession that a legally binding climate agreement is not feasible this year may be no bad thing. The hope is that the new goal for December - to reach a broader ""political agreement"" - will establish a better foundation for a future climate deal than we currently have.

This is important, since a climate agreement currently faces three significant obstacles. To overcome these, there might be no solution other than to link any deal to new and existing trade agreements.

The first challenge is to encourage participation in a climate agreement. The problem is that while participating countries bear the costs of reducing their own emissions, countries that chose to opt out can nevertheless benefit from these reductions and, in addition, from a lower fossil fuel price when the participating countries reduce their demand.

The Kyoto Protocol failed to motivate the US, as well as big developing countries, to take part. But Russia ratified Kyoto after the European Union promised to support its admission to the World Trade Organisation. Clearly, some carrot is needed to motivate participation, and being a favoured trading partner is one of the few powerful incentives that can realistically be offered in international politics. Alternatives such as conditional development aid might be held out to the poorest, but explicit transfers to other countries would be politically unacceptable.

The second obstacle is compliance. Currently, few countries are on track to fulfil their obligations under Kyoto. The explanation is simple: the consequences of not complying are minor. While Kyoto requires non-compliers to repay their carbon debt in the next commitment period at 30 per cent interest, this penalty merely delays the problem and reduces the motivation to then comply.

Specifying explicit fines or fees for non-compliance, on the other hand, cannot be credible in an international agreement when they are not even credible in a more formal setting such as the EU. After violating the Maastricht Treaty in 2003, for example, Germany and France easily reneged and no fines were paid.

Trade agreements, however, are better enforced since it is in the victim's interest to increase its barriers and reduce competition from the offender. Trade restrictions such as border taxes might also be the only credible sanction for climate treaties.

A third difficulty is stimulating the development of new technologies. Investing in solar technology, for example, must be sufficiently rewarded. For the private sector, this requires a large market and that intellectual property rights are protected. But for the public sector, such investments are still not worthwhile if better technology might become a liability when negotiating the allocation of quotas in the future. Denmark, a technology leader in wind power, has already felt the pressure to bear a larger burden of the EU's obligations: once its investments were sunk, reducing emissions became inexpensive and this could be exploited by the other negotiators.

To prevent investing countries from being penalised in this way, quotas should be based on pre-specified formulas and not on whether a country happens to be at the technology frontier. Rigid formulas preclude exempting ill-prepared countries, however, and these may prefer to opt out unless participation is sufficiently rewarded. Being a favoured trading partner might be the crucial reward.

Implementing such a linkage is possible. The Montreal Protocol, successfully protecting the ozone layer, is already restricting trade with non-participants and non-compliers, although only in the substances controlled by the treaty. To repeat this success and overcome the obstacles for a climate agreement, signatories should become favoured trading partners while non-compliance should trigger a temporary denial of this status. Disputes can be solved by expanding the mandate of the WTO's dispute settlement body or another mediator.

With the Doha Development Round negotiations stalled, a linkage to climate may even be a blessing for trade. There is a unique opportunity to link the two negotiations and achieve progress in both. That should be the goal for world leaders when they show up in Copenhagen.

Even if China and other developing countries are reluctant to make commitments at December's UN climate change conference in Copenhagen, ""President Obama has made it clear that the US should act first,"" Mr Chu said. ""Using China as a reason not to act is no longer an option.""

Mr Chu, who won the Nobel Physics Prize in 1997, was speaking to journalists after arriving in London for a meeting to discuss climate change with more than 20 fellow Nobel laureates and dozens of other experts.

The London meeting - hosted by the Prince of Wales and Royal Society, and organised by Cambridge University and Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research - is expected to close tomorrow with a strong declaration of the need for action against global warming, ahead of the Copenhagen conference.

Although the US would not use China as an excuse for inaction, Mr Chu said he was optimistic the Chinese would act to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas most responsible for global warming.

""China's leadership knows well what the consequences of climate change will be for their country,"" he said.

Mr Chu is the son of Chinese immigrants to the US.

The energy secretary expressed confidence in the ability of the US to deliver ""more than we have promised"" in the fight against climate change.

""I have great faith in the innovation machinery of the US,"" he said, which would be mobilised by means of billions of dollars of federal spending in President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package.

""There is tremendous intellectual horsepower in the US, which is just beginning to come alive"" on the issues of climate change, Mr Chu added. His remarks were made as a group of more than 500 business leaders worldwide called on governments to agree a strong global treaty on climate change to replace the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012. They urged governments to heed scientific advice and to set the target for emissions cuts at 28 per cent compared with business -as-usual levels by 2020.

Incentives for ""a dramatic increase in financing low emissions technologies"" and to encourage the deployment of existing low-carbon technologies should also be provided, they said. The business group was brought together by the Copenhagen Climate Council, a body set up to foster progress in negotiations for a new treaty to fight climate change which will culminate in a conference in December."
"WORLD NEWS, Wednesday, December 23, 2009 372 mots, p. 4",,EU reflects on hard truth after climate 'disaster',By Joshua Chaffin in Brussels,,"Europe's environment ministers added to the chorus of gloom over the outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit yesterday as they confronted the broader question of how the bloc could gain influence over a negotiation dominated by China and the US.

Andreas Carlgren, environment minister of Sweden, which holds the rotating European Union presidency, called the Copenhagen accord ""a disaster"" and ""a great failure"" as yesterday's EU meeting began.

""It was obvious that ministers broadly expressed their disappointment with the results of Copenhagen, which didn't at all meet the expectations or ambitions of the European Union,"" Mr Carlgren added after lunch with counterparts from the EU's 27 member states.

One immediate target of criticism was the unwieldy United Nations negotiating process, which several nations blamed for Copenhagen's failure. EU states have asked the European Commission to draw up recommendations to streamline the process, and to limit obstructionist tactics. They are expected to discuss them at a meeting in Seville on January 15-17.

Mr Carlgren reiterated the EU's commitment to reaching an ambitious, legally binding agreement. The pressure, he said, was now on the US after the public pleas made in Copenhagen by Barack Obama, the US president.

But members were grasping for answers on how to proceed after Copenhagen revealed a gap between the EU's ambitions to lead the fight against global warming and its limited clout on the world stage. The EU had believed its stature as the first bloc to pass binding emissions reductions targets and its leadership on climate finance for developing countries would give it a prime seat at the table. Yet it was not even invited to a final meeting at which leading developed countries struck the decisive deal with the US.

""We've been taught some lessons about the realities of the so-called multi-polar world,"" Carl Bildt, Sweden's foreign minister, told the Financial Times. ""These lessons will have to be taken into account when we go for a more comprehensive global agreement.""

Diplomats acknowledged that the EU's strategy of offering to deepen its emissions cuts - from 20 per cent below 1990 levels to 30 per cent - if other nations showed comparable effort had failed to provide leverage over the US or China.

In the wake of Copenhagen, the 30 per cent pledge has faced renewed attacks from European business, which fears being left at a competitive disadvantage.

Mr Carlgren said he expected rising calls for the EU to adopt a tougher line by threatening to impose carbon border taxes against countries unwilling to sign up to an ambitious agreement. But he warned that such a move risked greater ""fragmentation"" of the global community, while Germany and others opposed it as it would hurt exporters.

""This is a time for reflection,"" Mr Carlgren said."
"FT MAGAZINE, Saturday, November 28, 2009 482 mots, p. 15",,Political Ill Wind Blows A Hole In The Climate Change Debate,,,"My sunny disposition is wavering as the Copenhagen summit on climate change approaches. I believe that the governments of the world have taken the wrong approach to the problem - and if they had taken a different tack 12 years ago in Kyoto, we would be much closer to dealing credibly with climate change.

The complexities are dizzying, so it may help to be reductive for a moment. The governments of the world are focusing on reducing the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted, through cap-and-trade programmes; they should instead be focusing on increasing the price polluters must pay for emissions. The incentives provided by the two approaches are similar. Both will lead to a higher carbon price and lower emissions, and both could be tweaked over time to produce much the same trajectory of lower emissions. Either system would work well from an economic perspective.

Yet politically speaking, cap-and-trade - where an agreed cap on the level of pollution permitted in a region is set, within which companies can trade those permits between themselves so long as the cap is not exceeded - has long been regarded as the easier sell. I am not convinced it deserves that reputation. There are already several technically successful cap-and-trade schemes, but none requiring anything like the political compromises now necessary. The Kyoto protocol, a quantity-based agreement on emissions, effectively died in the US long before George W. Bush became president, took eight years to come into force and could not meaningfully accommodate China, India, Indonesia or Brazil. This is hardly auspicious.

The trouble with cap-and-trade is that countries must agree how to divide the allocation of permits. This has proved troublesome when emissions targets were assigned relative to a 1990 baseline. Rapid growth in the US economy suddenly made its allocation look stingy, while the Russian allocation looked absurdly lax following the economy's collapse in the early 1990s. It should not have been a surprise that some economies would grow faster or slower than predicted.

Gabrielle Walker and Sir David King, in their otherwise superb book on climate change, The Hot Topic, assert the conventional wisdom that cap-and-trade is politically more achievable. This statement is somewhat undermined as they start to describe the political prerequisites for such a deal, which include agreement on a global emissions cap (a hugely contentious question) and the distribution of emissions rights among countries.

There is a form of carbon tax that would be far simpler - and would not, contrary to Walker and King's implication, be levied by the World Bank. G20 members would agree to impose a broad-based carbon tax on their own economies. The tax would be levied by national governments and spent as they saw fit. Precise harmonisation would be unnecessary. The taxes would simply need to be broadly in line, with a commitment to keep them that way.

Cameron Hepburn, co-editor of The Economics and Politics of Climate Change, points out that quantity regulation puts knotty issues of distribution and compensation at the heart of the international negotiations. Harmonised carbon taxes put these questions to one side. They could be - and would have to be - discussed separately. Perhaps a carbon tax is the wrong approach, and it is all for the best that the whole sorry mess will be on the table at Copenhagen. That is the path the world's governments have chosen. I sincerely hope that they are right.

"FT REPORT - UNDERSTANDING ENERGY POLICY, Wednesday, December 2, 2009 840 mots, p. 9",,Climate of unrest,,,"When Barack Obama too k office as US president in January, he thought he had a double-whammy solution for two of his most pressing challenges: tackling the economic crisis and reducing his country’s greenhouse gas emissions. With his economic stimulus package, Obama sought to spur investment in green technology, simultaneously creating jobs and promoting cleaner energy.

But he has discovered that turning plans into policy is no easy task, even with Democratic majorities in both houses of US Congress.

“The closer we get to this new energy future, the harder the opposition is going to fight,” Obama said in Florida last month, announcing that $3.4bn of the $789bn economic stimulus package would be allocated to a “smart grid” project to modernise the US’s electricity network.

“It’s a debate between looking backwards and looking forward; between those who are ready to seize the future and those who are afraid of the future,” Obama said, adding that the drive to create a green economy would require “an all-handson- deck approach” similar to the mobilisation that preceded the second world war.

However, Obama’s opponents are standing in the way. His Recovery Act includes $80bn for developing new battery technologies for hybrid vehicles, modernising the electricity grid, improving energy efficiency and encouraging the use of renewable energy from the likes of solar panels.

But plans for legislation to curb emissions and encourage low carbon technology have been bogged down in Congress, meaning the president is likely to arrive at the UN’s Copenhagen climate change conference in December empty-handed.

“There is no way the House [of Representatives] and the Senate can agree on legislation for the president to sign before Copenhagen,” says Patrick Michaels, a climate change specialist at the Cato Institute, a free-market think-tank. “Just having a bill progressing through the Senate is not enough – he can’t assure the Copenhagen conference that the bill will be passed.” The House has narrowly passed a broad climate change bill that cuts emissions by 17 per cent from 2005 levels by 2020. But the Senate version of the bill, which calls for a 20 per cent reduction by 2020, has been hamstrung by Republican resistance, exacerbated by reluctance from Democratic senators from rural and industrial states, and by divisions within the business community.

Lisa Murkowski, a Republican senator from Alaska and a member of the committee on energy and natural resources, believes Congress should not pass climate change legislation for legislation’s sake. “We haven’t gotten anything out there that, in my opinion, meaningfully reduces our level of emissions while at the same time making sure that we haven’t kicked the economy in the head,” she told a recent forum.

While Republicans criticise the cap-and-trade system – which allows companies to trade emissions permits – for being too burdensome on business, some environmentalists think the Obama administration is using the wrong tools. “The capand- trade legislation is not legislation that will reduce our greenhouse gases below business-asusual levels for the next 20 years,” says Michael Shellenberger, president of the Breakthrough Institute, a think-tank. “The content of the climate bills is far worse than anyone imagined.” Nevertheless, the Senate environment committee voted to send forward its version of the bill without any Republicans present last month. On the Senate floor, Republicans are likely to find allies in Democratic lawmakers from states such as Montana, Nebraska and Arkansas, who will have difficulty supporting legislation that imposes new rules – and costs – on their constituents.

Senator aides say it is now unlikely any bill will be passed this year, creating new problems.

Lawmakers seeking re-election in mid-term elections will swing into campaign mode next year, and will shy away from any unpopular measures.

Delays could be costly. Steven Chu, US energy secretary, recently warned that Japan and China were pressing ahead with clean energy technologies.

To increase the sense of urgency on Capitol Hill, the Obama administration has suggested it will use regulation – through the Environmental Protection Agency – to reach its goals if Congress fails to send legislation to the president to sign.

The best chance of legislating a new energy policy now lies with three senators: John Kerry, a Democrat from Massachusetts; Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina; and Joe Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut.

They are trying to forge a bipartisan consensus and get the 60 votes needed to pass the bill into law. The trio has banded together to build a compromise package to “broaden the base of support” for a Senate climate bill, which the group hopes to unveil before the Copenhagen meeting next week.

“Our goal is to create a vision that not only will help this planet … but will create millions of new jobs for Americans, and help us become energy independent to make us safer,” Graham said recently. “I think most Americans – Republicans, independents or Democrats – really feel uncomfortable with the fact that our nation sends a billion dollars a day overseas to buy foreign oil from some countries who don’t like us very much.” The three senators’ proposal is expected to incorporate measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions, as well as exploring nuclear power generation and encourage domestic oil and gas exploration.

With Copenhagen approaching so quickly, Kerry said recently that simply getting a “binding and real political agreement … that will embrace finance mechanisms, adaptation, the [emissions] targeting levels” would be a “huge success”.

Analysts say Obama will not be able to sign up to an international treaty without a clear mandate from Congress, and there has been some criticism that his administration is not working hard enough to get legislation passed before Copenhagen.

Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, rejects any such suggestion. “We are closer to an energy and climate bill becoming law than we ever have,” Gibbs said recently. “The notion that one country stands in the way of addressing climate change would be to forget countries like China, India, Brazil, and others that have to also be brought along in this process.”"
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, May 14, 2009 273 mots, p. 8",,Scientists fear for seas at climate talks,By John Aglionby in Manado,,"Climate change negotiations will not take proper account of the devastating impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the seas, hundreds of scientists attending the World Ocean Conference in Indonesia warned yesterday.

The meeting aims to influence the crucial United Nations climate change talks scheduled to take place in Copenhagen in December. But the latest draft declaration from the ocean conference, seen by the Financial Times, has deleted the recommendation in an earlier version that the international negotiators ""consider the ocean dimension in the post 2012 [climate change] framework"".

""Everyone's waiting for the new US administration to elaborate its position before they commit to anything,"" said one participant.

Water temperatures, sea levels, acidity and coral bleaching are rising so fast that hundreds of millions of people will be at risk within decades unless drastic action is taken promptly, scientists at the first global conference on oceans and climate change concluded.

Cuts in carbon dioxide emissions planned for 2050 should either be made deeper or brought forward.Proposals on the agenda for Copenhagen are for an 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050 for developed countries and a halving for developing countries.

But politicians attending the conference, which is hoping to issue a declaration today to influence the Copenhagen negotiations, do not appear to have the same sense of urgency as the scientists. ""It means it's even more urgent for scientists working on oceans to increase their lobbying,"" said Meg Caldwell, an ocean specialist at Stanford University in the US. She launched a report yesterday by the Centre for Ocean Solutions, synthesising the findings of 3,400 studies of the Pacific.

Endorsed by 450 ocean scientists, it concludes: ""The rates of current environmental change far outpace anything seen in human history and are likely to accelerate in the near future. Many areas of the Pacific Ocean may become uninhabitable [within decades].""

Nancy Knowlton, a marine science professor in the US, said: ""Coral reefs will cease to exist as physical structures by 2100, perhaps 2050."""
"COMMENT & ANALYSIS, Saturday, December 12, 2009 747 mots, p. 9",,"Climate change, the great leveller",By Christopher Caldwell,,"The Copenhagen summit on climate change is starting to resemble the August 1928 meeting in Paris at which more than a dozen nations, including Britain, France, Germany, Japan and the US, signed a treaty to abolish war. A real problem, a commitment to solving it and a large dose of arrogance convinced the world - 65 countries, eventually - to sign the Kellogg-Briand pact, named after the American and French ministers who devised it. But the reality of perpetual peace proved harder to advance than the ideal of it.

The leak of a 13-page Danish government document that looked like a draft for a final agreement dominated the first week of meetings in Copenhagen, particularly after Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, the Sudanese negotiator for the Group of 77 developing countries, wept at a meeting of African politicians. He complained that the leaked draft was a ""suicide pact"". It does have its drawbacks. It is confusing to non-specialists, alluding to ""robust MRV"" (measurement, reporting and verification), the ""Bali building blocks"" (UN climate guidelines negotiated in 2007) and ICAO (the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which would devise carbon fees). The paper shows signs of having been negotiated with feminist non-government organisations. It bizarrely invokes ""gender equality"" in a climate context. But none of that is sufficient to explain Mr Di-Aping's outburst, or the sense that it imperilled an agreement. It was only a draft, after all. Anyone who did not like it could write his own. An official draft is now out.

What made the argument over the leak so contentious was that it was about money. Mr Di-Aping's complaint was the miserliness, as he saw it, of the climate aid that the draft envisioned developed countries sending to poor ones: $10bn (€6.8bn, £6.1bn) a year over the next three years was, as Mr Di-Aping put it, ""not enough to buy us coffins"". He compared it with the trillion he estimated the west had paid to bail out its banks. More important, it was far below the $67bn per year that African leaders, meeting last summer, decided would be a reasonable amount for the west to pay them in environment compensation. In short, many of the developing world's representatives have come to Copenhagen seeking reparations.

Just as the e-mails stolen from the University of East Anglia last month cast doubt on the scientific good faith of Copenhagen's proponents, the row over the Danish draft casts doubt on their political good faith. Western publics have come to understand that combating climate change will cost money. But why does that imply a global redistribution of wealth?

There are two ways to answer that. One is in terms of need. Africa is warmer and drier than most continents, and more dependent on agriculture. It may be that fluctuations in the global climate will hit Africa harder. These are technical points. They are not Mr Di-Aping's subject.

The other angle is to think in terms of western culpability. This is mostly a political matter. The call for reparations has parallels with American legal activism. Particularly since the rise of the critical legal studies movement in the 1980s, there have been calls for ""environmental reparations"" and ""environmental justice"" in the US, too. But in those cases the environment is a secondary consideration. Setting benchmarks for social reform is what comes first. Polluted and contaminated neighbourhoods cry out for reparations not on grounds of public health but on grounds of remedying racism and inequality.

Morally based reparations are relatively new to international relations. They tend to be paid after wars, from losers to winners, most onerously - and notoriously - from Germany to its former foes after the first world war. The winner looks at the payments as morally justified, of course, but the loser will have a hard time distinguishing between reparations and plunder. No climate change agreement built on settling the west's supposed ""debt"" to the rest of the world will have democratic legitimacy in the US.

There is a basic problem that besets all schemes of group reparation - those who inflicted and suffered the harm are often dead. Blameless people pay. Unharmed people collect. They become rentiers of injustice. The problem is extreme when it comes to climate change in a global economy. China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide and one of its fastest growing, is a member of the same developing-nations group represented by Mr Di-Aping. In the context of emitting greenhouse gases, China is not ""developing"" - it is at the top of the league table. It is more perpetrator than victim. The developed countries, meanwhile, have mostly passed their peak of carbon-dioxide emissions, and are putting out less every year.

But the entire concept of victims and perpetrators breaks down when it comes to global warming. Economies collude in pollution. It is less accurate to say that China has a large carbon footprint than to say that China is the place where the world's carbon footprint is located. The gases its factories emit are required to manufacture the stuff that western consumers think they need. China's pollution makes the US and Europe cleaner than they would be if they did that manufacturing themselves. Similarly, US pollution, the result more of consumption than production, enriches the exporting countries of Europe and Asia. It may provide the margin required to make the greening of those economies acceptable in the first place. Global warming is not a bilateral problem. It is a global problem. The Danish leak made clear that tackling it will mean big losses not just of western wealth but of western sovereignty."
"ROAD TO COPENHAGEN, Wednesday, September 23, 2009 576 mots, p. 12",,Horse trading on climate treaty has yet to pay dividends,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Any hope that the conference on climate change in Copenhagen this December would produce a new treaty in the mould of the 1997 Kyoto protocol has long faded, even among its strongest proponents.

The question is, in the absence of a complete treaty, what constitutes a successful outcome at the conference - and whether the prospects for a good deal are so dim that parties should resign themselves to continuing negotiations into next year.

For the United Nations, four key elements must be included: mid-term and long-term targets for cutting emissions; developing countries, which will not have mid-term emissions-cutting targets, committing to certain actions to curb their emissions' growth; financing from developed to developing nations to help them cut emissions and adapt to climate change; and mechanisms to ensure finance flows, such as a cap-and-trade system.

With fewer than 80 days to go, there is agreement on none of these.

Top of the list of prerequisites for success is setting targets for emissions reduction, by 2020 and by 2050. Scientific advice is for developed countries to cut emissions by 25-40 per cent compared with 1990 levels. Europe and Japan have both agreed cuts broadly on this level - the European Union has agreed to raise its promise of 20 per cent cuts to 30 per cent if other countries fell in line.

But the US will not. Its emissions rose by about 16 per cent from 1990 to 2005 and the most the White House thinks feasible is a cut of 17 per cent on current levels.

While this may look feeble compared with the EU's 20 per cent pledge, in fact the amount of effort required to reach this level is about equal to that required of the EU from current emissions levels.

The UN also wants all countries to set a global target of halving emissions by 2050. Developing countries will not be asked to take on absolute cuts, but to ensure their emissions increase at a slower rate than before - in the jargon, to ""deviate from business as usual"".

This, too, has proved more contentious than the UN hoped. China and India are reluctant to agree a global target because they fear it will be used later to strong-arm them into absolute cuts.

Rich nations would also like to see emerging economies set a target date for a peak of emissions. Again, China and India have strongly resisted this.

Financing from the rich to the poor world will be tricky to resolve. Developing countries and non-government groups have suggested finance flows must reach $150bn (£92bn) a year. Rich countries will not agree such sums.

The EU has been first to come forward, with financing of €2bn-€15bn a year. The US has indicated that the cap-and-trade bill in the Senate would provide for similar funding through the purchase of carbon offsets from developing countries.

Most countries recognise that a financing mechanism - such as a cap-and-trade system - is needed, as most of the money must come from the private sector.

Even on lesser issues, argument still rages. On forestry the vexed question of how to compensate developing nations such as Brazil and Indonesia for keeping their forests intact has not been resolved.

But the UN and leading governments insist a strong deal is still possible. Yvo de Boer, UN climate change chief, points to progress in moves by China and India this week. ""We are too close to an agreement now to fail at the last gate,"" he said.

But leading EU countries have begun to talk of a ""political declaration"" rather than a full agreement leading to a treaty.

Connie Hedegaard, the Danish environment minister who will host the talks, told the Financial Times: ""What I see at Copenhagen is that we define the politics, what we want, and then some experts have to decide exactly how that comes into being.""

Jennifer Morgan, climate director at the World Resources Institute, warns of ""the greenwash scenario - they package up the things they're doing already, tie it in a bow and call it a success"".

Lord Stern, former World Bank chief economist, warns against agreeing a deal with too weak targets that ""would be hard to unravel later"".

Whether Copenhagen is a success, a failure or a muddled mixture, it will certainly not be the last word on climate change.

Editorial Comment, Page 16"
"Monday, August 24, 2009 422 mots",,Asia hits back on climate change,By Kathrin Hille in Beijing and Amy Kazmin in New Delhi,,"China and India have closed ranks on climate change, blaming developed countries for the lack of progress towards a deal.

""They have talked much, but not done much,"" said Xie Zhenhua, China's minister in charge of climate change, adding that the conflict between developed and developing nations was driven by commercial and political interest.

His remarks came during two days of talks with Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister, which were aimed at ­synchronising the two countries' positions as negotiations at Copenhagen, Denmark, on climate change draw near.

Mr Ramesh also rejected the notion that the two Asian giants were obstructing a deal.

""The way the narrative seems to have evolved is that countries like India and China are holding back an inter­national agreement,"" he told foreign journalists before leaving for China. ""Far from it.""

The two countries are responding to intensifying criticism from western ­governments and climate change activists for refusing to agree to binding ­targets for carbon emissions as part of efforts to forge an international deal to combat global warming. But the negotiators' remarks also reflect their growing disillusionment with the talks.

""Developed countries just keep repeating the demand that China should commit to capping its emissions but they are not engaging in a sincere dialogue about the proposal China has put forward,"" said Zou Ji, a leading climate change scholar at People's University, Beijing, who has advised the government on its climate change policy and is head of the World Resources Institute in China.

This week the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, is expected to adopt a ­resolution on climate change, a move observers believe could give the clearest indication yet of Beijing's final negotiating ­position for Copenhagen.

China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has recently indicated that it could be open to discussing a cap on its emissions, but has combined this new flexibility with an insistence that it will still take decades for its emissions to peak - a stance that many western climate change experts see as in­sincere.

No drafts of the resolution have been made public yet. ""The best case would be something that would turn out to be China's version of a climate change bill. The worst would be just more empty words aimed at demonstrating that they're not to blame if there's no deal,"" said a diplomat working on climate change.

India is also on a mission to improve its reputation in the talks. ""India is not defensive; India is not obstructionist; India is not a naysayer,"" Mr Ramesh said. ""We want a meaningful agreement, not like Kyoto 1, where countries took on obligations and, for some reason, didn't fulfil them.""

Mr Ramesh, who will travel to Washington, Sweden and Norway in the coming weeks to discuss India's position with counterparts there, says the depiction of Asia's emerging economic giants as a potential stumbling block to a global deal is ""unfair"".

Both China and India demand that developed nations, whose industrialisation they claim caused global warming, must help developing nations with the money and technology to fight it."
"MORE COMMENT ONLINE, Thursday, August 13, 2009 676 mots, p. 6",,Engineering a cooler climate,,,"Jeremy Whipp : Don't you think that by placing too much emphasis on techniques such as geo-engineering, we risk relying too heavily on highly risky scientific endeavours (more risky for the environment, I would argue, than reducing carbon emissions) with climatic effects that we still understand relatively poorly? Bjørn Lomborg : You're quite right that there should be an informed, ethical discussion about climate engineering. And I should underline the point that last week's research paper - on the costs and benefits of different climate engineering solutions - is just one of a series that the Copenhagen Consensus Centre is releasing this month. In each paper, different climate economists look at the costs and benefits of different responses to global warming, whether it is cutting carbon, methane or black carbon, planting more forests, etc.

To answer your question: there are risks to be considered, but we shouldn't kid ourselves that other possible solutions to global warming - like the one we focus most on, carbon cuts - are risk-free. Think about what happened with bio-fuels - and think, also, about the possible impacts on free trade. Also consider the boondoggle that politicians are likely to make - the Waxman-Markey Bill was 1,400 pages long, gives pay-offs to everyone imaginable but does virtually nothing to actually reduce temperatures.

Nicolay Worren : Are there any new pieces of evidence available now that made you change your mind and which were not available when you wrote your earlier books? Or are you simply interpreting the same data differently? Do you believe that the analyses and recommendations of the United Nations climate panel adequately represent the consensus among leading climate researchers? BL : In both my first Danish book in 1998 and the English version of The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001, I stressed that man-made global warming exists. In Cool It , I wrote: ""Global warming is real and man-made. It will have a serious impact on humans and the environment toward the end of this century"". What I have also consistently argued is that there are other global challenges that we must also address, and that some of the extreme suggestions about global warming are overblown. My view is that the careful research of the UN panel of climate change scientists, the IPCC, is the best guide to what we can expect from global warming. The IPCC's report-writing process is robust and custom-made to weather criticism.

Matthew Bates : Don't you fear that if ""advanced industrialised"" countries cannot develop a sustainable lifestyle we will not have the moral authority to co-operate with developing countries on these issues? BL : I think that one of the real problems we have, in terms of rich nations' ""moral authority"", is that there are so many problems prevalent in the developing world today that we could fix incredibly cheaply but which we do not engage with. Last year, the Copenhagen Consensus looked at 10 different major global challenges and investigated the costs and benefits of different solutions. The project highlighted how cheaply we could address problems such as malnutrition and goitre, or get clean drinking water to those that lack it.

In terms of global warming, our biggest challenge is ensuring that the entire world - and not just rich countries - can shift away from reliance on fossil fuels. I'm not convinced that a global deal on carbon mitigation is the best way to achieve that transformation.

Eric Toogood : Why do you think it is that no one seriously questions US policy on petrol taxation? Increasing the cost of petrol for Americans would force their society to use their petroleum resources more efficiently. Europeans do quite well, with petrol costing over €1 a litre. I cannot see that Mr Obama has mentioned an increased tax on petrol as an option for the US economy.

BL : This really shows how difficult and unpopular a narrow focus on carbon mitigation is. Consider how Al Gore, when he was vice-president, pushed so hard to institute a tax on energy that would have raised the cost of gasoline by 7.5 cents a gallon - but ended up casting the deciding vote to increase the federal gas tax by just 4.3 cents a gallon.

Nicholas Grealy : We've seen ""unconventional"" shale gas extraction techniques push up North American reserves, even beating coal on price sometimes. Could third-generation gas be the ""bridge fuel"" that some propose? BL : These technological breakthroughs are obviously really important. But to turn your question around: if we are using this as a ""bridge fuel"", what are we building a bridge to? If we are going to move away from reliance on carbon-based energy sources, we need to ensure that alternatives become cheap, effective and competitive. That's where I believe that a technology-led policy approach needs to be a bigger part of our thinking today."
"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, May 23, 2009 450 mots, p. 5",,Obama passes first hurdle in global warming battle,By Edward Luce in Washington,,"The US Congress has taken its first big step towards passing a cap and trade bill to tackle global warming but the proposed legislation faces a tough fight to be passed by the Senate.

A vote on Thursday night in the key House committee on energy and commerce set out proposals for a bill to reduce US carbon emissions to 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020 and by 83 per cent by 2050.

Barack Obama, president, who is pushing Congress for a bill to sign before the global climate talks in Copenhagen in December, described the committee vote as ""historic"" even though it has yet to be passed by either chamber.

In his statement, Mr Obama reflected the often messy compromises that were necessary to bring along the so-called ""brown Democrats"" from the mid-west and south whose input drastically changed the bill from the original version put forward by the president.

Mr Obama campaigned on a promise to introduce a 100 per cent auction for all carbon permits. Under the House compromise, more than 80 per cent of the -permits would be given away to electricity utilities, energy-intensive manufacturers, car companies and the oil refining sector.

""The bill is historic for what it achieves, providing clean energy incentives that encourage innovation while recognising the concerns of sensitive industries and regions,"" said Mr Obama.

Some environmental groups applauded the measure which they said reflected the best possible deal in the political climate. In recent polls, tackling climate change has dropped down the agenda of concerns for ordinary Americans.

""You should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good,"" said one environmental advocate. ""If you look at the big picture, this would put a cap on carbon emissions, which is the main purpose.""

However, the bill, which is likely to be put to a full House vote before the summer recess in late July, faces continuing criticisms from both left and right.

On the left, environmentalists say the decision to give away, rather than auction, most carbon trading permits would blunt the price signals needed to persuade consumers to change their behaviour.

Under one estimate, the permits given to local electricity distribution companies would result in a $750bn (€534bn, £471bn) subsidy to consumers between now and 2030 when the system would have moved to a full auction. Proponents of the bill say that step is essential to win public support by avoiding sharp rises in the electricity bills of consumers at a time when the economy is -contracting.

The bill is also designed to avoid the windfall that European energy companies received by ensuring that the value of the free permits is passed on to the consumer, rather than producers. On the right, Republicans say they will continue to oppose the bill. Only one Republican voted for it, which passed the committee by a majority of 36 to 22.

A number of influential Democrats expressed doubts about the bill's merits. ""This stuff is going no place in the Senate,"" said Collin Peterson, the Democratic chairman of the House agriculture committee.

Charlie Rangel, chairman of the House ways and means committee, which also has jurisdiction over the bill, hinted he might not co-operate unless healthcare reform had first been enacted. Mr Rangel argues that a carbon tax would be more efficient."
"LEADER, Tuesday, December 14, 2010 388 mots, p. 10",,Temperate accord on climate change,,,"It is not surprising that there is no easy solution to global warming. The risk of climate change is among the most complex challenges the world faces. The difficulty of achieving international accord should not dissuade us from action, however. Taking steps to curb carbon emissions is a reasonable insurance premium against catastrophe.

Cancún's achievement was to establish a consensus from developed and developing countries to cut carbon emissions and enshrine this promise within the UN process for the first time. A full, legally binding treaty was never on the table for this meeting. That the US participated, however, and that developing countries committed to cut emissions, is significant.

Yet ambition without substance is not enough. Rich and poor nations, particularly the US and China, have proved compromise is possible. But fleshing out the specifics of these accords will inevitably re-inflame tensions.

Delegates hailed a new, £100bn-a-year ""green fund"" that aims to channel money from richer to poorer nations, for example. It is right that richer nations pay more than poorer countries to combat warming - after all, developed countries produce more carbon per capita. Where this money will come from, and how it should be disbursed, is undecided, however. It would be a definitive and welcome step for these transfers to result from a market of tradeable emissions quotas that put a price on carbon. This was not discussed at Cancún, however.

Directly addressing a sticking point at Copenhagen, a new pact on monitoring and verifying emissions is positive. Again, however, the detail is lacking. The UN's commitment to protect forests also tackles an urgent issue. But the scope of a $5bn accord is limited. And though deforestation has already slowed, degradation may occur even if more trees are not cut down.

Cancún passed the test of keeping the climate agenda on track. The next two years will now be decisive for the future of the UN process. The next US presidential election will determine whether Washington can really participate in a deal. More importantly, the provisions of the Kyoto protocols to cut emissions expire at the end of 2012. A choice must then be made: to extend these targets, agree on new ones, or abandon targets altogether.

Cautious optimism is not a comfortable place to be when weighing the future of the planet. A binding, global deal is still worth holding out for. The events of the past two weeks make this goal seem slightly less unrealistic."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Wednesday, December 16, 2009 160 mots, p. 10",,Remove politics from the climate science debate,,,"Sir, Clive Crook brings common sense to the debate about global warming (""Trust public opinion on climate change"", December 14).

But the arguments about action on climate change surely need to be put in a wider context. There is a massive cost involved in reducing carbon dioxide emissions (which seems to be the main area of focus). It is not just a matter of what or who we believe. One way or another, the costs will be borne by citizens, especially (and rightly) in the richer developing world. If we are serious about combating climate change, voters need to be faced with honest policies about the opportunity cost of initiatives to reduce global warming. Ultimately, to pay for significant action, citizens will have to be willing to reduce spending on areas such as healthcare and travel (via higher taxes and prices) in order to reallocate resources to ameliorate the environment. And success or failure will not be clear for decades.

This makes it all the more vital to gain public trust, with truly open, non-politicised science and honest expenditure priorities. The outcome of public choice should not be taken for granted.

"FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY, Saturday, November 14, 2009 490 mots, p. 6",,Changing climate shifts ethical investors,By Alice Ross,,"FundsClimate change redefines ethical sector thanks to outperformance, writes Alice Ross

Climate change funds, once dismissed as ""gimmicky"", have been quietly outperforming the market, according to a new report.

They have been helped by their exposure to energy stocks and defensive utility companies as governments increase spending on alternative energy and infrastructure to combat climate change.

Holden & Partners, the ethical financial advisers, published data this week showing that climate change funds have outperformed the MSCI world index over two and three years, with some - such as Schroders Global Climate Change and F&C Climate Opportunities - outperforming over one year as well.

Over these periods, ethical investment strategies have undergone a subtle shift. Whereas the focus used to be on ""screening"" stocks to filter out those that invest in sectors such as tobacco or armaments, ""positive"" screening for companies that are combatting climate change has come to the fore.

Most specialist climate change funds do not describe themselves as ethical - though they are likely to appeal to ethical investors. Managers of these funds say that there is a strong investment case for climate change technologies.

""There has been a strong development of the climate change sector despite the [financial] crisis, which has been a positive - in Asia, there have been subsidies and initiatives we haven't seen before,"" says Bruce Jenkyn-Jones, investment director at Impax Asset Management, the environmental specialist.

He says valuations on renewable energy stocks, which had fallen as the sector found it hard to get funding, are looking very attractive. Energy efficiency stocks - such as insulating for buildings - have done well this year as projects have been able to get off the ground again.

Climate change funds therefore outperformedconventional ethical ""screening"" funds, many of which had large holdings in bank stocks, which harmed their performance in 2008.

Ethical funds also tend to have a UK bias, while climate change funds take a more international approach. This has allowed them to benefit from the weakness of sterling, as well as to diversify into markets such as China, which is competing with the US to be a major producer of solar and wind energy.

Some climate change funds struggle with volatility, however. Energy stocks are correlated to the oil price, while the paucity of bank funding has meant that many wind and solar projects have been put on hold.

Nicola Donnelly, a fund manager at WHEB Asset Management, says one way to cope with volatility is to broaden beyond energy stocks to other climate change themes, such as water access and demographics.

She is investing in Eaga Insulation, a UK company that advises lowincome households on insulating their homes.

In fact, several climate change funds play a range of different themes, such as healthcare and agriculture. Schroders' fund, the best performing climate change fund in the past year, has a large holding in Tesco.

However, retail investors have yet to catch on to climate change. In spite of its strong performance in the past year, the Schroder Climate Change fund has less than £21m in assets under management.

""The retail investor is not getting this and I think they're going to miss out,"" warns Mark Hoskin at Holden & Partners, who says much of the interest is coming from institutions.

One reason could be that climate change funds pay little income - an average of 1 per cent a year. But, this could be set to change, with the introduction of a multi-asset climate change fund from Cheviot Asset Management. It's the first of its kind and is expected to pay a yield of 3 per cent."
"COMMENT, Tuesday, July 28, 2009 721 mots, p. 7",,Climate activists are also in denial,By Gideon Rachman,,"The phrase ""climate change denier"" has a nasty ring to it. It links those who dispute mainstream science on global warming with ""Holocaust deniers"". They are not just wrong, it implies, they are evil.

But the climate change lobby is in the grip of its own form of dangerous fantasy. It is in denial not about science - but about international politics.

At the moment, efforts to deal with global warming are focused on a huge international summit in Copenhagen in December. But the chances of Copenhagen delivering a deal that meets the goals for carbon dioxide emissions set by the United Nations Panel on Climate Change is vanishingly small. In private, many climate change activists will admit this. But Copenhagen is the only game in town - so they keep playing.

The first UN agreement on climate change was struck in Rio back in 1992. But in the intervening years, the rate of CO2 emissions has risen steadily - seemingly undeterred by huge emissions of hot air at UN conferences.

It was convenient to blame the lack of international progress on George W. Bush. But it is becoming increasingly apparent that the arrival of Barack Obama in the White House will not be the game-changer that many climate change activists hoped for. The House of Representatives in Washington has passed a bill to limit carbon emissions. But its provisions are so mild that they seem unlikely to make much impact. The climate change lobby hoped that if the US took the lead with new laws, the rest of the world would respond. There is little sign of this.

When Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, visited India last week and appealed to her hosts to limit emissions she was rebuffed. The Chinese may be a little more polite in Washington this week. But the substance of what they say is likely to be just as unyielding. The Indians and Chinese point out that the vast bulk of the CO2already in the atmosphere has been put there by the industrialised countries of the west. China is now probably the largest emitter of CO2 in the world. But, on a per capita basis, emissions in China are still well below western levels. Why, ask the Indians and Chinese, should Americans and Europeans assume the right to continue using energy at levels that they seek to deny to poorer countries? It is a fair question.

The Indians and the Chinese have so far refused to accept binding targets on CO2 emissions. Even if they change their position during the Copenhagen negotiations - and that is far from certain - that will come at a price. The proposed deal is that rich countries essentially bribe poorer countries to cut emissions and adopt cleaner technologies. China has proposed that developed nations should all agree to contribute 1 per cent of gross domestic product to help poorer nations fight global warming.

Now imagine that you are Mr Obama trying to sell a deal like that back home. The US is running a budget deficit of 12 per cent of GDP. The Chinese are sitting on the world's largest foreign reserves. The president would have to ask the American people to write a large cheque to China to combat global warming - while simultaneously praying that the Chinese graciously consent to keep buying American debt to fund the deficit. It does not sound like a political winner.

Even if a deal is somehow struck at Copenhagen, it will involve promised reductions of CO2 emissions that seem literally incredible. The rich countries that belong to the Group of Eight, including the US, say they want to cut emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 - which will mean a massive transfer to cleaner sources of energy. As Oliver Morton, the science writer, points out - ""Building two terawatts of nuclear capacity by 2050 - enough to supply 10 per cent of the total carbon-free energy that's needed - means building a large nuclear power station every week; the current worldwide rate is about five a year. A single terawatt of wind - 5 per cent of the overall requirement - requires about 4m large turbines.""

Nicholas Stern, a professor of economics, has issued an influential report arguing that the transition to a low-carbon economy is affordable and compatible with continued economic growth. Leading western politicians say that they believe this and talk airily of the ""green jobs"" of the future. But there is little sign that they are prepared to back their arguments with deliberate efforts to raise the cost of fossil fuels or to make the necessary investments in alternative energy. All the politicians involved in the global climate change negotiations know that a country that moves unilaterally risks severely damaging its economy, at least in the short-term - without affecting the global problem.

The state of international negotiations presents a huge dilemma for climate change activists. Most genuinely believe that a failure to achieve an international agreement in Copenhagen would be catastrophic. But they also know that, even if a deal is reached, it is likely to be feeble and ineffective. If they admit this publicly, they risk creating a climate of despair and inaction. But if they press ahead, they are putting all their energy into an approach that they must know is highly unlikely to deliver.

It is a horrible dilemma. But, in difficult situations, it is best to start by facing facts. The trouble is that - in different ways - both sides of the climate change debate are in denial."
"COMMENT, Saturday, November 28, 2009 740 mots, p. 9",,A climate of suspicion,By Christopher Caldwell,,"The publication last week of excerpts from 3,000 e-mails stolen from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia comes as a blow to global-warming activists on the very eve of the Copenhagen climate summit. The e-mails concern a handful of US and UK scientists affiliated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPPC has used a graph nicknamed the ""hockey stick"", which shows a spike in temperatures in the past century. It is a centrepiece of the assessment of global warming that will be the basis of talks in Copenhagen.

But it has its detractors. In a paper published in 2005, the Canadian economist Ross McKitrick attacked the IPCC's work as statistically flawed and warned that ""group efforts are always at risk of self-selection and groupthink."" Citing the importance of the IPCC to policymakers, he urged an independent panel be appointed to assure, first, that ""the data are publicly available"" and, second, that ""the statistical methods were fully described"".

The e-mails appear to bear out Mr McKitrick's worries. One, allegedly written by Phil Jones of East Anglia, asks that ""Mike"" (Michael Mann of the University of Pennsylvania) and another scientist (""Gene"") delete certain of their e-mails regarding a 2007 IPCC study. The author of the e-mail volunteers that another scientist (""Keith"") would delete his own, and that ""Caspar"" would do the same. At least two letters describe ways the scientists should use their influence to pressure and delegitimise a peer-reviewed journal that had published a hostile paper. At least two describe manoeuvres to avoid Freedom of Information requests. The e-mails do not in themselves undermine the IPCC's science. But they are evidence of groupthink. The author of the incriminating ""Phil"" e-mail appears hopeful, at least, that five distinguished scientists would be willing to destroy their own correspondence to defend their work not against error but against scrutiny. Mr Jones said this week that the e-mails were written out of frustration and that none have been deleted.

Even before the e-mails became public, American public opinion on climate change had undergone a shift towards scepticism. A Washington Post poll published this week found that only 72 per cent of Americans believe global warming ""has probably been happening"", as against 80 per cent last year. Since 2006, the percentage of Americans who think there is no such thing as global warming has doubled, to 26 per cent.

These findings are in line with a more detailed study done in October by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. The percentage of Americans who see global warming as a ""very serious problem"" has fallen since last year, to 35 per cent from 44 per cent. This decline is occurring in all regions and all political parties. It is sharpest among independents, 79 per cent of whom were seriously worried about global warming in 2008 and barely half of whom (53 per cent) are now. Democrats are more likely to see global warming as a ""serious problem"", but only a minority of them (49 per cent) do. And although Americans marginally favour President Barack Obama's cap-and-trade plans for reducing carbon emissions, those who follow the issue closely oppose them by two-to-one. A Senate bill that would have strengthened the president's negotiating hand in Copenhagen has stalled out and will not be revisited until the end of the year.

Democratic consultant Mark Mellman reacted to the waning faith in climate change by telling the Post: ""It's a sad state of affairs when science becomes subject to partisan politics."" But it is worth stressing that Copenhagen is a political, not a scientific, summit. World leaders are not going to Copenhagen to discuss whether and how climate change is happening - they are trying to hammer out solutions. So perhaps the poll data reflect the folk wisdom that if there is no solution, there is no problem. Even if solutions are not scientifically impossible, they may be politically impossible.

Taxpayers in the developed countries have reason to worry that they will be taken to the cleaners at Copenhagen. If rich countries get tight targets for carbon emissions and poor ones get technology transfers and subsidies (through sellable carbon-offset credits) to ""green their industrialisation"", then it looks less like a cleanup and more like a redistribution of productive capacity. Many programmes that appear reasonable in academic or political conclaves will prove explosive when exposed to the oxygen of democracy.

Paying poor countries is easier said than done. If you give money directly to farmers or ""rainforest communities"", it will be inefficiently spent. To purchase land, say, or to develop alternative industry, you need concentrations of capital. That means giving the money either to governments (which introduces the certitude of corruption) or big companies (which introduces the possibility money will simply be transferred from western wage-earners to western moguls of ""green industry"", who already receive large US subsidies and are prone to confuse their own interests with the developing world's.

Democratic publics are not science faculties. Most of those who urge teaching creationism, instead of evolution, in high-school biology classes, for instance, could not explain Darwin's theory to you. But neither could most of those who consider creationism an embarrassing superstition. When the public debates scientific questions, it is not attitudes towards science that divide them but attitudes towards authority. The stolen e-mails will not necessarily settle any scientific arguments. But they may settle some political ones."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, May 14, 2009 451 mots, p. 3",,Bill Clinton in call on climate bill,By Edward Luce in Washington,,"The US Congress must pass a ""strong"" climate change bill before the global warming summit in Copenhagen this December if it is to have a chance of persuading China and India to sign up to a new treaty, says Bill Clinton.

""First of all if we don't adopt a workable but a strong [cap and trade] bill then we can't get them to sign up because we won't have any credibility,"" Mr Clinton told the Financial Times in an interview yesterday.

""They will dodge - they won't play in that arena unless we are clearly there.""

The former US president, whose administration negotiated the Kyoto protocol in 1997 which failed to be passed by Congress because it largely spared the big developing countries from obligations, said China was in some respects ahead of the US on clean energy.

""They're already doing a lot of things better than we are,"" Mr Clinton said. ""All of their new coal plants are going to be at higher technology than our own coal stock . . . They have already invested more than we have in high-speed rail. The only thing they are still behind us on is vigorous energy efficiency.""

Mr Clinton's comments coincided with the first signs of progress on the cap and trade bill before the House of Representatives. However, some groups have raised concerns that the bill, which is largely the result of compromise between ""rustbelt"" and ""sunrise"" state Democrats, may have excessively watered down Barack Obama's campaign commitments.

Mr Obama pledged to auction off 100 per cent of the permits. Under the emerging bill, which is expected to pass the House later this year but will face a rougher passage in the Senate, more than half of the permits would be given away to utility companies, energyintensive manufacturers and oil refiners.

Mr Clinton said the bare minimum for the US in Copenhagen would be to have passed a strong cap and trade bill in the House and a clear signal it was about to pass the Senate. ""There may be things on the calendar that will prevent a final Senate vote but if it is pretty clear the bill is working through Congress that is going to pass and it will not be delayed by filibuster that is the sine qua non ,"" he said.

He added that the talks in Copenhagen would not even reach discussions about how China and India could move to more energy efficient economies unless Congress had reached that point. ""We won't get to the core question unless America crosses the threshold first because they kind of got to hide behind our skirts last time [at Kyoto],"" he said.

The former president's Clinton Global Initiative is organising an effort to refit buildings in an energyefficient way in 40 cities around the world - most recently the Empire State building in New York. Mr Clinton said China could re-employ many of its 35m jobless manufacturing workers retooling its buildings.

On clean energy, Mr Clinton cited a recent US government report showing that 35 to 50 per cent of US energy needs could be met from wind and air if the transmission systems were put in place. And he pointed to ways to change the American lifestyle that would apply in the developing world. ""Even in Germany, which is the auto capital of Europe, they're now building car-free suburban villages. If the president [Obama] stays on his current course, we may move away from internal combustion engines to electric motors."""
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Wednesday, June 3, 2009 249 mots, p. 8",,America must act fast and decisively on climate change,,,"Sir, You are correct to observe that US energy secretary Steven Chu's recent comments on the Obama administration's stance toward energy and climate change are sobering (""Professor Chu goes to Washington"", Editorial, May 29). But let's not under-emphasise a bigger point: a US administration is at last addressing climate change in a scientific, realistic and politically pragmatic manner.

You are absolutely right that Barack Obama and Mr Chu must redouble their efforts to build support for a cap-and-trade regime or a tax on carbon. With the establishment of a price on carbon, market mechanisms will engage and individual and private-sector priorities, investment and behaviour will quickly adapt.

The Obama administration must address two central facts. First, the US and China emit approximately half of all greenhouse gases. If the US and China do not successfully address climate change, game over. The US must do as much as possible to constructively engage and work with China on climate change.

Second, given the enormity of the necessary investment and the difficult straits in which we find government budgets, government spending alone cannot be expected to meet the challenge of climate change. Thus, the private sector must invest in climate change-related projects and technologies in a highly significant manner. For this to happen, the Obama administration must do much more to get in place commercially-viable, predictable, long-term investment incentives and tax policies. The numbers have to work.

By adopting a scientific, pragmatic approach to climate change and energy policy, the Obama administration has made important progress. But now is not the time to let up. The Copenhagen negotiations are scheduled to be concluded at the end of this year. The world is looking to Washington for leadership and an example. Now is the time for decisive action.

"FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - LIFE & ARTS, Saturday, December 5, 2009 721 mots, p. 14",,New climate of opinion,,,"That may be about to change. The most important issue of our time, climate change, has forced itself on to the consciousness of every nation's people. And art, slowly, reluctantly, is coming to terms with it. It has to. However lost they become in their layers of irony and cheek, artists need to convince themselves, if no one else, that they speak clearly and seriously of their lives and times. The last judgement they would want delivered by posterity on their efforts is that they simply fiddled while Rome burned, or froze over, or did both at the same time. Suddenly there is something bigger and graver in the air than their own ineffectual micro-concerns.

The new exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, Earth: Art of a Changing World , is a small, tentative step in this direction. Thirty-five artists have been invited or freshly commissioned to produce work that is inspired by the climate change debate. The debate over whether climate change threatens the world as we know it is virtually won, but the discussion of what to do about it is far from over. Practical solutions are not among the traditional strengths of the artist, and they are few and far between here. Yet the work at the show is arresting and smart. It is as if a pack of hungry hounds, tired of gnawing at irrelevance, has been thrown a bone juicy with cosmic importance.

As in any intelligently curated show, context is everything. Antony Gormley's army of terracotta miniatures, ""Amazonian Field"", was created at the beginning of the 1990s, yet the artist's brief - ""I wanted the art to look back at us . . . as if we were responsible for the world that it, and we, were in"" - has nowhere been better fulfilled than here. The figures, jam-packed inside one of the Academy's rooms, are turned towards the viewer at the doorway. They are passive and pathetic. They want us to look after them, to be released from their confinement, to be assured of a future. What kind of answer can we give them?

The piece is a compelling counterpoint to Gormley's recent installation on Trafalgar Square's fourth plinth, One & Other . There, live individual voices spoke clamorously on any subject they chose; at the Royal Academy, the clay figures stand crowded, expectant, mute. The dialectical tension between unfettered freedom of speech on the one hand, and powerlessness in the face of a grim, unfolding narrative on the other, is thrillingly conveyed. Gormley has captured the spirit of the times through nothing more complicated than the manipulation of the human figure, which can choose to stand proud and erect, or to be cowed by the grander forces of history.

Other works in the show are similarly fraught with contradiction. There is a small, fragile diamond on display, by the duo Ackroyd & Harvey, which has been manufactured from carbon extracted from the thigh-bone of a polar bear. The object is intrinsically beautiful, yet the means of its metamorphosis is somehow disturbing.

In the Danish artist Tue Greenfort's ""Medusa Swarm"", a suspended shoal of beautiful pink jellyfish made out of Murano glass seems to celebrate climate change: it is a species whose population has increased because its natural predators are disappearing from over-fishing and water pollution. Can climate change have beautiful outcomes? Well, yes. But at what cost? The sting of a jellyfish, we scarcely need reminding, can be fatal.

More beauty in another corner of the gallery: Kris Martin's golden sphere, placed innocuously on the floor, is perfectly realised. Yet once more, formal elegance disguises sinister intent: the sphere is a home-made bomb, primed to explode in 100 years. We can stand and admire it safely, its menace conveniently deferred to a time and place that is beyond us. Could there be a more potent metaphor for our attitude towards the earth?

In ""Kings of the Hill"", a video by the Israeli artist Yael Bartana, a small crowd of figures is silhouetted against a sunset on a long, sandy beach. Yet rather than look out romantically to sea, they face the opposite way, enraptured by uglier matters: a contest in which drivers of powerful 4x4 vehicles rev their engines to the maximum as they attempt to climb the beach's awkward dunes.

The whole affair is limp, pointless and unattractive - at least Formula One has a certain beauty to it - yet the Sisyphean futility of the game hypnotises us. Here is the throbbing soundtrack of environmental meltdown: the noise of dozens of engines spewing fuel fumes into the sea breeze as they head nowhere fast.

It is the highlight of an exhibition that bites, and bites hard. Art is rediscovering its ability to engage with the world's larger issues, and very welcome it is too. Don't miss it."
"COMPANIES - UK & IRELAND, Thursday, October 22, 2009 275 mots, p. 20",,Insurers call for action on climate change,"By Paul J Davies, Insurance Correspondent",,"The insurance industry will today add its voice to calls for more action to halt climate change. The industry says big cuts in emissions by developed countries and funding for developing countries to tackle climate change are needed to avoid a ""systemic risk to the global economy"".

Andrew Torrance, chairman of ClimateWise, an industry lobby group, and chief executive of Allianz Insurance in the UK, will tell a United Nations summit in South Africa that inaction could leave people unable to get insurance.

""Climate change must be tackled now if insurers are to continue to play their fullest role in managing climate risk,"" he will say. ""If governments fail to act today, substantial markets may become uninsurable tomorrow.""

The industry fears that climate change will leave it facing bigger losses from more extreme weather events. ""The risks that we face tomorrow mean that we will have to hold more capital because bad loss years will be much worse,"" Mr Torrance told the FT.

ClimateWise, which is looking to increase pressure on governments attending December's climate change conference in Copenhagen, wants the developed world to agree a 40 per cent cut in emissions by 2020 and to strike a deal on the size and structure of the financing package to help the developing world tackle climate change.

""A new international deal is ultimately in all of our interests and the costs of transition to a low climate risk economy are manageable,"" Mr Torrance will say. ""Delay is not an option.""

Insurance losses related to weather could rise by 75 per cent over the next 30 years, according to Mr Torrance. The industry has already seen a 15-fold rise in weather-related claims over the past 30 years due to increases in the frequency and intensity of storms.

However, academic and industry studies have found that all the increase in losses seen by insurers is due to socio-economic factors such as increasing wealth and greater concentrations of people in coastal areas such as Florida.

There is also significant debate in scientific circles about the influence of global warming on weather patterns."
"Friday, December 18, 2009 913 mots",,Climate deal only an 'essential beginning',"By Fiona Harvey, Ed Crooks and Andrew Ward in Copenhagen",,"The Copenhagen climate conference ended on Saturday without unanimous agreement as the world's biggest economies backed a limited accord that leaders said would form the basis for a future deal to tackle global warming.

Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, acknowledged that the outcome was ""not everything we hoped for"" but described it as an ""essential beginning"" as he brought a close to two weeks of fractious negotiations in the Danish capital.

Talks had continued through Friday night into Saturday morning in a bid to reach consensus on a tentative agreement struck between the US, China and other big emerging economies on cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and financing to help developing countries cope with climate change.

But several developing countries, led by Venezuela and Bolivia, refused to endorse the deal, ensuring that the conference would end without an official agreement. Instead, all 193 countries agreed to ""take note of the Copenhagen Accord"" without committing to accept it.

European Union leaders gave a tepid endorsement to the accord, which they described as the first of ""many more steps"" needed to curb rising temperatures, but made clear their deep disappointment over the weakness of the commitments and their non-binding nature.

Mr Ban said work must now start to forge broader consensus behind a concrete deal. ""We must transform this into a legally binding treaty next year,"" he said. ""The importance will only be recognised when it's codified into international law.""

Hopes of a deal had risen on Friday evening when President Barack Obama hailed a ""meaningful agreement"" after intensive talks with leaders of China, Brazil, India and South Africa appeared to have broken the deadlock between rich nations and the developing world.

But the EU said the US declaration was premature and negotiations dragged on for several more hours after Mr Obama left Copenhagen until EU leaders eventually announced their reluctant backing for the deal at 2am.

Mr Obama acknowledged that the deal was ""not sufficient to combat the threat of climate change but [was] an important first step"" on cutting greenhouse gases.

""We have made a meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough. For the first time in history, all of the major economies have come together to take action [on global warming],"" he said after meetings with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Jacob Zuma, the South African president.

The extent of China's backing for the accord is still unclear, however. Mr Obama said on Friday night that he had reached agreement with Mr Wen on Beijing backing the accord. But on Saturday morning China's representative insisted the accord was neither adopted nor endorsed as a formal decision at the meeting.

José Manuel Barroso, the European Commission president, said the outcome fell ""far short of our expectations"", adding: ""Our level of ambition has not been matched.""

Several countries, including Sudan, which heads the G77 group of developing nations, voiced outright opposition, raising doubts over whether a deal struck by an elite group of big industrialised and emerging economies could secure the broad international support needed to turn it into a binding treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol.

Mr Obama acknowledged that further talks were needed but voiced confidence that the Copenhagen accord would form the basis for a lasting deal.

""What we have achieved in Copenhagen will not be the end but the beginning of a new era of international action,"" he said. ""This is going to be hard. It's hard within countries, and it's going to be even harder between countries.""

The agreement contained a commitment to try to hold global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, a level scientists have suggested is probably the limit of safety, beyond which climate change could become catastrophic and irreversible.

Rich countries have also included commitments to cut their emissions and developing countries to curb the growth of theirs. There were also promises to transfer money from rich to poor countries, to help them tackle climate change.

But Fredrik Reinfeldt, prime minister of Sweden, holder of the rotating EU presidency, warned that the accord was not sufficient to meet the 2°C target.

""This is not a perfect agreement,"" he said. ""It will not solve the climate threat.""

Lumumba Di-Aping, the Sudanese head of the G77, said the US-backed proposals represented the ""lowest level of ambition"" and would be devastating for the world's poor.

""This is an idea not a deal,"" he told reporters. ""If any country rejects the deal, then there is no deal. Sudan will not be a signatory to a deal that destroys Africa.""

Venezuela described the accord as a ""coup d'etat"" by wealthy countries.

Sergio Serra, Brazil's ambassador for climate change issues, described the result of the talks as ""disappointing"". He added: ""There is a big job ahead to avoid climate change through emissions reduction targets, and that was not done here.""

Mexico said it would embrace the Copenhagen accord when it takes over the presidency of the UN climate talks next year and hoped to agree a ""legally binding instrument"" at the next conference , which it will host.

Felipe Calderón, Mexican president, acknowledged the proposals were ""far from what we expected and from what the world needs"" and described it as ""the basis for a future agreement"".

One key sticking point to a deal was China's refusal to allow international monitoring of its emissions. But in a last-minute compromise, Beijing and Washington agreed to a process of ""international consultation and analysis"".

Mr Obama held two meetings with the Chinese premier to try to resolve the issues. The second meeting, which was also attended by the leaders of India, South Africa and Brazil, lasted for four hours, officials said.

Countries had been negotiating in the Danish capital for two weeks, hoping to forge a new settlement that would be the first to require developed and developing countries to take action on greenhouse gas emissions.

Brazilian representatives said negotiators in Copenhagen would continue their work over the weekend, and into next year in the hope of having a legally binding document that can be signed by the end of 2010 and then ratified by national parliaments before the end of 2012. That is the expiry date of the main provisions of the Kyoto protocol, the world's only existing accord that binds countries to cut emissions, but only applies to the rich world.

Hugo Chávez, president of Venezuela, declared: ""The meeting unfortunately has not been successful. It has failed...[Because] of the lack of political will by a group of countries led by the imperial government of the United States.""

He accused Denmark and its wealthy allies of ""pulling a document from nowhere"" that ignored the interests of developing countries."
"GLOBAL INSIGHT - GEOFF DYER, Wednesday, November 4, 2009 609 mots, p. 4",,Beijing has so far played its climate cards beautifully,By Geoff Dyer,,"When I asked a Chinese academic last December what the main themes of 2009 would be, he named two big problems - the economy and Copenhagen.

The economy was pretty obvious. At the time we spoke, there were dark warnings about millions of disgruntled workers roaming the countryside. On Copenhagen, his worry was that as the world's largest emitter of carbon, China would become the lightning rod for global anxiety about climate change. If the December summit in Denmark collapsed without agreement, he pointed out, the inevitable demonisation of China could begin to threaten its development.

Almost a year later, both concerns have faded. China's economy is growing faster than most, and some factories in the south are already complaining about a shortage of workers.

In the frantic round of talks ahead of Copenhagen, meanwhile, Beijing negotiators can take comfort from the fact that the real pressure is being felt in other capitals. In truth, China has played its climate cards beautifully.

Beijing has been helped by events elsewhere. In its early days, the Obama administration hoped to forge a close partnership on climate change with China that would allow it to nudge Beijing into important new commitments. But with its climate-change bill still languishing in Congress, Washington has little leverage. Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, has admitted the two countries will not sign any substantial agreement when President Barack Obama visits Beijing later this month.

China has also been quite happy for India to strike a more belligerent tone in climate talks - a role often played by Jairam Ramesh, the Indian environment minister. Both governments feel strongly that the onus of dealing with global warming lies with the rich world. Last week they even signed an agreement to co-ordinate climate-change efforts, which will help them to take a united stance in Copenhagen. But it suits China for India to take a harder line in public.

Beijing has also done an excellent job at convincing the rest of the world it is serious about climate change. China is one of the biggest manufacturers of solar panels, and this year, announcements have been made almost every week about another big new wind farm - even if a large number of the existing ones are not yet connected to the national grid.

The government has set itself a target of improving energy efficiency by 20 per cent in the 2006-10 period and, with a little help from the downturn at the end of last year, the country is on track to get near to this goal. So, by the time President Hu Jintao told a United Nations climate- change conference in September that China would also adopt a ""carbon intensity"" target, environmental groups were only too happy to herald it as a big breakthrough.

Beijing's policies have been so successful that US advocates of green technology have given warning that China will become the dominant player. ""China is spending about $9bn (€6.1bn, £5.5bn) a month on clean energy,"" Steven Chu, the US energy secretary, told a Senate committee last week. ""The US, meanwhile, has fallen behind.""

Yet although it is Washington and not Beijing that is dreading the Copenhagen summit, China will still be under intense scrutiny. Not only has it yet to give a date for when its emissions might peak, but Mr Hu's plan to reduce carbon intensity (in other words, the amount of carbon produced by each unit of output) is still an aspiration rather than a concrete number.

Moreover, some activists fear that China could start to relax its policies. Beijing is currently putting in place the next five-year plan for 2011-15 and the word is that local governments have been resisting another 20 per cent improvement in energy efficiency. Observers speculate that the government will instead announce a target to reduce carbon intensity by 20 per cent - with about 13-15 per cent coming from better energy efficiency and the rest from more renewable energy and reforestation projects.

Such a reduction in energy intensity is still a big improvement. But it is easy to see the line of attack that other governments might take if such a policy were announced. They could say that under the guise of a new carbon-intensity target, Beijing was actually reducing pressure on its coal-addicted steel mills and power plants to use energy more efficiently. Copenhagen could still provide some uncomfortable moments for Beijing."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, October 29, 2009 239 mots, p. 6",,US envoy rules out climate deal with Beijing,By Geoff Dyer in Beijing and Bill Savadove in Shanghai,,"China and the US will not sign a landmark agreement on climate change policies when Barack Obama visits Beijing next month, the US president's climate change envoy said yesterday, in spite of high hopes this year among US officials, write Geoff Dyer in Beijing and Bill Savadove in Shanghai .

Todd Stern said the two would seek ""a common understanding"" on climate change ahead of a crucial meeting in Copenhagen in December and would deepen co-operation on clean energy, but would not reach an accord on carbon emissions targets.

The low expectations for the talks might please some European nations, which feared that China and the US would seek to impose a bilateral accord on other countries. But the fact that no landmark deal will be agreed underlines the weak position of the US in climate change discussions until cap-and-trade legislation is passed by Congress.

""I do not think that we are expecting a broad agreement, per se,"" Mr Stern saidin Shanghai. ""It's not an issue of trying to cut some separate deal, but there absolutely is an issue of trying to get us and China as aligned as possible so that we have a chance to get an agreement in Copenhagen.""

As the two biggest emitters of carbon, the US and China are central to an eventual new international agreement on global warming. The discussions during Mr Obama's visit could be pivotal to the debate, potentially setting the tone for the conference.

US officials had high expectations about what they could achieve through bilateral talks with China, hoping to use a broad discussion on environmental issues to nudge China into setting a date for when its carbon emissions will peak.

But Congress has yet to approve climate change legislation, significantly reducing any leverage the US might have had."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Tuesday, December 8, 2009 266 mots, p. 10",,Wrest control from climate change coalition to restore confidence,,,"Sir, Your already excellent coverage of the climate change debate may be yet further improved by more precision in the use of language. ""Climate change"" is not a science. It is a theme taken on by a single issue coalition of scientists, politicians and non-governmental organisations. Through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this essentially self-selecting coalition has captured many important levers of political power, research funding and professional advancement.

""Peer review"" is the process by which science moves forward within a scientific discipline. This term does not properly describe the pick and mix processes whereby a Noah's Ark of scientists and appointees select the information most supportive of their aims. ""Climate change modelling"" is the technical process of extrapolating historical data into the future by applying the cause and effect conclusions reached by the climate change coalition. It may be worth reflecting that modellers are often the poorer paid professional cousins of those formerly charged with regulating our financial markets.

I've watched the global warming debate develop since the ice age and acidification scares of the 1980s and have been waiting since then for a properly nuanced assessment of historical climate variability, a detailed review of the uncertainty around the impact of human activity; and the modelling of future consequences depending on a range of policy reactions. In the light of the University of East Anglia e-mail leaks, it appears I still have a long time to wait.

My positive proposal on how to rebuild confidence would be to take funding control from the hands of the climate change coalition, and ensure that the many respected sceptics in the scientific disciplines of oceanography, meteorology, atmospheric physics, astrophysics, glaciology and palaeontology have the right access to resources. Only then can the real processes of peer review start to inform properly public policy in this important area of human inquiry.

David Schofield,"
,,Top climate scientists share their outlook,By Tom de Castella,,"Climate scientists are like an exotic tribe - fascinating, sometimes hard to understand and rarely visited. The editor of a science journal warned me that I would find little to interest mainstream readers - the boffins would agree on pretty much everything. The debate, she implied, was over. She was wrong.

While climate scientists agree the world is warming due to man's activities, there are still large areas of conflict, notably over how certain we can be about the predictions.

How did we choose?

Assembling any top 10 is fraught with difficulties. Assemble one for climate scientists and the problem is exacerbated by the complexity of their research and the range of specialist fields that make up a broad science.

Here, we focused on those people who specialise in climate prediction rather than climate change's impact on the environment. The criteria for inclusion was original research, influence on peers and sound judgment.

So, while we were willing to consider talking to climate change naysayers - ""denier"" seems a rather Stalinist term - we found that even their initially compelling arguments were rarely backed up by peer-reviewed research. None made it into the top 10, although since he is a contrarian whose earlier work remains relatively respected, we chose to profile Richard Lindzen, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well.

Who's missing?

One regret is the absence of Chinese experts. Three were approached but either refused to be interviewed outright or failed to make themselves available after seeing a list of questions.

What can we learn?

The fact that experts in the hard sciences disagree about climate change spells trouble for the politicians and policymakers at Copenhagen.

A majority of scientists claim to be limiting their carbon footprint - but measured against the scale of the problem is such individual action meaningful?

""If we believe in free will we can at least make some difference,"" says Tim Lenton. Referring to the hundreds of thousands of air miles travelled by climate scientists going to and from professional meetings, however, he adds that ""we all have to 'fess up to the fact that we're deeply hypocritical and contradictory beings.""

Others argue that the focus on personal behaviour is damaging: ""Heart-warming stories of volunteers insulating the primary school roof have become a distraction,"" says Myles Allen, who believes the future lies in carbon capture and storage.

""We currently enjoy a free lunch, because energy, food and cement prices do not include the costs of decarbonisation. The sooner politicians are upfront with people about this, the better.""


Name: Stefan Rahmstorf Age: 49 Nationality: German Position: Head of Earth System Analysis, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact ResearchExpertise: Oceans

Mr Sea Level Rise fixes me with a steely gaze. We are sitting in a coffee shop close to the Oxford college where he is addressing a climate conference with his boss, John Schellnhuber. The two men are popular with the media, but some colleagues complain that they are too close to the policymakers and activists.

Rahmstorf, who is visiting from Potsdam, a university town strong in the sciences, projects a sense of both order and impatience. He argues that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has massively underestimated the rise in sea levels. Having tracked data for the past 120 years, he found that, above a certain equilibrium, a rise in temperature caused a proportionate increase in sea level. And when he compared the observations against the models for the years 1961 to 2003, the sea level had risen 50 per cent faster (1.8mm per year) than the models had predicted it would (1.2mm).

American oceanographer Carl Wunsch (see below) dismisses Rahmstorf's findings, saying adequate measurement of the oceans only goes back 20 years: ""People who claim to know what the ocean was doing 100 years ago are telling you fairy tales."" But Rahmstorf insists his curve fits recent figures. Since satellite measurements began in 1993, sea level has risen by 3.4mm a year. The IPCC notes the models' inaccuracy in its full report, he says, yet makes no attempt to alter its projections. Neither will it include estimates for the melting icecaps. ""A normal person would conclude 'maybe we can't trust the models'. But the models are simply taken as gospel for the future."" Rahmstorf believes the oceans will rise three times faster than the IPCC's highest projections. Assuming a 4°C temperature rise by 2100, that would also mean a rise in sea level of 1.2 metres.

Rahmstorf believes that unless emissions are under control by 2020, there will be no time to prevent warming going above 2°C. A member of the German government's Advisory Council on Global Change, he has issued a plan for how we can avoid such a rise. It gives every nation in the world a carbon allowance for the years up to 2050.

At current consumption levels, the US would exhaust its allowance by 2016. To give them time to adjust, rich countries can pay developing nations to share their allowance. Rahmstorf believes the payments will enable developing economies to ""leapfrog the dirty model"" practised by industrialised nations in the last century.

Personal stance: No air travel for holidays. Doesn't own a car and cycles to work. His house is insulated, cutting energy use by 60 per cent. His ""sins"" are buying bananas and having a long shower every morning.


Name: John Mitchel lAge: 61 Nationality: BritishPosition: Director of Climate Science, Met OfficeExpertise: Climate modelling

After 36 years at the Met Office, including a spell writing the shipping forecast, John Mitchell has a weather-beaten mind. In person, there is no smug air of foreknowledge. Yet this softly spoken rugby fan from County Down in Northern Ireland is one of the most experienced climate modellers in the world.

Modelling is a contentious area. There's so much we don't fully understand about the climate - clouds, hurricanes, ice melting, aerosols - that questions remain over the ability of super-computers to model future climate. One experiment - Climateprediction.net, which generated thousands of versions of the Met Office's climate model and got people to run them on their home PCs - showed that models will produce radically different results if you make minor adjustments to their parameters. The week before I met Mitchell, the Met Office was forced to defend its ""barbecue summer"" press release - proving the difficulty of making even seasonal predictions.

Mitchell takes such criticism calmly. ""Essentially, a model is based on Newton's Laws of Motion. All we're trying to do with the models is quantify [the warming] better and say what the regional changes are.""

In practice, that means taking balloon and satellite measurements for temperature, winds and humidity in the atmosphere and using equations to give you a rate of change. It is always going to be an approximate picture but he insists there is a ""strong resemblance"" with what happens in reality.

Big obstacles remain. ""There's so much variation out there,"" he says, pointing through the window. ""How do you model that? Clouds are the 'Achilles' heel' of modelling.""

But modelling power is increasing all the time. This summer, the government gave people access to detailed regional climate projections for the coming decades. The modelling was done by the Met Office - and though many scientists are uncomfortable with such ""postcode predictions"", saying they send out an overconfident message about our understanding of the future, Mitchell is proud that the US is now considering following suit.

Personal stance: Takes small steps - turning down the thermostat and unplugging his mobile phone charger.


Name: Rajendra Pachauri Age: 69 Nationality: IndianPosition: Chair, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeExpertise: Energy efficiency

Two years ago Dr RK Pachauri shared with Al Gore the Nobel Peace Prize for their work on climate change. If Gore was the populist showman, Pachauri was the diligent committee man, accepting the prize on behalf of the IPCC (which he has chaired since 2002).

The IPCC is in effect a huge machine for reaching scientific consensus on global warming. From its creation in 1988, it has brought together thousands of the world's climate experts to draft reports on the latest authoritative data and predictions. At the time of Pachauri's nomination for the post, Gore called him the ""let's drag our feet candidate"". Yet while he is not strictly a ""climate scientist"", he plays a crucial role in creating consensus, particularly among the world's developing nations.

Pachauri rejects the view that population is as big an issue as reducing per capita emissions. ""In North America,"" he argues, ""they have emissions of over 20 tonnes per capita per year, while in Bangladesh it's half a tonne.""

But surely the point is that South Asia's per capita emissions will catch up? ""That's precisely why a country like India should not allow its emissions to reach anywhere near [those of] the developed world."" He argues that India will have a very different pattern of development to the west with ""large-scale mass transport systems"" instead of cars, and energy-efficient buildings.

Meanwhile, industrialised nations will have to cut back fast. ""My big concern,"" he says, ""are the people living in several regions of the world where there is no infrastructure, no capability or financial strength to deal with the impact of climate change.""

Personal stance: Has given up meat, and only uses air-con on a moderate setting.


Name: Myles Allen Age: 44 Nationality: BritishPosition: Head of Climate Dynamics, Department of Physics, University of OxfordExpertise: Statistics and modelling

Myles Allen's young son John, who has been patiently reading in the corner, gets up and writes on the office whiteboard: ""Myles is a penguin."" His father thanks him wryly, before launching back into his discourse on carbon sequestration. But there is something of the penguin about this freethinking statistician, who combines upper-crust vowels with the awkward charm of Griff Rhys-Jones.

Allen believes the current approach to tackling climate change is ill-conceived. His latest paper, published earlier this year in Nature, argues we should be looking at the total amount of carbon that humankind emits, not the rate at which we do so - the measure the negotiators in Copenhagen will be focusing on.

He shows me a graph with three different curves representing the same amount of carbon being emitted over different timescales. ""Temperature response is identical,"" he says. ""It's much easier to frame the problem if you say 'what's the total amount of carbon we can afford to inject into the atmosphere' rather than what concentration should we be aiming for."" Yet because of the way the Rio Earth summit and Kyoto Protocol configured the problem, negotiations at Copenhagen are heading in the wrong direction.

Journalists are always asking Allen to say that unless emissions peak by 2015 we will pass a tipping point. He won't, because he says such claims are nonsense. Worse, to pretend such arbitrary targets have a scientific basis will only disillusion the public once they find out the targets are going to be missed.

But isn't it necessary to tell white lies in order to get what you want? ""There's just no point"", he says, looking over at his son before adding: ""They'll find you out!""

Personal stance: Cycles to work but loves Top Gear - ""fossil fuels are fun"". Believes focus on personal behaviour is a distraction.


Name: Tim Lenton Age: 36 Nationality: BritishPosition: Professor of Earth Systems Science, University of East AngliaExpertise: Earth systems science

Tim Lenton is James Lovelock's anointed successor. As an undergraduate he read Lovelock's The Ages of Gaia (a book which argues that the earth and its biosphere function as one complex system), and subsequently wrote to the author saying he wanted to do research in his field. It led to an ""amazing"" meeting - and the two have stayed in touch.

Today the protégé takes a different line to the mentor on climate change. Both are worried about positive feedbacks from the climate system - a domino effect of warming - but Lenton does not share Lovelock's apocalyptic vision. ""We've agreed to disagree about the level of hope we should have for the future,"" he says.

We are talking in the front room of his house in a quiet residential street in Norwich. Hardly the climate change frontline. And yet, in 2007, the freshwater Norfolk Broads were nearly flooded after storm surge conditions at sea. ""At some point - maybe in the next 50 years - we'll see the Broads revert towards a salt marsh ecosystem,"" he says.

While others work in decades or centuries, Lenton thinks in millions of years. The book he's working on chronicles Gaia's instability, focusing on abrupt changes such as a leap in the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere 2.5 billion years ago. ""My question is: 'are we at the start of another revolution?'"" He guesses that by the time his son James is 80, we will either be recycling energy and materials, or be on the way to a world of ""unpleasantries"".

Personal stance: Keen cyclist but also drives a Renault Clio. Holidays in the UK, but his wife is from New Zealand so they are using up a hefty dose of ""love miles"" this Christmas to see family.


Name: Kevin Trenberth Age: 65 Nationality: Dual New Zealand and US citizenshipPosition: Head of climate analysis, National Centre for Atmospheric Research, ColoradoExpertise: Hurricanes

There is a big debate about whether climate change is causing more devastating storms. Some say the increase in hurricanes could simply be the result of natural variability.

New Zealander Kevin Trenberth, on the other hand, is sure of the impact that climate change is having on hurricanes: he says it is causing more devastating storms. But he's less sure what effect hurricanes have on global warming.

Hurricanes tend to cool things down. They leave a cold wake in oceans, and the extra rainfall they bring helps keep the land a bit cooler, too. Climate models do not currently have a good grip on this cooling effect - so the projections for tropical sea temperatures in them may well be higher than they should be. Therefore, argues Trenberth, the number of projected future hurricanes is probably being overestimated.

That said, when the storms do occur, he is certain they'll be of greater intensity. Water vapour in the atmosphere helps fuel storms - and according to Trenberth it has increased by 4 per cent over the ocean since 1970. He traces that rise to the 0.6°C rise in global temperatures in that same period; as temperatures rise, the atmosphere is able to hold more water vapour.

Many scientists argue that his native New Zealand will be largely protected from climate change's most severe effects - thanks to its maritime climate. But Trenberth points out that energy price hikes will drive up shipping costs - and if as a result other countries start growing their own food, exports will be hit hard.

Personal action: He has fitted solar panels, a new heat pump and water heater in his home.


Name: Chris Rapley Age: 62 Nationality: BritishPosition: Director of the Science Museum Expertise: Earth systems science

As a man who has moved between the different branches of climate science, Chris Rapley is well placed to judge his colleagues: ""There's a whole spectrum of views out there,"" he says. ""Some of the science is clear-cut,"" but there are some big uncertainties. Will all the methane in the permafrost be released? What will be the rate of warming? Nobody knows what the world will look like in 50 years, but Rapley is confident it will be a warmer place facing a thousand years of rising oceans.

In 2005, he contributed to the Exeter conference on ""avoiding climate change"" commissioned by Tony Blair. His paper warned that the vast ice sheet on the western side of Antarctica might be starting to break up. As a result, he said, the IPCC would have to revise its prediction that the ice sheet was safe for 1,000 years. The following year he told the American Association for the Advancement of Science: ""Only five years ago, Antarctica was characterised as a slumbering giant in terms of climate change. I would argue that it is now an awakened giant, and we should take notice.""

Recently he's become more pessimistic about our ability to prevent serious warming. While there is no shortage of human ingenuity, rhetoric or Nobel Prizes, the emissions trajectory has not turned downwards. ""Unless Copenhagen leads to deceleration in the emissions curve then I think we're going to have to be very pessimistic about the future,"" he says.

He is not a deep green eco-warrior. He's a Formula 1 fan and describes Jeremy Clarkson as a ""really intelligent guy and great supporter of the museum"". But he wishes the Top Gear presenter would tone down his views on climate change, which he fears encourage people to cock a snoop at ""that global warming shit"". The stakes are too high for such pantomime acts.

Hundreds of years from now Rapley believes London, New York and Amsterdam will be under water. But it is the short-term, rapid deadlines of the modern world that scare him most. ""We saw with the economic crash it takes hours for things to go wrong. And when [in 2000] the petrol tankers went on blockade, there was a very frightening timescale - about a week for the supermarkets to run out of food, fear of food riots and civil disorder.""

He ""hates being apocalyptic"" but says his grandchildren will have to choose how to minimise their exposure to the risks. ""You'll find serious people talking about buying an AK47 and a small farm in northern Canada or Scandinavia, forming a commune to grow food and protect themselves in case the wheels come off society.""

Personal stance: Wanders around the museum switching off lights. But believes corporations hold the key to cutting emissions.


Name: Susan SolomonAge: 53Nationality: AmericanPosition: Senior scientist, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, ColoradoExpertise: Atmospheric chemistry

Susan Solomon was one of the first scientists to explain why the ozone hole was forming over Antarctica, and in 2007 she oversaw the historic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report which said it was 90 per cent certain that the bulk of global warming that has occurred since 1950 had been man-made. Still, she believes in keeping the science ""pure"" and rejects the idea that her profession has a duty to speak out on global warming.

This conservative approach frustrates activists and some fellow scientists. In the report's sea level projections, she excluded estimates for the impact of melting ice caps because modelling such a process is fraught with uncertainty. Neither would she discuss the policy response or make emotional appeals.

Almost three years on, Solomon believes she's been vindicated: ""There's an enormous amount of emotion on this subject, influenced by both the left and right."" The job of the IPCC is to present the science with the minimum of speculation, she says.

She is convinced that unless emissions are seriously reduced, the world in 2060 will be between 2°C and 3°C hotter. A deal will be tough she says, contrasting her own tribe with the political animal. ""If you sit 20 politicians in a room you won't get them to agree on anything,"" she says. ""But bring scientists together, and at the end of a sensible discussion of the data you'll all agree.""

But Solomon is hopeful that public pressure will bring about an eleventh-hour breakthrough at Copenhagen. ""Whenever I hear a person say this or that is impossible, I think back to the ozone layer days when people said it would be impossible to phase out CFCs from deodorant.""

Asked about the life her step-son's generation can be expected to live, she flares up briefly, arguing that such emoting is unhelpful: ""I don't know which way we're going to come out. But I want the scientific historians to be clear: scientists had primitive tools and limited information, but they played this one right.""

Personal stance: Tries to eat vegetarian twice a week, cycles, drives a Prius.


Name: Carl Wunsch Age: 68Nationality: AmericanPosition: Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physical Oceanography, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyExpertise: Oceanography

To many scientists, Carl Wunsch is the world's top oceanographer. Yet to the layman he is best known as the professor duped into appearing in Channel 4's 2007 programme The Great Global Warming Swindle. Wunsch was horrified to see his nuanced statements taken out of context to back the programme's dodgy premise. The broadcasting regulator Ofcom subsequently upheld his complaint and Channel 4 was obliged to broadcast a summary of its findings.

In reality, Wunsch accepts the evidence for climate change, though he worries about what he considers overconfident predictions - and he may be unique amongst senior colleagues in having turned down the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's invitation to participate. He accepts the organisation's usefulness but believes it moves too fast for the available data and has played down some of the uncertainties to catch the eyes of politicians.

On the other hand, Stefan Rahmstorf (see above) says Wunsch's comments on the show were not only irresponsible but wrong. ""They feed the message that the [film] makers wanted to portray."" Perhaps understandably, Wunsch and Rahmstorf have little time for each other. Early in our conversation, Wunsch bemoans the fact that some of his colleagues are guilty of ""overstating"" what we know to fit the media's demand for simple answers.

""Often the right answer is 'we don't really know but we're worried about the possibilities'."" The ocean has a long memory, he says, yet our observations of it are ""grossly inadequate"". Unless you understand what is happening in the south Atlantic or northern Pacific, you are flying blind, he argues.

Accordingly, Wunsch takes a small-picture view. ""Why has Arctic sea ice recovered partially in the last two years?"" he asks. ""What does this mean for the 'tipping point' that people talk of?""

In essence, he wishes people would stop making projections that read like strong probabilities and instead see climate change as ""an insurance problem"" - where we don't know what will happen but acknowledge there is the potential for something serious to occur, and take precautions.

Like many scientists, he is less inhibited when straying from his patch. Stabilising world population should be the number-one priority and yet the politicians are ""too spineless"" to talk about such a thorny issue. ""If the world goes to 9 and then 12 billion it won't matter what the climate does,"" he sighs. ""It'll be catastrophic.""

Personal stance: Travels mainly by public transport but also drives a Prius. He has insulated his home.


Name: Isaac HeldAge: 61Nationality: AmericanPosition: Senior research scientist at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Professor at PrincetonExpertise: Climate dynamics

Isaac Held was born in a German refugee camp three years after the end of the second world war, to a mother who had survived Auschwitz. Several years later, the family secured their passage to the US and began a new life in Minnesota.

Held did a PhD in physics at New York State University (Stony Brook) but was lacking inspiration until he read a paper on carbon dioxide and climate by Syukuro Manabe, today regarded as one of the pioneers of climate modelling. Held moved to Princeton where he has remained for the past four decades. Today, he is one of the world's foremost experts on predicting regional climate change. As the German oceanographer Mojib Latif says: ""He's not as visible to politicians as others, but he's one of the best scientists - someone who really understands how the whole climate machine works.""

He believes that changes in rainfall patterns will have the most direct impact on people's lives. In simple terms, he says, ""the wet places will get wetter and the dry drier"". In the Mediterranean - one of the easiest regions to model - a 3°C temperature rise would cut rainfall by 20 per cent. The real uncertainties lie in the tropics, although Held suspects that the region will be one of the biggest losers from climate change. His research on drought shows how interconnected the climate system is. The dramatic decline in rainfall over the Sahel - a horizontal sub-Saharan strip that stretches from Senegal to Eritrea - during the 1970s and 1980s has been commonly ascribed to overgrazing.

Held's research suggests the real cause has been the warming of the South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans during the latter half of the 20th century. Together with the hole in the ozone layer, the warmer oceans have had a similar impact on Australia's rainfall. Unfortunately, it's not possible to know which is the dominant factor for Australia, he says. If it's the ozone layer, then the situation should gradually improve. Otherwise, the land will get drier still.

Held follows the maxim of the medieval philosopher William of Ockham - forget complicated hypotheses if the simple explanation fits. ""The case has not been made for any specific tipping point,"" he says. ""We haven't seen that irreversibility. The climate system has so far behaved much as one would expect it to. Climate change means a steady warming with the impacts of warming growing bigger over time.""

Others, such as Latif, argue that we're in for a decade of cooling before the warming trend reasserts itself. Quite plausible, Held replies, saying that natural variability may have been underestimated in the rapid warming of the last 30 years. But in the long term, global warming will continue.

Richard Lindzen is by turns charming and cantankerous. ""That is the stupidest question I've ever heard!"" he yells when I ask whether global warming is occurring. Later, as I outline the layman's notion of what warming means, he barks: ""Stop this bullshit!"" When I cite a spokesman for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change saying the world warmed by 0.6°C over the 20th century, he puts it down to the natural variability of the climate.

Raised in the Bronx and educated at Harvard, Lindzen is the most respected of the climate change naysayers among other scientists. Arguing that CO2's impact on climate has been overstated, he says that emissions can keep growing with no consequences. The pre-industrial level of CO2 was 280 parts per million, we are now at 380ppm and the negotiators at Copenhagen want to stabilise it at about 450ppm. But Lindzen says we can safely climb past 10,00ppm. Even if for some reason there is an impact, we will have ample time to see it coming, he claims.

Contrary to what the models say, he argues that the world has not warmed over the past decade. We've underestimated natural variability, he says. And in the context of ""only"" 0.6°C of warming, the argument that man has caused most of it is not tenable. His critics say his emphasis on the past 10 years is a red herring. Assertions of climate change were not based on a 10-year trend but on a 30- to 50-year period.

Lindzen is convinced that global warming will one day be exposed as a con. ""I hope,"" he says, ""it's in my lifetime.""

Personal stance: Drives a small car, uses energy-saving lightbulbs and says he probably uses less energy than ""the climate change activists in Washington with their Mercedes""."
"FT REPORT - UNDERSTANDING ENERGY POLICY, Wednesday, December 2, 2009 1007 mots, p. 6",,Trading places,,,"By Fiona Harvey

Nearly all of the world's governments have pledged to do their best to secure a deal on cutting greenhouse gas emissions at the UN's conference on climate change in Copenhagen next week. Whether their words translate into action at the conference remains a matter of fevered speculation, and a deal is far from assured.

But if governments are serious, they must shortly begin implementing a wide range of policies that will ultimately affect every sector of the economy.

The direction was made clear earlier this year in the world's biggest economy, when Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, was given the role of combating global warming. His first message to business was stark, as he set out the policy imperatives of the Obama administration.

""High carbon goods will become untenable,"" he says. ""How good will the business judgment of companies that make high-carbon choices now look in five, 10, 20 years, when it becomes clear that heavily polluting infrastructure has become deadly and must be phased out before the end of its useful life?"" All of the biggest economies have enacted measures aimed at reducing emissions, cutting inefficiencies and diversifying their energy supply. A growing number of smaller economies are also putting in place policies that would cut or curb the growth of their greenhouse gas output. Even if the Copenhagen talks fail, it will be difficult for countries to row back on these commitments, having proclaimed the importance of tackling climate change.

""The trend is clear. We are moving towards a low carbon economy,"" says Lord Stern, author of the landmark Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change. ""Investors should be able to see clearly where we are headed."" In his 2006 report, Lord Stern, a former World Bank chief economist and adviser to the UK government, set out three main methods of legislating for greenhouse gas reduction. These were: carbon trading; taxes on carbon or energy; and regulations to force companies and consumers on to a lower carbon path, such as a minimum efficiency level for vehicles.

Of these policy instruments, carbon trading has attracted the most attention. The reason is simple: it has the best chance of becoming a truly global mechanism for both reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the lowest possible cost, and directing private sector finance to bringing low carbon technology to poor countries.

The first international system of carbon trading was set up under the 1997 Kyoto protocol, whereby rich countries can meet their obligations to reduce emissions by investing in projects such as wind farms or solar power generation in the developing world. This carries the double benefit of being cheaper for the developed world, and bringing low carbon infrastructure to poor regions that could not otherwise afford it.

Last year, the global carbon market was worth more than $125bn, in spite of the financial crisis.

But the carbon markets under Kyoto are in peril. The current ""commitment period"" of the protocol, under which most developed countries have taken on emissions targets, is scheduled to end in 2012, and as yet there is no framework to replace it. Furthermore, the US has never ratified the Kyoto pact, leaving the world's biggest economy out of the market. Governments are set to negotiate a new global framework on climate change at Copenhagen, and that could include a truly global carbon trading system. However, there is so little time left that talks over such finance mechanisms may have to run into next year. The US is also reluctant to submit to an international system, preferring to set up its own system that may connect to other markets in future, so a global carbon trading system may remain out of reach.

In spite of these disadvantages, carbon trading may still represent the best chance the world has of tackling climate change. Alternatives, such as a tax on carbon, are fraught with yet more difficulties.

On the plus side, carbon trading has been embraced by most of the developed world governments, albeit with differing levels of enthusiasm, as a means of bringing down emissions within their own countries. The European Union took an early lead with the start of its emissions trading scheme in 2005. This system covers most of the EU's heavy industries, such as energy generation, steel, glass and paper, and is to be extended to sectors such as aviation.

Under the scheme, companies are issued with a quota of permits to produce carbon dioxide each year. The number of permits available is gradually ratcheted down, so that companies taking steps to reduce their emissions benefit from being able to sell their spare permits to laggards.

Other countries that have accepted the Kyoto protocol have followed suit with proposals for emissions trading systems of their own, including Japan, Canada and Australia. However, these systems face opposition from some sectors of industry and in some cases have been watered down.

The US is also considering a cap-and-trade system covering at least 85 per cent of emissions from its industry. Though legislation was passed by the House of Representatives by a narrow margin this summer, and has the support of the White House, the bill faces uncertain prospects in the Senate, where it is currently in committee.

Whether carbon trading becomes a truly global system will depend to an enormous extent on whether a cap-and-trade scheme is enacted by the US.

International discussions of a new framework on emissions have fallen under this shadow.

Gernot Wagner, economist at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US, is confident that a capand- trade system will be passed: ""It's far from inevitable, but all the signs point in the right direction,"" he says.

But the bill faces stiff opposition from many sectors of industry and most Republican lawmakers.

Some of the other policy instruments for cutting greenhouse gases are yet more controversial than carbon trading. Carbon taxes already exist in the form of fuel taxes that penalise use. But while these are implicit carbon taxes, getting public agreement for one that is explicit is likely to be difficult: surveys have shown that people are willing to countenance measures to combat climate change, but when asked specifically about taxes, they tend to lose their enthusiasm markedly.

Other instruments are also in use. Many jurisdictions - including China, the US and Europe - impose minimum efficiency requirements on vehicles. Standards to ensure that less energy is wasted from buildings are also common. Other regulations are being tightened. The EU recently legislated to outlaw incandescent light bulbs, which waste as useless heat more than 95 per cent of the energy they use, in favour of energy-efficient models. Efficiency ratings on energy-using equipment are also made available in Europe, and other parts of the world, by which consumers can judge the value of goods.

Environmental regulation has been tightened more often than loosened in most countries in the past year. A prime example has been the US Environmental Protection Agency's decision - controversial in some quarters but backed by judicial review - to class carbon dioxide as a pollutant that it can regulate, in the same way as it regulates forms of air and water pollution.

This could open the way to strict controls on greenhouse gas emissions in the US, independently of whether cap-and-trade regulations are passed. It remains to be seen how this power may be used. Other jurisdictions will watch the development with interest."
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, November 30, 2009 446 mots, p. 1",,Move to see climate issue go main line,By Pauline Skypala,,"News analysisRailpen is quizzing its advisers on their approach to climate change, writes Pauline Skypala

One of the UK's biggest pension funds will today seek to make climate change a key issue for its advisers and the 40 investment managers mandated to run money for the fund.

Railpen, the £17bn (€18.7bn, $29bn) fund for railway employees, will be sending out detailed questionnaires to probe the extent to which managers take climate change seriously, how it affects their investment process, and what they see as their fiduciary duty.

Devised in collaboration with HSBC and Linklaters, the 77 questions will be freely available to any other asset owner that wants to quiz its advisers and managers.

Frank Curtiss, head of corporate governance at Railpen Investments, said the initiative was not the first in this area but was ""the most sophisticated"", particularly on the legal issues. ""We have to be comfortable our advisers and managers are taking on these risks so we need to open up a dialogue.""

He said there had been a strong focus on short-term returns and a view that researching environmental, social and governance issues was a niche area.

Gordon Morrison, global head of equity trading analytics at HSBC, said the real point of the effort was to ensure returns for asset owners do not disappear. ""We need to make a huge transition to a low carbon economy in a short time. We have a big pool of existing assets that is not necessarily structured for a low carbon economy.""

Mr Morrison pointed to regulatory moves elsewhere, notably in the US, where insurers will be required to submit annual climate risk reports from May 2010. There is no parallel in Europe. This may change if asset owners signal they see this sort of reporting as a starting point to deal with the issue.

There are a number of industry-led initiatives. Insurers have set up ClimateWise, an international group that commits to action on climate change against six principles. Launched by Prince Charles in 2007, the group last week published its second independent review.

European asset managers and owners can join the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which encourages a proactive approach to climate change among its members and disclosure by companies. Railpen is not a member because it felt the £5,000 annual fee was too much of its members' money to commit.

With the latest initiative, which involved a time commitment rather than cash, Railpen hopes to act as a catalyst. ""The investment community needs to become substantially more sophisticated and more engaged. Tools like this will help,"" said Mr Curtiss.

One area where he hopes to move the debate forward is the legal issue of fiduciary duty. ""People hide behind fiduciary duty as an excuse to do nothing,"" he said.

The legal requirement on asset owners to act prudently and in the best interests of beneficiaries is narrowly interpreted by some as a duty to maximise return. ""Duties have been understood in a particular way by the investment industry,"" said Vanessa Havard-Williams, partner at Linklaters.

She said the legal obligation had to be considered in the overall regulatory and scientific context. ""It does not exist in isolation.""

Regulation could fill some of the gap, but was not yet in place, she added. ""The science is there but the regulation is not. So you have an exposure but it is not signalled to you."""
"Friday, June 26, 2009 479 mots",,Annan and Geldof launch climate campaign,By Tim Bradshaw in Cannes,,"Kofi Annan, the former secretary-general of the United Nations, and Bob Geldof, the founder of Live Aid, launched a new ""climate justice"" campaign on Friday ahead of December's UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.

The campaign, dubbed ""tck tck tck: Time for Climate Justice"", will see advertising agencies and major organisations such as HSBC and Oxfam use mass marketing to call on world leaders to agree a ""just and binding deal"" on climate change.

The ""tck tck tck"" campaign aims to emulate the success of Band Aid and Lance Armstrong's Livestrong to create the world's largest petition in support of climate justice.

A campaign song, which sees various musicians including Duran Duran cover Australian band Midnight Oil's ""Beds are burning"", will be released in September as a free internet download. People will be able to upload a video of their own ""tck"", creating a virtual human clock, counting down to Copenhagen.

Desmond Tutu and actors Jet Li and Milla Jovovich are among the celebrities lending their support to the project, alongside Google's YouTube.

Speaking at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, Mr Annan said time was running out in the fight against climate change.

""The clock is ticking around the world, we have no time to waste,"" he said.

He added that marketing campaigns on climate change too often focused on polar bears on melting ice caps and neglected the human impact.

""We tend to worry a lot about the loss of biodiversity. We forget that we are part of that biodiversity and we need some protection.""

The Nobel peace prize winner also warned that developing countries suffered disproportionately from the effects of climate change, which is largely caused by emissions in the West.

""Copenhagen presents a truly historic opportunity to agree the steps this crisis demands. It must be global, it must be fair and it must be binding ... We have to accept the 'polluter pays' principle, that pollution has a price and the polluter must pay,"" he said. ""Those who are bicycling should not subsidise those who insist on driving their SUVs.""

Mr Geldof emphasised the cost of tackling climate change, which he put at $1,000bn, or 1.6 per cent of global annual gross domestic product.

""We need to cut our emissions in the developed world by 80 per cent by 2050,"" he said.

Mr Geldof called on delegates at the Cannes advertising festival - where attendance is down around 40 per cent on last year - to focus their creative talents on driving public awareness of ""proper politics"".

""You are creatively some of the most intelligent people on the planet gathered in one space. You are the most powerful potential political tool,"" he said

The tck tck tck campaign was developed by EuroRSCG Worldwide, a division of French advertising group Havas. A video advert, soundtracked by Coldplay, has been released online and more will appear in TV and print soon.

David Jones, global chief executive of Havas Worldwide, encouraged other brands and advertisers to pick up and reuse the ""tck tck tck"" logo, for free, to demonstrate their commitment to corporate social responsibility.

""If 1 per cent of the world's advertisers put this on their advertising it would be the biggest campaign in the world,"" he said.  He also encouraged the media to donate free advertising space to the campaign. ""There's a bit of it around at the moment. We'd love some of that, thank you.""

Mr Jones said that advertising agencies could help to raise the profile of the Copenhagen summit, and therefore increase pressure on politicians. ""Our belief, my belief is that what our industry is great at is changing people's behaviour,"" he said."
"Sunday, October 18, 2009 372 mots",,Industry urged to embrace action on climate,By Kevin Brown in Singapore and Fiona Harvey in London,,"Industry should embrace stronger environmental controls, a leading chemicals manufacturer has urged, as ministers from the world's biggest polluting countries meet in London for the final stages of climate change talks that will culminate in Copenhagen in December.

Peter Huntsman, chief executive of Huntsman, told the Financial Times that the US and European Union should act together to raise environmental standards for manufacturing and force global competitors to comply as a condition of access to their markets.

""Our industry ought to be out fighting for environmental controls, we ought to be fighting for a higher standard instead of falling to the lowest common denominator,"" Mr Huntsman said.

However, his remarks may be seen as protectionist, since any attempt by the US and EU to link environmental controls directly to trade could be seen as a way of excluding competitors in the developing world from the largest western markets.

In London Todd Stern, President Barack Obama's special envoy for climate change, said developing countries must do more than they have agreed so far to curb emissions growth.

""Where they are right now is almost certainly not enough, if you're talking about getting toward a place that's in the vicinity of holding the temperature increase to 2 degrees [a level which scientists say is the limit of safety],"" he said. ""It's very important for China to do what they are doing and more than that.""

Public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic is firmly in favour of China taking on the lion's share of cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, according to a Harris poll taken for the Financial Times. At the same time people are lukewarm about providing funds to the developing world to adapt to climate change. But Mr Stern said a deal was still possible in December at the climate change summit in Copenhagen, where countries will try to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto protocol.

""There's a deal to be had,"" he said. ""There are difficulties but not that many elements [needed] to put together a basic deal,"" he said.

The US has yet to put forward a target for cutting emissions but Mr Stern said it was clear in what range such a target would fall, as the bill on cap-and-trade requires cuts of 17 per cent by 2020 and the current Senate bill cuts of 20 per cent.

Speaking in Singapore, Mr Huntsman accused his own industry in the US and Europe of continuing ""to fight against environmental legislation that by and large the general public want . . . We seem to be continually coming down on the wrong side of history.""

Mr Huntsman said he was ""not a protectionist"", pointing out that 40 per cent of his company's manufacturing operations were outside the US and Europe. ""If the US and Europe would act in unison around environmental standards, I think you would be both protecting local industries and promoting environmental sustainability,"" he said."
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, October 19, 2009 350 mots, p. 14",,Climate change opportunities catching on,By Sophia Grene,,"""This is real, hard-core, capitalism. This is the biggest investment trend of all time."" Kevin Parker, global head of Deutsche Bank's asset management division is talking about climate change.

For the past four years, Mr Parker has been evangelising among both his own fund managers and the broader investment community about climate change. The burden of his message is that climate change is real and therefore a source of both investment risk and opportunity.

""We've built a $100 trillion economy based on fossil fuels - now all of the assumptions that's based on are being destroyed,"" he says. ""If you really believe we will move to a low carbon economy, there's going to have to be tectonic shifts in the markets.""

To some extent, he thinks, an understanding of climate change's impact on companies is already feeding through into stock prices. ""The stock market tends to discount factors far earlier than the public. What the market is beginning to tell us is that the externality of carbon emissions will be priced.""

Companies that emit high levels of carbon will have to pay for the damage they do to the environment, so investors are not prepared to pay as high prices for them as their low carbon peers. ""It's not widespread, it's not a rush for the door, but there is a recognition,"" he claims.

Despite this belief in the efficiency of markets, Mr Parker has yet to convince most of his own fund managers that climate change should be part of their thinking. An internal product - ""Carbon Beta"" - that attempts to show how levels of carbon emission relate to stock valuations has been created in an attempt to prove to the Deutsche Bank investment managers they can find an informational advantage by focusing on the issue.

""Most of our managers are not convinced yet. Investment managers are paid to be sceptical, so they put up a big hurdle for the research guys to prove there was alpha there. Now a healthy debate will ensue.""

While the Deutsche fund managers argue over whether using information about a company's environmental impact can help make better investment decisions, Mr Parker's campaign to bring the problem to the attention of the world is doing slightly better.

Since the summer, a huge screen showing the number of metric tons of carbon in the earth's atmosphere has been displayed outside Madison Square Garden in New York.

The Carbon Counter , sponsored by Deutsche Bank, is Mr Parker's pet project. With some pride, he counts up the number of cities that want to use a version of it - 14 at latest count. He may still be struggling to convince his fund managers, but the PR campaign is a hit."
"OBAMA IN ASIA, Monday, November 16, 2009 466 mots, p. 3",,No binding agreement but still hope for progress,,,"Barack Obama, the US president, said yesterday that next month's summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, would not produce a legally binding agreement to tackle global warming. So what have his comments done to any hope of a deal on climate change?

What has happened?

Mr Obama says that instead of a binding treaty, he and other world leaders are aiming for a ""political agreement"" on the substantive issues.

What do other countries think?

The United Nations, the European Union and other nations had already conceded that there was not enough time to draw up a full legal treaty at Copenhagen, so they too are aiming for a political agreement, to be followed by a full treaty next year.

What is a political agreement and how is it different from a treaty?

A political agreement would not be legally binding under international law. But it would be a document that leaders or their representatives would have to sign, and it would be difficult and politically embarrassing for them to break it subsequently.

So this is a big problem for Copenhagen?

No. Even if Copenhagen were to produce a legally binding treaty, that document would have no real legal force until it was ratified by the nations.

Why are people complaining?

Having to wait until next year for a treaty to be drawn up will mean a delay to the process of implementing any agreement, which must be done by the end of 2012 for a new global framework on emissions to be in force when the current provisions of the Kyoto protocol expire. Any delay increases the possibility of disagreement.

What would a Copenhagen ""political agreement"" contain?

For countries to sign it, a political agreement would have to set out four main commitments. These are: targets for developed countries to make big cuts in their emissions by 2020; agreement on the measures that developing countries would take to curb the future growth of their emissions; financing from rich to poor countries to help them curb their emissions and cope with climate change; and an outline of the governance structures to monitor and deliver the above. Are countries agreed on these?

Not yet, but nearly. Almost all the big developed countries have now set out their emissions-cutting targets for 2020, and the main developing economies have outlined the measures they will take to curb their emissions growth. Agreement on governance issues should not be too difficult to achieve.

So what is not agreed?

The US has not agreed 2020 emissions-cutting targets and until that happens many developing countries will not agree to ""internationalise"" their domestic commitments on emissions - that is, to codify them ready to be legally binding at an international level. Finance is also tricky: the EU is the only developed group of countries to have set out commitments on financing, and even those are vague. What's holding up the US?

Mr Obama has not yet managed to pass domestic cap-and-trade legislation, which would set out the US's emissions-cutting targets and some financial help for poor countries. The bill is now before the Senate, but there is almost no chance it will pass before the Copenhagen summit, and its prospects of passing next year are still in doubt. Without the backing of Congress, Mr Obama will find it difficult to make commitments.

And if he cannot make these commitments?

There might be no agreement at Copenhagen, or only a partial agreement, excluding the US.

Would that be disastrous?

It would leave the world without a global framework for tackling climate change."
"NATIONAL NEWS, Monday, October 19, 2009 139 mots, p. 2",,Brown to warn on global warming,By James Boxell,,"Gordon Brown will today issue his most dire warning yet on the threat of global warming, arguing that it will be ""irretrievably too late"" to halt environmental catastrophe if agreement is not reached at December's climate change summit in Copenhagen, writes James Boxell.

The comments will be made in a speech to the Major Economies Forum in London, bringing together 17 of the world's biggest greenhouse gas-emitting countries.

Ministers hope the talks will improve the chances of a climate change treaty being agreed at the summit.

There has been some progress ahead of the summit on matters such as developing countries dropping demands for access to rich countries' technology. But there are still concerns that progress is stalled in other areas, notably on the issue of financial assistance to poor nations. Mr Brown will say: ""I believe agreement at Copenhagen is possible. But we must frankly face the plain fact that our negotiators are not getting to agreement quickly enough. So I believe that leaders must engage directly to break the impasse."""
"Monday, December 7, 2009 532 mots",,The Economics and Politics of Climate Change,Review by Crispin Tickell,,"The Economics and Politics of Climate ChangeEdited by Dieter Helm and Cameron HepburnOxford University Press £30, 538 pages

The United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen is almost upon us. Preparations for it have attracted unprecedented public debate on climate change and what should be done about it. There is always a long and unsteady bridge between the science underlying a problem and the economics and politics involved, all the more so when the issues are truly global. Everything is further complicated by the continuing financial and credit crisis.

There has already been a deluge of books on climate change. The Economics and Politics of Climate Change brings together over 30 experts, nearly all economists, who in different ways set out a kind of primer for Copenhagen on the economic, political and social implications.

Even if they do not always agree with each other, they successfully illustrate the immense complexity of the problem and its connection with global issues such as human population increase, resource depletion and economic development in its crudest sense - in short, human impact on the earth since the industrial revolution.

The sheer scale of the problem is well articulated by Dieter Helm. The science is now reasonably clear, but its messages have yet to be fully understood, even by other contributors to the book. There is, for example, little reference to the extent of human vulnerability to climate change.

The arguments ranging back and forth in the preparations for Copenhagen, with all the posturing that precedes international negotiations, cover a wide area: how to limit emissions of greenhouse gases; how to mitigate and adapt to the consequences; how best to wean ourselves from dependence on fossil fuels and develop alternative sources of energy; how to allocate responsibility for what has happened (here the industrial countries are in the firing line); how to set up the right kind of international institutions to manage, regulate and enforce whatever system is created; and more widely, how to prevent climate change from widening the gap between rich and poor.

On most of these issues the contributors to this book have something useful to say, and we must hope that their messages get through, particularly on the institutional shape of the future, and even the hazards of geo-engineering. A good example is the suggestion that, rather than put the emphasis on measuring the quantity of greenhouse gases involved in production, we should look instead at those who consume the goods produced. It is easy to blame China for increasing its emissions - it is now the biggest emitter in the world - but in doing so we forget that many countries, including Britain, have transferred some of their manufacturing base to China. There is a particularly useful analysis of the Stern report of 2007 which represents a somewhat conventional view of the economic and social impacts of climate change.

Indeed, if there is a reproach to be made it is that the economics of this book are too conventional. The units of measurement are too often growth and GNP, and too much is made of the distinction between developed and developing countries. As well-defined in the Stiglitz Commission report of September, we need new methods of measurement to make sense of what is going on. There is also a depressing amount of economists' jargon and infuriating use of acronyms which together obscure otherwise reasonable arguments and conclusions. But although this book is not made for easy reading, it is still a valuable compendium.

It is obvious that if things are as dire as suggested here, a lot more than negotiations or haggling in Copenhagen will be necessary. Copenhagen is only part of a process which will continue over the years. As Gordon Barrett says in this book: ""Climate change is arguably the greatest collective-action problem the world has ever faced."" The challenge is clearer than ever. The response has yet to come.

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, February 16, 2009 345 mots, p. 7",,Global warming closing in on 'critical threshold',By Clive Cookson in Chicago,,"The world is warming far more quickly than scientists forecast just two years ago when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published its last reports, according to a series of assessments presented over the weekend.

Chris Field of Stanford University, a senior member of the IPCC, told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science that the unexpectedly rapid increase in the burning of fossil fuels, especially coal, since 2000 would have dire consequences because of ""feedback loops"" in the global -climate.

""We are looking now at a future climate that's beyond anything we've considered seriously in climate model simulations,"" Prof Field said.

The IPCC's fourth assessment in 2007 concluded that the average global temperature would increase by between 1.1°C and 6.4°C by 2100, depending how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases were released into the atmosphere over the coming decades. Prof Field said that seriously underestimated the potential severity of global warming, based on the new evidence.

Prof Field warned that there were early signs of melting in the Arctic tundra and increased fires in tropical forests - over and above deliberate deforestation - that could add billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

""There is a real risk that human-caused climate change will accelerate the release of carbon dioxide from forest and tundra ecosystems, which have been storing a lot of carbon for thousands of years,"" Prof Field said.

""We don't want to cross a critical threshold where this massive release of carbon starts to run on autopilot.""

Al Gore, the former US vice-president turned climate change campaigner, responded with a passionate plea to an audience of 1,600 scientists, urging them to become more politically active in the fight against global warming.

""Scientists can no longer in good conscience accept this division between the work you do and the civilisation in which you live.This is a historic struggle.""

Mr Gore focused particularly on the accelerating loss of Arctic ice and the global increase in coal burning.

However there was optimism at the AAAS meeting - based on the professed determination of the new US administration to promote effective action, both in its domestic energy policies and in taking a lead in international climate change negotiations.

James McCarthy, a climate change expert at Harvard University and this year's AAAS president, said: ""The scientific talent President [Barack] Obama has recruited is of extraordinary calibre. He could not have found anyone better to look after energy and the environment."""
"Monday, October 19, 2009 540 mots",,Concession raises hopes for climate deal,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"Developed countries are preparing to relent on their demand that developing countries agree to long-term cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in a concession that could form the basis of a global deal on climate change.

 

The demand was one of five key elements rich countries wanted for a deal at the international climate change summit in Copenhagen in December. But major emerging economies, led by China and India, refused to sign up to it, worrying it could be used to force large and so far unquantified emission cuts on them in the future.

Governments on both sides of the Atlantic are now softening their call for a global target of halving emissions by 2050, in an attempt to build a consensus around a less ambitious deal in Copenhagen.

Todd Stern, Mr Obama's special envoy for climate change, in London on Monday for talks with the world's 17 biggest emitters, hinted at the softening stance: ""Our view at the G8 in July was that there ought to be both a developed country number and a worldwide number - 80 per cent for developed countries, 50 per cent worldwide. We still think that.""

But he added: ""I don't know whether that is going to be included or not.""

Gordon Brown, the UK prime minister, tried to galvanise other governments into action on Monday with a rallying call. ""Success at Copenhagen is still within reach. But if we falter, the earth itself will be at risk,"" he told talks in London.

But speculation was growing over whether Barack Obama, US president, would attend the December conference.

Mr Stern said that climate change talks were treated by the US as ministerial meetings and only if progress was made to ""warrant the attendance of leaders"", would they consider Mr Obama attending.

Dropping the 2050 demand for a target date will make it easier to strike a deal in Copenhagen, as it will switch attention to how countries manage emissions in the next decade.

""Discussions on 2050 have been eating up time that could be more usefully spent determining what we do before we're all dead,"" said one senior official involved in the talks.

Developed countries have already agreed to cut their emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, which will remain unchanged.

Ed Miliband, the UK secretary of state for climate change, also signalled that the 2050 goal was dispensable. He praised the actions developing countries such as China and India were taking to curb the growth of their emissions, and said these pledges for the next decade were paramount.

""The most important thing is mid-term actions. The 2050 targets are important but it's more important to have near-term targets,"" he said. ""The actions China and India are taking for 2020 are absolutely central to a successful outcome ... What's important is that Chinese action for 2020 is made concrete in terms of quantified numbers.""

The 2050 target is the second recent concession in the pre-Copenhagen talks. Developing countries have all but given up on attempts to get free access to rich countries' intellectual property.

Most developed countries, apart from the US, have also agreed to targets for cutting emissions by 2020, and emerging economies have pledged to curb their emissions.

There is still some disagreement - developing countries want tougher targets from rich countries, and rich countries in turn want emerging economies to make their commitments legally binding. But there are signs that a compromise could be reached. ""There is a deal to be had,"" said Mr Stern.

The biggest remaining problem is over finance, which was the subject of Monday's discussions in London. Poor countries want aid from rich nations if they are to quantify the actions they will take on emissions in a binding deal.

Yvo de Boer, the UN's top climate change official, told the Financial Times this was ""a potential deal-breaker"". He encouraged rich countries to do more. ""This has nothing to do with signing blank cheques. It's about building trust and showing that you are serious [about climate change]."""
"Thursday, May 28, 2009 379 mots",,Hoon eyes new transport climate accord,By Robert Wright in Leipzig,,"The transport secretary will call on Thursday for an international consensus on ensuring that shipping and aviation are included in any global environmental deal in Copenhagen this year.

Geoff Hoon will tell the International Transport Forum in Leipzig, Germany, that it was ""a great missed opportunity"" that the two dominant international modes of transport were omitted from the last global climate change deal, signed in Kyoto in 1997.

""That led to over a decade of inaction,"" he will tell the conference. ""We cannot afford to wait any longer. It is vital that we put that right at Copenhagen.""

However, the tone of Mr Hoon's speech, which will dwell on the benefits of transport and the potential for improved technology to reduce emissions, is likely to worry many environmental campaigners on transport issues. Most believe use of some forms of transport, such as aviation, will need to fall to meet emissions reduction targets.

The International Transport Forum is an annual meeting of transport ministers and other policymakers, organised under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The audience will include many of those that the UK has to win over if it is to get agreement on including shipping and aviation in any Copenhagen deal. Mr Hoon will call for transport policymakers to take charge of the sector's response to the climate change issue, rather than leaving it to others such as environment ministers.

""If we do not lead this debate, then others will,"" he will say.

Transport ""will leave itself wide open to accusations that it is part of the problem, rather than part of the solution"" if ministers take no action, he will add. The sector could also find solutions imposed on it that do not take account of competition or the realities of international transport, he will say.

However, much of the speech is likely to focus on potential technical solutions to aircraft and ship emissions that many environmental campaigners believe will never be sufficient to curb emissions without substantial reductions in traffic volumes.

Mr Hoon will point to changes in aircraft technology such as blended wings, a technique that reduces drag and fuel consumption, and lighter composite materials as potential ways of reducing aviation emissions. He will also point to improved engine and ship design as means of reducing ships' emissions. ""Technological advances can also help to generate business and trade,"" he will say.

Environmental campaigners fear that a focus on potentially less polluting means of transport could distract from the need to reduce overall use of some forms of transport.

While referring to a number of potential means of curbing transport emissions, including rail electrification, Mr Hoon will avoid any reference to road-user charging. A number of reports have found charging for road use - which is officially government policy but has received far less attention in the past two years - could bring about significant emission reductions."
"FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT, Monday, November 30, 2009 652 mots, p. 6",,Include climate in long China view,By Pauline Skypala,,"Wondering what to write about for this column, I made a list of the week's news and events that could be of interest. It was quite a long one, what with the publication of the Walker Review and of findings from the investment consultation by the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority , dislocation in Dubai , and developments on the proposed European regulations for alternative investment funds.

But possibly the most significant item was the intriguing revelation that Anthony Bolton is to return to managing money , but is moving to Hong Kong to focus on China.

Mr Bolton, who stepped down as manager of Fidelity International's Special Situations fund in December 2007 after 28 years, is so excited by the investment opportunities in China he has torn up his retirement plans to return to the fray.

He is held in high regard by investors and notably called the bottom of the credit crash, in stock market terms at least, in March, although he had made a similar call in October before Lehman Brothers went bust. His long-term performance record puts him in the super-manager league, his fund's annual growth rate of 19.5 per cent during his tenure being well ahead of the 13.5 per cent annual gain by the FTSE All Share index over the same 28 years.

Of course, being a value manager, he had periods in the doldrums, but investors who stayed with him through the mania of the dotcom boom rather than switching to one of the go-go technology funds that mushroomed in the late 1990s did well in the end.

Can they hope to do as well in his new China fund, to be launched in March? Perhaps, if they have the stomach for the volatility they are likely to experience.

But Fidelity may decide not to offer the fund to the general investing public, or to put a relatively high minimum investment on it. A specialist China fund is still pretty exotic after all.

For my money, I would much rather Mr Bolton had decided that climate change was the big opportunity, and put his expertise to work in that area.

Perhaps he is a climate sceptic - I have no idea. Maybe China will be the best place to make money in the coming years. It may even be the best place to make money from climate change opportunities.

Perhaps too, the climate change fund area is just too fashionable for him. He is a contrarian investor by reputation after all, although China is hardly an unfashionable choice of focus.

What we need from the people, like Mr Bolton, making important capital allocation decisions is a longer term view of the world than most take, and a proper consideration of the risks and opportunities involved in the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.

According to Stephen Green, chairman of HSBC: ""The greatest single opportunity for markets to prove their worth will be in the fight against climate change.""

Much of the effort will have to be made by asset owners. They have the money. Some have been active for years, but, as in the related area of corporate governance, there are a few making the effort and many reaping the benefit.

One of the questions raised at a briefing last week by Tomorrow's Company on effective stewardship by asset owners was about the market failure that deprives start-up businesses of capital to develop. One tenth of 1 per cent of the global capital pool goes to early stage capital, according to Steve Podmore, founder of the Global Sustainability Challenge. This harms investment returns and the ability to deal urgently with climate change, he said. ""We need to revisit how we use capital to stimulate and drive innovation.""

No one had any answers to that.

Politicians will gather in Copenhagen next month to talk about climate change. Their inability so far to deliver regulation that gives businesses a framework to work in has delayed progress and resulted in a failure to set a price for carbon that encourages the development of alternative energy sources.

The Copenhagen talks will not move matters on substantively, and much will continue to be left to markets. But if investors remain fixated on maximising short term returns, capital will not necessarily flow to companies making the necessary investment to adapt to climate change, or help mitigate it. And they could suffer losses if they have not taken account of longer term risks arising from climate change issues.

So it is good to see pension funds like Railpen trying to move the debate on, and raise important questions about fiduciary duty (see page 1), with the help of HSBC and Linklaters. Railpen will not necessarily make mandate decisions on the basis of the answers it gets to its lengthy questionnaire, but hopes nonetheless to influence fund managers.

A regulatory push to make reporting mandatory would help to raise awareness. A China fund taking a long-term view of the risks and rewards related to climate change run by Mr Bolton would be even better."
"Saturday, March 27, 2010 2864 mots",,Europe's royals as climate activists,By Fiona Harvey,,"The day before last December's Copenhagen summit on climate change drew to a tortuous close, world leaders temporarily broke off their labyrinthine discussions, changed out of their business suits, put on white tie and tails and headed off in motorcades to Christiansborg Palace. It was a momentary ceasefire in the increasingly fractious gathering; warring heads of state smiled for the camera and shook hands.

 

There was more to the state banquet, hosted by Queen Margrethe, than normal regal hospitality: it was inspired by a real interest in the issues. The Danish royal family, like royal families across Europe, has taken up the cause of environmental education and action with great conviction. Usually it is not sitting monarchs but heirs to the throne who have become involved, but involved they certainly are. Last year, the three heirs to Scandinavian thrones - Queen Margrethe's son Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria of ­Sweden and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway - travelled to Greenland together to witness for themselves the effects of climate change. They visited a research centre where scientists drill for ice cores that are used to estimate temperature and climate shifts over the past 700,000 years.

At the other end of the world, Prince Albert of Monaco spent several weeks touring Antarctic research stations with his foundation, which he set up in 2006 to fund environmental protection projects. Meanwhile, Princess Astrid of Belgium has taken up climate change because of its relevance to her main area of interest - the spread of malaria. And, fittingly for the future king of the Netherlands, parts of which are below sea level, the Prince of Orange campaigns on climate and water management issues as a member of several international committees that work to secure clean water and sanitation in developing countries.

European royals hold dinners, convene meetings of business leaders, open conferences, hold photo sessions in picturesque regions, set up foundations and make speeches urging planetary preservation. What's more, their efforts are having some effect. Scores of businesses, cajoled by royals, have signed up to take action on greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental issues have made their way into some unlikely places, including the celebrity-filled pages of Heat and Hello! When any of the current ­generation of heirs ascends the throne, we can expect their gown to be - ­metaphorically at least - trimmed in green rather than ermine.


Prince Frederik motions me to sit on a gilded sofa in a light grey room of the Amalienborg palace, pours coffee and hands me ­delicate chocolate biscuits. This is his home, which lies across a large cobbled square from his mother's palace in central Copenhagen. Outside, in the cold December air, tourists are beginning to gather for the changing of the guard and salute to the Danish queen. Inside, the rooms seem rather austere for an 18th-century royal palace, sparsely furnished and monotone. But somehow they are still cosy. That might be because they're warm: this wing has been refurbished, Frederik tells me, with double glazing and insulation - sensitively installed to preserve the original decor, of course.

Frederik is charming, handsome and beautifully dressed in what I have come to recognise as ""royal casual"" - an impeccably tailored brown blazer, twinned with lighter trousers and a checked shirt. He speaks eagerly and warmly. ""Going to the Arctic was immense for me,"" he says. ""Greenland is a wonderful country... but you can see the changes. I was probably most impressed by the visual things - that you can see what's happening there. I think it's important for me to have a message for other people from that, to convince the broader population that there are changes happening and that we are making the change.""

Along with his mother, Frederik played a prominent role in the Copenhagen summit, inviting government representatives, scientists, journalists and activists to the medieval Helsingør Castle - better known as Hamlet's Elsinore - for an evening's discussion about climate issues. Like the other royals interviewed for this piece, he thinks a lot about his family's long ­history and its obligation to act as stewards of the nation's heritage. ­""Historically, royal families have represented an institution,"" he says. ""The institution is built on heritage, and is timeless in that sense. I hope that my family will continue in another thousand years.""

Royals, with the sense of destiny that settles upon those who have emerged victorious from centuries of battle over territory and precedence, are used to taking the long view, and they do it on a scale that most of us would find puzzling, if not incomprehensible. (""It was decided a hundred years before I was born,"" Crown Prince Haakon of Norway tells me, ""that I would be king."") But thinking in these timescales makes sense when you're talking about climate change, Prince Frederik argues. ""If climate change becomes radical, then we are all in danger - we are in danger of not being able to see ourselves in a thousand years.""

Royals who take up causes are nothing new. When monarchies were still politically powerful, able to appoint cabinets and start wars, they dispensed patronage to nearly every kind of charity and popular campaign, from stray dogs to indigent widows. The habit is written into the fabric of European capitals, where 19th and early 20th-century hospitals often bear the name of their royal protector, carved in stone. Some of this heritage lives on: in Britain there are royal societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, for the protection of birds, for the prevention of accidents, for the encouragement of arts, manufacture and commerce.

But there is something different about the newfound royal enthusiasm for environmental causes. This is not just about lending the royal prefix, nor about acting as a figurehead while others gather donations. No longer content to remain passive accomplices in good causes, green royals are becoming much more active in campaigning. And for some critics, royal involvement in the vexed issue of climate change comes close to breaking the ultimate taboo: unwarranted intervention in the political process.

. . .

For Crown Prince Haakon, such concerns are irrelevant. A goodwill ambassador for the UN Development Programme, he is clear that he acts out of humanitarian instincts, and speaks humbly of how he came to what he regards as his calling. ""If we realise and accept that every person has dignity, and dignity does not stop at borders, that all ­people should have access to dignified lives, a dignified level of healthcare, income and education... then the decisions we make at all ­levels will move the world forward in such a way that we get there.""

Prince Haakon has travelled the world, returning again and again to Africa, where he has witnessed the effects of drought and food shortages - experiences that are likely to become more frequent for many people if the climate changes. On one visit there, he met an HIV-positive woman living in dire poverty with little prospect of a better life. But while she ""had every right in my mind to be angry, frustrated, bitter, she was the opposite - she had become an activist, teaching her peers how to avoid becoming infected. She really put her neck out when she told people that she was positive."" The prince was inspired. ""I was supposed to be the Prince of Norway. But she was the only leader in that room. She has become my role model.""

Global-warming sceptics regard royals campaigning against climate change as a fad at best and at worst a form of political activism ­inappropriate for public figures who are meant to remain outside the realm of democratic politics. Myron Ebell, director at the Competitive Enterprise ­Institute and one of America's most prominent climate-change sceptics, says: ""The interest of royal personages in promoting global warming alarmism and supporting energy-rationing policies is a good example of out-of-touch elitism. It's a popular cause for them and other wealthy people who don't have to worry about skyrocketing energy bills.""

This is a complaint that might have received short shrift as little as a year ago, but in recent months, global efforts to combat climate change have hit a crisis. The Copenhagen summit produced a limited agreement, but one overshadowed by the scenes of chaos at its closing, which badly dented faith in the United Nations process. Yvo de Boer, the official in charge of that process, resigned shortly afterwards, saying no global ­agreement was yet in sight.

Far more damaging, however, have been scandals relating to the science informing political decisions on climate change. Last November, thousands of e-mails were hacked from a server at the University of East Anglia, dozens of which appear to show climate scientists manipulating data or planning to conceal vital information. The university rejects claims of distortion and secrecy, saying that its use of data was in line with standard scientific practice. Several investigations have begun, but the damage is done. Soon after that, critics uncovered a clutch of alleged flaws in the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the bible of climate science. At least one claim - that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035 - has been demonstrated to be false, and others are still in dispute. An audit of the report is now under way.

These indignities have taken their toll on the climate change cause: a survey conducted by Ipsos Mori in January found that only 31 per cent of the British public regarded climate change as a ""definite reality"", down from 44 per cent last year. That shift in public opinion may throw the wisdom of royals' advocacy into question. Ebell is scathing: ""My guess is that Prince Charles's clueless comments tend to confirm the suspicions of ordinary people that global warming is just another fashionable cause.""

. . .

The reasons his Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco gives for his involvement in climate-change activism are disarmingly personal. Over tea and biscuits in the Monégasque consulate in ­Mayfair - at first I take the biscuits to be Duchy Originals, then realise it must be Monaco's coat of arms I can see stamped on them - he talks of his father's and grandfather's love of the sea, and how both men helped shape his awareness of the natural world. He has also talked about the influence of his mother, Princess Grace, who gave him a much-treasured nature poster when he was a child. ""With that heritage, I felt obliged to be more involved personally,"" he says. ""I saw the urgency, especially in the years that followed.""

He sees his environmental work as a duty. ""Everyone in a position of leadership or responsibility should be thinking of environmental [issues]. It's not just political leaders who should be doing so, but leaders of civil society - they have to take this issue on."" He accompanied his father to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, where the parent treaty to the Kyoto protocol was signed. Later, when he succeeded his father, one of his first acts was to sign up Monaco to the protocol.

Travelling to the Antarctic, he says, gave him an insight into the extraordinary fragility of some of the world's most remote habitats. It's now his job to communicate his first-hand experience to the rest of the world - an idea many of the royals bring up. ""I was privileged to ... see what was going on, and I talked to the scientists,"" he says. ""It was good to get more understanding of how important the Antarctic is in terms of influencing climate change in the rest of the world.""

It is the ""convening power of royalty"" that makes their involvement so important, explains Ian Cheshire, chief executive of the Kingfisher retail group, who heads a group of businesses looking at climate change for Prince Charles. Europe's crowned heads have a unique ability to draw in almost anyone they choose from the worlds of business, politics, celebrity and civil society. Just as Queen Margrethe's summons in Copenhagen was not to be ignored, so gatherings headed by a prince tend to be well-attended.

""Convening power"" essentially means ""our snobbery"". People, even very important people, will rarely decline an invitation if it bears a royal crest. The cachet of hereditary majesty has been known to draw the most profit-hungry captains of industry and the most inward-looking US politicians. There is a mystique to monarchies, however much the Scandinavian princesses may cycle round their cities. Even when that mystique is replaced by a sense of wonder that we still attach such importance to mere ancestry, few of us can say we are indifferent.

Cheshire demurs, preferring the explanation that ""convening power"" recognises the inherent neutrality of the royal. He points out that, required to be apolitical, they take pains to ensure that every meeting allows a fair say for all, and is not dominated by a single interest.

. . .

Probably the most famous royal to have taken on the green ­mantle is Charles, Prince of Wales. Pilloried following his divorce from Diana, Princess of Wales, and her death, in the past decade Charles has been reborn in the public imagination as a less remote, more human and relaxed figure, a doting father to his two sons, a remarried divorcee. But key to this recasting has been his role as a champion of ­environmental causes.

His concern for green issues is hardly new - he has spoken out for many years on the need for conservation. What is new is the vigour of his support for the climate change cause in the past five years, setting up a ­business forum, convening dozens of meetings and dispatching letters to ­governments and the United Nations.

Most recently, Charles encouraged a group of businesses to come up with ways to preserve forests using market mechanisms. Forestry is one of the thorniest problems in climate change: it's clear that keeping the world's existing forests standing is the single most effective - and ­cheapest - way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the world has yet to devise an effective way of paying nations to protect their forests from the predations of loggers, ranchers and subsistence farmers desperate to eke out a living. Prince Charles's initiative, led by the celebrated British financier Stanley Fink, has still to come up with a comprehensive solution, but it has made some progress.

Yet behind the smiles, the pomp and glamour as the old regimes come face to face with modern political power, there is a sense that royals can get in the way as much as assist in the fight against climate change. At Queen Margrethe's dinner in Copenhagen, more than one world leader chafed at the enforced suspension of negotiations, which by then had reached a crucial stage, with only hours to go and no agreement yet in sight. As the Queen's servants put up the shutters in the royal palace, the heads of government headed back to sweaty, windowless rooms in their conference centre on the outskirts of the city, to roll up their sleeves and spend the rest of the night and the early morning in a line-by-line ­discussion of the negotiating text.

Among the royal activists on global warming, Prince Charles has shown the greatest willingness to try to influence politicians directly. A few years ago, it was revealed that British ministers were used to receiving long letters in spidery handwriting on any number of issues, from architecture and homeopathy to - increasingly - climate change. The reason he is able to get away with this may be that in Britain, as opposed to the US, environmentalism largely transcends party boundaries. Margaret Thatcher was the first world leader to speak out strongly on the problem of climate change, in 1988. (See ""Improbable heroes of the green movement"".)

But while the Conservative party leader David Cameron has appeared to want to retain the cross-party consensus, British politics is starting to change. Cameron's green rhetoric has been quietly dropped in recent months and there is evidence suggesting increasing climate-change scepticism within the Tory ranks. A recent poll by ComRes showed that two-thirds of prospective Conservative MPs rate the environment as a very low priority, while in a Conservative Home survey, 144 Tory candidates in marginal seats ranked ""reducing Britain's carbon footprint"" as the least important from a list of 19 priorities for the next government. Some are hostile to spending on renewable energy and to green taxes and ­regulation, and openly contemptuous of any attempt to reach a global deal on limiting emissions. ""They don't believe in climate change, and they think the public don't either,"" says one ­disgruntled green Tory.

Cameron may win the battle and stick to his green agenda, but if his majority is narrow or backbenchers flex their muscles, he will come under increasing pressure to drop it. In a political climate such as this, Prince Charles's vehement support for environmental causes and the fight against global warming could take on a very different complexion. While the green movement will welcome having such a powerful voice to put their case, the tension between monarchy and government could become strained. The question of political interference could open up.

The royals with whom I spoke didn't want to acknowledge this possibility. Frederik protests that ""climate change concerns everyone"". ""It is a transcendent issue that is politicised occasionally,"" he says.

. . .

A more pertinent question may be: does it matter? While princes may bring the magic of majesty to readers of Heat and Hello! and in the process help recruit them to the green cause, and while they may bring business leaders together in feel-good meetings, the limits to their power and prestige are all too apparent. Real political power is located elsewhere, and increasingly debates about European public opinion on climate change are a sideshow. One senior US official said the activities of royals on climate issues were ""not even on the radar"" in the US, and other non-European countries agree.

At the Copenhagen summit, this changed world order became inescapably apparent after Queen Margrethe's banquet. European leaders tried to forge a compromise among the world's leading developed and developing nations, thrashing out details of what could be agreed in a late-night ­session. But within 24 hours, all that effort was blasted away. The agreement that emerged from the talks was not crafted by the Europeans; indeed, journalists asking the European Union representatives for comments on the final shape of the accord were met with panic and ­puzzlement. EU politicians, let alone royalty, had simply been out of the loop.

Instead, a new brand of royalty stepped forward. In the closing hours of the Copenhagen summit, after the clock should have stopped on the talks, President Barack Obama of the US walked into a room where he was supposed to meet the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. In a story much recounted since, he instead found Wen speaking to the leaders of three of the other biggest developing nations: India, Brazil and South Africa (a group that has come to be known by the acronym ""Basic""). Taking a seat, Obama proceeded to extinguish the remaining causes of disagreement among the countries present, and within hours the leaders assembled in that small room had succeeded where the rest of the summit failed. Without the Europeans, without the UN, they had come to an accord. The developing countries present hailed the deal as ground-breaking. Jairam Ramesh, environment minister for India, proclaimed: ""It was a deal between the Basic countries and the US.""

Europe, the continent that had done most to alert the world to the dangers of climate change and that has done the most to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, was left out in the cold. The European Commission and individual country leaders had to scramble desperately to save face as rivals trumpeted their success in crafting a new settlement and, by extension, a new world order. The US and the four Basic nations had carried the day. Not one of the five is a monarchy.

"WORLD NEWS, Monday, December 13, 2010 681 mots, p. 6",,Cancún seen as 'beacon of hope' for climate deal,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"News analysisThe UN talks broke through stalemate and secured steps towards a global accord, writes Fiona Harvey

A global agreement on climate change moved a step closer over the weekend as governments ended the UN Cancún talks with a series of accords on key elements of an overarching deal.

A ""green fund"" that will distribute money to help poor countries cope with climate change, a mechanism for international co-operation on low-carbon technology, and a way to help developing nations preserve their forests all emerged from the two weeks of negotiations in the Mexican resort of Cancún.

Countries will now continue to work towards agreement on other elements, such as the legal form a new deal could take, and the future of the Kyoto protocol - the current provisions of which expire in 2012.

The aim will be to draw up a full international deal to cover all of these elements, which could be agreed next year or in 2012.

Ministers, businesses and environmentalists welcom-ed the progress at the end of the talks, which had appeared mired in stalemate until the final hours of the conference. But some green campaigners said the advance was insufficient.

Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, hailed ""meaningful progress"".

""The Cancún agreements represent a balanced and significant step forward,"" said Mrs Clinton. ""[We] will work with our friends and partners to keep the world focused on this urgent challenge and continue building on this progress.""

Others welcomed the agreements as a vote of confidence in the UN negotiating process, which was in danger of failure after the chaos and discord that marked the end of last year's Copenhagen summit.

""Cancún has done its job - the beacon of hope has been reignited, and faith in the multilateral climate-change process to deliver results has been restored,"" said Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the world body's senior official on the issue.

""Nations have shown they can work together under a common roof, to reach consensus on a common cause.

""They have shown that consensus in a transparent and inclusive process can create opportunity for all.""

The agreements reached in Cancún formalised the accord reached at Copenhagen, when developed and developing countries agreed for the first time to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Owing to the refusal of a handful of countries - chiefly Venezuela, Bolivia and Sudan - to sign up, the Copenhagen Accord could not be formally adopted by the UN talks last year.

At Cancún, only Bolivia continued to hold out, but was sidelined.

This meant that the emissions-cutting targets that countries set out last year can now be formally recognised within the UN negotiating process.

Greg Barker, the UK climate change minister, said the deal would ""send a strong signal of confidence to business investing billions in the new global green economy"".

Businesses welcomed the outcome of the talks.

Ole Beier Sorensen, chairman of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change which represents investors holding $6,000bn in funds, said the deal ""promises to put the international climate process back on track"".

Mr Sorensen said: ""It is an important step on the road towards a global deal and reassures investors that countries are committed to developing a low-carbon economy.""

He added that governments must work with the private sector closely. ""The lion's share of the investments necessary must come from private sources, so a continued public-private dialogue is critical to ensuring the policy environment supports in-vestment in low-carbon technologies.""

Some green campaigners rejected the outcome of the talks, however, arguing that the emissions reductions that were set out would not be enough to stave off dangerous global warming, according to scientific estimates. Nnimmo Bassey, chair of Friends of the Earth International, called the Cancún agreements a ""slap in the face"" for developing countries.

The agreements

WHAT WAS AGREED

•A green fund. This will disburse money to poor countries to help them cope with the effects of global warming.

•A framework on low-carbon technology co-operation. Some developing countries wanted free access to intellectual property, which rich countries opposed. But a compromise should foster international co-operation.

•A framework to prevent deforestation. Poor countries will be able to seek funds to keep their existing forests standing and restore degraded areas.

•A continuation of the UN process. This had been in doubt owing to the chaos at Copenhagen. •Progress on how to monitor emissions.

STILL TO BE DONE

•Raising money for the green fund. The agreement over the fund covers only how the money will be distributed. Left hanging is how the $100bn a year can be raised.

"COMMENT, Friday, January 29, 2010 596 mots, p. 9",,Green is the colour of climate change discord,Fiona Harvey,,"Climate change negotiations will grind into gear again this weekend, after last month's chaotic summit in Copenhagen ended with a partial accord signed by the world's biggest economies. The weary process - it has been going on since 1992 - is supposed to yield, by the end of this year, a legally binding treaty that would be the first to require both developed and developing countries to limit their greenhouse gas emissions.

If the United Nations and the proponents of such a deal are serious in their stated aims, the best thing they could do would be to keep environmentalists out of the process.

Green campaigning groups played an exceptionally destructive role in the two weeks of the Copenhagen summit. They fomented discord among developing nations and their rejection of all compromises provided a cover for those governments with a vested interest in the talks' failure. Climate sceptics rejoiced - the greens were doing a far better job of wrecking Copenhagen than they ever could.

Copenhagen was always going to be a failure in the eyes of campaigning groups such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Oxfam. Developed country governments could never meet their demands to slash emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. So the green responses to the summit had been written weeks before - as the meeting closed, dozens of fingers hovered over the ""send"" key on prepared texts.

Seen without green lenses, however, the accord cannot be so easily dismissed. The scenes of chaos in the final hours of the summit overshadowed its achievement: the world's biggest economies, rich and poor, agreed for the first time to reduce emissions and limit global warming.

In advance of the summit, the UN's aims were that rich countries should set emissions reduction targets for 2020; that poor countries should agree measures to curb emissions growth; that the rich world should provide financing to the poor; and that governments should set a timetable for signing a legally binding treaty.

The first three of these were achieved. There was a caveat - governments did not specify their emissions targets, but must do so by January 31. But all of the major economies have publicly stated targets they will find embarrassing to renege upon.

Hardly the unmitigated failure, then, that many claimed. True, much of the detail remains to be filled in - how to raise the $100bn a year that rich countries have pledged to provide by 2020, for instance. Nor was the accord technically adopted in full, thanks the antics of a handful of countries - chiefly Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Sudan.

The next task - turning the accord into a legally binding treaty - will be far harder than the negotiations so far. In a series of meetings culminating in Mexico in December, green groups could wreak even more havoc.

During last year's talks, non-governmental organisations encouraged small countries such as the Pacific island states to reject the consensus - held for the preceding two years of negotiations - that the world should aim to confine warming to 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels, which scientists regard as the limit of safety. If that debate is reopened this year, it will be fatal to any hopes of progress.

Green groups also provided a smokescreen for China and other big developing countries to exert influence on smaller nations with which they have ties. Many developed country governments suspected China - which in recent days has publicly cast doubt on the science of man-made global warming - of urging some of these countries to reject compromises. China is the world's biggest emitter, and has an appalling record on air and water pollution. Yet in climate negotiations its sins go unmentioned, and it is praised to the skies by environmental groups for its meagre targets. Beijing has few better friends.

Copenhagen laid bare the frailties of the UN process. For a climate deal to be reached, each nation must agree to it in every detail. This is proving so difficult that some countries have argued for seeking a treaty among a smaller group such as the G20.

If the UN were stronger, it might be able to deal with the NGOs and stand up to the likes of China. But that would require an overhaul of the negotiating processes, which could take years. Every year without a climate treaty makes the goal of halting climate change harder to achieve."
"WORLD NEWS, Friday, December 3, 2010 348 mots, p. 10",,Cancún feud hits climate deal talks,By Fiona Harvey in Cancún,,"Clash between rich and poor countriesVoters' concerns on global warming fall

A dispute between developing nations and richer signatories to the Kyoto protocol is threatening the fragile peace at international talks on climate change, even as a poll found global warming had slipped down voters' agendas.

Poor countries at the two-week conference in Cancún, Mexico, want a continuation of the 1997 Kyoto pact as a condition for discussions on a new treaty that would encompass the US - which never ratified Kyoto - and impose obligations on major emerging economies, which were not required to curb emissions under the original treaty.

Japan has openly opposed continuing Kyoto after its current provisions expire in 2012, prompting the Indian government on Thursday to say the chance of achieving a ""positive outcome"" at Cancún was ""remote"".

The disagreement threatens to kill any chance of measurable progress at the talks, which started on Monday and will continue until December 10.

Ministers will arrive at the conference next week. If the delegates cannot find common ground before then, participants fear simmering tensions could deteriorate into open fighting.

Rifts between developing and developed countries prevented a comprehensive deal at last year's Copenhagen summit, and little has been done to heal the divide since then. Meanwhile, a survey has shown climate change is less important to the public than it was in the lead-up to last year's global warming summit in Copenhagen, which was attended by leaders of the world's major economies.

The GlobeScan poll of more than 13,000 people in 26 countries found that the proportion of people rating climate change as a ""very serious"" problem fell from 61 per cent to 53 per cent.

In the US, 41 per cent of people said it was ""very serious"" compared with 45 per cent previously, while in the UK and Germany the difference was even more marked.

In the UK, 43 per cent now rate it ""very serious"" compared with 59 per cent before. In Germany the figures are 47 per cent, down from 61 per cent.

Despite growing public indifference, scientists at the Cancún conference say the problem is getting worse.

Research from the World Meteorological Organisation, unveiled at the conference, showed that 2010 is set to be one of the three warmest years on record.

Professor Mark Maslin, director of the Environment Institute at University College London, said: ""Those who hoped that global warming would just go away will be disappointed by today's announcements [which] add to the huge weight of evidence accumulated by scientists over the last two decades showing climate change is real."""
"Saturday, January 23, 2010 424 mots",,UN climate specialist defends glacier report,By Amy Kazmin in New Delhi,,"The chief of the Nobel Prize winning United Nations climate change panel admitted on Saturday that its dire warning that Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035 was ""an error,"" but said the threat posed by global warming could not be ignored.

Seeking to quell a controversy with great resonance in his native India, Rajendra Pachauri, chief of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, admitted there was no hard science to back the ""regrettable"" claim that Himalayan glaciers could disappear within three decade if global warming goes unchecked.

The claim was part of the wide-ranging 2007 report produced by the IPCC, which includes the world's leading climate change scientists and advises governments on policy to deal with global warming.

""There's been this error, but that in no way detracts from the value of the report or the impact it has had,"" Mr Pachauri told journalists in Delhi. ""Rational people see the larger picture and are not going to be distracted by this one error.""

The pace of Himalayan glacier melt has been a contentious issue in India, which, along with China, depends heavily on what some refer to as ""the Water Towers of Asia"" to feed its major rivers, including the Ganges.

Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister, has been openly disputing the IPCC's doomsday predictions on Himalayan glaciers, arguing that there was no evidence to support what it called misleading claims that they could disappear within decades.

In November, Mr Ramesh's ministry released a report that concluded that some Himalayan glaciers were indeed receding but not a pace that was ""historically alarming"".

Mr Pachauri criticised the ministry's report as '""schoolboy science"".

However, the spotlight fell on the IPCC last week, after New Scientist, the popular magazine, traced the IPCC's warning of the potential disappearance of Himalayan glaciers by 2035 to its own 1999 article quoting an Indian glaciologist Syed Hasnain.

Mr Hasnain never offered such a time frame in any peer-reviewed literature, but the New Scientist reference was included in a report by the WWF, the environmental campaign group, from which it eventually found its way into a chapter of the IPCC report.

The IPCC issued a statement last week admitting that the estimates on the pace of glacier retreat, and the date for their likely disappearance was ""poorly substantiated"", though it re-affirmed its basic conclusion that global warming will lead to significant losses in glacier mass, resulting in water shortages.

Mr Pachauri said on Saturday that the IPCC panel will be more rigorous in its scrutiny of all data used for its next assessment report, for which preparation has begun and which is due in four years. ""Our procedures are very robust, very solid, but we have to make sure we are implementing the procedures,"" he said. ""Reasonable people will continue to repose their faith in the IPCC.""

Mr Pachauri's admission comes as environment ministers from India, China, Brazil and South Africa are meeting in New Delhi on Sunday to discuss how to move forward on creating a new international treaty on climate change after the disappointment at Copenhagen."
"Wednesday, October 28, 2009 314 mots",,US to seek Chinese climate 'understanding',By Bill Savadove in Shanghai,,"The US and China will seek a ""common understanding"" to push forward a global deal on climate change during President Barack Obama's first state visit to Beijing next month, but the top US climate official has ruled out any ""separate deal"".

The US and China are the world's biggest emitters of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to global warming, making the two countries key players for the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen set for December.

""I think that Copenhagen can be a success,"" Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, said in Shanghai after meeting his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua. ""There is a deal to be had. It doesn't mean we are going to get it, but I think that there is one to be had.""

Mr Stern continued, ""It's not an issue of trying to cut some separate [US-China[ deal, but there absolutely is an issue of trying to get us and China, the US and China, as aligned as possible so that we have a chance to get an agreement in Copenhagen.""

Another aim of the visit is to advance cooperation on clean energy projects. ""We are in fact trying to press forward with some specific initiatives there, but it's too early to know exactly what that will be,"" the envoy said.

Chinese President Hu Jintao in September pledged to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output over the next decade. Beijing prefers this formulation as opposed to a straightforward emissions cap.

Mr Stern said the level of Beijing's planned reductions remained vague and he called on China, and all countries, to do more. ""China is doing a lot more than many people outside of China give China credit for. I think China needs to do more and I am looking forward to the announcement, when they're ready, of what they plan to do,"" he said.

Washington has faced criticism and limits on its ability to negotiate since domestic legislation on climate change has yet to be approved by the US Congress. Mr Stern defended the achievements of the Obama administration so far, which included $80 billion in investment and tax credits for energy research, new vehicle fuel economy standards and a process to regulate stationary sources of carbon dioxide.

He declined to say if he believed the climate bill would pass Congress before the Copenhagen meeting starts on December 7. ""From my point of view, the best thing that can happen is a maximum amount of progress on that legislation,"" he said."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, July 29, 2010 464 mots, p. 4",,New data fuel debate on climate,,,"Since comprehensive studies of the world's climate began 20 years ago, the evidence for global warming has been steadily growing.

Study after study has found temperatures on land and at sea increasing, while the Arctic ice sheet has diminished in extent and thickness, and sea levels have risen.

These studies were drawn together in the landmark report on climate change produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. The 3,000- page report said climate change was ""unequivocal"" and there was a 90 per cent likelihood that much of the earth's warming was due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels.

But when the ""climategate"" scandal broke last year - e-mails among climate scientists appeared to show them distorting data to suit their theories, and this was followed by revelations of a few flaws in the IPCC report - many people decided the science of climate change was in doubt.

Polls showed public faith in climate science dropping, and an increasingly vocal chorus of ""climate sceptics"" protesting that the credibility of climate science had been destroyed.

But new research released by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration yesterday reignited the debate.

Peter Stott, of the UK's Met Office, which contributed to the NOAA report, said the data showed clearly human influence over the climate.

For instance, he pointed to research showing temperatures in the stratosphere were falling. ""This would be expected as a consequence of a combination of ozone depletion and greenhouse gas increase."" An increasing concentration of greenhouse gases would be likely to cause the upper atmosphere to cool even as the lower atmosphere warmed.

""This is part of a very distinctive pattern of change associated with human influence on climate systems. The evidence is so clear the chance there's something we haven't thought of [that could be warming the climate other than greenhouse gases] seems to be getting smaller and smaller,"" he said.

The NOAA research gathered together much new data published since the last IPCC report. Although that report was published in 2007, most of the data used were from several years before.

Two pieces of research also found the first half of this year was the warmest on record. This refuted the claims of many climate sceptics that global warming had stopped or reached a plateau in the past 10 years, Mr Stott said.

However, he added that people should not infer too much from a single year's data. Sceptics claim that as the sea ice in the Arctic has recovered slightly from its record minimum in 2007, that global warming is not happening. Mr Stott said that the climate could vary strongly from year to year, while still following a general warming trend.

Myles Allen, of Oxford University, said it was clear from the accumulated work of climate scientists that greenhouse gases were the problem. He said: ""Climategate never really brought climate science into question at all.""

Sceptics remain unconvinced. Pat Michaels, a climate sceptic, said that the report and other evidence suggested that the sensitivity of temperature to carbon dioxide had been overestimated. This would mean that the planet could warm, but not by as much as the computerised models predicted."
"Monday, July 5, 2010 575 mots",,Dutch study broadly backs IPCC climate report,By Fiona Harvey in London and Clive Cookson in Turin,,"A Dutch government investigation into climate change science has found that there is no reason to doubt the central claims that global warming is occurring and is found to be the result of human actions.

However, the study suggested that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change might have emphasised the negative effects of climate change over some of the benefits.

It raised 10 question marks over the one-third of the 3,000-page 2007 landmark IPCC report on the impacts of climate change that it studied, but several of these were either simple typographical errors, errors in the footnoting, or minor problems in interpreting ranges of uncertainty. For instance, the IPCC in 2007 estimated that 75m to 250m people would be subject to increased water stress owing to climate change in Africa by 2020, but the Dutch study suggested this range should have been 90m to 220m.

The study was commissioned because of the ""climategate"" scandals that occurred late last year and early this year, in which the IPCC's report was alleged to contain several errors, and climate scientists from the UK's University of East Anglia were separately alleged to have distorted climate science.

The chief error in the IPCC report was a claim that the glaciers of the Himalayas could largely disappear by 2035. This was determined to be unfounded and subsequently retracted. Other claims in the report that have been questioned, such as potential drops in crop yields in Africa if climate change progresses, are defended by the IPCC.

As to the overall findings of the 2007 IPCC report, the most comprehensive study of climate science to date and the benchmark used by most of the world's governments, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency said: ""The summary conclusions were well-founded and none were found to contain any significant errors.""

Martin Parry, a leading IPCC author and professor at Imperial College London, said the report - the latest of several studies into the ""climategate"" affair -- had vindicated climate scientists: ""There have been a very small number of near-trivial errors in an extremely dense report.""

The Dutch study was prompted by a row in the country's parliament over whether the IPCC - the body of the world's leading climate scientists - had been correct in its estimation of the amount of Dutch land that was below sea level. Although the figure quoted in the IPCC study was subsequently found to be incorrect, it was the estimate provided to the IPCC by the Dutch government.

However, the Dutch finding that the IPCC might have over-emphasised the negative aspects of climate change was strongly rebuffed by IPCC scientists in London on Monday. Prof Parry said the 2007 report had contained estimates of the possible benefits to certain regions from climate change, but that these were clearly outweighed by the very large damages that global warming would cause, particularly when coupled with population growth and increased pressure on water supplies in many poorer regions of the world.

On Wednesday, a separate inquiry into the UEA e-mails will be published. The 500-page report is expected to say that the main conclusions of climate science are unaffected, but to recommend greater transparency among climate scientists.

Separately, two international studies of the earth's ""carbon balance"", released at the EuroScience forum in Turin, will fill in some of the data gaps for which previous IPCC assessments were criticised.

The studies, co-ordinated by Germany's Max Planck Society, use measurements from Fluxnet, a global network of more than 500 ""flux towers"". These assess the flow of carbon dioxide to and from different types of vegetation around the world, from tropical forest to temperate grassland.

Markus Reichstein, of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry, said the measurements would help to answer criticism of the IPCC for relying too much on computer modelling.

""The IPCC assessments are largely based on computer simulations,"" he said. ""We believe we can falsify or confirm the simulations.""

The studies, which are published online in the journal Science, show that the world's plantlife ""breathes in"" 123bn tonnes of carbon a year. This amount is very sensitive to changes in rainfall but less sensitive to temperature changes than many climatologists had previously estimated."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, March 11, 2010 242 mots, p. 9",,Climate panel work faces review,By Harvey Morris at the United Nations,,"The United Nations yesterday appointed international experts to review the work of its climate change panel after errors in the body's last report were seized on by sceptics to challenge its scientific evidence for global warming.

Ban Ki-moon, UN secretary-general, said ""a very small number of errors"" in a report by the UN's Nobel-prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, did not undermine the fundamental scientific consensus. Evidence collected since the 2007 report suggested climate change was accelerating, he said.

Rajendra Pachauri, the IPCC chief who has come under fire after acknowledging an error in his panel's fourth report, said he welcomed the independent review. ""It is critically important the science in our report is accepted across the world. . . so that this challenge can be met effectively,"" he said.

An error in the landmark 2007 report that claimed Himalayan glaciers could almost disappear by 2035 was traced by the New Scientist to an interview it conducted with an Indian glaciologist in 1999. The claim was not repeated in any peer-review study, and was rebuffed by other glaciologists, who maintain the glaciers could take centuries to vanish.

Other alleged mistakes, such as that crop yields in some African countries could drop by 50 per cent by 2020, remain disputed.

The review will be independent of the UN. It will be undertaken by the Inter- Academy Council, an Amsterdam-based scientific advisory body. Robbert Dijkgraff, its co-chairman, said the review of the procedures of the IPCC, which is starting work on a fifth report, would be completed by August.

""The panel will look at how the evidence was used and how errors can be avoided in future,"" he told reporters.

In Beijing yesterday, Xie Zhenhua, China's chief climate change negotiator, urged the US to make stronger commitments on climate change and to help developing countries."

That implies the Heartland Institute received $5.2m in 2007 for its work on climate change, which is not true. Heartland addresses a wide range of issues, including budget and tax policy, education and environment issues in addition to climate change, healthcare, information technology, and more. Climate change is one part of a large and diversified policy portfolio.

"COMMENT, Friday, August 27, 2010 784 mots, p. 9",,Russia cannot afford climate inaction,Anthony Giddens,,"Will the heat-wave and drought that created so much havoc in Russia this summer cause the leadership in that country to take climate change seriously? The answer is important: Russia is the third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases globally, behind only China and the US. Yet Russia's attitude to climate change to date has been cavalier, at best.

Indeed, until recently its leaders seemed to believe climate change would be beneficial. Warmer weather would open up the Arctic's mineral wealth, create new shipping routes along its northern coasts, and extend agriculture into infertile areas. At a conference in 2003, Vladimir Putin, then president, even said global warming would merely mean that ""we Russians will spend less on fur coats"".

This summer's disasters - in which the country lost some 25 per cent of its grain production - should have brought home the naivete of this view. No one can say with certainty that the fires were influenced by climate change. Yet they are the sort of disasters that lie ahead if warming is not held in check.

Russia, by virtue of its size and variable continental climate, is unusually vulnerable to the extreme weather that climate change will bring. Flooding, in particular, will be a problem for coastal cities such as St Petersburg. Changes in the flow of rivers, storms, melting ice and many other hazards will cause difficulties, too.

Russia's leaders had slowly begun to change their tone even before this summer. A climate plan was endorsed by the government in 2009. President Dmitry Medvedev announced in the run-up to the climate change meetings in Copenhagen that Russia would accept a target of reducing its carbon emissions by 15-20 per cent below 1990 levels, later elevated to 20-25 per cent.

Critics correctly point out, however, that even these higher figures would see Russian carbon emissions increase, once the effects of the collapse of Russian heavy industry are taken into account. Mr Medvedev may have agreed to them in part because, as yet, little follows from their acceptance. Even so, they mark an encouraging shift of emphasis.

Mr Medvedev has also recently stressed the importance of achieving greater energy efficiency, an important step given the profligate way Russia uses energy. In a recent speech he also explicitly linked the heat-wave to climate change. What he has not done, so far, is to take the necessary next step, and link his new-found awareness of the dangers of global warming with wider plans for Russia's economic modernisation.

These are ambitious: to transform Russia's competitive base over the next 10 to 15 years, and lessen its dependence on oil, gas and minerals. Many have said such goals are unrealistic. They might add that boosting investments in clean energy technologies to them would only render them more so. But I would argue strongly that the reverse is true.

This is not only because of the economic damage that climate change will eventually unleash. Taking steps to reduce carbon emissions, and collaborating with the international community to do so, could stimulate Russian economic development, rather than inhibit it. Indeed, responding to climate change could become a major vehicle for the economic modernisation the leadership seeks.

Countries that bring up the rear in investment in low-carbon technologies and lifestyles are likely to become progressively less and less competitive. Oil and gas, which contribute so heavily to Russia's gross domestic product, are now sunset industries, at least in their current form. Russia must look to become a leader in the emerging technologies that will update these sectors; for instance, the carbon capture and storage techniques that will soon be applied widely both to gas and coal-fired power stations.

Vanguard states, such as Germany, Portugal, China, South Korea - and significantly, several of the leading oil and gas producing countries in the Middle East - are already investing heavily in these areas. If it does not move quickly, Russia risks being left further behind.

Yes, changing such industries is expensive. But where there are significant costs Russia should seek help, both from other nations and international organisations. The emissions permits Russia already holds as a result of signing up to Kyoto could be put to good use, to fund more environmentally responsible policies. This would build on moves in July, when - finally starting to make use of its carbon credits - the government endorsed 15 clean energy projects.

The rest of the world has a further strong interest in helping Russia: limiting the damage likely to result from the effects of global warming upon Russia's frozen peat bogs. As they melt, these huge sinks of carbon will release vast amounts of methane into the air - and methane is a greenhouse gas many times more potent than CO2. Serious outside investment could come Russia's way to help develop ways of limiting this process, especially if Russia itself began to sound more receptive to outside help.

Can a country that has found it difficult to break from its reliance on oil and gas revenues, and to modernise other industrial sectors, feasibly make this kind of transition? It will be testing, to say the least. The sense of emergency may soon fade when the temperatures drop. Support from other countries will be essential. Yet it remains in Russia's strategic interests to take climate change seriously. If its leaders can take this on board and communicate it to the public, the sense of fatalism in the face of disaster, coupled to bureaucratic stasis and corruption, that so often inhibit innovation in the country can be challenged. If not, Russia's plans to modernise its economy will be undermined before they have begun.

"FT REPORT - WORKING IN TAX, Thursday, January 21, 2010 450 mots, p. 5",,Climate brings in opportunity,,,"Green taxes are the up-and-coming thing in tax circles. They are in tune with the times. They deal with the challenge of climate change. They provide tax advisers with a rich new vein of both intellectual challenge and income stream. And they provide a new career path.

""There are a few risks that it might not take off, but if you want to get in on the ground floor then this is a good bet,"" says John Whiting, policy director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT).

It may be a long-term bet, but it could be a good one. The combination of climate change and filling a deficit left by the economic crisis could provide the trigger. ""Any government is going to have to raise a lot of money and raise it quickly,"" says Francesca Lagerberg, head of tax at Grant Thornton, an accountancy. ""Green tax is something which people have sympathy with. It seems an easy task for politicians.""

The ground rules are already being laid out. Last summer the CIOT published its Green Tax Report, which aimed to provide a foundation for the new discipline of green taxation.

It was the brainchild of the CIOT's then president, Nick Goulding, an adviser with KPMG, a consultancy. His view is that pressure is coming from both environmentalists and governments.

""It is clear that non-governmental activity in this area will simply not go away as environmentalists and other pressure groups step up their efforts to get governments to do far more to control emissions and protect the planet,"" he says.

""One can say with some certainty that tax and other fiscal measures are expected to play an important role in tackling this worldwide problem.""

However, the thinking behind green tax is in its infancy. The idea of engineering social change through tax is a complex one.

""No government has produced a green tax to deal with climate change,"" says Mr Lagerberg. ""So far they have just been an easy way of raising money."" And trying to change behaviour can raise the public's hackles. ""When you look at it in more depth they do hit day-to-day living, like fuel taxes, and that is when you lose the public,"" says Mr Lagerberg.

John Whiting agrees: ""Everyone can see lots of ways of doing it. But making them work will be complex."" Although here he sees another career path opening up. ""Getting in there and designing ways of making it all work would be good,"" he says.

""It will be an opportunity for tax people to be at the heart of businesses, working with the operational people to see how they can all adapt,"" says Mark Schofield who leads PwC's sustainability and climate change tax network. ""It will be a fascinating time with more people needed to look at the possible impacts on businesses.""

The arrival of a serious structure of green taxation will create all manner of challenges. Businesses will have to deal with changing costs, there will be greater complexity sprung by compliance and legal questions as well as measurement, reporting and assurance issues.

It is a new world to conquer. ""Green taxes could be the third age of tax,"" says Mr Whiting. ""Tax started by taxing things - like land for example. Then it moved on to more abstract concepts like profits. Green taxes could be the next stage."" Time to get in on the ground floor."
"WORLD NEWS, Friday, March 5, 2010 332 mots, p. 5",,"Strong evidence on global warming, says study",By Clive Cookson in London,,"The case for man-made global warming is even stronger than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change maintained in its official assessments, according to the first scientific review published since December's Copenhagen conference and subsequent attacks on the IPCC's credibility .

An international research team led by the UK Met Office spent the past year analysing more than 100 recent scientific papers to update the last IPCC assessment, released in 2007.

Although the review itself preceded the sceptics' assault on climate science over the past three months, its launch yesterday in London marks a resumption of the campaign by mainstream scientists to show that man-made releases of greenhouse gases are causing potentially dangerous global warming.

""The fingerprint of human influence has been detected in many different aspects of observed climate changes,"" said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Research . ""Natural variability, from the sun, volcanic eruptions or natural cycles, cannot explain recent warming.""

The review, published in the journal Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change , found several ""fingerprints"" of warming that had not been established by the time of the last IPCC assessment but were now unambiguously present.

One is human-induced climate in the Antarctic, the last continent where regional warming has been demonstrated.

There is also new evidence of warming in the oceans, which is having several effects. The subtropical Atlantic is becoming significantly saltier; the extra salinity could in turn alter ocean currents.

Another effect of ocean warming is increasing evaporation, leading to more humidity in the atmosphere and changing rainfall patterns.

""The whole water cycle is changing,"" said Mr Stott. ""The wet regions are tending to get wetter and the dry regions are getting dryer.""

On a global scale this means less rainfall in the tropics and more at higher latitudes, although Mr Stott said there was much regional variation in the pattern, which scientists were still working to make sense of.

The review is based on a forensic comparison of the pattern of changes expected from man-made warming with those that would result from other factors such as changing solar radiation and purely natural variations.

A separate study by Russian and US scientists, published today in the journal Science, shows methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, is escaping from the seafloor of the warming Arctic Ocean more rapidly than previously suspected."

Corporate sponsors have met most of the costs, led by Shell and Siemens, the German electronics and engineering group, with £1m donations each.

The gallery, which is called Atmosphere, ""aims to make sense of one of the biggest issues today"", said Chris Rapley, the museum's director. ""Our job is to present the science, not the controversy. We have not gone beyond the science into areas where we have no particular authority - the economics and politics.""

Even so, by representing mainstream climate science, the museum gives visitors the clear impression that man-made warming is a problem that needs to be tackled urgently through coherent global action.

The gallery is divided into five zones covering climate history, the greenhouse effect and energy balance in the atmosphere, rising carbon dioxide levels, evidence for climate change, and ways technology can tackle climate change by cutting carbon emissions.

James Smith, chairman of Shell UK, said his company was enthusiastic about the gallery. ""For me, the fundamental science of climate change is very clear: there are certain molecules that absorb energy and will heat up the atmosphere if you add them to it,"" Mr Smith said.

""You can postulate circumstances in which the consequences are not too bad and others in which they are very bad. We know that climate change will have to be tackled sooner or later - and the sensible thing in business is to tackle problems early.""

Mr Smith insisted that Shell was taking climate change seriously. Its own carbon emissions were down 30 per cent since 1990, he said, and would continue to fall as the company made the transition from oil to natural gas production. At the same time, it was investing heavily in new low-carbon technologies.

The Atmosphere gallery contains many exhibits illustrating past climate, including tree rings, fossils, ocean sediment and - most fascinating - a freezer containing an Antarctic ice core.

The cylinder was drilled by the British Antarctic Survey so that scientists could extract the tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice as it formed. Their composition shows atmospheric conditions at the time, including the amount of carbon dioxide. The ice core on display at the museum dates back to 1410. Others - much too long to fit in the gallery - go back as far as 800,000 years."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Friday, February 26, 2010 181 mots, p. 10",,A better way to tackle climate change,,,"Sir, Jagdish Bhagwati is correct that creativity is needed to bridge differences between rich and poor countries on climate change (""A new approach to tackling climate change"", February 23). While the World Trade Organisation offers some institutional alternatives, climate negotiators have already tried and failed to develop a compliance mechanism with teeth, and that is because political will for serious consequences is feeble.

Prof Bhagwati is right that rich countries need to be prepared to pay for past liability, but we need an even more creative mechanism for doing so that benefits rich and poor alike. I proposed a carbon mitigation fund in a recent paper whereby funds would be used to pay incremental costs of low-carbon technologies in developing countries. Contributions to the fund would be based on historical emissions.

The two caveats are that developing countries must have domestic policies to reduce emissions in order to access the fund, and companies from all countries must be allowed to compete to be technology providers for the new power plants, buildings and factories in developing countries. This way, companies from both developing and industrialised countries can compete for the new markets created by a low-carbon economy.

"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Saturday, July 10, 2010 352 mots, p. 12",,Science fiction writers have had climate change covered for decades,,,"Sir, I just caught up with Ed Crooks' review of climate change in fiction (""When the wind blows"", Life & Arts, June 26-27), and, once again, I'm amazed that no one ever bothers to check out what science fiction writers have been doing for the past couple of decades. Of course, it's science fiction, so who cares? But Ian McEwan is certainly wrong when he says it's hard to find novels about climate change. He should just wander over to a different section of the bookstore. Even leaving aside most of the post-apocalyptic novels premised on some sort of global warming catastrophe, the following are pretty good examples of what the genre has been producing.

First, how could you not mention JG Ballard in your review? The Drowned World (1962) is a classic.

Kim Stanley Robinson's Forty Signs of Rain (2005), Fifty Degrees Below (2007) and Sixty Days and Counting (2007) are an engaging and all too plausible chronicle of near-term events. All are more plausible and entertaining than McEwan's Saturday . It's actually on the basis of Saturday - a genuinely bad book by an otherwise good writer - that I'm holding off on Solar .

Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather (1995) is as scary as hell. Take the notion of tornado hunters and translate into an extreme weather nightmare. In Jonathan Barnes' Mother of Storms (1995) methane clouds from under the Arctic disrupt global weather catastrophically when released by a nuclear explosion. And since Mr Crooks is the energy editor, he could then think about the large methane bubble lying underneath the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and what that might accomplish if released.

Then there is Nothing Human (2003) by Nancy Kress, with global warming and its impacts as the backdrop for some changes to humanity. An astonishingly good book on any number of levels, not least in its description of a US dissolving from the impact of warming. Peter F. Hamilton's Mindstar Rising (1993) is set in England in the early 21st century as it tries to recover from global warming. Meanwhile, the title of Arthur Herzog's Heat (1976) sums it up. Herzog was talking about CO2 and global warming decades ago.

Paolo Bacigalupi wrote a number of short stories about climate change impacts, collected in Pump Six (2008). Finally, Philip K. Dick wrote several novels in which the background environment is one ravaged by global warming. Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep is the best known, as the basis for the film Blade Runner. Happy reading!

"FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION, Thursday, July 29, 2010 226 mots, p. 1",,New study says global warming is undeniable,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"International scientists have injected fresh evidence into the debate over global warming, saying climate change is ""undeniable"" and shows clear signs of ""human fingerprints"" in the first big piece of research since the ""Climategate"" controversy.

The research, headed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is based on new data not available for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report of 2007, the target of attacks by sceptics in recent years.

The NOAA study drew on 11 different indicators of climate, and found that each one pointed to a world that was warming owing to the influence of greenhouse gases, said Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the UK's Met Office, one of the agencies participating.

Seven indicators were rising, he said. These were: air temperature over land, sea-surface temperature, marine air temperature, sea level, ocean heat, humidity, and tropospheric temperature in the ""active-weather"" layer of the atmosphere closest to the earth's surface.

Four indicators were declining: Arctic sea ice, glaciers, spring snow cover in the northern hemisphere and stratospheric temperatures.

""The whole of the climate system is acting in a way consistent with the effects of greenhouse gases. The fingerprints are clear. The glaringly obvious explanation for this is warming from greenhouse gases,"" Mr Stott said.

Some scientists hailed the study as a refutation of the claims made by sceptics during the so-called Climategate saga.

This involved accusations of flaws in the IPCC's landmark 2007 report and the release of hundreds of e-mails from climate scientists that appeared to show them distorting certain data."
"FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - LIFE & ARTS, Saturday, April 10, 2010 661 mots, p. 13",,Whose climate is it anyway?,,,"But the problem will not go away. The science remains pretty robust. Sooner or later there will have to be some kind of global solution to a global problem.

Among the issues is that of the justice or equity underlying any future system to manage the effects of change. The good health of the atmosphere is vital to all forms of life, including our own. But we all have free access to it and can pollute it as we will. How should we value a public good? How should responsibilities, past, present and future, be allocated? This is the central theme of Eric Posner's and David Weisbach's new book, Climate Change Justice .

One reason for the relative failure of Copenhagen was the sheer scope and complexity of the issues. The impacts of climate change are themselves uncertain. There are tipping points when one climatic regime can slide, often quickly, into another. The trouble is that we do not know where they are until we have passed them. Then there are wider issues regarding our ability to respond to change: among them are human proliferation and migration; exhaustion and pollution of natural resources; and damage to essential ecosystems.

This leaves one or two relative certainties. The rapid increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases is a product of the industrial revolution, and the rise is ever more steep as the world follows the western economic model of ""development"". There can be argument about how and when this affects temperature here or there but the long-term relationship between greenhouse gases and global temperature is not in serious dispute.

So should industrial countries accept prime responsibility for what has happened? And what should they say to those countries who simply want to follow the western model and raise their citizens' living standards?

No easy answers exist. Posner and Weisbach look not only at the ethical principles, such as corrective justice or distributive justice, but also at how they relate to the practicalities of reducing emissions. Two broad approaches exist: the first can be labelled command and control; the second is to rely on market forces and individuals to choose the right technologies and apply them. The best approach is a mix of the two. Authorities can set incentives and disincentives, impose carbon taxes, and organise sequestration of carbon. They can also establish cap-and-trade arrangements by which, having set an overall limit on emissions, they can issue permits to pollute that can be bought and sold.

Underlying everything is the problem of how to calculate costs and benefits. Discounting the future is already a fraught subject among economists. We simply do not know enough and probably never will.

We are back to problems of justice. In varying degrees, the main industrial countries are already trying to lower their emissions and help others. But by what means, by how much and in what form remains in dispute. Countries such as China also accept the need to lower their emissions, and are investing in new technologies to do so. Other nations give the issue low priority and demand help before considering any real action.

Posner and Weisbach conclude that, given the uncertainties, the best outcome would be a ""welfare promoting agreement to deal with climate change, using science and economics to settle the optimum level of emission reductions"". They recognise when assessing national interests that some may have to contribute more than others but all should see some kind of advantage, whether in economic, moral or other terms. They also think that states should seek justice-related goals independently of climate issues. In other words, nations should deal with the problems of global equity and redistribution of resources on their own rather than include them in a climate change agreement. In their view, mixing the two could prejudice both.

This book contains many good points but is no easy read. It is dominated by conventional thinking about economics and works on a somewhat misleading division between developed and developing countries. It also tends to see the future as simply a continuation of the present. There is relatively little about the possibilities of rapid climate change increasing damage to the environment. Justice is an elusive concept throughout.

"Wednesday, May 26, 2010 387 mots",,Brussels reopens climate change debate,By Fiona Harvey and Joshua Chaffin,,"The European Commission reopened an acrimonious argument on climate change policy on Wednesday, with the presentation of a discussion document on toughening its targets on greenhouse gas emissions.

Some member states, including the UK, are calling for the European Union to cut its emissions by 30 per cent compared with 1990 levels by 2020, a substantial strengthening of the 20 per cent already pledged.

But nations such as Poland and Italy are adamant that the higher level of cuts represents too heavy a burden on their industries.

In the document, the Commission noted that the effects of the recession, which pushed down emissions across the bloc, had made it much easier and cheaper to cut emissions.

The cost of meeting the 20 per cent target has dropped from €70bn to €48bn per year since 2008, according to the report. Moving to a 30 per cent target would cost an extra €33bn per year by 2020.

Weighed against this would also be benefits, such as lower health costs from air pollution.

Some member states say moving to 30 per cent would stimulate the growth of low-carbon technologies, and would make it easier for Europe to meet the 2050 target of cutting emissions by 80 per cent.

Chris Huhne, the UK's secretary of state for energy and climate change, said: ""Global climate change is the biggest challenge the world faces and securing an ambitious deal is a priority for this government. That's why we will push for the EU to demonstrate leadership by supporting an increase in the EU emissions reduction target to 30 per cent by 2020.""

But the last time the possibility of 30 per cent cuts was discussed, there was such opposition to it that a compromise was established of cutting emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 but offering to move to higher cuts if other nations also agreed to substantial reductions. This was intended to encourage other countries to up their offers of taking action on greenhouse gases.

That did not happen at the Copenhagen climate summit last December, when the Commission was forced to admit that no other country was calling on the EU to move to the higher target. Critics of the higher target say agreeing unilaterally to the increase in cuts only leaves Europe without leverage in the international negotiations.

Wednesday's announcement was timed to come just before the restart on May 31 of the stalled United Nations talks on a new treaty to replace the Kyoto protocol.

However, the document does not represent a firm plan by the Commission to push for member states to adopt the 30 per cent target. Instead, it has been carefully positioned as a way of providing information on the costs and benefits of toughening the target.

Connie Hedegaard, commissioner for climate change, is well aware that any proposal to increase the target will face vocal opposition from some member states, and from many sections of business."
"WORLD NEWS, Thursday, February 4, 2010 270 mots, p. 6",,Climate panel's arduous task,,,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent

What is the IPCC? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a forum of the world's leading global warming experts, was convened by the United Nations in 1988 to draw up a report summarising climate science. Why is it under fire? In early January, the New Scientist, a British magazine, reported that a claim in the 2007 IPCC report on climate change - that the Himalaya's glaciers could lose most of their mass by 2035 - was based on a report by WWF, the environmental group, which in turn was based on the New Scientist's account of a 1999 interview with an Indian glaciologist. The expert in question did not repeat the claim in any peer-reviewed study. To cite such a source for such a dramatic claim was considered a bad mistake.

Why does its process take so long? Several hundred scientists are chosen to be lead authors who draw on the work of thousands of other scientists. The erroneous claim that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 was one line in the 2007 report, which ran to about 1,000 pages. Does that mean that the IPCC's conclusions could be based on faulty data that have not been rigorously analysed? It's not so simple. Reports from many climate sceptics are included.

The most important part of the IPCC process is taking these diverse views and boiling them down.

First, they are condensed to a technical summary, which is then reviewed and distilled into a short summary for policymakers. This is the crucial document - the SPM is presented to governments to inform negotiations and its conclusions are generally supported by various data.

Is that it? Then, all governments are invited to send a delegation to discuss the SPM. Only when every word is approved by every government can it be published. Critics say this produces a bland document, but it is also one no government can disown. If the process is so arduous, why have mistakes slipped through? The contested claims come from the wider report, not the SPM."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Friday, October 1, 2010 270 mots, p. 10",,Climate change panel needs urgent reform,,,"Sir, Andrew Turnbull ("" A climate overhaul is needed to win back public trust "", Comment, September 27) argues for a meta-inquiry into the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia. Yet if his aim really is the restoration of public confidence in science, this seems an odd way to go about it. Better to focus limited political resource on reforming the critical science policy interface - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

I therefore support Lord Turnbull's call for the immediate implementation of the InterAcademy Council's recommendations for the IPCC's management structures, governance and procedures. Future IPCC assessments must be able to withstand the intense scrutiny appropriate to potentially momentous changes in our economic and social systems.

Indeed I would go further. As soon as practicable, the IPCC should separate its climate science assessment from that on policy options.

Instead of the current three working groups (on physical science, impacts/vulnerability and mitigation) there should just be two. The first on our understanding of the changing climate system and the observed and projected impacts. The second on the range of available policy options (mitigation, adaptation and geo-engineering) in the context of this scientific evidence. The timing of their two reports should be substantially decoupled so that the conclusions from each can be fully assimilated and reflected in the other on an ongoing and cyclical basis.

This would spread the load on senior IPCC officials and reduce the risk of errors. The separation of the science assessment and response options would also help reinforce this crucial distinction in the minds of IPCC authors, the media and public. Together with the management and governance reforms urged by the IAC, these changes would provide a solid basis for restoring public confidence in climate science and the IPCC - a prerequisite for translating concern into effective and proportionate action.

"NATIONAL NEWS, Thursday, April 15, 2010 392 mots, p. 4",,Global warming graph attacked by study,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"'Hockey stick'

A key piece of evidence in climate change science was slammed as ""exaggerated"" yesterday by the UK's leading statistician, in a vindication of claims that global warming sceptics have been making for years.

Professor David Hand, president of the Royal Statistical Society, said that a graph shaped like an ice hockey stick that has been used to represent the recent rise in global temperatures had been compiled using ""inappropriate"" methods.

""It used a particular statistical technique that exaggerated the effect [of recent warming],"" he said.

The criticism came as part of a report published yesterday that found the scientists behind the ""Climategate"" e-mail scandal had behaved ""honestly and fairly"" and showed ""no evidence of any deliberate scientific malpractice"".

The e-mails were hacked last autumn from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. They caused a storm, as they appeared to show scientists manipulating and concealing data.

Although yesterday's report - commissioned by UEA with advice from the Royal Society, the UK's prestigious national science academy - exonerated the unit's scientists, it criticised climate experts for failures in handling statistics.

""It is very surprising that research in an area that depends so heavily on statistical methods has not been carried out in close collaboration with professional statisticians,"" the report concluded.

The hockey stick graph was a key part of the scandal. In the e-mails, UEA's Professor Phil Jones referred to a ""trick"" to ""hide the decline"" in temperatures suggested by certain sources of data. A similar trick was used in the hockey stick graph.

The UEA scientists said that ""trick"" merely referred to a scientific technique - an explanation accepted by some sceptics, including Lord Lawson, former Tory chancellor.

Prof Hand said his criticisms should not be seen as invalidating climate science. He pointed out that although the hockey stick graph - which dates from a study led by US climate scientist Michael Mann in 1998 - exaggerates some effects, the underlying data show a clear warming signal.

He accused sceptics of ""identifying a few particular issues and blowing them up"" to distort the true picture. The handful of errors found so far, including the exaggerated hockey stick graph and a mistaken claim by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035, were ""isolated incidents"", he said. ""If you look at any area of science, you would be able to find odd examples like this. It doesn't detract from the vast bulk of the conclusions,"" he said.

The report into the science produced by UEA, which came from a panel chaired by Lord Oxburgh, a scientist and former Shell chairman, was the second investigation into Climategate in the UK. The first, by a committee of MPs, also found the scientists innocent of manipulating data, though it said they may have breached Freedom of Information legislation.

An investigation into the scientists' handling of FOI requests is still under way."
"WORLD NEWS, Saturday, February 20, 2010 431 mots, p. 5",,Departing UN climate change chief pessimistic over Cancún deal prospects,By Fiona Harvey in London,,"De Boer dashes hopes for meeting

Hopes that the world's biggest polluters will strike a deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions this year have been dashed by the outgoing United Nations official in charge of the talks.

Yvo de Boer, whose unexpected resignation as the UN's climate change chief this week dismayed policymakers and campaigners, said there was a ""big question mark"" over whether a meeting of the world's biggest economies in December would produce a treaty to tackle global warming.

Governments were hoping to adapt a limited accord signed two months ago at Copenhagen, which requires big cuts in emissions by 2020, into a fully fledged treaty at the talks in Mexico.

But Mr de Boer, who will leave in July, told the Financial Times yesterday: ""I think you could get a decision at Cancún, and what is agreed there [could be] turned into a treaty, but getting the big agreements on the content and the form at the same time, and finalising that in two weeks - that is a very heavy lift.""

His comments are a blow to hopes for a more substantial accord and provide further ammunition to those calling for the urgent reform or abandonment of the UN decision-making process. ""This resignation is simply dispiriting,"" said Paul Bledsoe, policy director at the US National Commission on Energy Policy and a former White House adviser. ""If someone as politically adept, dedicated and charismatic as Yvo de Boer can't bring the [UN] process to heel, then the process is broken and has to be reformed.""

Mr de Boer gave a crumb of comfort to supporters of a treaty, saying businesses were taking up the challenge of climate change in spite of the failure of governments to draw up a legal framework on -emissions.

In thinly veiled criticism of governments' reluctance to involve business, he said: ""The [negotiating] text is deafeningly silent on the role of the private sector. Regulators have the opportunity to design [an agreement] in co-operation with business, to finally prove that action on climate change can lead to growth, not just to costs.""

Mr de Boer will leave for an advisory post with KPMG, the consultancy, and is in talks with universities including Yale and Utrecht on academic roles. He follows other prominent public sector officials with an interest in climate change who have taken jobs in the private sector, including Al Gore, former US vice-president.

Mr de Boer can boast a partial success to crown his career as a public servant: the Copenhagen Accord, which for the first time drew from both rich and poor countries pledges to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, and promised financial assistance from the developed to the developing world to do so.

The accord has been attacked by critics who argue that the emissions reduction commitments are -inadequate, and that the accord has little meaning as it is not a legally binding treaty.

His successor will have a tough task, facing stiff opposition from a wave of climate change scepticism, which has resurged in the wake of a series of scandals, including flaws in the data used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. These include the citation of an untrue claim that the Himalayan glaciers would melt by 2035; experts think it will take much longer.

"WORLD NEWS, Tuesday, March 9, 2010 378 mots, p. 5",,Climate treaty hopes quashed,"By Fiona Harvey, Environment Correspondent",,"EU commissioner voices pessimismHard sell seen as counterproductive

The world will almost certainly fail to draw up a new treaty on climate change this year, the minister in charge of last year's Copenhagen summit has admitted, delivering a heavy blow to the barely flickering hopes for a swift global -settlement.

Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister who masterminded the summit of world leaders on global warming last year and is now the European commissioner for climate change, told the Financial Times that negotiations were not progressing fast enough for a treaty to be signed soon.

She also gave a warning that pushing too hard for a treaty this year could be counterproductive.

""To get every detail set in the next nine months looks very difficult,"" she said. ""Europe would love that to happen, and I would love that to happen . . . but my feeling is that it is going to be very difficult to get a treaty.""

Her pessimism echoed that of the outgoing United Nations climate change chief, Yvo de Boer. He told the FT as he resigned last month after four years of seeking an agreement that he could not see a treaty being signed this year.

The admission comes against the backdrop of a resurgence of climate change scepticism, fuelled by a series of mistakes by scientists that have encouraged many politicians to oppose emissions regulation.

Governments had been hoping to forge a final treaty at a global conference this December in Mexico, after failing to do so in Copenhagen.

However, Ms Hedegaard said this was more likely to happen at a follow-up meeting next year in South Africa.

That would still allow governments to meet their self-imposed deadline of forging a new agreement before the end of 2012, when the current provisions of the world's only existing treaty on greenhouse gas emissions, the 1997 Kyoto protocol, expire. Ms Hedegaard robustly defended the Copenhagen summit, which attracted loud criticism, especially for the chaotic way in which it finished. She said that calling world leaders to the long-running negotiations had ensured rapid progress towards the end, when for the first time developed and developing countries mutually agreed limits on their emissions.

But she said there would not be another Copenhagen-style summit. ""You can do such a thing one time,"" she said.

The price of failure, if diplomats tried to force an agreement this year, was too high, Ms Hedegaard said. ""People would say let's skip that idea, let's skip the UN thing,"" she said.

She also defended climate scientists, saying flaws in the 2007 report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the e-mails in which scientists talked of concealing data did not affect the large body of scientific evidence amassed over decades."
"LETTERS TO THE EDITOR, Tuesday, February 2, 2010 206 mots, p. 12",,Make climate change politics matter,,,"Mr Matthew Lockwood.

Sir, Fiona Harvey is harsh on green campaigning groups whose members worked hard to raise the issue of climate change up the international agenda (""Green is the colour of climate change discord"", January 29), but she nevertheless has a point about the Copenhagen climate summit. The United Nations negotiations that led up to Copenhagen have always been and still are conducted in a green bubble, even if more than 100 leaders felt the need to attend on this occasion.

At the moment, the important countries appear supportive of the accord struck in Denmark. But it's difficult to say whether this process is the formation of a new wave of climate talks or merely a ripple of political expediency resulting from leaders needing to leave Copenhagen with something to show for their trip. The underlying reality is that, in spite of all the attention the issue has received in recent months, opinion polls consistently show that climate change remains a low priority for most people - especially in the US where support for action is so critical.

Thus, while green groups may be asking for too much and governments may be promising too little, the politics of climate change are tough. This calls for an urgent reframing of the issue in terms that matter to people now: less dependence on oil, investment in renewable energy, renewed economic growth as a result of innovation, jobs, and security.

"GLOBAL INSIGHT - CLIVE COOKSON, Friday, January 29, 2010 543 mots, p. 11",,Climate sceptics bask in the light as science steers clear of debate,By Clive Cookson,,"Climate scientists were desperately hoping for a fresh start this year after the disappointing outcome of last month's Copenhagen conference and the ""Climategate"" debacle, in which e-mails stolen from the University of East Anglia allegedly showed scientists suppressing data that did not suit their case for man-made global warming.

However, far from enjoying a respite, bad news continues to flow. Yesterday, for example, the UK Information Commissioner's Office said UEA's climatic research unit breached freedom of information rules by failing to provide data requested by climate sceptics, though complaints were made too late for the university to face legal action.

More serious may be an assault on the reputation of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose assessments underpin the whole UN-sponsored battle against global warming.

The most damaging revelation is that a forecast in the IPCC's 2007 report, the likely disappearance of Himalayan glaciers by 2035, was based on an unsubstantiated assertion rather than good science. The IPCC was forced into an apology and a promise by Rajendra Pachauri, its chairman, that ""we will ensure greater consistency in the next assessment report"".

Climate sceptics sense an opportunity to weaken or even destroy a body they have always disliked - because its reports have shown how widespread is the scientific consensus on man-made global warming - and have loathed since it won a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, the former US vice-president.

Other accusations are flowing from sceptics' publications. Two frequent examples are that the IPCC's conclusions about Amazon deforestation and the increasing risk of storms in a warming world are also based on unsubstantiated work. There are snide comments too about Mr Pachauri's lifestyle and alleged conflicts of interest.

Environmental scientists are proving poor defenders of what remains their overwhelming view: that human activities - mainly the use of coal, oil and gas - are inducing climate change that will become ever more dangerous and requires urgent action. The reluctanceto speak out is reminiscent of the silence a few years ago when plant genetic engineering was under sustained assault, particularly in Europe.

The big difference is that then scientific consensus - that genetically modified crops were safe and desirable to increase agricultural productivity - was being attacked by environmental groups, which accused researchers of being in thrall to big biotech. Now scientists are on the same side of the climate change argument as campaigning groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, but they still seem shy about public debate.

Interestingly a movement to defend the IPCC and Mr Pachauri is developing in his native India, apparently motivated partly by national pride. Darryl D'Monte, who chairs the Indian environmental journalists' forum, wrote in The Hindustan Times that ""vested interests, using British media, are seeking to discredit the IPCC . . . A smear campaign is being launched to undermine Pachauri and ultimately the IPCC.""

The few prominent scientists who have commented on recent events have emphasised the need for transparency in the IPCC and climate research more generally. No longer should there be such an emphasis on consensus in a field where there was still uncertainty on the effects of rising carbon dioxide levels.

China has called for sceptics' views to be included in the next IPCC assessment, though it will be hard to find many reputable scientists who deny that human activities will have a big impact on climate in the near future.

But the converse should also be true. Some scientists believe the last IPCC assessment was too cautious. The next one, they say, should give greater prominence to the loss of heat-reflecting polar ice and the release of vast quantities of methane (a greenhouse gas) through the melting of permafrost.

It remains to be seen whether Mr Pachauri can wrest back the initiative. For now the sceptics are enjoying the spotlight.

"National, Thursday, January 17, 2008 649 mots, p. A 24",,Climate Talk's Cancellation Splits a Town,By JIM ROBBINS,,"CHOTEAU, Mont. - School authorities' cancellation of a talk that a Nobel laureate climate researcher was to have given to high school students has deeply divided this small farming and ranching town at the base of the east side of the Rocky Mountains.

The scholar, Steven W. Running, a professor of ecology at the University of Montana, was scheduled to speak to about 130 students here last Thursday about his career and the global changes occurring because of the earth's warming.

Dr. Running was a lead author of a global warming report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the 400-member United Nations body that shared last year's Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. But when some residents complained that his presentation here would be one-sided because no opposing view would be offered, the superintendent of Choteau School District No. 1, Kevin St. John, canceled it.

Dr. Running was surprised.

""Disbelief was the primary reaction,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""I've never been canceled before. But it was almost comical. I had a pretty candid discussion with the superintendent and the school board, and they said there were some conservative citizens who didn't want me to speak.""

Mr. St. John said that numerous residents had complained to school board members and that they in turn had suggested that the program be called off.

Those who complained misunderstood the content of the talk, Mr. St. John said, but there was no time to explain to all of them that Dr. Running was a leading scientist rather than an agenda-driven ideologue.

""It was my failure to articulate who he is and what he was here for,"" the superintendent said. ""He's a Nobel scientist, highly distinguished, but people thought he was something else. Academic freedom is very important here, and science education is very important here.""

Still, as in much of the West, Choteau is home to a deep-seated mistrust of environmentalism, which many here see as a threat to their agricultural way of life. The town has also been largely on the pro-development side of a long and sometimes bitter battle over whether to exploit oil and gas reserves along the wild Rocky Mountain front or to preserve it primarily for wilderness and wildlife.

Finally, there is the raw politics of the matter. Dr. Running specializes in an issue associated with Mr. Gore, not a popular figure among many in this predominantly Republican town.

But Mr. St. John said he had in no way intended to censor Dr. Running, who in fact presented a previously scheduled evening lecture on climate change at the high school the day he was to have spoken during school hours. Only a handful of students were among the 140 or so people at the evening talk, however, because it coincided with a high school basketball game, a big source of entertainment in small-town Montana. Dr. Running did not mention the cancellation or the resulting controversy in his presentation, ""The Five Stages of Climate Grief,"" which was sponsored by the Sonoran Institute, an environmental group.

The first two of the five stages are denial and anger, Dr. Running said in the phone interview, so he understands the opposition to his addressing the students.

The controversy here intensified when a local student's article criticizing school officials was published Monday on the student-created ""Class Act Page"" of The Great Falls Tribune, a statewide daily.

""I was insulted as a high school student prepared to enter the world I need to hear both sides of the story,"" the student, Kip Barhaugh, 17, said in an interview Tuesday. ""I don't feel there is another side. Global warming is not a controversial issue, it's a fact. We need to be prepared to deal with it.""

People on Main Street here were divided over the cancellation. Melody Martinsen, the editor of The Choteau Acantha, a local weekly, said that while she rarely received letters to the editor, ""this week I have nine and seven are on the subject, and they are all chastising the school board.""

Kirk Moore, the owner of a farm and ranch store, is a school board member who favored canceling the talk. But he declined to say why. ""No comment,"" Mr. Moore said. ""Go talk to the superintendent.""

Jill Owen, the owner of an organic grocery and bookstore, wrote a letter to the school board that opposed the cancellation. ""We were disappointed the school board would turn down an opportunity for a Nobel laureate to speak,"" Ms. Owen said. ""We need to inspire kids in math and science, and it would have been great.""

Dr. Running, 57, said high school students were an important audience for his message about climate change. ""Our generation caused the problem,"" he said, ""and I want to talk to high schools because they are the generation that will solve the problem. And we can't solve the problem without a free discussion."""

THE GREAT WARMING

Climate Change and the Rise and Fall of Civilizations

By Brian Fagan

Illustrated. Bloomsbury Press. 282 pages. $26.95.

If you don't think climate change produces winners as well as losers, consider this: In the 12th and 13th centuries England exported wine to France. Vineyards also flourished in improbable regions like southern Norway and eastern Prussia. A centuries-long spell of mild, predictable weather blessed Western Europe with abundant crops, healthy populations and budget surpluses sufficient to finance projects like Chartres Cathedral.

This is the credit side of a global balance sheet carefully itemized by Brian Fagan in ""The Great Warming,"" his fascinating account of shifting climatic conditions and their consequences from about A.D. 800 to 1300, often referred to as the Medieval Warm Period. The debit side is appalling: widespread drought, catastrophic rainfall, toppled dynasties, ruined civilizations. Abandoned Maya temples in the Yucatan and the desolation of Angkor Wat, supreme achievement of the Khmer empire, bear witness to climatic change against which royal power and priestly magic proved impotent.

Mr. Fagan, an anthropologist who has written on climate change in ""The Long Summer"" and ""The Little Ice Age,"" proceeds methodically, working his way across the globe and reading the evidence provided by tree rings, deep-sea cores, coral samples, computer weather models and satellite photos. The picture that emerges remains blurry -- scientists still understand little about such weather-changers as El Nino and La Nina -- but it has sharpened considerably over the past 40 years, enough for Mr. Fagan to present a coherent account of profound changes in human societies from the American Southwest to the Huang He River basin in China.

Longer summers and milder winters in Europe, especially stable from 1100 to 1300, allowed Norse explorers to range as far as Greenland and Labrador. At the same time a population boom in the rest of Europe led to radical deforestation, as trees were cleared to create farmland. By the end of the Medieval Warm Period half the forests that covered four-fifths of Western and Central Europe in A.D. 500 had disappeared.

Across vast swaths of the globe, however, severe, persistent droughts lasted not just for years but for generations. The Sierras of modern-day California experienced the severest droughts of the past 4,000 to 7,000 years. Acorn trees died, and along with them peoples largely dependent on acorns for food. Although data remain sketchy, it seems probable that extended droughts dried up pastureland on the Central Asian steppe, propelling the armies of Genghis Khan westward.

In the southern Yucatan arid conditions proved too much for the elaborate reservoirs, called ""water mountains,"" that the Maya used to irrigate their fields. Mr. Fagan permits himself an ominous aside: ""The analogies to modern-day California, with its aqueducts for water-hungry Los Angeles, or to cities such as Tucson, Ariz., with its shrinking aquifers and falling water table, are irresistible.""

Mr. Fagan is as interested in human adaptation as he is in weather. While California's acorn eaters suffered, peoples in the Southwestern deserts expanded their diet to include new edible plants. In the Sahara caravan organizers simply adjusted their routes according to changing rainfall patterns.

""The camel and its load-carrying saddle proved an effective weapon against heat and drought even in the worst years, when extreme aridity affected cattle people living far south of the desert,"" Mr. Fagan writes.

Northern China got the worst of both worlds during the Medieval Warm Period: violent climatic swings that resulted in lengthy dry spells or torrential rainfall. Meanwhile, in the South Pacific, faltering trade winds allowed Polynesian voyagers to head east, eventually reaching Rapa Nui (Easter Island) around 1200.

Mr. Fagan has a somewhat rigid, formulaic way of presenting his material. Well aware that the general reader can handle only limited amounts of ice-core data, he tries to generate period atmosphere by including present-tense ""you are there"" episodes. ""The hushed crowd in the plaza gazes upward to the temple at the summit of the pyramid,"" one section begins. A little drama certainly helps, but he overworks this device. The book is overpopulated with sweating plowmen and fishermen peering into the mist.

The causes of the Medieval Warm Period remain unclear, and there is debate over what the actual temperatures were. Mr. Fagan draws one unambiguous conclusion from the evidence, however, in a final chapter on the present-day implications of the great warming of a thousand years ago. Drought is the great enemy, ""the silent and insidious killer associated with global warming,"" he writes.

Population density has placed enormous pressure on increasingly scarce water resources. As a result modern droughts, brought on by El Nino events, have taken an enormous toll in lives and wreaked measureless economic devastation. Prepare for worse.

""Judging from the arid cycles of a thousand years ago, the droughts of a warmer future will become more prolonged and harsher,"" Mr. Fagan writes. ""Even without greenhouse gases, the effects of prolonged droughts would be far more catastrophic today than they were even a century ago.""

For a spark of hope Mr. Fagan offers the example of Chimor, a kingdom in coastal Peru tormented by El Nino flooding and severe droughts throughout the Medieval Warm Period. The Chimu people thrived nonetheless by diversifying their food supply and protecting their scarce water resources. In a historically arid region with uncertain food supplies, they successfully tapped their centuries of experience with irrigation, soil conservation and water management. Look no further for a global-warming role model."
"Business/Financial, Saturday, March 22, 2008 1091 mots, p. C 1",,"On an Island Paradise, Seeking Global Warming's Silver Lining",By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; Andrew Ross Sorkin reported from Necker Island and added updated information from New York.,,"NECKER ISLAND, British Virgin Islands - Richard Branson was lounging under the starry midnight sky on this palm-dappled speck of an island recently when he popped a sobering question.

""So, do we really think the world is on fire?"" Mr. Branson, the British magnate and adventurer, asked several guests as a manservant scurried off to fetch him another glass of pinot grigio.

What he wanted to know was whether his high-powered visitors, among them Larry Page of Google, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia and Tony Blair, the former prime minister of Britain, thought global warming threatened the planet.

Mr. Branson does -- and so did most of his guests. So on this recent weekend they assembled here, on his private hideaway in the waters between the islands of Tortola and Anegada, to figure out what to do about it and perhaps get richer in the process.

Some of them, like Mr. Page, jet-pooled in from Silicon Valley, where the financiers who bankrolled the Web boom of the 1990s are chasing the new New Thing: green power. In an era of $100-a-barrel oil, venture capitalists like Vinod Khosla, another invitee, are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into young companies that cook up biofuels and harness the power of the sun.

Mr. Blair, now a senior adviser to JPMorgan Chase, squeezed in a few idyllic hours here between assignments (he flew in late from California and left early for Jerusalem). Another attendee only sort-of showed up. The Medusa, the 198-foot yacht owned by Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, was moored off Necker Island all weekend, but Mr. Allen never made an appearance.

Mr. Branson hopes the Caribbean getaway weekend will be the first of many, an intimate, enviro-version of the annual media gathering in Sun Valley, Idaho, sponsored by Allen & Company. It was the brainchild of Richard Stromback, a former professional hockey player who has remade himself as a clean-technology entrepreneur. Mr. Stromback, who was host of the weekend and is the chief executive of Ecology Coatings, joked that a gathering like this might seem nefarious to some people.

""In James Bond movies, evil-doers meet in exotic settings to plot the destruction of the planet,"" Mr. Stromback said, puffing on a cigar before dinner. ""This is the opposite of that.""

So far, however, the hopes and dreams of alternative energy have far outstripped reality. But for Mr. Stromback and many others here, a confluence of two powerful forces -- soaring oil prices and growing concern over global warming -- means the era of economically viable green power is finally at hand.

Many executives and financiers, including some in attendance, have a lot of money riding on global warming. Mr. Branson, for example, has invested in a host of alternative energy enterprises, including recently flying the first biofuel-powered plane engine for Virgin Atlantic. He also put up $25 million in prize money to challenge scientists to find a way to extract greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

Mr. Khosla, the founding chief executive of Sun Microsystems and one of the most successful venture capitalists in Silicon Valley, has at least 33 investments in clean tech, including new fermentation technology to make fuel-grade ethanol.

Much of the weekend was spent hashing over ideas in Mr. Branson's new open-air yoga pavilion in between massages, kite-surfing lessons and meals on beaches around the island, which Mr. Branson said he bought for $:180,000 in the late-1970's and now rents for as much as $250,000 a week to outside guests. (He's trying to make the island carbon-neutral and has erected a test windmill.) Talk ranged from the practicality of electric-powered cars to how much money would have to be invested in biofuels to reduce the price of crude to $35 a barrel, a prospect Mr. Khosla said he considered ""totally realistic.""

But the big question that hung over the meeting was whether the world could ever work together to tackle climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.

""We have an agreement that there should be an agreement,"" said Mr. Blair, dressed in a white polo shirt, blue cargo shorts and Nike sneakers. ""But there's no agreement on what that agreement should be.""

Mr. Blair, who last week announced his Breaking the Climate Deadlock Initiative, predicted that the United States would soon adopt a so-called cap and trade system for carbon emissions, as the European Union has done, with mixed success. But, he contended, ""I'm a little skeptical that it will work unless it's part of a global deal.""

As an alternative, Shai Agassi, the former president of SAP's product and technology group, suggested having companies buy carbon insurance. Insurance companies, after all, price all kinds of risks. ""They know how to put a price on it better than the bookies,"" said Mr. Agassi, whose start-up, Better P.L.C., is trying to support the use of fleets of electric vehicles in Israel and elsewhere. (Stanley Fink, the deputy chairman of the Man Group, the world's largest hedge fund, with $72 billion, suggested that insurance companies often misprice risk -- as in the subprime debacle.)

Everyone, it seemed, had some project in the works. Elon Musk, the co-founder of Paypal, talked about his latest project: Tesla Motors, a Silicon Valley company that makes sexy electric sports cars retailing for $100,000. Mr. Page has ordered one.

D. Hunt Ramsbottom, the chief executive of Rentech, talked about his plans to make biofuels for airplanes. William McDonough, the designer, showed renderings of recent planned projects: a building in Abu Dhabi with solar panels built into the windows and a distribution center with a grass roof. And Mr. Page, who was married on Necker Island a few months ago, talked about problems with permits that Google has faced in trying to use solar energy.

With no naysayers on the island, the weekend, which was organized in part by the Climate Group, a nonprofit, was filled with hopeful talk about the ""war against carbon,"" as Mr. Branson put it. But there was also talk of money, which most of the attendees had plenty of. And to make any of these technologies successful, they all agreed the solutions had to be profitable without subsidies.

""It can't work any other way,"" Mr. Khosla said.

Mr. Page of Google complained that it is still too easy to make a profitable environmentally friendly product that does not go far enough. ""We need to give people permission to think really big,"" he said. He recounted how when an engineer told him he could produce electricity at 10 cents a kilowatt, he asked if it could be brought down to 3 cents.

After a breakfast of scrambled eggs with salmon on the deck outside the main house Sunday morning, Mr. Branson spent most the day talking about his next big idea. He wants to create a coalition of the most respected people in business to help champion environmental ""best practices"" -- a resource for governments and multinational companies looking for help as they develop environmentally sound policies.

He is tentatively calling the group the War Room. He wants to model it after another group he formed last year, the Elders, with Desmond Tutu, Jimmy Carter and Nelson Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, to help solve the world's political and humanitarian problems.

Mr. Branson was canvassing for names to run it. Someone wondered: what about Warren Buffett?

Of course, there was plenty of time for fun and games. After lunch one afternoon Mr. Branson suggested the entire group sail off to Mosquito, a nearby island he also owns, aboard a dozen catamarans. He said there was a party over there.

One of Mr. Blair's security personnel trailed behind in a motorboat. Mr. Page, an avid kite surfer, struck out alone.

As the catamarans beached on Mosquito, music was blaring and women in bikinis were dancing. Mr. Branson deadpanned, ""Normally the girls would be naked, but the prime minister is here."""
"Science, Tuesday, March 25, 2008 529 mots, p. F 3",,Link to Global Warming in Frogs' Disappearance Is Challenged,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"In the scientific equivalent of the board game Clue, teams of biologists have been sifting spotty evidence and pointing to various culprits in the widespread vanishing of harlequin frogs.

The amphibians, of the genus Atelopus -- actually toads despite their common name -- once hopped in great numbers along stream banks on misty slopes from the Andes to Costa Rica. After 20 years of die-offs, they are listed as critically endangered by conservation groups and are mainly seen in zoos.

It looked as if one research team was a winner in 2006 when global warming was identified as the ""trigger"" in the extinctions by the authors of a much-cited paper in Nature. The researchers said they had found a clear link between unusually warm years and the vanishing of mountainside frog populations.

The ""bullet,"" the researchers said, appeared to be a chytrid fungus that has attacked amphibian populations in many parts of the world but thrives best in particular climate conditions.

The authors, led by J. Alan Pounds of the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve in Costa Rica, said, ""Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming."" The study was featured in reports last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Other researchers have been questioning that connection. Last year, two short responses in Nature questioned facets of the 2006 paper. In the journal, Dr. Pounds and his team said the new analyses in fact backed their view that ""global warming contributes to the present amphibian crisis,"" but avoided language saying it was ""a key factor,"" as they wrote in 2006.

Now, in the March 25 issue of PLoS Biology, another team argues that the die-offs of harlequins and some other amphibians reflect the spread and repeated introductions of the chytrid fungus. They question the analysis linking the disappearances to climate change. In interviews and e-mail exchanges, Dr. Pounds and the lead author of the new paper, Karen R. Lips of Southern Illinois University, disputed each other's analysis. Experts who have researched the amphibian said neither group had enough evidence to nail down its case and warned that this normal tussle over scientific details should not distract from the reality that humans are clearly roiling biology in ways important and yet poorly understood.

""There is so much we still do not know!"" David B. Wake, a biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail note after reading the new paper. The origin of the fungus and the way it kills amphibians remain unknown, he said, and there are ample mysteries about why it breaks out in certain places and times and not others.

Dr. Pounds and Dr. Lips have both done important work, Dr. Wake said, adding, ""I hope this does not turn into a 'spitting contest,' because we all have a lot to learn about amphibian declines.""

Ross A. Alford, a tropical biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, said such scientific tussles, while important, could be a distraction, particularly when considering the uncertain risks attending global warming.

""Arguing about whether we can or cannot already see the effects,"" he said, ""is like sitting in a house soaked in gasoline, having just dropped a lit match, and arguing about whether we can actually see the flames yet, while waiting to see if maybe it might go out on its own."""

GARRISON, N.Y. - At what was once a Capuchin monastery on the Hudson River, the Zen archers were out in force on Friday. They were members of a New York City group celebrating 10 years of study with a retreat at what's now the Garrison Institute, a New Agey organization that tries to meld contemplation and action.

The idea of the Zen archery is to combine intention and action, focus and carry-through. Physical action slows. The archer and the bow become one. The art becomes artless. The archer evolves through perseverance and discipline. Or so they say.

It's not much of a stretch to go from the visiting Zen archers to the institute's own initiative, an ambitious program next month to look at how the ideas of Mohandas K. Gandhi relate to current environmental issues, particularly climate change.

Central to Gandhi, after all, was the notion that the truth, power and moral force of a movement are inseparable from the truth, power and moral force of its actors.

Hence Gandhi nonviolently freeing India from the greatest empire of his time, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. overturning segregation in the South, Nelson Mandela ending apartheid -- intention wedded to action, focus leading to carry-through, evolution resulting from perseverance and discipline. Like the Zen archers, it may seem way too abstruse and exotic for the short attention span of modern life, but then, maybe not.

The Garrison Institute, founded in 2003, sits across the river from an important site in American environmental history, Storm King Mountain, where more than 40 years ago an epic battle over land use helped redefine environmental activism and law.

So there's nothing unexpected in the current melding of Gandhi and climate change, tied to the Metropolitan Opera's first staging of Philip Glass's opera about Gandhi, ""Satyagraha"" (""The Power of Truth""), beginning April 11. After that is a private conference at the institute, followed by a free public event on April 13 at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan including scholars, environmental leaders and artists, among them Mr. Glass.

The guiding notion is that climate change today calls for the same kind of collective will, shared destiny, moral purpose, personal responsibility and strategic acumen as the other great movements, and that Gandhi's ideas and achievements are entirely germane to what needs to happen now.

""The environment and nonviolence is like a marriage made in heaven,"" Mr. Glass said. ""If we treated the environment with nonviolence we wouldn't have the polar ice cap melting away.""

Remarkably, almost a century ago, Gandhi's writings were full of thoughts on the environment.

""The earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs, but not every man's greed.""

""God forbid that India should ever take to industrialism after the manner of the West. ... If [our nation] took to similar economic exploitation, it would strip the world bare like locusts.""

""This little globe of ours is not a toy of yesterday.""

""We may utilize the gifts of Nature just as we choose, but in Her books, the debits are always equal to the credits.""

To the reflexively jaundiced modern eye, Gandhi evokes a presence seemingly ancient and somewhat naive, but naive is the last word you could apply to Gandhi, who wedded moral insights to a shrewd tactical sense of politics and public opinion.

""He had an ability to find a very simple symbol that could mobilize a great number of people; think of his Salt March,"" said Gandhi's grandson and biographer, Rajmohan Gandhi, referring to the 1930 protest against the British tax on salt that helped galvanize India against British rule. ""You might say he was an advertising genius.""

Al Gore cited both Gandhi and Abraham Lincoln in a speech on climate change in 2007. He noted Gandhi's sense of satyagraha and a statement of Lincoln's during the depths of the Civil War: ""We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.""

But disenthralling ourselves, seeing the world and its perils afresh, may be even harder now than it has ever been -- too many diversions, too murky and vaporous a peril, too little sense of urgency, an enemy that is more us than them.

And if there's an advertising genius who has found the simple symbol to make people individually and collectively change behavior, he hasn't stepped forward.

From Storm King to Woodstock to the institutes and ashrams that dot the landscape today, the Hudson Valley has played a remarkable and barely understood role in the evolution of the nation's environmental and personal consciousness over the past half-century.

But skeptics might say it's produced more individual evolution than a transformed culture.

No mere conference is likely to change that, but maybe the Gandhi-philes will find some clues. Without them, we're left, it seems, with the few Zen archers able to magically hit their targets, while the vast majority of us neither know nor much care what ours are."
"Business/Financial, Tuesday, April 1, 2008 328 mots, p. C 8",,Gore Alliance Starts Ad Campaign on Global Warming,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"Former Vice President Al Gore and a nonprofit climate group have begun what they say will be a three-year $300 million advertising blitz to recruit 10 million advocates to seek laws and policies that can cut greenhouse gases.

The campaign was introduced in a ""60 Minutes"" appearance by Mr. Gore on Sunday. The first ad, posted online at wecansolveit.org , compares the challenge of fighting global warming to the invasion of Normandy and the civil rights movement.

That advertisement will start appearing on television Wednesday, according to the Alliance for Climate Protection, a group created by Mr. Gore in 2006. It will be followed by ads tailored to particular audiences and media, including the Internet.

About half the anticipated budget has been raised from donations, mostly from anonymous benefactors, people involved in the campaign said.

In a presentation on the campaign last week, Cathy Zoi, who heads the alliance and was formerly a Clinton administration environmental aide, said the goal was to replicate the marketing success of enduring public service ad campaigns like the frying egg depicted as ""your brain on drugs"" and the 1971 advertisement featuring a tearful American Indian considering a polluted landscape.

John P. Murry Jr., an associate professor of marketing at the University of Iowa who has studied public service advertising, said the campaign might be spending too little.

""I think the global warming project media budget should be 10 times as high,"" he said. ""Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi spend over a billion dollars each year to promote brand preference for soft drinks. In this light, the $100 million per year to change our lifestyles seems pretty small.""

Pollsters and communications experts have noted that the public remains deeply divided along party lines over global warming and that the issue rarely shows up on voters' lists of worries.

Ms. Zoi said the goal was to recruit people she described as ""influentials."" She added: ""These are people who talk to five times as many people a day as the typical person, who derive self-esteem from having new information.""

The ads will be coordinated with outreach through organizations like the United Steelworkers union and the Girl Scouts.

On various blogs on Monday, reactions ranged from strong support to complaints that the money would be better spent on energy research and that the effort would mainly swell coffers of environmental campaigners and carbon traders."
"Week in Review, Sunday, April 6, 2008 873 mots, p. WK 3",,IDEAS & TRENDS,,,"By ANDREW C. REVKIN

The charged and complex debate over how to slow down global warming has become a lot more complicated.

Most of the focus in the last few years has centered on imposing caps on greenhouse gas emissions to prod energy users to conserve or switch to nonpolluting technologies.

Leaders of the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change -- the scientists awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year with former Vice President Al Gore -- have emphasized that market-based approach. All three presidential candidates are behind it. And it has framed international talks over a new climate treaty and debate within the United States over climate legislation

But now, with recent data showing an unexpected rise in global emissions and a decline in energy efficiency, a growing chorus of economists, scientists and students of energy policy are saying that whatever benefits the cap approach yields, it will be too little and come too late.

The economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, head of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, stated the case bluntly in a recent article in Scientific American: ""Even with a cutback in wasteful energy spending, our current technologies cannot support both a decline in carbon dioxide emissions and an expanding global economy. If we try to restrain emissions without a fundamentally new set of technologies, we will end up stifling economic growth, including the development prospects for billions of people.""

What is needed, Mr. Sachs and others say, is the development of radically advanced low-carbon technologies, which they say will only come about with greatly increased spending by determined governments on what has so far been an anemic commitment to research and development. A Manhattan-like Project, so to speak.

And time is critical, they say, as China, India and other developing nations march headlong into the modern world of cars and electric consumption on their way to becoming the dominant producer of greenhouse gases for decades to come. Indeed, China is building, on average, one large coal-burning power plant a week.

In an article in the journal Nature last week, researchers concerned with the economics, politics, and science of climate also argued that technology policy, not emissions policy, must dominate.

""There is no question about whether technological innovation is necessary -- it is,"" said the authors, Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado; Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and Christopher Green, an economist at McGill University. ""The question is, to what degree should policy focus directly on motivating such innovation?""

Proponents of treaties and legislation that would cap emissions don't disagree with this call to arms for new, low-carbon technologies. But they say the cap approach should not be ignored, either.

One of them is Joseph Romm, a blogger on climate and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit group pushing for federal legislation to restrict greenhouse gases.

""Of course we need aggressive investments in R. and D. -- I for one have been arguing that for two decades,"" Mr. Romm wrote in a post to his blog, climateprogress.org. ""But if we don't start aggressively deploying the technologies we have now for the next quarter century, then all the new technologies in the world won't avert catastrophe.""

Another expert who has emphasized the importance of capping emissions, Adil Najam of Boston University, said he hoped this emerging debate would not distract from doing whatever is possible now to curb emissions.

""You can do a tremendous lot with available technology,"" said Professor Najam, one of the authors of the intergovernmental panel's report on policy options. ""It is true that this will not be enough to lick the problem, but it will be a very significant and probably necessary difference.""

But Professor Pielke and his co-authors say that a recent rise in emissions -- particularly in fast-growing emerging powers -- points to the need for government to push aggressively for technological advances instead of waiting for the market to force reductions in emissions.

Mr. Sachs pointed to several promising technologies -- capturing and burying carbon dioxide, plug-in hybrid cars and solar-thermal electric plants. ""Each will require a combination of factors to succeed: more applied scientific research, important regulatory changes, appropriate infrastructure, public acceptance and early high-cost investments,"" he said. ""A failure on one or more of these points could kill the technologies.""

In short, what is needed, he said, is a ""major overhaul of energy technology"" financed by ""large-scale public funding of research, development and demonstration projects.""

At the same time, China and India continue to insist that economic growth is both their priority and right. They argue that the established economic powers should be responsible for spearheading the research to reduce carbon emissions. After all, the United States and Europe spent more than a century growing wealthy by burning fossil fuels.

Developing countries repeatedly made that point last week in Bangkok in the latest round of United Nations talks over the shape of a new climate agreement. But the United States rejected a proposal from China that 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product of industrialized countries be used to disseminate nonpolluting energy technologies.

As if to underscore the energy and emissions trajectories in Asia's emerging powerhouses --and the priority placed on growth there and among important international institutions -- the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank is planning to vote on Monday on helping to finance a four-billion-watt complex of coal-burning power plants, the ""Ultra Mega"" complex, in Gujarat State in India."
"Foreign, Sunday, April 6, 2008 544 mots, p. A 14",,Amazon's 'Forest Peoples' Seek a Role in Striking Global Climate Agreements,By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO,,"MANAUS, Brazil - Some wore traditional headdresses, and some traveled by riverboat or canoe. But the dozens of ""forest peoples"" who descended on this capital of Amazonas State last week had a common goal of becoming bigger players in global climate talks.

A conference here that ended last Friday drew leaders of hundreds of indigenous groups in 11 Latin American countries and observers from Indonesia and Congo, the largest gathering of its kind, organizers said. They came to build a consensus for a plan in which wealthier countries would compensate developing countries for conserving tropical forests like the Amazon.

Such an international carbon-trading plan has been gaining momentum and was a central topic last December at a climate conference in Bali, Indonesia. Scientists generally agree that tropical deforestation accounts for 20 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

""There is a real sense that this potentially represents a huge opportunity for forest peoples to influence climate change negotiations and create larger-scale incentives to stop deforestation and improve their living conditions,"" said Stephan Schwartzman of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, who attended the discussions here.

On Friday, representatives from the 11 Latin American countries signed a declaration establishing the International Alliance of Forest Peoples and vowed to continue to push for a place at the table of climate change talks.

The Indonesian government has been promoting the idea of carbon trading at climate talks. But environmentalists see South America, where native populations have stronger legal claims to the land, as a major staging ground for building support for the concept.

Unlike Southeast Asia, where land is more tightly controlled by national governments, Brazil has set aside huge swaths of the Amazon for native groups, who now have permanent rights to 12 percent of the country's territory and 21 percent of the Amazon. Some 49 million acres of ""extractive reserves"" were set aside for the rubber tappers, Brazil nut gatherers and river communities that live there.

Brazil's government has also recently shown a willingness to crack down on rampant logging. Deforestation rates in the country, despite a spike last year, had been declining for several years. But little value has been assigned to the role of native peoples in sustaining the Amazon.

Large-scale clearing of the Amazon forest -- for wood, cattle-grazing and agricultural products like soybeans -- is threatening the native people's traditional way of life. ""The climate changes are a reality,"" said Manoel Cunha, chairman of Brazil's National Council of Rubber Tappers. ""We have rivers that are unnavigable"" and trees that no longer bear fruit, he added.

The plan, formally known as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD, would involve payments by wealthy countries, principally the United States and European nations, to developing countries for every hectare, or 2.47 acres, of forest they do not cut down.

Some doubt it will be possible to measure how much carbon is being conserved, and question whether the forest lands involved can be protected from illegal logging and government corruption.

Calculating what fair compensation for forest conservation would amount to is no easy task. The Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts recently estimated that indigenous groups should receive $10 per square kilometer for ""perimeter defense.""

The total cost of paying private landholders and governments to conserve the Amazon would be $531.6 million a year by the 10th year of the program, the center calculated. Several indigenous leaders here expressed concern that such a system would ultimately be devised to compensate governments with the carbon credits, but not indigenous communities.

""The challenge is to pay the native peoples, not the governments,"" said Elisa Canqui, a member of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. ""They need to be direct beneficiaries in this process."""
"Editorial, Saturday, April 19, 2008 414 mots, p. A 19",,OP-ED COLUMNIST,,,"By CHARLES M. BLOW

The questioning at Wednesday's Democratic presidential debate has been roundly panned, and rightfully so. The moderators spent about 40 minutes on a trite list of recriminations apparently intended to bait the candidates into a ""Jerry Springer""-like brawl.

Barack Obama was again asked to address the kerfuffle he caused by labeling rural voters ""bitter"" and to explain his relationship with the frightening Reverend Wright, and Hillary Clinton was again pushed back on her heels for saying that she had ducked bullets in Bosnia.

When they finally got around to the issues, they were the same ones that we've heard before: Who would best deal with an economy hobbled by predatory banks giving mortgages to anyone who could sign their names? How can we most quickly exit the Iraq debacle? Who would offer more tax relief for the not-so-poor while imposing the fewest new taxes on the not-so-wealthy?

Worthy issues all. But one was missing: the environment.

The League of Conservation Voters, an environmental watchdog group, reports that in the debates in which five Sunday-morning television anchors -- George Stephanopoulos, Tim Russert, Wolf Blitzer, Chris Wallace and Bob Schieffer -- have participated (17 in total) and in their major interviews with the candidates (176 in total) only eight of the 2,372 questions asked have mentioned global warming or climate change.

That omission is baffling because the environment has become a big issue for Americans. Nearly 6 in 10 people responding to a Pew Research Center poll in January said that protecting the environment and dealing with energy problems should be top priorities.

Americans have awakened to some simple and frightening realities. The earth is getting hotter. The world's ice is melting. The sea level is rising, and will continue to do so. How much? That's the question. The answer may largely depend on the course America takes, since we have been the most egregious at treating the air like a sewer for carbon emissions. (Although China may already have caught up.)

Apparently, the moderators didn't get the message. Instead they revived a more trivial issue, allowing a question that called Mr. Obama's patriotism into question for not wearing a flag pin on his lapel. Better to have tied patriotism to the environment and ask whose global warming plan will best ensure that no one will ever have to go to Lower Manhattan and point to the spot in the water where ground zero used to be."
"Foreign, Wednesday, April 23, 2008 1516 mots, p. A 1",,"Europe Turns to Coal Again, Raising Alarms on Climate Change",By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"CIVITAVECCHIA, Italy - At a time when the world's top climate experts agree that carbon emissions must be rapidly reduced to hold down global warming, Italy's major electricity producer, Enel, is converting its massive power plant here from oil to coal, generally the dirtiest fuel on earth.

Over the next five years, Italy will increase its reliance on coal to 33 percent from 14 percent. Power generated by Enel from coal will rise to 50 percent.

And Italy is not alone in its return to coal. Driven by rising demand, record high oil and natural gas prices, concerns over energy security and an aversion to nuclear energy, European countries are expected to put into operation about 50 coal-fired plants over the next five years, plants that will be in use for the next five decades.

In the United States, fewer new coal plants are likely to begin operations, in part because it is becoming harder to get regulatory permits and in part because nuclear power remains an alternative. Of 151 proposals in early 2007, more than 60 had been dropped by the year's end, many blocked by state governments. Dozens of other are stuck in court challenges.

The fast-expanding developing economies of India and China, where coal remains a major fuel source for more than two billion people, have long been regarded as among the biggest challenges to reducing carbon emissions. But the return now to coal even in eco-conscious Europe is sowing real alarm among environmentalists who warn that it is setting the world on a disastrous trajectory that will make controlling global warming impossible.

They are aghast at the renaissance of coal, a fuel more commonly associated with the sooty factories of Dickens novels, and one that was on its way out just a decade ago.

There have been protests here in Civitavecchia, at a new coal plant in Germany, and at one in the Czech Republic, as well as at the Kingsnorth power station in Kent, which is slated to become Britain's first new coal-fired plant in more than a decade.

Europe's power station owners emphasize that they are making the new coal plants as clean as possible. But critics say that ""clean coal"" is a pipe dream, an oxymoron in terms of the carbon emissions that count most toward climate change. They call the building spurt shortsighted.

""Building new coal-fired power plants is ill conceived,"" said James E. Hansen, a leading climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. ""Given our knowledge about what needs to be done to stabilize climate, this plan is like barging into a war without having a plan for how it should be conducted, even though information is available.

""We need a moratorium on coal now,"" he added, ""with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades.""

Coal's Advantages

Enel and many other electricity companies say they have little choice but to build coal plants to replace aging infrastructure, particularly in countries like Italy and Germany that have banned the building of nuclear power plants. Fuel costs have risen 151 percent since 1996, and Italians pay the highest electricity costs in Europe.

In terms of cost and energy security, coal has all the advantages, its proponents argue. Coal reserves will last for 200 years, rather than 50 years for gas and oil. Coal is relatively cheap compared with oil and natural gas, although coal prices have tripled in the past few years. More important, hundreds of countries export coal -- there is not a coal cartel -- so there is more room to negotiate prices.

""In order to get over oil, which is getting more and more expensive, our plan is to convert all oil plants to coal using clean-coal technologies,"" said Gianfilippo Mancini, Enel's chief of generation and energy management. ""This will be the cleanest coal plant in Europe. We are hoping to prove that it will be possible to make sustainable and environmentally friendly use of coal.""

""Clean coal"" is a term coined by the industry decades ago, referring to its efforts to reduce local pollution. Using new technology, clean coal plants sharply reduced the number of sooty particles spewed into the air, as well as gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide. The technology has minimal effect on carbon emissions.

In fact, the technology that the industry is counting on to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions that add to global warning -- carbon capture and storage -- is not now commercially available. No one knows if it is feasible on a large, cost-effective scale.

The Struggle to Be Green

The task -- in which carbon emissions are pumped into underground reservoirs rather than released -- is challenging for any fuel source, but particularly so for coal, which produces more carbon dioxide than oil or natural gas.

Under optimal current conditions, coal produces more than twice as much carbon dioxide per unit of electricity as natural gas, the second most common fuel used for electricity generation, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. In the developing world, where even new coal plants use lower grade coal and less efficient machinery, the equation is even worse.

Without carbon capture and storage, coal cannot be green. But solving that problem will take global coordination and billions of dollars in investment, which no one country or company seems inclined to spend, said Jeffrey D. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

""Figuring out carbon capture is really critical -- it may not work in the end -- and if it is not viable, the situation, with respect to climate change, is far more dire,"" Mr. Sachs said.

There are a few dozen small demonstration projects in Europe and in the United States, most in the early stages. But progress has not been promising.

At the end of January, the Bush administration canceled what was previously by far the United States' biggest carbon-capture demonstration project, at a coal-fired plant in Illinois, because of huge cost overruns. The costs of the project, undertaken in 2003 with a budget of $950 million, had spiraled to $1.5 billion this year, and it was far from complete.

The European Union had pledged to develop 12 pilot carbon-capture projects for Europe, but says that is not enough.

Many have likened carbon capture's road from the demonstration lab to a safe, cheap, available reality as a challenge equivalent to putting a man on the moon. Norway, which is investing heavily to test the technology, calls carbon capture its ""moon landing.""

It may be even harder than that. It is a moon landing that must be replicated daily at thousands of coal plants in hundreds of countries -- many of them poor. There is a new coal-fired plant going up in India or China almost every week, and most of those are not constructed in a way that is amenable to carbon capture, even if it were developed.

Plants that could someday be adapted to carbon capture cost 10 to 20 percent more to build, and only a handful exist today. For most coal power plants the costs of converting would be ""phenomenal,"" concluded a report by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Then there is the problem of storing the carbon dioxide, which is at some level an inherently local issue. Geologists have to determine if there is a suitable underground site, calculate how much carbon dioxide it can hold and then equip it in a way that prevents leaks and ensures safety. A large leak of underground carbon dioxide could be as dangerous as a leak of nuclear fuel, critics say.

As for its plant here, Enel says it will start experimenting with carbon-capture technology in 2015, in the hopes of ""a solution"" by 2020.

""That's too late,"" Mr. Sachs said.

In the meantime, it and other new coal plants will be spewing more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere than ever before, meaning that current climate predictions -- dire as they are -- may still be ""too optimistic,"" Mr. Sachs said. ""They assume the old energy mix, even though coal will be a larger and larger part.""

An Efficient Plant

On many other fronts, the new Enel plant is a model of efficiency and recycling. The nitrous oxide is chemically altered to generate ammonia, which is then sold. The resulting coal ash and gypsum are sold to the cement industry.

An on-site desalination plant means that the operation generates its own water for cooling. Even the heated water that comes out of the plant is not wasted: it heats a fish farm, one of Italy's largest.

But Enel's plan to deal with the new plant's carbon emissions consists mostly of a map of Italy with several huge white ovals superimposed -- subterranean cavities where carbon dioxide potentially could be stored.

The sites have not been fully studied by geologists as yet to make sure they are safe storage sites and well sealed. There is no infrastructure or equipment that could move carbon into them.

The new Enel plant here opens its first boiler in two months. It will immediately produce fewer carbon emissions than the ancient oil boiler it replaces, but only because it will produce less electricity, officials here admit.

Unhappy Neighbors

In the towns surrounding Civitavecchia, the impending arrival of a huge coal plant, with its three silvery domes, is being greeted with a hefty dose of dread.

""They call it clean coal because they use some filters, but it is really nonsense,"" said Marza Marzioli of the No Coal citizens group in the nearby ancient Etruscan town of Tarquinia. ""If you compare it to old plants, yes it's better, but it's not 'clean' in any way.""

The group says that Enel has won approval for a dangerous new coal plant by buying machines for a local hospital and by carrying out a public relations campaign. Enel advertisements for the project show a young girl erasing a plant's smokestack.

Most people who took part in a 2007 local referendum voted no, but the plant went ahead anyway, the group said.

The European Union, through its emissions trading scheme, has tried to make power plants consider the costs of carbon, forcing them to buy ""permits"" for emissions. But with the price of oil so high, coal is far cheaper, even with the cost of permits to pollute factored in, Enel has calculated.

Stephan Singer, who runs the European energy and climate office of WWF, formerly the World Wildlife Fund, in Brussels, said that math was shortsighted: the cost of coal and permits will almost certainly rise over the next decade.

""If they want coal to be part of the energy solution, they have to show us that carbon capture can be done now, that they can really reduce emissions"" to an acceptable level, Mr. Singer said."
"National, Wednesday, May 14, 2008 472 mots, p. A 16",,"Stumping On Climate, McCain Faults Bush",By ELISABETH BUMILLER,,"NORTH BEND, Wash. - Senator John McCain intensified his criticism of President Bush and the administration's environmental polices on Tuesday, taking a walk in the cold, rain-drenched foothills of the Cascade Mountains and asserting that in the effort to stem climate change, ""America can lead and not obstruct.""

At an outdoor news conference in the Cedar River Watershed east of Seattle, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, declared that ""the president and I have disagreed on this issue for many years -- it isn't a recent disagreement."" He added, ""There is a longstanding, significant, deep, strong difference on this issue between myself and the administration.""

Mr. McCain was on his second day of a trip to the Pacific Northwest, a potential swing region in the November election, to promote his plan to slow global warming and appeal to the region's many independent voters who view the environment as an election issue of critical concern. Mr. Bush, who questioned the scientific basis for global warming in his first term, is deeply unpopular, and Mr. McCain, whom the president endorsed at the White House in March, has been sprinting away from him this week.

The senator has proposed mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States -- Mr. Bush is opposed -- but Mr. McCain's Democratic competitors, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have offered plans to reduce emissions more quickly.

Asked at his news conference why voters who are concerned about the environment should support him over Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain said that his proposal was ""doable"" and that his rivals ""have never to my knowledge been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement in this issue.""

He did not mention that in 2007, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were co-sponsors of an emissions-curbing bill that he introduced with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. In addition, Mrs. Clinton went with Mr. McCain and other senators on a 2004 trip to Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, to see the effects of global warming. Mr. McCain mentioned that journey in a speech Monday on climate change, but he did not mention that Mrs. Clinton was one of those who went along.

Before his news conference Tuesday, Mr. McCain led a round-table discussion with environmentalists and local leaders at the education center of the Cedar River Watershed, which supplies water for Seattle. The panelist Mr. McCain appeared most excited to meet was Sally Jewell, chief executive of the outdoor gear and attire company REI, based in Seattle, who told Mr. McCain that she was converting 10 REI stores to solar power and that if she had federal incentives, they would help.

Mr. McCain made no promises but said the panel had renewed his enthusiasm to return to Washington ""to try to do the Lord's work in the city of Satan"" -- one of his favorite expressions.

In addition to the criticism of Mr. Bush, which Mr. McCain delivered against the backdrop of mist-shrouded Rattlesnake Lake, the senator's campaign day appeared organized around television pictures of him walking amid Pacific Northwest scenery with important local environmentalists. Within the Cedar River Watershed, the group ambled over the Masonry Dam and along the Chester Morris Lake and then took a brief stroll in the woods, with camera crews in tow."
"Business/Financial, Monday, January 21, 2008 151 mots, p. C 5",,Multinationals Fight Climate Change,By REUTERS,,"LONDON - Eleven companies are teaming up to see how they can work with thousands of their suppliers to curb greenhouse gas emissions, an environmental consultancy said on Sunday.

The companies in the program, called the Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration, include giants in their sectors like Cadbury Schweppes, Dell, Nestle, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Tesco.

The venture is being coordinated by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a British nonprofit organization that helps companies and investors to cooperate in the battle against climate change.

""Multinationals are seeking to understand where the emissions are lying in their supply chain and what risks and opportunities from climate change will be presented,"" Paul Simpson, chief operating officer for CDP, said.

In the pilot phase, until the end of March 2008, each company participating in the program has selected 50 suppliers to work with, the group said.

The Carbon Disclosure Project will publish a report after the first phase, recommending a standardized approach to emissions cuts. A second phase, starting in May, will include up to 2,000 suppliers associated with each participating company."
"National, Wednesday, May 28, 2008 581 mots, p. A 14",,U.S. Report Foresees Effects of Climate Shift,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The rise in concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities is influencing climate patterns and vegetation across the United States and will significantly disrupt water supplies, agriculture, forestry and ecosystems for decades, a new federal report says.

The changes are unfolding in ways that are likely to produce an uneven national map of harms and benefits, according to the report, released Tuesday and posted online at climatescience.gov.

The authors of the report and some independent experts said the main value of its projections was the level of detail and the high confidence in some conclusions. That confidence comes in part from the report's emphasis on the next 25 to 50 years, when shifts in emissions are unlikely to make much of a difference in climate trends.

The report also reflects a recent, significant shift by the Bush administration on climate science. During Mr. Bush's first term, administration officials worked to play down a national assessment of climate effects conducted mainly during the Clinton administration, but released in 2000.

The new report, which includes some findings that are more sobering and definitive than those in the 2000 climate report, holds the signatures of three cabinet secretaries.

According to the report, Western states will face substantial challenges because of growing demand for water and big projected drops in supplies.

From 2040 to 2060, anticipated water flows from rainfall in much of the West are likely to approach a 20 percent decrease in the average from 1901 to 1970, and are likely to be much lower in places like the fast-growing Southwest. In contrast, runoff in much of the Midwest and East is expected to increase that much or more.

Farmers, foresters and ranchers nationwide will face a complicated blend of changes, driven not only by shifting weather patterns but also by the simultaneous spread of nonnative plant and insect pests.

Some invasive grasses, vines and weeds, for example, do better in higher temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations than do crops and preferred livestock forage plants.

Corn and soybean plants are likely to grow and mature faster, but will be more subject to crop failures from spikes in summer temperatures that can prevent pollination, said one of the authors, Jerry L. Hatfield, a plant physiologist with the United States Department of Agriculture, in a conference call with reporters.

David E. Schimel, a lead author and director of a federal system of ecological monitoring stations, said in the call that mitigating emissions in the long run was still important even though not much could be done to change the short-term climate picture.

The 203-page report, ""The Effects of Climate Change on Agriculture, Land Resources, Water Resources and Biodiversity in the United States,"" is a review of existing studies, including last year's voluminous quartet of reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It is part of a continuing assessment of lingering questions related to global warming that was initiated in 2003 by Mr. Bush.

The report did not evaluate how the risk faced by farmers, water-supply managers and others might be reduced if they changed practices or crop and livestock varieties to adjust to changing conditions.

But several authors said that over all, the pace and nature of some of the looming changes would present big challenges in many of the country's fastest-growing regions.

The West will not only face a dearth of water, but also large shifts in when it is available. Water supplies there will be transformed by midcentury, with mountain snows that provided a steady flow of runoff for irrigation and reservoirs dwindling. That flow will be replaced by rainfall that comes at times and in amounts that make it hard to manage, the report and authors said.

The report also emphasized that the country's capacity to detect climate shifts and related effects was eroding, as budgets and plans for long-term monitoring of air, water and land changes -- both on the ground and from satellites -- shrank.

Richard Moss, a vice president of the World Wildlife Fund who previously coordinated federal climate reports under both the Clinton and Bush administrations, said the findings ""highlight the urgency of the climate change problem"" and provided important new support for action both to limit emissions and adapt to inevitable changes."
"Business/Financial, Friday, May 30, 2008 1025 mots, p. C 4",,Climate Enters Debate Over Nuclear Power,By KATE GALBRAITH,,"BRATTLEBORO, Vt. - After part of a cooling tower collapsed last August at Vermont's only nuclear power plant, the company that runs it blamed rotting wooden timbers that it had failed to inspect properly. The uproar that followed rekindled environmental groups' hopes of shutting down the aging plant.

The proposed closing, albeit a long shot, has gained some support this year among Vermont politicians. The discussion is bringing into sharp relief a conflict between two objectives long held by environmental advocates: combating nuclear power and stopping global warming.

Nuclear plants supply nearly 20 percent of the nation's electricity, and they do so without emitting the carbon dioxide that is the principal cause of global warming.

Vermont's 36-year-old plant, which feeds into the regional power grid, represents a third of the state's electrical generation.

Antinuclear groups that are arguing for closing the plant hope to replace the lost electricity with renewable generation from wind turbines, solar power and the combustion of plant material. Additionally, they cite the potential for cutting electrical demand by making homes and business more efficient.

Even so, some environmental advocates have reluctantly acknowledged that no combination of renewable power and improved efficiency can replace the plant, Vermont Yankee, at least in the near term. Instead, the state would probably have to tap the Northeastern grid -- which derives more than half its energy from fossil fuels -- for extra power.

""We'll likely have to go to the market, and that will mean an increase in Vermont's electricity portfolio that comes from fossil fuels,"" said Andrew Perchlik, director of Renewable Energy Vermont, a group that promotes clean power, speaking about the prospect of the plant's closing.

He faulted the state government and utilities for not focusing earlier on renewable energy, saying that if they had done so, ""we wouldn't be in this predicament.""

The Vermont debate comes as interest in nuclear power is increasing across the country, driven by rising demand for power as well as emissions concerns.

Like other plants nationwide, Vermont Yankee is seeking a 20-year extension of its operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that oversees the country's reactor fleet. A decision, which could allow the plant to keep operating until 2032, is expected later this year. Several utilities, encouraged by the federal government, are considering building nuclear reactors for the first time in three decades.

In Vermont, home to many people with a back-to-the-land viewpoint, surveys show that people want to move away from fuels like coal and oil that emit large amounts of carbon dioxide. They also support renewable energy.

But the same surveys show less consensus on nuclear power. At energy workshops last year, nearly two-thirds of participants said Vermont utilities should cease buying power from the nuclear plant -- unless fossil fuels and out-of-state nuclear power were the alternatives, in which case more than half would continue with Vermont Yankee.

Not counting dams, another low-emission energy source that many environmental groups oppose, renewable power makes up 2.5 percent of the nation's electricity generation. That figure is higher in Vermont, 6 percent, but renewables are still a long way from supplying the bulk of the state's power.

Starting from these slim figures, many advocacy groups dream of achieving a nuclear-free mix burnished by local renewables. State researchers estimate that as much as 48 percent of Vermont's power could one day come from local renewables, including small hydropower projects.

""When you look at all the scenarios for climate change, nuclear is not a must-do,"" said James Moore, the clean-energy advocate for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a group that opposes the nuclear plant.

But utilities in Vermont, like their counterparts elsewhere in the country, argue that environmental advocates are mistaken if they believe a low-emission future can be achieved without nuclear power. They note the intermittency of power sources like windmills and solar panels, and argue that the nation needs more, not fewer, big power plants that emit no carbon dioxide.

""Vermont is in an enviable position right now,"" said Steve Costello, a spokesman for the state's largest utility, Central Vermont Public Service. ""We have arguably the cleanest power in the country from an air-emissions standpoint, and we have the lowest rates in the Northeast.""

His utility is willing to build more renewables, he said, but closing Vermont Yankee would make maintaining clean and cheap power ""much more difficult.""

Even as some Vermonters argue for more renewable power, proposals to build it have hit snags.

Vermont has only one commercial wind farm, 11 turbines along a mountain ridge. They have less than 1 percent of the capacity of Vermont Yankee, a relatively small nuclear plant.

Other proposed projects have been stalled by local opposition. One wind project would infringe on bear habitat. Another won approval from state regulators, but a local group filed a court appeal to block it.

""Vermont is very protective of its environment regulation,"" said Mr. Perchlik of Renewable Energy Vermont. ""It's not going to be done Texas-style, where you can get a permit in a month."" He nonetheless hopes that wind turbines can provide 20 percent of Vermont's electricity by 2015.

Besides tapping into the Northeastern grid, Vermont could import more power from Hydro Quebec, a giant dam system in Canada that already accounts for a third of Vermont's electricity, but that would probably help push up prices. Solar power is also costly. Burning wood chips or other plant material is one option -- Burlington already has such a plant -- but a large one would face pollution and other problems.

The best bet for reducing the state's emissions may be energy efficiency, in which Vermont already excels. Since 2000, an outfit called Efficiency Vermont has coaxed homeowners and businesses to change their light bulbs and buy more efficient appliances, like refrigerators. The state believes it has already cut power demand slightly this way.

Concerns about the Vermont Yankee nuclear plant, in the town of Vernon, focus on the disposal of spent nuclear fuel, a nationwide problem, and on local concerns about safety.

Last August, Vermonters were shocked to see images of water gushing out of a huge pipe onto a heap of collapsed wooden beams. A portion of one of the plant's two cooling towers had fallen in after decay weakened the wood. No radioactivity was released, but Entergy, the plant's operator, labored to explain how it could have missed such an obvious problem.

Rob Williams, an Entergy spokesman, said the cooling tower collapse, along with other recent incidents, ""certainly impacted reliability, but the safety was not at all impacted."" Major repairs and improvements to both cooling towers have just been completed, he said, with crucial timbers replaced by fiberglass-reinforced plastic.

The Vermont Legislature has already voted to tighten plant oversight, and next year it is likely to take a vote on shutting down the plant, though whether the state would actually have the power to close the plant is unclear. The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses and regulates all reactors, and some experts predict lawsuits if Vermont tries a shutdown."
"National, Tuesday, June 3, 2008 418 mots, p. A 16",,NASA Office Is Criticized on Climate Reports,By ANDREW C. REVKIN; John Schwartz contributed reporting.,,"Two years after James E. Hansen, the leading climate scientist at NASA, and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees, the agency's inspector general has concluded that such activities occurred and were ""inconsistent"" with the law that established the space program 50 years ago.

In a 48-page report issued on Monday as a result of a request in 2006 by 14 senators, the internal investigative office said the activities appeared limited to the headquarters press office.

No evidence was found showing that officials higher at NASA or in the Bush administration were involved in interfering with the release of climate science information, the report said.

It also credited Michael Griffin, the agency administrator, for swiftly ordering a review and policy changes when the pattern came to light after articles in The New York Times early in 2006.

The report, signed by Kevin H. Winters, assistant inspector general for investigations, criticized what it said was a sustained pattern of activities, largely supervised by senior political appointees, that included muting or withholding news releases on global warming and, at least in Dr. Hansen's case, limiting a scientist's interactions with reporters.

""Our investigation,"" the report said, ""found that during the fall of 2004 through early 2006, the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public.""

The report said most evidence supported contentions that politics was ""inextricably interwoven"" into operations at the public affairs office in that period and that the pattern was inconsistent with the statutory responsibility to communicate findings widely, ""especially on a topic that has worldwide scientific interest.""

A NASA spokesman, Michael Cabbage, said: ""The issues mentioned in the inspector general's report are more than two years old, and after learning of those issues, NASA revised the agency's policy for disseminating science information.""

Dean Acosta, who was deputy assistant administrator for public affairs at the agency when the problems surfaced, sharply attacked the credibility of the report. Mr. Acosta was appointed by President Bush in 2003 and resigned in 2007.

""My entire career has been dedicated to open and honest communications,"" Mr. Acosta, who now is director of communications for the Boeing space-exploration business, wrote in an e-mail message. ""The inspector general's assertions are patently false. The report itself does nothing but raise questions about a three-year investigation that has yielded nothing but flimsy allegations aimed at hard-working public servants.""

Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat who wrote the request for the inquiry, had a markedly different reaction.

""Global warming is the most serious environmental threat we face, but this report is more evidence that the Bush administration's appointees have put political ideology ahead of science,"" Mr. Lautenberg said in an e-mailed statement. ""Our government's response to global warming must be based on science, and the Bush administration's manipulation of that information violates the public trust."""
"National, Tuesday, June 3, 2008 1147 mots, p. A 16",,Senate Opens Debate on Politically Risky Bill Addressing Global Warming,By JOHN M. BRODER; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.,,"WASHINGTON - The Senate on Monday opened a raucous debate over climate change legislation even though it will put supporters of the bill, including all three presidential candidates, on the spot -- essentially forcing them to come out in favor of high energy costs at a time when American consumers are paying record fuel prices.

While the three candidates are on record favoring legislative action on global warming, the Bush administration opposes a far-reaching bill.

The measure's sponsors say the nation must take immediate action to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and cut carbon emissions, but many senators in both parties see the legislation as an expensive long-term plan that would do little to solve today's energy supply and price problems. In fact, the legislation is not expected to pass in the Senate this year.

The debate, which could last all week, will force senators to take a stand on some of the most difficult, expensive and potentially life-altering questions the world will face in coming decades.

And lawmakers on Monday embraced the challenge, voting 74 to 14 in favor of the first of several procedural steps needed to bring the bill to the Senate floor.

Thirteen Republicans, including the minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, voted in opposition as did one Democrat, Robert C. Byrd, from the coal-producing state of West Virginia.

Proponents say the nation cannot afford to wait until fuel prices come down to begin to deal with these problems. Opponents argue that the bill would direct the largest changes in the American economy since the 1930s and should not be rushed through without painstaking debate.

""There's a great feeling all across America by people in small villages and towns to large cities to state legislatures and others: we must move and move now,"" Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia and a co-sponsor of the bill, said as debate opened on the floor. ""Do something. Doing nothing is not an option. Let us do something.""

But critics of the bill said it would do more harm than good.

""Any action has to provide real protections for the American economy and jobs, and we must protect the American families,"" said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma. ""Any action should not raise the cost of gasoline or energy to American families, particularly the low-income and elderly who are most susceptible to energy costs.""

The debate is shaping up as both a landmark moment and an opportunity for both sides to score political points. Opponents could pay a price for voting to block legislation that is intended to slow and ultimately reverse production of greenhouse gases that scientists warn are exacting an increasingly heavy environmental toll.

Even though high energy prices and an overheated political climate pose serious obstacles to such a far-reaching bill this year, whatever the Senate does will set the terms of the debate when a new Congress and president take office next January.

The heart of the bill is a plan to cap the production of greenhouse gases that scientists blame for the warming and, for the first time, force polluters to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide. For better or worse, putting a price on those emissions could be a wrenching change.

All three major presidential candidates have expressed support for the cap-and-trade concept that underlies this legislation, but all have said they would like to see changes in the current bill. The Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, would like to see its pollution targets strengthened, while Senator John McCain, a Republican, is demanding that it provide more help for the nuclear power industry.

All three candidates said that their schedules for the week were in flux but that they would participate in debates and votes if they were in Washington.

The bill's chief promoter, Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said that the Bush administration had failed to address either energy costs or global warming and that Congress had to step into the breach now.

""There were a lot of voices saying, 'Why do this now? Why do we have to do this now?' "" Mrs. Boxer said, opening the Democrats' argument for the bill. ""Because it is, in fact, one of the greatest challenges of our generation and we have to respond with a landmark bill, and it will take us awhile and we must get started.""

The bill is a revision of a plan proposed last year by Mr. Warner and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.

The measure would reduce American production of climate-altering gases by nearly 70 percent from current levels by 2050. It would provide billions of dollars in subsidies for energy conservation and environmentally clean technologies, creating millions of jobs, proponents say.

The sale of the permits would raise more than $5 trillion for the government in the coming decades, money that the bill proposes to distribute to affected industries, consumers and local governments in one of the biggest programs of redistribution of American wealth in history. The bill's proponents say the money would help pay for a technological leap that would create millions of new jobs while cleaning the atmosphere.

Given the timing and the range of opposition, it appears unlikely that the bill will pass the Senate. (Similar efforts are under way in the House.) President Bush has stated opposition to the mandatory emissions limits and numerous other provisions.

But history shows that far-reaching environmental legislation often gets off to a slow start, then passes both houses of Congress and is signed into law when the political time is ripe. ""If we get a majority or even close, we will be that much closer to addressing global warming and passing legislation in the next Congress, whoever the president is,"" said David Doniger, director of climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""We may not get it done this year, but if not we start next year just a few steps from the finish line.""

Senator Bob Corker, a freshman Republican from Tennessee, said in an interview that he favored a cap-and-trade program in theory but found serious flaws in the bill. He will be among those seeking to derail it.

""This bill is not going to become law,"" Mr. Corker said. ""It has no chance, none.""

Mr. Corker is proposing a string of amendments that Democrats characterize as ""poison pills"" that would undermine the purpose of the legislation. His amendments would return more of the receipts from the carbon permits directly to taxpayers, eliminate the issuance of free permits and do away with the ability of American companies to meet their emissions targets by buying offsets overseas.

One of the major points of contention arises from the bill's treatment of goods from developing countries that are among the world's biggest carbon emitters, including China, India, Brazil and Mexico.

The measure directs the president to negotiate agreements with those countries to ensure they are imposing binding limits on carbon emissions on their own industries. If they fail to do so, the United States will impose unspecified tariffs on carbon-intensive products like steel, paper, concrete and glass from those countries. The provision was included at the behest of labor unions and American companies in those industries who would not support the bill without such a cost equalizer.

In a speech on global warming in mid-May, Mr. McCain endorsed a similar carbon tariff, then backed away from it because of objections from the free-trade wing of theRepublican Party. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, courting labor support, favor tough carbon-based tariffs.

Frank Ackerman, an economist at the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University, said that the nation had lost crucial time in not addressing climate change and that other nations were bypassing the United States in the development of alternative energy technologies. Mr. Ackerman acknowledged that the conversion to a low-carbon economy will be costly for many industries and consumers, but said that the cost of inaction is many times greater.

""How do you price the increased deaths, the losses of endangered species and unique habitats, the increased damages from hurricanes that are becoming more intense?"" he asked. ""Those numbers dwarf any reasonable estimate of the cost of doing something about climate change. The choice is a no-brainer."""
"Business/Financial, Tuesday, July 1, 2008 566 mots, p. C 4",,"India Offers 8 Ideals on a Climate Change Policy, but Few Details",By HEATHER TIMMONS,,"NEW DELHI - The Indian government pledged Monday to devote more attention to renewable energy, water conservation and preserving natural resources in the country's first climate change plan, but it did not set concrete goals or pledge to cap harmful emissions.

During a speech here on Monday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh acknowledged that climate change was a dangerous problem, but the plan he introduced reinforced India's long-held stance that developed nations created the bulk of the mess and should be responsible for cleaning it up.

""There is a real possibility of catastrophic disruption of the fragile life-sustaining ecological system that holds this world together,"" Mr. Singh said. India traditionally ""treats nature as a source of nurture and not as a dark force to be conquered and harnessed to human endeavor,"" he said. ""There is a high value placed in our culture to the concept of living in harmony with nature.""

India will pursue eight national ""missions"" for sustainable development, Mr. Singh said. They are: pursuing solar energy, urging energy efficiency, creating a sustainable habitat, conserving water, preserving the Himalayan ecosystem, creating a ""green"" India, creating sustainable agriculture and, finally, establishing what he called a ""strategic knowledge platform for climate change.""

How much the Indian government will spend on these goals, who will run the efforts and how they will be evaluated was unclear. A spokesman reached in Mr. Singh's office said he could not answer questions about the plan.

India is the fourth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main gas linked to climate change, after the United States, China and Russia, according to the most recent World Bank data. On an individual basis, though, Indians emit far less carbon dioxide than people in those countries and in Europe.

India and China argue that this is how their contribution to climate change should be judged.

According to the World Bank data, the average Indian generates about one-tenth the amount of carbon dioxide as someone in Japan or Europe, and one-twentieth that of an American.

Swift economic growth and huge populations in India and China mean these countries are contributing more to the growth of emissions than developed countries. But, on an individual basis, these nations still produce far fewer pollutants and gases than developed countries.

Scientists in the West and international bodies set up to address climate change say that meaningful change cannot happen without the robust participation of India and China, which needs to come well before per capita emissions reach those of developed countries.

In April, President Bush pledged that the United States would stop the growth of greenhouse gas emissions by 2025, without giving any specifics about how that would happen. The promise was an about-face for the current administration, which has long resisted emission caps and refused to join the Kyoto Protocol on limiting such emissions.

The Indian government is scheduled to attend a meeting of the Group of 8 in July in Japan, and climate change is expected to be a main topic there.

On Monday, Mr. Singh particularly emphasized the solar mission, saying that in India's plan the ""sun occupies center stage, as it should, being literally the original source of all energy.""

The plan will ""look beyond"" the government to try to expand solar power in India, he said, a sign that the country will welcome private companies as well.

The plan ""reiterates India's position that the country is looking for technology as a solution, and not any mandatory cuts"" in carbon dioxide emissions, said Anshu Bharadwaj, the director of the Center for Science, Technology and Policy in Bangalore.

There were no specific targets set for energy efficiency, solar power use or water conservation. China's first climate change plan, released last year, called for improved energy efficiency and expansion of renewable and nuclear energy sources. China set some goals in areas like energy efficiency, but it has already fallen short of them, some analysts contend."
"Foreign, Thursday, July 10, 2008 741 mots, p. A 10",,"After Applause Dies Down, Global Warming Talks Leave Few Concrete Goals",By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"Nearly everyone had something to cheer about on Wednesday after the major industrial powers and a big group of emerging nations pledged to pursue ""deep cuts"" in emissions of heat-trapping gases in coming decades.

President Bush, who had insisted that any commitment to combat global warming must involve growing economies as well as the rich nations, recruited China and India to the table and received rare accolades from some environmentalists for doing so.

The developing countries received a promise that the rich countries would take the lead in curbing emissions. And environmentalists said the agreements renewed chances of reviving two ailing climate pacts, the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.

But behind the congratulatory speeches on Wednesday, some experts said, was a more sobering reality. The documents issued by the participating countries had very few of the concrete goals needed to keep greenhouse gases from growing at their torrid pace, they said.

The statement issued by the industrialized Group of 8 pledged to ""move toward a carbon-free society"" by seeking to cut worldwide emissions of heat-trapping gases in half by 2050. But the statement did not say whether that baseline would be emissions at 1990 levels, or the less ambitious baseline of current levels, already 25 percent higher.

Mentions of mandatory restrictions on emissions were carefully framed. Caps or taxes were endorsed where ""national circumstances"" made those acceptable. The statement urged nations to set ""midterm, aspirational goals for energy efficiency.""

There were new commitments to demonstrate that carbon dioxide from coal combustion could be captured, compressed, and stashed permanently underground. But experts have said that process would have to work at the scale of billions of tons of carbon dioxide a year within a decade or two to avert a huge rise in carbon dioxide concentrations, while proposed projects are all measured in millions of tons.

The Group of 8 statement also pledged to increase aid to help developing countries improve energy efficiency or cut their vulnerability to climate risk. But developing countries have noted that in the past those pledges have gone unfilled.

""I would characterize this outcome as 'talking the talk' rather then 'walking the walk' on climate change policy,"" said Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has co-written many papers on climate policy.

Dr. Schlesinger and others said that neither this week's statements nor the two previous climate treaties seemed likely to significantly slow the rise over decades of heat-trapping gases, most notably carbon dioxide -- an unavoidable byproduct of burning fossil fuels and forests.

Beyond any vagueness in this week's statements is the challenge that climate policy must compete with other pressing global problems, particularly rising prices for energy.

This reality was on display in Japan in the days leading up to the leaders' formal sessions. Gwyn Prins, an expert on climate policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science, was there for discussions preceding the formal talks and noted that current concerns about energy security were already clearly interfering with discussions aimed at climate stability.

One day, in particular, he said, was ""gloriously incoherent."" At a meeting in the morning, participants focused on finding ways to reduce gas prices, he said, while a session that afternoon focused on raising them through caps or taxes on fossil fuels.

The most discouraging aspect of the statements out of Japan, for many experts, was seeing the persistent gap between what science is saying about global warming and what countries are doing.

The United States appeared to regain some credibility at the meetings, but some environmentalists still found an opportunity to criticize President Bush. David G. Victor, an expert on climate policy at Stanford University, said that the power of any American president was limited, and that another barrier to cutting emissions was Congress.

""Nearly every government is looking beyond Bush, and while they are hopeful that the next president will surely be more constructive on this issue, they don't know what the president can really bring to the table,"" he said. ""It is hard for the U.S. president to negotiate with strength when his ability to offer commitments hinges on national legislation that he does not control.""

Cutting emissions in half is just the first step in curtailing warming, climate experts have long said, because the main greenhouse gas generated by human activities, carbon dioxide, can persist for a century or more in the atmosphere, once it is released. That means that later in the century, emissions must drop nearly to zero, or large-scale techniques must be developed to pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.

Making a bit of lemonade from lemons, Dr. Victor saw a bright spot in the disagreements at the meetings. ""Inability to agree is a sign that governments are actually getting serious,"" he said.

He concluded: ""People are working hard and pursuing many avenues; in time, they will find routes that work. This is quite unlike the Kyoto process, which was marked by very rapid negotiations that produced agreements that looked good on paper, but didn't really reflect what important governments, such as the U.S., could actually deliver.""

"Science, Tuesday, July 22, 2008 338 mots, p. F 3",,Climate Film Draws A Rebuke,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"A controversial British documentary called ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"" unfairly portrays several scientists and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Britain's television watchdog agency ruled on Monday.

The agency, the Office of Communication, issued a report rebuking Channel 4 in Britain, which broadcast ""Swindle"" last year. But the report said the film, while ""intemperate"" in its characterizations of the dominant scientific view that humans are the main force in warming the planet, ""did not materially mislead the audience so as to cause harm or offense.""

The documentary, from the independent filmmaker Martin Durkin, has been seen worldwide on DVD and the Internet. It focuses on a small group of scientists who reject the idea that human-caused warming poses big dangers.

Since its release, the film has been widely circulated by opponents of restrictions on greenhouse gases and attacked by scientific groups and campaigners seeking action to curb such emissions. Criticism has been particularly sharp over the film's assertions that the depiction of consensus on human-caused warming is a willful deception. In one particularly jarring line, a narrator says: ""Everywhere you are told that man-made climate change is proved beyond doubt. But you are being told lies.""

While criticizing such statements, the agency said that ""Swindle"" was adequately framed as a polemic and that so many programs had focused on the dominant scientific views of global warming that the film had a place on television. Channel 4 must broadcast the results of the inquiry, which was prompted by complaints from scientists and viewers.

This conclusion was criticized by several scientists, including Carl Wunsch, an ocean and climate expert at M.I.T. Dr. Wunsch appeared in the film and later said his comments were taken out of context and made him appear to question the seriousness of human-driven warming.

The report upheld his complaint that he was treated unfairly, but he said the agency did not go far enough because the film clearly misled the public in harmful ways. "" 'Swindle' raises the noise level and politicizes an extremely complicated science problem without enlightening anyone,"" he said in an e-mail message. ""A film claiming to be a science documentary that is really a nonscientific political tract is poisonous.""

Mr. Durkin was on vacation and not available for comment, his office said. Executives at Channel 4 said they accepted the findings and defended their right to show the film.

"Editorial, Wednesday, August 6, 2008 701 mots, p. A 23",,OP-ED COLUMNIST,,,"By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

Ilulissat, Greenland - Sometimes you just wish you were a photographer. I simply do not have the words to describe the awesome majesty of Greenland's Kangia Glacier, shedding massive icebergs the size of skyscrapers and slowly pushing them down the Ilulissat Fjord until they crash into the ocean off the west coast of Greenland. There, these natural ice sculptures float and bob around the glassy waters near here. You can sail between them in a fishing boat, listening to these white ice monsters crackle and break, heave and sigh, as if they were noisily protesting their fate.

You are entirely alone here amid the giant icebergs, save for the solitary halibut fisherman who floats by. Our Greenlandic boat skipper sidles up to the tiny fishing craft, where my hosts buy a few halibut right out of his nets, slice open the tender cheeks and cut me the freshest halibut sushi I've ever tasted. ""Greenland fast food,"" quips Kim Kielsen, Greenland's minister of the environment.

We wash it down with Scotch whiskey cooled by a 5,000-year-old ice cube chipped off one of the floating glacier bits. Some countries have vintage whiskey. Some have vintage wine. Greenland has vintage ice.

Alas, though, I do not work for National Geographic. This is the opinion page. And my trip with Denmark's minister of climate and energy, Connie Hedegaard, to see the effects of climate change on Greenland's ice sheet leaves me with a very strong opinion: Our kids are going to be so angry with us one day.

We've charged their future on our Visa cards. We've added so many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, for our generation's growth, that our kids are likely going to spend a good part of their adulthood, maybe all of it, just dealing with the climate implications of our profligacy. And now our leaders are telling them the way out is ""offshore drilling"" for more climate-changing fossil fuels.

Madness. Sheer madness.

Most people assume that the effects of climate change are going to be felt through another big disaster, like Katrina. Not necessarily, says Minik Thorleif Rosing, a top geologist at Denmark's National History Museum and one of my traveling companions. ""Most people will actually feel climate change delivered to them by the postman,"" he explains. It will come in the form of higher water bills, because of increased droughts in some areas; higher energy bills, because the use of fossil fuels becomes prohibitive; and higher insurance and mortgage rates, because of much more violently unpredictable weather.

Remember: climate change means ""global weirding,"" not just global warming.

Greenland is one of the best places to observe the effects of climate change. Because the world's biggest island has just 55,000 people and no industry, the condition of its huge ice sheet -- as well as its temperature, precipitation and winds -- is influenced by the global atmospheric and ocean currents that converge here. Whatever happens in China or Brazil gets felt here. And because Greenlanders live close to nature, they are walking barometers of climate change.

That's how I learned a new language here: ""Climate-Speak.""

It's easy to learn. There are only three phrases. The first is: ""Just a few years ago ..."" Just a few years ago you could dogsled in winter from Greenland, across a 40-mile ice bank, to Disko Island. But for the past few years, the rising winter temperatures in Greenland have melted that link. Now Disko is cut off. Put away the dogsled.

There has been a 30 percent increase in the melting of the Greenland ice sheet between 1979 and 2007, and in 2007, the melt was 10 percent bigger than in any previous year, said Konrad Steffen, director of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado, which monitors the ice. Greenland is now losing 200 cubic kilometers of ice per year -- from melt and ice sliding into the ocean from outlet glaciers along its edges -- which far exceeds the volume of all the ice in the European Alps, he added. ""Everything is happening faster than anticipated.""

The second phrase is: ""I've never seen that before..."" It rained in December and January in Ilulissat. This is well above the Arctic Circle! It's not supposed to rain here in winter. Said Steffen: ""Twenty years ago, if I had told the people of Ilulissat that it would rain at Christmas 2007, they would have just laughed at me. Today it is a reality.""

The third phrase is: ""Well usually ...but now I don't know anymore."" Traditional climate patterns that Greenland elders have known their whole lives have changed so quickly in some places that ""the accumulated experience of older people is not as valuable as before,"" said Rosing. The river that was always there is now dry. The glacier that always covered that hill has disappeared. The reindeer that were always there when the hunting season opened on Aug. 1 didn't show up.

No wonder everyone here speaks climate now -- your kids will, too, and sooner than they think."
"National, Thursday, August 7, 2008 449 mots, p. A 17",,Climate-Change Program To Aid Poor Nations Is Shut,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The National Center for Atmospheric Research, an important hub for work on the causes and consequences of climate change, has shut down a program focused on strengthening poor countries' ability to forecast and withstand droughts, floods and other climate-related hazards.

The move, which center officials say resulted from the shrinking of federal science budgets, is being denounced by many experts on environmental risk, who say such research is more crucial than ever in a world with rising populations exposed to climate threats.

In e-mail exchanges, these experts said the eliminated program, the Center for Capacity Building, was unique in its blend of research and training in struggling countries.

The Center for Capacity Building (still online at ccb.ucar.edu) was created in 2004. It built on decades of work by its director, Michael Glantz, a political scientist who has focused on the societal effects of natural climate extremes and any shifts related to accumulating greenhouse gases.

One scientist, Ilan Kelman, a senior research fellow at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, said he was ""appalled"" that the National Center for Atmospheric Research, based in Boulder, Colo., ""would suddenly end one of the most productive programs and would let go of one of the most productive scientists within the institute.""

""In terms of value for money,"" he added, ""Dr. Glantz's science was among the best, being cutting-edge and cost-effective, yet influencing the world. He also ensured that science was used for humanity and by humanity.""

Eric J. Barron, who was named the director of the atmospheric research center in May, said the step had been unavoidable given steady erosion of the center's budget, most of which comes from the National Science Foundation.

Dr. Barron said that over the last five years more than 110 positions at the center, of about 1,000 supported by the science foundation, had been cut from other programs as varied as solar physics, atmospheric chemistry and social science.

Altogether, the eliminated program had an annual budget of about $500,000. The budget for the entire atmospheric research center is $120 million.

In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Dr. Glantz said that he was let go Monday and that three other researchers were also losing their jobs. One, Tsegay Wolde-Georgis, left a similar program at Columbia University less than a year ago to work with Dr. Glantz. Dr. Wolde-Georgis's focus is bolstering the ability of African nations to anticipate and withstand drought and other climate shocks.

Roger A. Pielke Jr., a former staff scientist at the atmospheric research center and now a political scientist at the nearby University of Colorado, said the cut undermined an increasingly important branch of science.

""Knowledge related to the societal dimensions of global environmental problems is fundamental to efforts to arrive at practical and effective solutions,"" Dr. Pielke said. ""If anything, we need to expand attention in these areas.""

Clifford A. Jacobs, the National Science Foundation's section head for the atmospheric research center and related programs, said the decision did not mean that the center was interested only in basic physical climate science.

""This came as a very, very difficult decision,"" Dr. Jacobs said. ""You have to protect your core activities, but as budgets keep shrinking you have to redefine your core."""
"Science, Tuesday, September 23, 2008 310 mots, p. F 3",,OBSERVATORY,,,"By HENRY FOUNTAIN

One of the potential consequences of a warmer world, according to scientists who study such things, is the deep thawing of the permafrost. Thawing could release huge quantities of carbon into the atmosphere, as vegetation, bones and other organic material, long locked up in the deep freezer that is the permafrost, decompose.

But a study published in Science suggests that the impact of warming on the permafrost may not be as bad as forecast. The evidence comes in the form of a wedge of ancient ice found at an old mining site in the Yukon in Canada.

Ice wedges form in permafrost when the ground cracks because of cold, and spring meltwater seeps in and freezes. Over hundreds of years, the wedge builds up, like an in-ground icicle.

Duane G. Froese of the University of Alberta, the lead author of the study, said ice wedges could provide clues to the long-term stability of the permafrost. The problem is figuring out how old they are.

In this case, the top of the wedge was a couple of yards deep in the permafrost, and the researchers found volcanic ash on its top surface. By dating the ash (which presumably came from eruptions in what is now southeastern Alaska), Dr. Froese and his colleagues were able to say how long the ice had been there: about 740,000 years. Because the ash had to have been deposited after the wedge formed, that's ""very clear proof,"" Dr. Froese said, that the ice is at least that old.

That means the ice survived several warming periods, including the last major one, 120,000 years ago. ""The general view is that everything would have melted out back then,"" Dr. Froese said. The new finding suggests that was not the case, and that models of melting need to be rethought.

""But I don't want people to think we don't have to worry about global climate change,"" Dr. Froese said. The top couple of yards of permafrost are still quite likely to melt as temperatures warm, and there is plenty of carbon stored in them. ""But the deeper part of the permafrost is probably relatively stable."""
"National, Wednesday, February 27, 2008 555 mots, p. A 16",,"Flooded Village Files Suit, Citing Corporate Link to Climate Change",By FELICITY BARRINGER,,"SAN FRANCISCO - Lawyers for the Alaska Native coastal village of Kivalina, which is being forced to relocate because of flooding caused by the changing Arctic climate, filed suit in federal court here Tuesday arguing that 5 oil companies, 14 electric utilities and the country's largest coal company were responsible for the village's woes.

The suit is the latest effort to hold companies like BP America, Chevron, Peabody Energy, Duke Energy and the Southern Company responsible for the impact of global warming because they emit millions of tons of greenhouse gases, or, in the case of Peabody, mine and market carbon-laden coal that is burned by others. It accused the companies of creating a public nuisance.

In an unusual move, those five companies and three other defendants -- the Exxon Mobil Corporation, American Electric Power and the Conoco Phillips Company -- are also accused of conspiracy. ""There has been a long campaign by power, coal and oil companies to mislead the public about the science of global warming,"" the suit says. The campaign, it says, contributed ""to the public nuisance of global warming by convincing the public at large and the victims of global warming that the process is not man-made when in fact it is.""

Kivalina, an Inupiat village of 400 people on a barrier reef between the Chukchi Sea and two rivers, is being buffeted by waves that, in colder times, were blocked by sea ice, the suit says. ""The result of the increased storm damage is a massive erosion problem,"" it says. ""Houses and buildings are in imminent danger of falling into the sea.""

The estimated cost of relocating the village is up to $400 million, the suit says.

Some lawyers in the case participated in the long-running litigation against American tobacco companies in the 1990s, and some of the same legal theories echo through the complaint. But the hurdles may be greater than those in the tobacco wars. Global warming is a diffuse worldwide phenomenon; a successful public nuisance case requires that defendants' behavior be directly linked to the harm.

""Public nuisance law has been used from time immemorial to address issues that have not been addressed by the political branches,"" said Kirsten H. Engel, a law professor at the University of Arizona. But Professor Engel added, ""It's very difficult to get a court to jump in here and say that what these companies are doing, and have been doing for years, is unreasonable and creating a public nuisance.""

Two similar lawsuits, one brought by California against six automakers and another by a coalition of Eastern states against utility companies, have been dismissed by federal judges. Both judges said the issues involved were political and did not belong in the courts. Those decisions have been appealed.

Matt Pawa, a lawyer for Kivalina, said this case was different because it sought monetary damages for an injured party. ""The kind of harms to property and public welfare caused by global warming are classic public nuisance injuries,"" Mr. Pawa said.

He added that the other cases had no conspiracy claims, which he said courts routinely addressed.

Reached late Tuesday, spokesmen for three defendants -- Jason Cuevas of Southern, Vic Svec of Peabody and Gantt Walton of Exxon Mobil -- said they would not comment on the substance of the lawsuit.

But Mr. Svec said, ""Rather than unreasonably suing companies for the weather, we would encourage everyone to join Peabody in supporting aggressive development of carbon capture and storage projects and other technologies that help us provide both energy security and carbon solutions.""

Of the accusation that Exxon Mobil participated in a disinformation campaign, Mr. Walton said, ""The recycling of this type of discredited conspiracy theory only diverts attention from the real challenge at hand -- how to provide the energy to improve living standards while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions."""

Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama part company on many issues, but they agree that the Bush administration's policies on global warming were far too weak.

Both candidates say that human-caused climate change is real and urgent, and that they would sharply diverge from President Bush's course by proposing legislation requiring sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury.

Such rare agreement has both industry and environmental groups expecting a big shift, no matter who is elected, on three fronts where the United States has been largely static for eight years: climate legislation, expansion of nonpolluting energy sources and leadership in global talks on fashioning a new climate treaty.

But quick progress could be held hostage to the financial crisis and the prospect of a worldwide recession. The economic turmoil could force the next president to delay legislation that imposes major new costs on struggling businesses or raises energy prices for consumers.

Mr. McCain, of Arizona, has repeatedly pointed to his longtime focus on global warming, including a fact-finding trip with other lawmakers to the thawing Arctic and his co-authorship, in 2003, of the first comprehensive legislation seeking mandatory limits on heat-trapping gases.

But in recent weeks he has taken heat from some environmental activists for statements on the stump implying that he might not seek mandatory emission cuts. His campaign has not said how the ailing economy would affect his climate agenda.

A high priority is helping revive the nuclear-power industry because nuclear plants produce no greenhouse gases, once built. Mr. McCain claims a byproduct of his nuclear push would be the creation of thousands of new jobs.

Mr. Obama, of Illinois, insists that his energy plan, which is largely framed around measures that could have climate benefits, would remain a top priority even in the face of economic troubles.

Rather than increasing joblessness, he says, his proposals to create federal programs to cut energy waste and to help Detroit retool and retrain to make fuel-sipping hybrids would create jobs.

A top environmental goal of both candidates is enactment of climate-change legislation centered on a ""cap and trade"" mechanism that sets a ceiling on emissions that declines over time. Businesses and institutions that cannot hit the targets must buy permits from those that achieve bigger cuts than required.

But the devil on such bills is in the many details. (A fight over such details also contributed to the death of a climate bill that the Senate debated earlier this year.)

The permits issued under Mr. Obama's bill would be bought by businesses through an auction before they were traded. Mr. Obama says he would use $150 billion of the auction revenue over 10 years -- a small amount of the total flow -- to help improve nonpolluting vehicles, wind and solar power, technology for capturing emissions from power plants, and other energy technologies. The brunt of the funds, he says, would help reduce costs faced by industries and citizens affected by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Mr. McCain's approach, according to his Web site, would distribute the permits initially at no cost, and move to auctioning ""eventually.""

Some economists and environmentalists have criticized the distribution of free permits as a handout to industry, noting that the European Union -- which initially set up its trading system that way -- saw the prices for pollution permits collapse. At the same time, some European power companies made windfall profits from their permits and ultimately heat-trapping gas emissions increased.

Mr. McCain would also initially allow businesses to meet all their emission targets either directly or by buying a kind of credit, called an offset, generated by, say, a landowner who can prove fields or trees are sopping up a certain tonnage of carbon dioxide or a business that can prove an investment avoided emissions that would otherwise have happened. His Web site says the fraction of emission reductions allowed through offsets ""would decline over time,"" but offers no specifics. Calls and e-mail messages to the McCain campaign were not answered.

Environmentalists tend to prefer Mr. Obama's approach, which many analysts say has less wiggle room and, in theory, sends a stronger message to companies that rely on fossil fuels to seek nonpolluting sources or reduce energy use.

Several representatives of industries said that, if forced, they would prefer the less aggressive targets and looser terms of Mr. McCain's plan. But some appear to think they will not need to choose for a long while in any case, given the state of the global economy.

""Most industries are sort of keeping their powder dry at this point,"" said Scott H. Segal, a lawyer and lobbyist at Bracewell & Giuliani who represents energy companies.

Without more details, it is not possible to estimate the costs of either candidate's cap-and-trade plan, but economists generally agree that Mr. McCain's would be less costly because of the offsets. But such offsets may also delay real decreases in greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite Mr. McCain's early focus on climate change and the need for legislation, some environmental groups have sharply chided him lately, pointing to campaign statements seemingly softening his stance on firm caps on heat-trapping gases.

The League of Conservation Voters gave him the lowest possible score for his voting record in 2007 on subsidies or spending for renewable energy. Environmental bloggers derided his choice of running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, who has questioned whether global warming is caused by human activity and who elicits chants of ""drill, baby, drill"" on the stump for her support of oil drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama also support ocean drilling and oppose drilling in the Arctic refuge.

Joseph Romm, a physicist who writes the ClimateProgress.org blog and is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit research group generally aligned with Democrats, said that Mr. McCain ""has provided ample evidence in the last year or so that he is not serious about clean energy and he has increasingly walked away from the climate issue.""

Mr. Obama, after taking heat from some environmentalists for championing coal use as an Illinois state senator, has been hailed by environmental groups for sticking with a mandatory cap on emissions with steadily rising costs for permits bought by polluters.

Still, his advisers lately have emphasized that he might have to compromise to get bipartisan support for a climate bill, something he has said he wants. Strident opponents of climate legislation, echoing the views of industry figures, do not appear worried that a bill will come together any time soon, no matter who is in the White House.

""I believe the current financial difficulties,"" said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, ""will only reinforce the public's concerns about any climate bill that attempts to increase the costs of energy and jeopardizes jobs in the near term.""

Van Jones, an environmental activist from Oakland, Calif., and the author of ""The Green Collar Economy,"" has criticized Mr. McCain as the vanguard of a new movement with an environmental veneer but bad intentions.

""The climate deniers got chased out of town, but in their place you've got the rise of the Dirty Greens,"" he said in a recent interview. These are ""people saying 'I'm for solar, wind, geothermal, but I'm also for tar sands, coastal drilling.' ""

Over all, the hurdles facing legislation restricting gases released by burning coal and oil, which still underpin the economy, remain so daunting that many experts who favor capping emissions appear to be focusing on actions a president could take with a pen stroke.

Both candidates have said they would grant California a long-sought waiver under the Clean Air Act allowing that state to set its own limits on automobile emissions of carbon dioxide, the main human-generated greenhouse gas. The Bush administration turned down California's request in January.

David D. Doniger, who directs climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council and worked in the Clinton administration on the issue, said this move would set in motion a wave of pent-up state actions following California's lead, and the resulting bottom-up pressure could force Congress to pursue a climate bill.

The same upward push could result, he said, if the next president orders the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon dioxide.

The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 ruling in 2007, rebuffed the Bush administration and said the Clean Air Act gave the agency the authority to restrict the gas.

If Mr. Obama is elected, such a move appears likely. Heather Zichal, policy director for energy, environment and agriculture for the Obama campaign, said he would reduce emissions through actions at the E.P.A. and other government agencies.

""While he strongly believes that Congressional action is needed,"" Ms. Zichal said, ""he is also committed to employing the considerable powers Congress has granted to the executive branch.""

Mr. McCain has not specified whether he would seek to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant.

Some environmental groups say the next president could attack the energy, economic and climate problems at once with a grand program to remake the electrical grid, greatly expand sources of nonpolluting power like wind turbines and solar arrays, and boost energy efficiency.

Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have both picked up on that theme.

When addressing energy on the campaign trail, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin have tended to focus on expanding supplies of fossil fuels even as they mention the need for solar panels, tapping geothermal energy and the like. They call this an ""all of the above"" strategy.

One of Mr. McCain's main talking points on nonpolluting energy sources is a promise to build 45 new nuclear power plants by 2030.

Energy specialists say that is a difficult goal because of the high cost -- one estimate is that each plant would cost $10 billion -- and unresolved questions about where to store nuclear waste. Another issue is the lack of American expertise in building such plants after decades of opposition.

Mr. Obama has given muted support to nuclear power but has repeatedly said his prime goal is an ambitious, sustained push for efficiency and new climate-friendly technologies, like plug-in hybrid cars and improved solar panels. Among other steps, he would create a national project to cut energy waste with federal subsidies to insulate one million low-income homes a year.

He and Mr. McCain continue to mention ""clean coal"" in the context of climate change, even though teams of researchers have concluded that investments in large-scale tests of ways to capture and bury carbon dioxide from coal combustion would be required on a scale far beyond the federal spending either candidate is calling for."
"Editorial, Sunday, November 9, 2008 1181 mots, p. WK 10",,OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,,,"By AL GORE

THE inspiring and transformative choice by the American people to elect Barack Obama as our 44th president lays the foundation for another fateful choice that he -- and we -- must make this January to begin an emergency rescue of human civilization from the imminent and rapidly growing threat posed by the climate crisis.

The electrifying redemption of America's revolutionary declaration that all human beings are born equal sets the stage for the renewal of United States leadership in a world that desperately needs to protect its primary endowment: the integrity and livability of the planet.

The world authority on the climate crisis, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, after 20 years of detailed study and four unanimous reports, now says that the evidence is ""unequivocal."" To those who are still tempted to dismiss the increasingly urgent alarms from scientists around the world, ignore the melting of the north polar ice cap and all of the other apocalyptic warnings from the planet itself, and who roll their eyes at the very mention of this existential threat to the future of the human species, please wake up. Our children and grandchildren need you to hear and recognize the truth of our situation, before it is too late.

Here is the good news: the bold steps that are needed to solve the climate crisis are exactly the same steps that ought to be taken in order to solve the economic crisis and the energy security crisis.

Economists across the spectrum -- including Martin Feldstein and Lawrence Summers -- agree that large and rapid investments in a jobs-intensive infrastructure initiative is the best way to revive our economy in a quick and sustainable way. Many also agree that our economy will fall behind if we continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars on foreign oil every year. Moreover, national security experts in both parties agree that we face a dangerous strategic vulnerability if the world suddenly loses access to Middle Eastern oil.

As Abraham Lincoln said during America's darkest hour, ""The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew."" In our present case, thinking anew requires discarding an outdated and fatally flawed definition of the problem we face.

Thirty-five years ago this past week, President Richard Nixon created Project Independence, which set a national goal that, within seven years, the United States would develop ""the potential to meet our own energy needs without depending on any foreign energy sources."" His statement came three weeks after the Arab oil embargo had sent prices skyrocketing and woke America to the dangers of dependence on foreign oil. And -- not coincidentally -- it came only three years after United States domestic oil production had peaked.

At the time, the United States imported less than a third of its oil from foreign countries. Yet today, after all six of the presidents succeeding Nixon repeated some version of his goal, our dependence has doubled from one-third to nearly two-thirds -- and many feel that global oil production is at or near its peak.

Some still see this as a problem of domestic production. If we could only increase oil and coal production at home, they argue, then we wouldn't have to rely on imports from the Middle East. Some have come up with even dirtier and more expensive new ways to extract the same old fuels, like coal liquids, oil shale, tar sands and ""clean coal"" technology.

But in every case, the resources in question are much too expensive or polluting, or, in the case of ""clean coal,"" too imaginary to make a difference in protecting either our national security or the global climate. Indeed, those who spend hundreds of millions promoting ""clean coal"" technology consistently omit the fact that there is little investment and not a single large-scale demonstration project in the United States for capturing and safely burying all of this pollution. If the coal industry can make good on this promise, then I'm all for it. But until that day comes, we simply cannot any longer base the strategy for human survival on a cynical and self-interested illusion.

Here's what we can do -- now: we can make an immediate and large strategic investment to put people to work replacing 19th-century energy technologies that depend on dangerous and expensive carbon-based fuels with 21st-century technologies that use fuel that is free forever: the sun, the wind and the natural heat of the earth.

What follows is a five-part plan to repower America with a commitment to producing 100 percent of our electricity from carbon-free sources within 10 years. It is a plan that would simultaneously move us toward solutions to the climate crisis and the economic crisis -- and create millions of new jobs that cannot be outsourced.

First, the new president and the new Congress should offer large-scale investment in incentives for the construction of concentrated solar thermal plants in the Southwestern deserts, wind farms in the corridor stretching from Texas to the Dakotas and advanced plants in geothermal hot spots that could produce large amounts of electricity.

Second, we should begin the planning and construction of a unified national smart grid for the transport of renewable electricity from the rural places where it is mostly generated to the cities where it is mostly used. New high-voltage, low-loss underground lines can be designed with ""smart"" features that provide consumers with sophisticated information and easy-to-use tools for conserving electricity, eliminating inefficiency and reducing their energy bills. The cost of this modern grid -- $400 billion over 10 years -- pales in comparison with the annual loss to American business of $120 billion due to the cascading failures that are endemic to our current balkanized and antiquated electricity lines.

Third, we should help America's automobile industry (not only the Big Three but the innovative new startup companies as well) to convert quickly to plug-in hybrids that can run on the renewable electricity that will be available as the rest of this plan matures. In combination with the unified grid, a nationwide fleet of plug-in hybrids would also help to solve the problem of electricity storage. Think about it: with this sort of grid, cars could be charged during off-peak energy-use hours; during peak hours, when fewer cars are on the road, they could contribute their electricity back into the national grid.

Fourth, we should embark on a nationwide effort to retrofit buildings with better insulation and energy-efficient windows and lighting. Approximately 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States come from buildings -- and stopping that pollution saves money for homeowners and businesses. This initiative should be coupled with the proposal in Congress to help Americans who are burdened by mortgages that exceed the value of their homes.

Fifth, the United States should lead the way by putting a price on carbon here at home, and by leading the world's efforts to replace the Kyoto treaty next year in Copenhagen with a more effective treaty that caps global carbon dioxide emissions and encourages nations to invest together in efficient ways to reduce global warming pollution quickly, including by sharply reducing deforestation.

Of course, the best way-- indeed the only way -- to secure a global agreement to safeguard our future is by re-establishing the United States as the country with the moral and political authority to lead the world toward a solution.

Looking ahead, I have great hope that we will have the courage to embrace the changes necessary to save our economy, our planet and ultimately ourselves.

In an earlier transformative era in American history, President John F. Kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon within 10 years. Eight years and two months later, Neil Armstrong set foot on the lunar surface. The average age of the systems engineers cheering on Apollo 11 from the Houston control room that day was 26, which means that their average age when President Kennedy announced the challenge was 18.

This year similarly saw the rise of young Americans, whose enthusiasm electrified Barack Obama's campaign. There is little doubt that this same group of energized youth will play an essential role in this project to secure our national future, once again turning seemingly impossible goals into inspiring success."
"4A, Wednesday, November 19, 2008 588 mots",,Obama Affirms Climate Change Goals,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"President-elect Barack Obama, in strongly-worded remarks to a gathering of governors and foreign officials on Tuesday, said he had no intention of softening or delaying his aggressive targets for reducing emissions that cause the warming of the planet.

Speaking by video to a climate conference in Los Angeles, Mr. Obama repeated his campaign vow to reduce climate-altering carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and invest $150 billion in new energy-saving technologies.

""Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,"" Mr. Obama said. ""Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response.""

Some industry leaders and members of Congress have suggested that Mr. Obama's climate proposal would impose too great a cost on an already-stressed economy -- having the same effects as a tax on coal, oil and natural gas -- and should await the end of the current downturn. A bill similar to Mr. Obama's plan failed to clear the Senate earlier this year, largely because of concerns about its impact on the economy.

Mr. Obama rejected that view, saying that his plan would reduce oil imports, create jobs in energy conservation and renewable sources of energy, and reverse the warming of the atmosphere.

""My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process,"" Mr. Obama said.

State officials and environmental advocates were cheered that Mr. Obama choose to address climate change as only the second major policy area he has discussed as president-elect. In a press conference and television interview last week he said that his first priority as president will be to revitalize the economy.

The bipartisan summit meeting was convened by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, who has been a leader in state efforts to regulate greenhouse gases, even when it meant confronting the Bush administration over its more hesitant approach. Attendees included the governors of Illinois, Florida, Wisconsin and Kansas, who have also been in the forefront of actions at the state level to act in the absence of a national climate change plan. Officials from 22 other states, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Brazil, China, India and Indonesia, as well as United Nations aides and environmentalists, also are taking part in the two-day meeting.

Mr. Schwarzenegger announced the meeting in September in part to signal to Washington and the two presidential candidates that the states were serious about moving forward with climate legislation with or without Washington's blessing.

California enacted a sweeping climate bill in 2007 that would have, among other things, imposed strict mileage and emissions standards on all cars and trucks sold in the state. More than a dozen other states adopted the standards, but they were struck down by the Bush administration last December on the ground that the states did not have the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

""When California passed its global warming law two years ago, we were out there on an island,"" Mr. Schwarzenegger said in opening the conference, ""so we started forming partnerships everywhere we could.""

Mr. Obama said that although he would not attend a U.N.-sponsored meeting on climate change next month, he has asked members of Congress who are going to report back to him on what the United States can do to reassert leadership on global climate policy.

He also told the state officials: ""When I am president, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House. Any company that's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in Washington. And any nation that's willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the United States of America.""

Governor Jim Doyle, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles that he had been frustrated by what he said was the Bush administration's timid approach to climate issues. And he said that despite the current economic crisis, it was important to begin long-term efforts to address global warming.

""I think we all wish the economy was a lot better, but I feel very strongly that we can't back away from progress we've made on really important things like climate change,"" Mr. Doyle said. ""I'm looking forward to having a federal government and a president who will provide real leadership and bring the United States into the world on this issue."""
"Foreign, Thursday, December 11, 2008 1001 mots, p. A 12",,U.S. Transition Hampers Talks on Climate Change,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting from New York.,,"POZNAN, Poland - As ministers from 189 countries gather here in the coal mining regions of Poland to hammer out a new climate treaty, progress is being sorely hampered by the transition under way in American politics, delegates and experts here said.

No one expected a team representing President-elect Barack Obama to attend these meetings -- he has said there is but one president at a time, and the United States is still represented here by the Bush administration. But the anticipation of his presidency has left this critical meeting in a bit of limbo.

Mr. Obama has called climate change ""a matter of urgency,"" promising to seek legislation to cut greenhouse gas emissions sharply and to increase United States participation in global climate initiatives. But many countries are still waiting to size up Mr. Obama's actual environmental commitment before making bold moves of their own.

""It has affected the meeting in a fairly significant way,"" said Gus Silva-Chavez, a policy expert at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, who has been observing the closed negotiations. ""A lot of people think: 'This is not the time to put our cards on the table. Let's wait for the new administration. Why agree to anything now?' ""

This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the European Union is itself struggling to finalize its own climate package this week -- hampered by the global economic turndown -- and so its delegates have been unusually quiet here.

""We have a sense of urgency, but you don't see any strong decisions"" being made here, said Elenita Dano, a member of the Philippines delegation. ""Political developments in the U.S. and the E.U. are holding us hostage, and we have no choice but to wait.""

The current negotiations are meant to culminate in a treaty in Copenhagen in December 2009, to take effect in 2013. It will replace industrialized nations' commitments to reduce emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. The United States never ratified that agreement, and its binding terms do not apply to China, India, and other emerging powers that are projected to account for nearly all growth in emissions in the next few decades.

So far Mr. Obama has outlined a number of broad policies but provided few specifics or a timetable for implementing his ideas. He could propose a climate bill, but the kind of cap-and-trade system preferred by Mr. Obama for greenhouse gases would, by many estimates, take at least a year or two to hash out even with a Democratic majority in both houses of Congress.

""The fear is this could become a Clinton health plan, trying to do too much too soon, and ending up with nothing,"" said Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House staff member who is now with the National Commission on Energy Policy.

On the other hand, short-term measures that would be easier to enact, like energy initiatives in an economic stimulus spending package, could be perceived by Europe and China, particularly, as insufficient evidence of meaningful change.

Even at the highest levels, officials here are awaiting results: ""Another climate treaty without the U.S. doesn't make a lot of sense,"" said Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the meeting's sponsor.

There are ample signs that the United States can do little of substance in these talks because of the presidential transition. In an interview several days ago, James L. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said the Bush administration climate team was committed to keeping all options open for the incoming Obama administration -- in essence saying that the American negotiators in Poznan had little room to make commitments.

""We have taken ideas very extensively from many people who are currently senior advisers to the Obama team on how to think through creative future approaches,"" he said.

Still, the conference has achieved a few important goals. The delegates have agreed on a method for essentially paying countries and communities for preserving forests, through a system of carbon credits. Twenty percent of man-made carbon-dioxide emissions are attributed to deforestation. The delegates are also nearing agreement on a fund, conceptualized a year ago, to help developing nations adapt to climate change.

Expectations for the talks here were always muted, because Poznan was meant to be a midpoint meeting that would lead to a new climate treaty by next December.

Negotiators may yet be on track to meet that goal. ""If the pace picks up we could get an agreement by Copenhagen,"" said Angela Anderson, director of the International Global Warming Campaign of the Pew Environment Group.

On Thursday, government ministers arrive for two days of meetings to work out a final set of documents, to guide the process through the next year. A Congressional delegation, as always, is observing the talks, with senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, assigned to report back to Mr. Obama.

Against the backdrop of a global recession, there were signs that delegates of industrialized nations wanted to back away from ambitious emission reduction targets that had been discussed last year, based on research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Under the panel's scenarios, industrialized countries would have to reduce emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 to set the world on a track to avert disastrous warming, numbers that went in and out of the draft proposal over the course of Wednesday. Countries like Italy have suggested they might have a hard time meeting previous emissions reductions goals in the current economic climate.

In addition, a group of developing countries called the G-77 complained that their proposals to help poor countries combat climate change generally fell on deaf ears. ""We got no support from developed countries whether in technology transfer or finances,"" said Tasneem Essop, of the World Wide Fund for Nature of South Africa.

Such hopes and frustrations presaged great pressure on the new American administration. Said Jake Schmidt of the Natural Resources Defense Council, who participated in a panel discussion here: ""Clearly one of the major stumbling blocks has been a lack of leadership at the U.S. level, and that's about to change,"" he said.

But the incoming Obama administration is currently weighing its options, including whether there should be a climate czar, or cabinet-level environment position, said a person who is familiar with the transition.

Domestically, the person said, the administration is looking toward a three-pronged approach. First there is a stimulus package that will include ""green"" initiatives like retrofitting buildings with better insulation. Then there is an energy bill that will include components like new fuel standards and tax breaks for investments in environmental technology and renewable energy.

Finally, there is the cap-and-trade system, in which companies are assigned emissions limits and must effectively buy permits to exceed them.

Dirk Forrister, the chairman of the White House Climate Change Task Force under the Clinton administration, said such a complicated program probably could not become operational before 2014.

Tim Wirth, head of the United Nations Foundation, based in Washington, said that finalizing a new climate program would take time, but that the new administration should immediately start creating the ""building blocks"" -- forging agreements with countries like China to cooperate on energy efficiency.

""Everybody is waiting for the U.S. cavalry to come over the ridge,"" he said. ""We're a major component but not the only component."""
"Foreign, Friday, December 12, 2008 471 mots, p. A 8",,U.S. Presence at Conference On Climate Raises Hopes,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"POZNAN, Poland - Senator John Kerry arrived at the United Nations climate conference here on Thursday and immediately reassured delegates that the United States would take strong measures to combat climate change.

""President Obama will be like night and day compared to President Bush,"" Mr. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at a news conference, adding, ""Congress and the president-elect are committed to movement on mandatory goals as rapidly as possible.""

Although the incoming president has no official representatives here, the conference center is crawling with Congressional representatives and their staff members, a sign of the political transition in the United States.

Over the past two weeks, there have been staff members from more than 50 Congressional offices, representing figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, a Republican foreign policy statesman; and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, who will be the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The staff members were so numerous that the United States delegation here, representing the Bush administration, put a sign on its office door: ""Executive Branch Personnel Only.""

On Wednesday, transition team officials for Mr. Obama said he would announce his top environment team next week, which so far includes Carol M. Browner, Steven Chu and Lisa P. Jackson.

Despite elation at the new United States presence, there was widespread concern among delegates that developed nations would be less willing to make the financial investments in climate change at a time of global recession. In opening the two-day meeting of environment ministers on Thursday morning, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said there should be ""no backsliding on our commitments.""

In a roundtable on Thursday, dozens of environment ministers pledged to hold to previous plans for emissions reductions. Stavros Dimas, environment director general of the European Union, said, ""We are determined despite economic surprises to deal with climate change."" The European Union has committed to reducing emissions 20 percent by 2020.

Still, other ministers made it clear that the global recession had made good works harder. ""If we can bring our finance ministers back on board, we will be successful in Copenhagen,"" where countries hope to arrive at a climate treaty by December 2009, said Sigmar Gabriel, Germany's environment minister, who reiterated his country's goal of cutting emissions by 25 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020.

There were some bright spots at the conference, which is part of a negotiation to create the global climate treaty. Mexico took the lead among developing countries and committed itself to emission reduction targets and caps, even though developing countries are not required to do so under the Kyoto Protocol. Brazil said it would aim to cut deforestation 70 percent in the next decade.

But Xie Zhenhua, the head of the Chinese delegation, reiterated that as a developing country China should not have to make such numerical commitments, but that it would ""take positive and effective mitigation and adaptation measures."" China is the world's largest emitter.

Also, some developing countries said promises by industrial nations to help them cope with climate change seemed to have been put off. The fate of a fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change was unclear on Thursday.

""We are really disappointed with the progress we are seeing in Poznan,"" said Amjad Abdulla, director general of the Ministry of Environment in the Maldives, a chain of low-lying islands that is threatened by rising sea levels. ""We are drowning, and there is this huge gap in commitment."""
"National, Friday, December 12, 2008 673 mots, p. A 28",,"Title, but Unclear Power, For a New Climate Czar",By JOHN M. BRODER; Charlie Savage contributed reporting from Washington.,,"WASHINGTON - Much remains unknown, and perhaps undecided, about Carol M. Browner's new position as White House coordinator of energy and climate policy.

How much real authority will Ms. Browner wield? Will her office have the same bureaucratic clout -- the ability to knock heads together at other agencies -- as the National Security Council and the National Economic Council? Will she be able to hold her own against the two powerhouses that will lead those established councils, James L. Jones, a retired Marine general, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary? Will she outrank the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council? Will she have office space in the West Wing? How big will her staff be?

But this much is known. Ms. Browner's thinking on climate change, environmental regulation, energy conservation and new technology are very much in line with those of President-elect Barack Obama and the other members of his environmental team. Ms. Browner, who has close ties to Mr. Obama's transition chief, John D. Podesta, started laying the groundwork for the handover with him back in August.

Aides said Wednesday that Mr. Obama intended in the next few days to announce the nominations of Ms. Browner, Steven Chu as secretary of energy, Lisa P. Jackson as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and Nancy Sutley as head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. But the scope of Ms. Browner's job remains under discussion, the aides said.

Her views and government record are well known.

Long an acolyte of Al Gore, she has called climate change ""the greatest challenge ever faced"" and echoed Mr. Obama's call for a cap-and-trade system to control carbon dioxide emissions. Before leaving office in 2001, she set out to give the E.P.A. authority to regulate the carbon emissions that cause climate change, a power the Bush administration subsequently refused to use despite a Supreme Court ruling endorsing it. She supports California's ambitious global warming law, which will force automakers to cut tailpipe emissions deeper and faster than current federal law.

After leaving the Clinton administration, Ms. Browner became a founding partner at the Albright Group, an international consulting firm. It has helped Coca-Cola and Merck with foreign operations, but a spokeswoman for the firm declined to identify other clients.

Ms. Browner's work with the Albright Group attracted attention in early 2006, during the controversy over a Dubai firm's takeover of a company that operated several American seaports. In February 2006, Ms. Browner and a lobbyist for the Dubai company met with the staff of Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a vocal opponent of the deal.

A spokesman for Mr. Schumer told a reporter at the time that the visitors had been ""unpersuasive."" Neither Ms. Browner nor the Albright Group registered to lobby Congress about the deal. The firm's spokeswoman said Thursday that the meeting ""was for informational purposes only"" and that ""the Albright Group does not lobby.""

Ms. Browner also sits on the board of APX, which specializes in handling cap-and-trade emission credits, as well as several environment groups.

Her most notable accomplishment in the Clinton years came when she pushed through tough air quality rules over intense opposition from industry groups and from some in the administration who viewed them as too costly. But even as she pressed ahead, her favorite slogan was ""common sense."" How far she will be able to go in pursuit of vastly more comprehensive and costly energy-conservation goals remains to be seen.

The transition team is still trying to draw the increasingly complex White House organization chart, with a proliferation of top-rank positions with as-yet-undefined roles. On Thursday, Mr. Obama designated former Senator Tom Daschle as not only his secretary of health and human services but also the White House ""health czar."" Ms. Browner is informally known within the transition and in the environmental community as the ""climate czarina,"" a title that conceals as much as it reveals.

She showed her bureaucratic muscle in one of the critical environmental battles of the Clinton era, the drive to write tough rules for permissible levels of ozone and fine particles of air pollution. The rules, drafted at Ms. Browner's E.P.A., set strict standards that industry groups and scores of members of Congress said would be too costly to meet.

Mr. Gore, then the vice president, was Ms. Browner's top ally in the administration, but the president's economic advisers and Office of Management and Budget officials were wary of the supposed economic and political costs of the new regulations.

Ms. Browner stood her ground and eventually persuaded President Bill Clinton to support her. The rules went into effect and survived determined challenges in the courts and in Congress. In navigating that maze, Ms. Browner stepped on many toes, and she remains unpopular with assorted industry groups and conservatives in Congress."
"National, Tuesday, December 16, 2008 935 mots, p. A 24",,Hard Task for New Team On Energy and Climate,"By JOHN M. BRODER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.",,"WASHINGTON - The team President-elect Barack Obama introduced on Monday to carry out his energy and environmental policies faces a host of political, economic, diplomatic and scientific challenges that could impede his plans to address global warming and America's growing dependence on dirty and uncertain sources of energy.

Acknowledging that a succession of presidents and Congresses had failed to make much progress on the issues, Mr. Obama vowed to press ahead despite the faltering economy and suggested that he would invest his political capital in trying to break logjams.

""This time must be different,"" Mr. Obama said at a news conference in Chicago. ""This will be a leading priority of my presidency and a defining test of our time. We cannot accept complacency, nor accept any more broken promises.""

Shortly after Mr. Obama spoke, transition officials confirmed that he would select Senator Ken Salazar, a first-term Democrat from Colorado, as interior secretary. Mr. Salazar's appointment will complete the team of environmental and energy officials in the new administration.

The most pressing environmental issue for the incoming team will almost certainly be settling on an effective and politically tenable approach to the intertwined issues of energy security and global warming.

The point person for these issues will be Carol M. Browner, who was named on Monday to the new position of White House coordinator for energy and climate. Ms. Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Bill Clinton, will oversee two former aides, Lisa P. Jackson, who was selected as the new agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, who will be the chairwoman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Joining the group will be Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics whom Mr. Obama designated to lead the Energy Department.

Mr. Salazar, a former director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and state attorney general, is a farmer and rancher whose family has lived in Colorado for five generations. He is known as a staunch conservationist and an opponent of developing oil shale on public lands.

His appointment will leave a Democratic vacancy in the Senate. Colorado, which voted for Mr. Obama 53 percent to 45 percent, has a Democratic governor, Bill Ritter, who will name a replacement to complete the final two years of Mr. Salazar's term. Mr. Salazar's brother John, a congressman, is among potential appointees to fill the Senate seat.

The intense ideological and regional rivalries that have stalled climate change legislation in Congress for years have not suddenly melted away. And even though Mr. Obama promises to give energy legislation a high priority, he first must stabilize an economy that is shedding jobs by the hundreds of thousands each month.

The new team faces political urgency to deliver on promises made by Mr. Obama on the campaign trail. One was his pledge to use a cap-and-trade bill for curbing heat-trapping gases as both the means of shifting investments away from energy sources that cause emissions of such gases and also as the source of the $15 billion a year he promised to invest in advanced energy technology. That figure may be dwarfed by spending on stimulus programs, including so-called green projects like building wind farms and making buildings more energy efficient.

Previous efforts to move a comprehensive climate bill through Congress stalled even without the deepening recession the nation confronts today, said Rafe Pomerance, a negotiator in the Clinton administration on international climate agreements and the president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a Washington nonprofit group.

Mr. Pomerance said the challenge would be to devise a scientifically rigorous bill that would satisfy lawmakers who fear the costs.

Left unclear on Monday was how the new president's advisers intend to use the levers of government to get to the ""new energy economy"" Mr. Obama described. Also uncertain was what relationship they would forge with his powerful economic advisers.

""In policy terms, I think there are big questions about what priority will be given to direct public infrastructure spending versus tax-based incentives versus environmental markets versus direct regulation,"" said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group. ""There is still a very profound debate on all of that.""

The diplomatic tension is driven by the steps required to work toward a new global climate treaty, which the United States and nearly all other nations have committed to completing by December 2009. The last round of talks ended last weekend in Poland with few signs of progress on the main goal, limiting emissions of heat-trapping gases without hampering economic development.

It is widely felt that if the United States does not demonstrate concrete domestic steps to curb its emissions from burning fossil fuels, fast-growing developing countries will continue to balk at taking on obligations to cut their emissions. And while Mr. Obama will enjoy a larger Democratic majority than Mr. Clinton did in his two terms, the Senate has long made such steps a prerequisite for its required consent to any climate treaty.

The scientific urgency comes from the unanticipated recent growth in emissions of carbon dioxide in China, India and other countries with fast-expanding economies. This heat-trapping gas is the biggest concern because its long life, once the gas is released, causes it to build in the atmosphere, something like unpaid credit-card debt, as long as reductions are not made.

Additional pressure comes from growing recognition that market forces alone are unlikely to drive the spread of nonpolluting energy technologies fast enough to matter where all the growth in energy use is at its peak, in the rapidly growing countries of Asia and Latin America.

Nathan Lewis, who leads a team at Caltech pursuing ways to greatly improve solar energy technologies, said the appointment of Dr. Chu as energy secretary sent a strong signal that Mr. Obama understood that any program on climate-friendly energy had to have three prongs: increasing efficiency, moving existing nonpolluting energy technologies more quickly into the market, and advancing on the frontiers of energy science in search of radical breakthroughs.

""Energy efficiency cannot be seen as Job 1 and the other stuff Job 2,"" Dr. Lewis said. ""You've got to do them all as Job 1 because they all have to work.""

Dr. Chu has spoken of using coal to generate electricity as an environmental ""nightmare,"" but he acknowledges that the nation lacks the technology to replace it or clean it up in the near term. Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for utilities, said that any solution to the climate problem must address these costs and provide consumers and electricity producers time to adjust.

""There will be major costs,"" Mr. Kuhn said. ""It's a question of trying to mitigate the costs as much as possible."""
"National, Saturday, January 3, 2009 1132 mots, p. A 10",,"In Obama's Team, 2 Camps on Climate",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - In the fall of 1997, when the Clinton administration was forming its position for the Kyoto climate treaty talks, Lawrence H. Summers argued that the United States would risk damaging the domestic economy if it set overly ambitious goals for reducing carbon emissions.

Mr. Summers, then the deputy Treasury secretary, said at the time that there was a compelling scientific case for action on global warming but that a too-rapid move against emissions of greenhouse gases risked dire and unknowable economic consequences.

His view prevailed over those of officials arguing for tougher standards, among them Carol M. Browner, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and her mentor, Al Gore, then the vice president.

Today, as the climate-change debate once again heats up, Mr. Summers leads the economic team of the incoming administration, and Ms. Browner has been designated its White House coordinator of energy and climate policy. And Mr. Gore is hovering as an informal adviser to President-elect Barack Obama.

As Mr. Obama seeks to find the right balance between his environmental goals and his plans to revive the economy, he may have to resolve conflicting views among some of his top advisers.

While Mr. Summers's thinking on climate change has evolved over the last decade, his views on the potential risks to the economy of an aggressive effort to limit carbon emissions have not. But he now works for a president-elect who has set ambitious goals for addressing global warming through a government-run cap-and-trade system.

It may once again prove to be Mr. Summers's role to inject a rigorous economist's reality check into the debate over the scope and speed of an attack on global warming.

According to a transition official familiar with Mr. Summers's thinking, he is wary of moving very quickly on a carbon cap, because doing so could raise energy costs, kill jobs and deepen the current recession. He foresees a phase-in of several years for any carbon restraint regime, particularly if the economy continues to be sluggish, a slower timetable than many lawmakers and environmentalists are pressing.

Mr. Summers and Peter R. Orszag, the economist whom Mr. Obama has designated director of the White House budget office, have both argued that a tax on carbon emissions from burning gasoline, coal and other fuels might be a more economically efficient means of regulating pollutants than a cap-and-trade system, under which an absolute ceiling on emissions is set and polluters are allowed to buy and sell permits to meet it.

But Mr. Obama and Ms. Browner have ruled out a straight carbon tax, perhaps mindful of the stinging political defeat the Clinton administration suffered in 1993 when, prodded by Mr. Gore, it proposed one.

Mr. Obama was asked in a television interview last month whether he would consider imposing a stiff tax on gasoline, whose price has now fallen to below $2 a gallon after cresting above $4 a gallon last summer.

He replied that while American families were getting some relief at the pump, they were hurting in other ways, through rising unemployment and falling home values. ""So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake,"" he said.

At least for the present, then, the idea of a carbon tax has been shelved, and Mr. Obama's economic and environmental advisers are working, along with Congress, to devise a cap-and-trade system.

But difficult debates lie ahead within the White House, between the White House and Congress, and within the Democratic Party, whose deep divisions on climate change break down along ideological and geographical lines.

The fight in November between two Democrats, Representatives John D. Dingell of Michigan and Henry A. Waxman of California, for the chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee was a preview. It pitted lawmakers from auto- and coal-producing states against liberal lawmakers from California and the East Coast, Blue Dog fiscal conservatives against environmentalists, pro-business moderates against regulatory activists. Mr. Waxman, with the tacit support of the Obama camp and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, won, but narrowly.

That was just a taste of the broader and potentially more bitter fight over global warming and energy legislation, which will have profound implications for the American economy, the environment and foreign policy.

Both sides -- those seeking strict enforcement of emissions limits and those concerned about higher energy costs and potential job losses -- will find receptive ears in the new White House, Obama aides and outside analysts said.

""There is a diversity of opinion among Democrats over the best way to contain costs associated with a climate change plan,"" said Scott Segal, a utility lobbyist in Washington, who cited rival approaches pushed by Senator Barbara Boxer of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

""I think there is room within the current range of administration advisers to accommodate all those points of view,"" Mr. Segal said.

The Obama transition did not make Ms. Browner or Mr. Summers available for on-the-record interviews. A spokesman, Nick Shapiro, said that Mr. Obama had appointed advisers with differing views but that ultimately he would set policy.

""At the end of the day,"" Mr. Shapiro said in an e-mail statement, ""the advisers will be charged with implementing President-elect Obama's strong targets that set us on a course to reduce emissions to their 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce them an additional 80 percent by 2050. However, the president-elect appointed a cabinet with diverse views and looks forward to strong debate within the cabinet on how best to achieve those outcomes.""

Emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by the United States in 2007 were about 15 percent above 1990's level, according to the Department of Energy.

In past public statements and writings, Ms. Browner and Mr. Summers have wrestled with the difficult choices posed by global warming and at times have come to different conclusions on how to minimize the impact on the economy.

Ms. Browner has been a forceful advocate for strict carbon limits for years and has said that a comprehensive cap-and-trade system is the best way to achieve swift and certain reductions in emissions. She has said that the plan could include flexibility for carbon-emitting businesses by allowing them to bank and borrow permits, but she has not supported setting a maximum price or ""safety valve"" cost in case permits become prohibitively expensive, as Mr. Summers and Mr. Orszag have.

She has urged Congress to take up the issue quickly in the new year. In September, in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, Ms. Browner pointedly noted that the Supreme Court had given the E.P.A. authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. She implied that if Mr. Obama was elected, the new administration might unilaterally seek to curb carbon emissions should Congress not act.

""Given the magnitude of the problem, and the scale of the solution required,"" she said, ""I believe it is important that Congress provide national leadership on this issue.""

Mr. Summers believes a cap-and-trade program can be a workable solution, provided it includes some sort of escape clause if prices rise too quickly, according to several articles he has written in the past two years. He has also expressed a belief that developing nations must also adhere to carbon limits, or manufacturing jobs will migrate to countries without them.

In a forum at the Brookings Institution a year ago, Mr. Summers said the current moment on climate change was analogous to that on health care in 1992: Everyone agreed that the current system was unsustainable, but there was less agreement on how to address the complexities and costs. There was a general expectation that with the inauguration of a new Democratic president, something would be done.

""In the end,"" Mr. Summers said, ""what everyone agreed needed to happen didn't happen in 1993.""

"Business/Financial, Saturday, March 1, 2008 756 mots, p. C 2",,SATURDAY INTERVIEW,,,"By PATRICIA R. OLSEN

MENTION global warming and there is a good chance the conversation will turn to the future of ski resorts. But Rob Katz, chief executive of Vail Resorts, is not worried. Vail had more snow in a recent 30-day period than it has had in the last 10 years. And should snowfall decrease significantly in the future, Mr. Katz said, there will be greater concerns than how much snow there is.

In an industry that averages $2 billion in annual revenue in the United States, according to a report in January by First Research, Vail Resorts is a heavyweight. The company's five ski resorts are Vail, Breckenridge, Beaver Creek and Keystone in Colorado, and Heavenly, which straddles California and Nevada. The first three consistently get high marks in Ski Magazine.

The company has several energy-conservation and earth-friendly programs, including partnerships with wind farms across the country to offset its energy use. Vail Resorts pays its utility bills and then invests, through renewable energy credits, in developing new wind farms.

In addition, Vail intends to purchase ""green"" construction materials for future building projects and work with the Forest Service to preserve trees. In new developments, the company plans to use a geothermal process that relies on ground source heat pumps to collect heat from the earth and melt the snow on streets and sidewalks. Mr. Katz recently discussed global warming; Vail's focus, environmental and otherwise; and his company's customers. Following are excerpts from that interview:

Q.You don't sound overly concerned about the effect of global warming on your operations. Why not?

A. Climate is only one part of the environment, and it's a planetary issue. When people ask me if I'm worried about global warming, I tell them I'm worried as a parent. If Colorado is going to be as warm as Mexico in 50 years, then we all have more to worry about than skiing at Vail. We have higher priorities directly related to our local ecosystem, such as improving the wildlife habitat and keeping the water clean.

In the businesses we're in -- whether you look at our skiing, lodging, retail or real estate development business -- what we sell is the outdoors. Because that's our product, we have a responsibility and an opportunity. The responsibility is to do the right thing for something we're using to make money, and the opportunity is to deepen our relationship with our guests by keeping our spectacular settings beautiful. That has been the push for us.

Q.What steps have you taken to stay viable as an industry?

A. We're doing what we're doing because it's the right thing to do. So for example, using wind power helps global climate change, but we're also diversifying our fuel source. There is other pollution that comes from coal, for instance, so there's a whole range of impact that fossil fuels have. The steps we're taking are less about our viability as a business than doing the right thing for the product we sell.

Q.When did you begin the renewable energy credits program to offset your use of fossil fuels? What is the scope of your effort?

A. We started the program in August of 2006. We purchase 152,000 megawatt-hours and are right behind Whole Foods.

Q.Has the skier demographic changed in the last 5 or 10 years?

A. I think our audience has widened in the last few years. We're seeing an expansion at our top end. More frequent grooming of the slopes and shaped skis, which are wider, have allowed people to continue enjoying the sport longer. People who aren't as athletic as many skiers are also able to enjoy the sport. The advent of twin-tip skis, freestyle skiing and terrain parks for snowboarders, with jumps and rails and all those crazy things, has also increased the number of skier days for 10- to 20-year-olds. That's not necessarily our target market, but the parents of those kids are looking for vacations that keep the kids happy and occupied, and skiing resonates with them.

Also, people are spending more time at work and have more stress. They're looking for vacations that allow them an outlet.

Q.Why didn't you buy any of the American Ski Company properties when that company was selling off ski resorts in 2006? Why haven't you ever expanded into the Northeast?

A. We're focused on buying a resort that we think fits with what we have today -- a very high-quality experience but also one that's large enough to be a very successful business. You have a lot of fixed costs in opening a resort. Adding skiers doesn't cost that much. I wouldn't say we'd never buy a property in the Northeast, but our bigger focus has been in the West.

Q.Having snowboarders and skiers share the slopes has been controversial. What's the solution?

A. We're not seeing the same issues we saw 10 or 15 years ago. The 50-year-old who likes snowboarding may not cause as much commotion on a snowboard as a 17-year-old. The 17-year-olds tend to gravitate toward the terrain parks, where there are all kinds of jumps and tricks. I'm a pretty enthusiastic skier, and I never go into the terrain parks. I'm scared. The key is to go to an area that provides a place snowboarders and freestyle skiers gravitate to.

Q.How often do you get to ski?

A. If my 7- and 9-year-olds have anything to say about it, I'll get in about 40 days this year."
"Foreign, Sunday, March 2, 2008 290 mots, p. A 4",,Danish Guest Asks Bush to Back Climate Treaty,By NEIL A. LEWIS,,"CRAWFORD, Tex. - With less than a year to go in office, President Bush has begun offering valedictory courtesies to favored foreign leaders, including a much coveted ranch visit this weekend to the Danish prime minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

Mr. Rasmussen, who has been one of Mr. Bush's most stalwart defenders on Iraq, has sharply reduced his country's contingent there but still has 600 troops in Afghanistan.

Despite his obvious delight at being invited to Mr. Bush's ranch, Mr. Rasmussen wanted the president to reciprocate his loyalty, providing support for Denmark's efforts to negotiate a new global warming treaty when it is the host of a conference next year in Copenhagen.

Mr. Bush told reporters on Saturday, ""We talked about climate change, more than once, as I showed him my ranch and how we're conservationists in Crawford.""

Mr. Rasmussen, in turn, described Mr. Bush as ""a convinced environmentalist"" and world leader on the issue.

But it remained unclear whether Mr. Bush was offering anything beyond a rhetorical blessing. The administration has long been at odds with many European countries that would like to forge a new treaty with mandated limits on greenhouse gas-causing emissions.

Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton professor who has called attention to the issue of global warming, said in an interview that a Bush administration pledge about reducing global warming would lack credibility because the administration had opposed many domestic programs to save energy and cut oil consumption.

""No one will take this as anything meaningful,"" he said. Professor Oppenheimer also noted that Mr. Bush would be long gone from office when dozens of nations meet in Copenhagen at the end of 2009.

Mr. Bush offered a favorable interpretation of Denmark's decision to withdraw most of its forces from Iraq, saying the action was based on ""the policy of 'return upon success.""' The president avoided a direct answer when questioned about recent reports that American forces in Iraq will continue to be reduced after July, when they reach the level of 15 combat brigades, where they stood before a sudden increase last year.

""In terms of troop levels, there is going to be enormous speculation again about what decision I will make,"" Mr. Bush said."
"Foreign, Sunday, March 2, 2008 1015 mots, p. A 18",,Skeptics on Human Climate Impact Seize on Cold Spell,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The world has seen some extraordinary winter conditions in both hemispheres over the past year: snow in Johannesburg last June and in Baghdad in January, Arctic sea ice returning with a vengeance after a record retreat last summer, paralyzing blizzards in China, and a sharp drop in the globe's average temperature.

It is no wonder that some scientists, opinion writers, political operatives and other people who challenge warnings about dangerous human-caused global warming have jumped on this as a teachable moment.

""Earth's 'Fever' Breaks: Global COOLING Currently Under Way,"" read a blog post and news release on Wednesday from Marc Morano, the communications director for the Republican minority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

So what is happening?

According to a host of climate experts, including some who question the extent and risks of global warming, it is mostly good old-fashioned weather, along with a cold kick from the tropical Pacific Ocean, which is in its La Nina phase for a few more months, a year after it was in the opposite warm El Nino pattern.

If anything else is afoot -- like some cooling related to sunspot cycles or slow shifts in ocean and atmospheric patterns that can influence temperatures -- an array of scientists who have staked out differing positions on the overall threat from global warming agree that there is no way to pinpoint whether such a new force is at work.

Many scientists also say that the cool spell in no way undermines the enormous body of evidence pointing to a warming world with disrupted weather patterns, less ice and rising seas should heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and forests continue to accumulate in the air.

""The current downturn is not very unusual,"" said Carl Mears, a scientist at Remote Sensing Systems, a private research group in Santa Rosa, Calif., that has been using satellite data to track global temperature and whose findings have been held out as reliable by a variety of climate experts. He pointed to similar drops in 1988, 1991-92, and 1998, but with a long-term warming trend clear nonetheless.

""Temperatures are very likely to recover after the La Nina event is over,"" he said.

Mr. Morano, in an e-mail message, was undaunted, saying turnabout is fair play: ""Fair is fair. Noting (not hyping) an unusually harsh global winter is merely pointing out the obvious. Dissenters of a man-made 'climate crisis' are using the reality of this record-breaking winter to expose the silly warming alarmism that the news media and some scientists have been ceaselessly promoting for decades.""

More clucking about the cold is likely over the next several days. The Heartland Institute, a public policy research group in Chicago opposed to regulatory approaches to environmental problems, is holding a conference in Times Square on Monday and Tuesday aimed at exploring questions about the cause and dangers of climate change.

The event will convene an array of scientists, economists, statisticians and libertarian commentators holding a dizzying range of views on the changing climate -- from those who see a human influence but think it is not dangerous, to others who say global warming is a hoax, the sun's fault or beneficial. Many attendees say it is the dawn of a new paradigm. But many climate scientists and environmental campaigners say it is the skeptics' last stand.

Michael E. Schlesinger, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said that any focus on the last few months or years as evidence undermining the established theory that accumulating greenhouse gases are making the world warmer was, at best, a waste of time and, at worst, a harmful distraction.

Discerning a human influence on climate, he said, ""involves finding a signal in a noisy background."" He added, ""The only way to do this within our noisy climate system is to average over a sufficient number of years that the noise is greatly diminished, thereby revealing the signal. This means that one cannot look at any single year and know whether what one is seeing is the signal or the noise or both the signal and the noise.""

The shifts in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (where ice has retreated significantly in recent summers) and Antarctic (where the area of floating sea ice has grown lately) are similarly hard to attribute to particular influences.

Interviews and e-mail exchanges with half a dozen polar climate and ice experts last week produced a rough consensus: Even with the extensive refreezing of Arctic waters in the deep chill of the sunless boreal winter, the fresh-formed ice remains far thinner than the yards-thick, years-old ice that dominated the region until the 1990s.

That means the odds of having vast stretches of open water next summer remain high, many Arctic experts said.

""Climate skeptics typically take a few small pieces of the puzzle to debunk global warming, and ignore the whole picture that the larger science community sees by looking at all the pieces,"" said Ignatius G. Rigor, a climate scientist at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington in Seattle.

He said the argument for a growing human influence on climate laid out in last year's reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or I.P.C.C., was supported by evidence from many fields.

""I will admit that we do not have all the pieces,"" Dr. Rigor said, ""but as the I.P.C.C. reports, the preponderance of evidence suggests that global warming is real."" As for the Arctic, he said, ""Yes, this year's winter ice extent is higher than last year's, but it is still lower than the long-term mean.""

Dr. Rigor said next summer's ice retreat, despite the regrowth of thin fresh-formed ice now, could still surpass last year's, when nearly all of the Arctic Ocean between Alaska and Siberia was open water.

Some scientists who strongly disagree with each other on the extent of warming coming in this century, and on what to do about it, agreed that it was important not to be tempted to overinterpret short-term swings in climate, either hot or cold.

Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist and commentator with the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, has long chided environmentalists and the media for overstating connections between extreme weather and human-caused warming. (He is on the program at the skeptics' conference.)

But Dr. Michaels said that those now trumpeting global cooling should beware of doing the same thing, saying that the ""predictable distortion"" of extreme weather ""goes in both directions.""

Gavin A. Schmidt, a climatologist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan who has spoken out about the need to reduce greenhouse gases, disagrees with Dr. Michaels on many issues, but concurred on this point.

""When I get called by CNN to comment on a big summer storm or a drought or something, I give the same answer I give a guy who asks about a blizzard,"" Dr. Schmidt said. ""It's all in the long-term trends. Weather isn't going to go away because of climate change. There is this desire to explain everything that we see in terms of something you think you understand, whether that's the next ice age coming or global warming."""
"Editorial, Tuesday, March 4, 2008 482 mots, p. A 24",,EDITORIAL,,,"The Bush administration has now provided the rationale for its lamentable decision to deny California permission to develop its own stricter rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The explanation was full of holes, but it was not a total setback for those who want urgent action on global warming.

The essence of the administration's reasoning was that California had failed to demonstrate ""extraordinary and compelling"" circumstances justifying stricter rules. To make that case, Stephen Johnson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was forced to argue that climate change gravely endangered not only California but the entire country. As hard as it is to believe, this was the first time that any senior administration official had explicitly conceded that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Even more startling for an administration that has spent seven years in denial, Mr. Johnson acknowledged that ""warming of the climate system is unequivocal,"" that man-made emissions are largely responsible and that the consequences could be devastating -- more wildfires, more droughts, rising sea levels, more intense hurricanes, more outbreaks of insect-borne diseases.

Given all that, one would assume that Mr. Johnson is at last ready to champion a national program of controls on greenhouse gas emissions, something the administration has long resisted. At the very least, he would now seem obliged to begin regulating greenhouse gases, at least from vehicles. The Supreme Court in effect ordered the E.P.A. to do just that last April, when it declared carbon dioxide a pollutant subject to regulatory control. Nearly a year has gone by, and Mr. Johnson has not announced any new regulations.

Meanwhile, Mr. Johnson's decision to deny California the right to set its own emission standards is unquestionably a blow to anyone worried about climate change and its consequences. With neither the administration nor Congress willing to take aggressive action -- the Senate is only now beginning to entertain a broad program of emissions reductions -- there were hopes that the states could fill the gap.

California's program was intended to take effect in 2009 and aimed to cut greenhouse gases from vehicles by nearly one-third by 2016. These are double the reductions that would be achieved by the new fuel economy standards contained in last year's energy bill, the best the federal government has been able to do so far.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 allows California to set stricter standards than the federal government (in part because its own clean air laws predate the federal statute) as long as it first receives a federal waiver. Once that waiver is granted, other states can adopt the same standards. In anticipation of a waiver, 12 other states -- including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- had adopted California's greenhouse gas standards and a half-dozen more are in the process of doing so. The states are now stuck with the weaker targets called for in the energy bill.

The states and various environmental groups will rightly challenge this latest decision in court. We have no doubt that the law and sound public policy are on California's side. Meanwhile, the way Mr. Johnson framed his case leaves him and the administration no choice except to seek a national regulatory solution. As Lisa Heinzerling, the Georgetown professor who wrote the plaintiffs' briefs in last year's Supreme Court case, observed: Mr. Johnson ""cannot avoid the consequences of his own decisions.""

We hope she is right. It is past time for this administration to do what is required by law and the planet."
"National, Monday, March 10, 2008 411 mots, p. A 11",,Southern Baptists Back A Shift on Climate Change,By NEELA BANERJEE,,"Signaling a significant departure from the Southern Baptist Convention's official stance on global warming, 44 Southern Baptist leaders have decided to back a declaration calling for more action on climate change, saying its previous position on the issue was ""too timid.""

The largest denomination in the United States after the Roman Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist Convention, with more than 16 million members, is politically and theologically conservative.

Yet its current president, the Rev. Frank Page, signed the initiative, ""A Southern Baptist Declaration on the Environment and Climate Change."" Two past presidents of the convention, the Rev. Jack Graham and the Rev. James Merritt, also signed.

""We believe our current denominational engagement with these issues has often been too timid, failing to produce a unified moral voice,"" the church leaders wrote in their new declaration.

A 2007 resolution passed by the convention hewed to a more skeptical view of global warming.

In contrast, the new declaration, which will be released Monday, states, ""Our cautious response to these issues in the face of mounting evidence may be seen by the world as uncaring, reckless and ill-informed.""

The document also urges ministers to preach more about the environment and for all Baptists to keep an open mind about considering environmental policy.

Jonathan Merritt, the spokesman for the Southern Baptist Environment and Climate Initiative and a seminarian at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., said the declaration was a call to Christians to return to a biblical mandate to guard the world God created.

The Southern Baptist signatories join a growing community of evangelicals pushing for more action among believers, industry and politicians. Experts on the Southern Baptist Convention noted the initiative marked the growing influence of younger leaders on the discussions in the Southern Baptist Convention.

While those younger Baptists remain committed to fight abortion, for instance, the environment is now a top priority, too.

""In no way do we intend to back away from sanctity of life,"" said the Rev. Dr. Timothy George, dean of Beeson Divinity School in Birmingham, Ala.

Still, many powerful Southern Baptist leaders and agencies did not sign the declaration, including the convention's influential political arm, the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.

Dr. Barrett Duke, vice president for public policy at the commission, played down the differences between the declaration and the Southern Baptist Convention's position.

The declaration says in fact that lack of scientific unanimity should not preclude ""prudent action,"" which includes changing individual habits and giving ""serious consideration to responsible policies that effectively address"" global warming.

The declaration is the outgrowth of soul-searching by Mr. Merritt, 25. The younger Mr. Merritt said that for years he had been ""an enemy of the environment."" Then, he said, he had an epiphany.

""I learned that God reveals himself through Scripture and in general through his creation, and when we destroy God's creation, it's similar to ripping pages from the Bible,"" Mr. Merritt said."
"National, Wednesday, March 12, 2008 669 mots, p. A 21",,Global-Warming Threat Is Seen for Coastal Areas,By CORNELIA DEAN,,"A rise in sea levels and other changes fueled by global warming threaten roads, rail lines, ports, airports and other important infrastructure, and policy makers and planners should be acting now to avoid or mitigate their effects, according to new government reports.

While increased heat and ""intense precipitation events"" threaten these structures, the greatest and most immediate potential impact is coastal flooding, according to one of the reports, by an expert panel convened by the National Research Council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences.

Another study, a multiagency effort led by the Environmental Protection Agency, sounds a similar warning on infrastructure but adds that natural features like beaches, wetlands and fresh-water supplies are also threatened by encroaching saltwater.

The reports are not the first to point out that rising seas, inevitable in a warming world, are a major threat. In a report last September, the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Task Force noted that a two-foot rise by the year 2100, the prediction of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ""would make life in South Florida very difficult for everyone.""

But the new reports offer detailed assessments of vulnerability in the relatively near term. Both note that coastal areas are thickly populated, economically important and gaining people and investment by the day, even as scientific knowledge of the risks they face increases. Use of this knowledge by policy makers and planners is ""inadequate,"" the academy panel said.

""It's time for the transportation people to put these things into their thought processes,"" Henry G. Schwartz Jr., the chairman of the Research Council panel, said in an interview.

The 218-page academy report was issued Tuesday, and is available at nationalacademies.org.

Noting that 60,000 miles of coastal highways are already subject to periodic flooding, the academy panel called for policy makers to survey vulnerable areas -- ""roads, bridges, marine, air, pipelines, everything,"" Dr. Schwartz said -- and begin work now on plans to protect, reinforce, move or replace on safer ground. Those tasks will take years or decades and tens of billions of dollars, at least, he said.

""We need to think about it now,"" said Dr. Schwartz, a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

The multiagency report, a draft assessment, is intended to help policy makers do just that. The 800-page draft was posted online last month for public review at climatescience.gov/Library/sap/sap4-1/public-review-draft. It focuses on the area from Montauk Point on Long Island to Cape Lookout, N.C.

Produced by a collaboration among agencies that included the United States Geological Survey, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the Department of Transportation, the report offers three estimates for sea-level rise by 2100: about 16 inches a century, a rate it said had already been exceeded; about two feet, an estimate many scientists regard as optimistic; and up to three feet, which the report says would be catastrophic for wetlands and other coastal features but that is ""less than high estimates suggested by more recent publications.""

The academy report cited similar estimates.

The multiagency report cited the Port of Wilmington in Delaware as an example. The report says that if the sea level rises by two feet or even a bit less, 70 percent of port property will be affected.

Meanwhile, it says, such a rise in sea level would leave almost 2,200 miles of major roads and almost 900 miles of rail lines in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and the District of Columbia ""at risk for regular inundation.""

The academy report made similar points, noting, for example, that airports in many large coastal cities are built in tidal areas, often on fill, making them ""particularly vulnerable."" In the New York metropolitan area, Newark Liberty International Airport and La Guardia Airport are especially at risk, Dr. Schwartz said.

Some experts have suggested that additional fill could keep pace with rising water, just as many beaches are kept alive today with periodic infusions of sand pumped from offshore. But S. Jeffress Williams, a coastal expert at the geological survey and an author of the multiagency report, noted in an interview that necessary quantities of high-quality fill might not be available where they were needed. In that case, he said, policy makers would have to consider constructing immense systems of coastal armor or accept the need for ""strategic retreat.""

As a first step, the academy report said, transportation officials must realize that climate patterns that prevailed in the past ""may no longer be a reliable guide for future plans."" Instead, it said, they should incorporate climate change into their plans for capital improvements, maintenance schedules, emergency preparedness and so on.

The panel also recommended changes in the National Flood Insurance Program, a federally subsidized program for coastal properties. The report said the maps the program used in setting rates did not reflect the influence of climate change."
"National, Friday, September 25, 2009 895 mots, p. A 19",,Behind the Furor Over a Climate Change Skeptic,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - Alan Carlin, a 72-year-old analyst and economist, had labored in obscurity in a little-known office at the Environmental Protection Agency since the Nixon administration.

In June, however, he became a sudden celebrity with the surfacing of a few e-mail messages that seemed to show that his contrarian views on global warming had been suppressed by his superiors because they were inconvenient to the Obama administration's climate change policy. Conservative commentators and Congressional Republicans said he had been muzzled because he did not toe the liberal line.

But a closer look at his case and a broader set of internal E.P.A. documents obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act paint a more complicated picture.

It is true that Dr. Carlin's supervisor refused to accept his comments on a proposed E.P.A. finding, since adopted, that greenhouse gases endangered health and the environment, and that he did so in a dismissive way.

But the newly obtained documents show that Dr. Carlin's highly skeptical views on global warming, which have been known for more than a decade within the small unit where he works, have been repeatedly challenged by scientists inside and outside the E.P.A.; that he holds a doctorate in economics, not in atmospheric science or climatology; that he has never been assigned to work on climate change; and that his comments on the endangerment finding were a product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship, as he acknowledged Thursday in an interview.

Dr. Carlin remains on the job and free to talk to the news media, and since the furor his comments on the finding have been posted on the E.P.A.'s Web site. Further, his supervisor, Al McGartland, also a career employee of the agency, received a reprimand in July for the way he had handled Dr. Carlin.

Dr. McGartland, also an economist, declined to comment on the matter. But top officials of the agency said his decision not to forward Dr. Carlin's comments to the E.P.A. office that would be writing the final report had been his own and not directed by anyone higher up in the agency.

Adora Andy, the agency's chief spokeswoman, called the accusation that Dr. Carlin had been muzzled for political reasons ""ridiculous.""

""There was no predetermined position on endangerment, and Dr. Carlin's work was not suppressed,"" Ms. Andy said in an e-mail response to questions. ""This administration has always welcomed varying scientific points of view, and we received much of it over this process.""

Dr. Carlin said he was concerned less about how he had been treated than about what he described as the agency's unwillingness to hear the arguments of climate change skeptics. He said there was an obvious ""imbalance"" between the billions of dollars the government had spent building a case for dangerous climate change and the lack of attention to a handful of skeptics like him.

The affair began in March as the E.P.A. was rushing to document the scientific justification for its proposed finding that emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases endangered public health and the environment. The finding was largely an updated version of a similar report, prepared last year under the Bush administration, that came to the same conclusion. But the Bush administration never acted on the research or issued an actual finding.

The agency's officials were acting in March under severe time constraints to prepare the finding for the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa P. Jackson, who was planning to issue it in mid-April, fulfilling a presidential campaign pledge by Barack Obama. The finding set the stage for the government to regulate greenhouse gases for the first time, an initiative that will resonate through the economy for decades.

Dr. Carlin, long known as a skeptic on global warming, was not invited to submit comments on the document. But he was determined that his views be heard.

He rushed out a 93-page report that cited a variety of sources in raising questions about global warming and the usefulness of government action to combat it. In an accompanying e-mail message to superiors, he said the belief in global warming was ""more religion than science"" and warned that regulating carbon dioxide would be ""the worst mistake that E.P.A. has ever made.""

Agency officials and outside experts who reviewed his report as a result of the outcry over the episode have said they found it wanting in a number of ways. It included unverified information from blog posts, they found, quoted selectively from journal articles, failed to acknowledge contradictory information and may have borrowed passages verbatim from the blog of a well-known climate change doubter.

In the interview Thursday, Dr. Carlin admitted that his report had been poorly sourced and written. He blamed the tight deadline.

""There are numerous problems with it,"" he said. ""I wouldn't dream of sending it to a journal in its current form. It is totally unacceptable for that type of thing. But it was either do it in four and a half days or don't do it. I had to take some shortcuts.""

According to e-mail messages that were among the documents obtained this week under the Freedom of Information Act, Dr. McGartland had earlier tried to discourage Dr. Carlin from filing comments on the proposed finding and told him that whatever he submitted was not likely to affect the final report, implying that the decision had already been made. After receiving Dr. Carlin's comments, Dr. McGartland told him that he would not forward them to the office preparing the final report.

""The time for such discussion of fundamental issues has passed for this round,"" he wrote on March 17. ""The administrator and the administration has decided to move forward on endangerment, and your comments do not help the legal or policy case for this decision.""

A few minutes later, he instructed Dr. Carlin to ""move on to other issues and subjects."" He also told Dr. Carlin not to discuss climate change with anyone outside his immediate office.

The e-mail messages most embarrassing to the E.P.A. came to light in late June, when someone sympathetic to Dr. Carlin leaked them to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative group that regularly produces studies critical of research that advances a case for climate change and government actions to address it. The institute distributed the material widely, and a number of conservative commentators and Republican lawmakers seized on it as an example of what they called Democratic suppression of science.

Dr. McGartland was ""counseled"" by his superior ""to assure that professional differences are expressed in appropriate and considered ways,"" according to one of the newly released documents.

Dr. Carlin said he and Dr. McGartland had not spoken to each other since June."
"Editorial, Monday, September 28, 2009 662 mots, p. A 23",,OP-ED COLUMNIST,,,"By PAUL KRUGMAN

Every once in a while I feel despair over the fate of the planet. If you've been following climate science, you know what I mean: the sense that we're hurtling toward catastrophe but nobody wants to hear about it or do anything to avert it.

And here's the thing: I'm not engaging in hyperbole. These days, dire warnings aren't the delusional raving of cranks. They're what come out of the most widely respected climate models, devised by the leading researchers. The prognosis for the planet has gotten much, much worse in just the last few years.

What's driving this new pessimism? Partly it's the fact that some predicted changes, like a decline in Arctic Sea ice, are happening much faster than expected. Partly it's growing evidence that feedback loops amplifying the effects of man-made greenhouse gas emissions are stronger than previously realized. For example, it has long been understood that global warming will cause the tundra to thaw, releasing carbon dioxide, which will cause even more warming, but new research shows far more carbon dioxide locked in the permafrost than previously thought, which means a much bigger feedback effect.

The result of all this is that climate scientists have, en masse, become Cassandras -- gifted with the ability to prophesy future disasters, but cursed with the inability to get anyone to believe them.

And we're not just talking about disasters in the distant future, either. The really big rise in global temperature probably won't take place until the second half of this century, but there will be plenty of damage long before then.

For example, one 2007 paper in the journal Science is titled ""Model Projections of an Imminent Transition to a More Arid Climate in Southwestern North America"" -- yes, ""imminent"" -- and reports ""a broad consensus among climate models"" that a permanent drought, bringing Dust Bowl-type conditions, ""will become the new climatology of the American Southwest within a time frame of years to decades.""

So if you live in, say, Los Angeles, and liked those pictures of red skies and choking dust in Sydney, Australia, last week, no need to travel. They'll be coming your way in the not-too-distant future.

Now, at this point I have to make the obligatory disclaimer that no individual weather event can be attributed to global warming. The point, however, is that climate change will make events like that Australian dust storm much more common.

In a rational world, then, the looming climate disaster would be our dominant political and policy concern. But it manifestly isn't. Why not?

Part of the answer is that it's hard to keep peoples' attention focused. Weather fluctuates -- New Yorkers may recall the heat wave that pushed the thermometer above 90 in April -- and even at a global level, this is enough to cause substantial year-to-year wobbles in average temperature. As a result, any year with record heat is normally followed by a number of cooler years: According to Britain's Met Office, 1998 was the hottest year so far, although NASA -- which arguably has better data -- says it was 2005. And it's all too easy to reach the false conclusion that the danger is past.

But the larger reason we're ignoring climate change is that Al Gore was right: This truth is just too inconvenient. Responding to climate change with the vigor that the threat deserves would not, contrary to legend, be devastating for the economy as a whole. But it would shuffle the economic deck, hurting some powerful vested interests even as it created new economic opportunities. And the industries of the past have armies of lobbyists in place right now; the industries of the future don't.

Nor is it just a matter of vested interests. It's also a matter of vested ideas. For three decades the dominant political ideology in America has extolled private enterprise and denigrated government, but climate change is a problem that can only be addressed through government action. And rather than concede the limits of their philosophy, many on the right have chosen to deny that the problem exists.

So here we are, with the greatest challenge facing mankind on the back burner, at best, as a policy issue. I'm not, by the way, saying that the Obama administration was wrong to push health care first. It was necessary to show voters a tangible achievement before next November. But climate change legislation had better be next.

And as I pointed out in my last column, we can afford to do this. Even as climate modelers have been reaching consensus on the view that the threat is worse than we realized, economic modelers have been reaching consensus on the view that the costs of emission control are lower than many feared.

So the time for action is now. O.K., strictly speaking it's long past. But better late than never."
"Business/Financial, Tuesday, September 29, 2009 905 mots, p. B 1",,Climate Bill Splits Exelon And Chamber Of Commerce,By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and KATE GALBRAITH,,"Exelon, one of the country's largest utilities, said Monday that it would quit the United States Chamber of Commerce because of that group's stance on climate change. It was the latest in a string of companies to do so, perhaps a harbinger of how intense the fight over global warming legislation could become.

""The carbon-based free lunch is over,"" said John W. Rowe, Exelon's chief executive. ""Breakthroughs on climate change and improving our society's energy efficiency are within reach.""

A wave of departures from the chamber has been building for weeks. It was heralded Monday by some Congressional Democrats and environmentalists as a sign that the business community's opposition to global warming legislation is weakening. In their view, that improves the chances that a global warming bill that narrowly passed the House in June might also pass the Senate.

But others said the resignations were just a sign that businesses will have varied positions depending on whether they will be winners or losers from the legislation. Exelon, a Chicago company that sells electricity and gas in four states, is also the country's largest operator of nuclear power plants. That type of electrical generation emits no greenhouse gases and would gain a financial advantage under the pending bills.

""There will be significant vibrations from this,"" said Representative Jay Inslee, a Democrat of Washington State on the Energy and Commerce Committee. ""It's a bit of an earthquake.""

Pacific Gas & Electric, the dominant utility in Northern California, and PNM Resources, a holding company that includes the largest utility in New Mexico, said recently that they would withdraw from the national chamber. Mr. Rowe said Exelon would not renew its membership because of the chamber's ""stridency against carbon legislation.""

The United States Chamber of Commerce is one of the main business lobbies in Washington, with more than three million members. It says it not opposed in principle to tackling global warming, but is worried about any approach that would raise costs for businesses.

The chamber has been especially vocal recently in opposing a proposal by the Environmental Protection Agency to use an existing law, the Clean Air Act, to set limits on greenhouse gases. The proposal would most likely take effect only if Congress failed to pass climate legislation.

The utilities and other companies that are supporting climate change legislation tend to be those based in more liberal parts of the country and believe that being viewed as environmentally responsible is a good marketing strategy, energy and business analysts said. The utilities tend to be dependent on sources like nuclear power that emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions than their competitors.

Before, ""voicing their good fortune among higher-carbon colleagues was seen as impolite,"" said Paul Bledsoe, director of communications and strategy at the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan research organization. ""Now that legislation seems imminent, these companies are stepping up to support legislation because it helps their bottom lines.""

What appears to have touched off the utilities' withdrawals from the chamber was a recent article in The Los Angeles Times that cited chamber officials who called for a ""Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century"" about the science of climate change. The Scopes trial was a clash of creationists and evolutionists in the 1920s.

Both PG&E and PNM cited the possibility of such a trial as a major concern.

Don Brown, a PNM spokesman, said in a statement that his company felt compelled to ""particularly reject"" the chamber's ""recent theatrics calling for a 'Scopes monkey trial' to put the science of climate change on trial.""

However, David C. Chavern, the chamber's chief operating officer, said there had been a misunderstanding. Chamber officials do not question the overall science of climate change, but rather, the group questions whether that science is enough to support the E.P.A.'s rulemaking under the specific legal requirements of the Clean Air Act.

""We're not looking at the next Scopes monkey trial,"" he said. ""We just think the E.P.A. is the wrong venue to be dealing with climate change issues that will impact the whole country and whole world.""

He said another chamber official's reference to the Scopes trial ""was wrong, inaccurate and obscured what the chamber is really doing.""

Other companies have also expressed differences with the chamber recently. Nike has said in a statement that it ""fundamentally disagrees with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's position on climate change and is concerned and deeply disappointed with the U.S. Chamber's recently filed petition challenging the E.P.A.'s administrative authority and action on this critically important issue.""

Johnson & Johnson, the big consumer products company, urged in a letter this spring that the chamber's statements on climate change ""reflect the full range of views, especially those of chamber members advocating for Congressional action"" on global warming.

Duke Energy, a large Southern utility that supports action against global warming, has so far stayed in the national chamber, but it withdrew from of the National Association of Manufacturers in December, citing climate as a partial factor. The manufacturers' group has also been wary of action by the E.P.A.

In August, Duke Energy also left the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, citing climate policy. ""It was clear that many influential members would never support climate legislation in 2009 or 2010 no matter how it was written,"" Tom Williams, a Duke Energy spokesman, said in an e-mail message. Alcoa, the aluminum company, also pulled out of the coal coalition this summer, with climate policy being one factor, a spokesman said.

""This is an issue that will cleave a lot of companies more than other business policy issues because there are sharper differences in strategies,"" said Matthew J. Slaughter, associate dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. He noted that a utility that primarily used coal would logically have a different view from one dependent on nuclear power.

Climate change legislation still faces a tough battle in the Senate, where legislators from coal states will seek to protect the coal industry, and where many Republicans are opposed to any action they believe would put American businesses at a disadvantage.

Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he did not know what impact the recent corporate policy announcements would have on individual senators. ""But I do think it's a sign at least some in the business community are anxious to see us provide some leadership on climate change,"" he added."
"National, Wednesday, September 30, 2009 596 mots, p. A 19",,Curtain Rises Today on Senate Struggle Over Climate Change Legislation,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - A draft of a climate bill that Senate Democrats will formally introduce on Wednesday suggests that the legislation will include a more ambitious greenhouse gas emissions target than one passed by the House.

The measure, sponsored by Senators Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, seeks to achieve by 2020 a 20 percent reduction from 2005 levels of carbon dioxide emissions, compared with 17 percent in the House bill, according to the 801-page draft, which circulated on Tuesday. The House and Senate bills both include a long-term target of an 83 percent reduction by 2050.

The Senate bill will be the focus of a broad political and lobbying struggle, as industry groups, environmental lobbies, local government officials, universities and advocates for the poor all scramble for advantage in legislation that would rewrite the rules of the domestic energy economy. Groups are already spending millions of dollars in organizing, mailing and advertising campaigns to influence the legislation.

The battle has exposed deep rifts within the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business lobbies, with companies leaving their trade organizations almost daily in disputes over climate change legislation. The Chamber of Commerce opposed the House bill and will almost certainly work to weaken or defeat the Boxer-Kerry measure.

The Senate debate will also significantly affect the American negotiating position at climate talks, sponsored by the United Nations, that are scheduled for December in Copenhagen.

The bill would set up a cap-and-trade system to achieve the emissions targets, allowing industry and other entities to buy and sell permits within an overall emissions ceiling. The House bill, which narrowly passed in late June, would establish a similar program.

But the Senate measure so far leaves a number of crucial questions unanswered, chief among them how the permits to emit carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases would be distributed to utilities, manufacturers, agribusiness and other interests. The allocation of such permits, worth billions of dollars annually, was a subject of intense horse-trading in the House and is certain to touch off a major battle as the Senate debates its own version of the bill.

The Boxer-Kerry bill will be considered in the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which Mrs. Boxer heads. Several other Senate panels, including the Finance Committee, led by Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, will also play a major role in whatever climate change debate the Senate engages in this fall. A Boxer aide cautioned that the bill was still evolving.

While Mrs. Boxer is promising to begin hearings on her bill on Oct. 20, there is no certainty that other committees will act as quickly. The Finance Committee, where the permit allocation issue and trade questions will be decided, is in the middle of the difficult health care debate and appears to be in no hurry to take on another hugely contentious matter.

The Senate bill reflects months of discussions among Democratic members to address their concerns with the House measure, sponsored by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats. The latest draft of the Senate legislation includes a system somewhat different from the House bill's to ensure that the price of emissions permits does not rise or fall too quickly. The Senate measure provides what one senior aide called a ""soft collar"" to keep permit prices within a specified range from year to year.

The Senate bill would also alter the House approach to so-called offsets, which are ways that polluting industries can get credit for emissions reductions by paying others, like farmers or timber growers, to adopt practices that reduce the overall level of carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere.

In addition, the Senate bill would provide greater incentives for construction of nuclear power plants and for low-emissions transportation systems, an aide working on the measure said.

David Doniger, climate policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the introduction of the Boxer-Kerry bill on Wednesday would signal the beginning of Senate debate on climate change.

Despite predictions that health care and other matters will consume all of the Senate calendar before members get a chance to turn to the issue, Mr. Doniger said: ""The Senate can engage and get it done this fall. There's still time."""
"National, Friday, October 2, 2009 377 mots, p. A 15",,"Southeast Drought Study Ties Water Shortage to Population, Not Global Warming",By CORNELIA DEAN,,"The drought that gripped the Southeast from 2005 to 2007 was not unprecedented and resulted from random weather events, not global warming, Columbia University researchers have concluded. They say its severe water shortages resulted from population growth more than rainfall patterns.

The researchers, who report their findings in an article in Thursday's issue of The Journal of Climate, cite census figures showing that in Georgia alone the population rose to 9.54 million in 2007 from 6.48 million in 1990.

""At the root of the water supply problem in the Southeast is a growing population,"" they wrote.

Richard Seager, a climate expert at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who led the study, said in an interview that when the drought struck, ""people were wondering"" whether climate change linked to a global increase in heat-trapping gases could be a cause.

But after studying data from weather instruments, computer models and measurements of tree rings, which reflect yearly rainfall, ""our conclusion was this drought was pretty normal and pretty typical by standards of what has happened in the region over the century,"" Mr. Seager said.

Similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years, the researchers wrote. Regardless of climate change, they added, similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future, with similar results.

In an interview, Douglas LeComte, a drought specialist at the Climate Prediction Center of the National Weather Service, said the new report ""makes sense."" Although Weather Service records suggest the 2005-7 drought was the worst in the region since the 1950s, Mr. LeComte said, ""we have had worse droughts before.""

Some climate models developed by scientists predict that the Southeast will be wetter in a warming world. But the Columbia researchers said it would be unwise to view climate change as a potential solution to future water shortages.

As the region's temperature rises, there may be more rain, they wrote, but evaporation will increase, possibly leaving the area drier than ever.

Mr. LeComte said that creating greater water storage capacity -- say, in reservoirs -- could mitigate drought effects in areas where population was rising.

""I am not going to criticize any governments for what they did or did not do,"" he said. ""But if you have more people and the same amount of water storage, you are going to increase the impact of droughts.""

The researchers said rainfall patterns in the Southeast were linked only weakly to weather patterns like La Nina and El Nino, the oscillating warm and cold conditions in the eastern Pacific linked to precipitation rates in the Southwestern United States.

Instead, they wrote, any variation in rainfall in the Southeast commonly ""arises from internal atmospheric processes and is essentially unpredictable."""
The New York Times,Late Edition - Final,"National, Saturday, October 3, 2009 437 mots, p. A 11",,,"By ANDREW C. REVKIN

President Obama's top climate and energy official said Friday that there was virtually no chance Congress would have a climate and energy bill ready for him to sign before negotiations on a global climate treaty begin in December in Copenhagen.

The remarks by the official, Carol M. Browner, during an onstage interview in Washington, were the first definitive statement by the administration that it saw little chance of Congressional passage this fall.

Lawmakers and environmental campaigners have cast similar doubts on the prospect in recent weeks, given the high priority put on health care legislation and the array of hearings that would be needed on the energy initiative, to say nothing of the time needed to reconcile competing versions of it. Climate legislation was introduced in the Senate only Wednesday, a full three months after the House passed its version.

""Obviously we'd like to be through the process -- that's not going to happen,"" Ms. Browner said at a conference on politics and history organized by The Atlantic magazine. ""I think we would all agree the likelihood you would have a bill signed by the president on comprehensive energy by the time we would go in early December is not likely.""

Yet Ms. Browner said it was possible that the Senate could at least complete its hearings on the bill by the time the international climate talks open on Dec. 7. Those hearings, along with the Obama administration's recent moves toward regulating greenhouse gases, would provide evidence that the nation was serious about cutting emissions, she said.

A show of resolve by the United States about doing its part to combat global warming is considered critical to the outcome of the Copenhagen talks.

""We will go to Copenhagen and manage with whatever we have,"" Ms. Browner said.

Later in the day, she issued a statement emphasizing that there was plenty for the United States to put on the table in the treaty talks.

""America's leadership is clear,"" she said.

To signal its determination, the administration announced Wednesday that it was planning new rules to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from hundreds of power plants and large industrial factories, regardless of Congressional action.

The Senate's climate measure, sponsored by Senators Barbara Boxer of California and John Kerry of Massachusetts, seeks a 20 percent reduction from 2005 levels of carbon dioxide emissions by 2020. The House version seeks a 17 percent reduction. Both bills include a long-term target of an 83 percent reduction by 2050.

The legislation is exceptionally controversial, given the extent to which it would transform how the nation generates and consumes energy. It is already a focus of intense lobbying by industry groups that hope to defeat it or escape aggressive regulation and by environmentalists who want it strengthened.

Eileen B. Claussen, a negotiator in climate talks for the Clinton administration who now heads the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said Ms. Browner's remarks reflected the complexity of the Obama legislative agenda.

""The Senate is a huge challenge -- not impossible, but difficult,"" Ms. Claussen said. ""What we need is for the health care debate to conclude, and the president and the entire administration to work constructively and tirelessly to pass climate legislation as soon as possible."""
"Foreign, Sunday, October 4, 2009 917 mots, p. A 12",,NEWS ANALYSIS,,,"By JIM YARDLEY

NEW DELHI - When the United Nations convened its summit meeting on climate change last month, China and the United States, the two most important countries at the negotiating table, hewed to mostly familiar scripts, making promises without making too many specific commitments. Less familiar was the script followed by the third most important country at the table, India.

India's public stance on climate change is usually predictable -- predictably obstinate and unwilling to compromise, at least according to many industrialized nations. But at the United Nations, India's delegation toned down its usual criticisms of the industrialized world, presented new plans to reduce India's emissions and sought to reposition the country, in the words of the environment minister, as a ""deal maker,"" not a ""deal breaker.""

The shift comes as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is pushing India to adopt a more internationalist posture on issues like climate change and trade as he seeks to expand India's global stature at a time when declining American influence is altering the geopolitical balance of power.

Mr. Singh's government has concluded that addressing climate change is intertwined with addressing domestic priorities like pollution, energy security and even national security.

Moreover, analysts say, India's rigid, hard-line posture has backfired; the country has been typecast as intransigent, even as its putative ally on the issue, China, a far bigger source of emissions, has succeeded in creating the impression that the Chinese are more active and engaged.

""We cannot compromise our basic national position on protecting our prospects for growth, but we can see things that can be done,"" said Nitin Desai, a member of the prime minister's special advisory council on climate change. ""The signal that I get is that India is not going to be a spoiler at Copenhagen. If a reasonable deal can be worked out, they will be there.""

With less than three months before final talks commence in Copenhagen, many analysts are deeply pessimistic that a comprehensive deal can be reached. But others are already discussing Plan B's that might give credit for domestic programs, like one proposed by India, instead of creating a global set of binding limits like those in the existing, but faltering, Kyoto Protocol.

India's close alliance with China -- they are co-leaders of the bloc of developing nations -- has been rooted in their shared interest in protecting economic growth and has created the impression that the two countries share a similar emissions profile, but, in fact, they do not. China is a far bigger polluter. India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, said India had one-fifth of China's emissions, measured either in total or per capita amounts. Over all, China accounts for roughly 23 percent of all global emissions, while India accounts for less than 5 percent.

Those disparities are why some analysts say the relationship is subtly shifting. China has now overtaken the United States as the biggest emitter in the world and is under pressure to assume responsibilities more in line with industrialized countries.

India is worried that it could face similar expectations, based on its population size and potential for future growth, even though its levels of economic development and emissions lag far behind those of China.

David G. Victor, an energy analyst who has studied India's situation, predicted that the Indian and Chinese positions could gradually separate.

As demands on developing countries increase, Mr. Victor predicted, their bloc will fragment. Low-per-capita emission countries, possibly led by India, may try to differentiate themselves from countries like Mexico, Brazil and China, which have more advanced economies and higher emissions.

""The Indians need to be very careful that they are seen as a different kind of country,"" said Mr. Victor, who also teaches at the University of California, San Diego.

Mr. Ramesh, India's environment minister, said China and India were closely coordinating their positions on the negotiations, but he also conceded that China was winning the public relations battle.

""China has raced way ahead of us, both in terms of emissions and in conveying the impression they are doing a lot on climate change,"" he said in an interview in New Delhi before he left for the United Nations summit meeting.

Mr. Ramesh said India's basic demands for signing an international accord were unchanged: that industrialized nations agree to significant emissions reductions by 2020 and also provide financial and technical assistance to the developing world. India also remains opposed to accepting any mandatory caps on emissions.

But regardless of the fate of the agreement, he said, India was moving forward anyway. His ministry would soon submit legislation to the Indian Parliament that would tighten fuel efficiency standards, set voluntary targets to improve energy efficiency, push ahead with solar power and expand the use of clean-coal technology in power plants.

""I want to be aggressive, because, frankly, we are a country that is climate dependent,"" he said, alluding to the vulnerability of India to rising sea waters and potentially disruptive annual monsoons. ""We don't like to think about it, but we are vulnerable.""

He added: ""Our prime minister's clear message to me was, 'India has to be part of the solution. We may not have caused the problem, but we have to be part of the solution.' ""

At the United Nations, Mr. Ramesh focused on practical issues like expanding forest cover, extending a treaty program encouraging investment in clean technologies and expanding technological cooperation.

""I think a lot of people welcomed that as a positive contribution,"" said Michael A. Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It showed engagement on substance rather than rhetoric.""

For years, Indian negotiators defined climate change through the geopolitics of economic justice and national sovereignty, arguing that the industrialized world had a historical responsibility to bear the brunt of any global response while equating mandatory caps on emissions as being tantamount to capping India's economic growth.

These arguments are still deeply felt in India and continue to shape the domestic political debate; Mr. Singh was sharply criticized by some members of Parliament after he agreed with other leaders last summer in Italy that nations should prevent the average global temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit from its current level.

His critics called the deal a trap to limit India's development.

Mr. Ramesh said part of his job was to build a new domestic political consensus about how India could constructively address climate change without damaging its national interests because ""without a solid domestic consensus, or even a domestic constituency, we cannot even think about engaging internationally.""

""And this is also true of the United States,"" he added. ""It's true of all democracies."""

Washington - CONVENTIONAL wisdom suggests that the prospect of Congress passing a comprehensive climate change bill soon is rapidly approaching zero. The divisions in our country on how to deal with climate change are deep. Many Democrats insist on tough new standards for curtailing the carbon emissions that cause global warming. Many Republicans remain concerned about the cost to Americans relative to the environmental benefit and are adamant about breaking our addiction to foreign sources of oil.

However, we refuse to accept the argument that the United States cannot lead the world in addressing global climate change. We are also convinced that we have found both a framework for climate legislation to pass Congress and the blueprint for a clean-energy future that will revitalize our economy, protect current jobs and create new ones, safeguard our national security and reduce pollution.

Our partnership represents a fresh attempt to find consensus that adheres to our core principles and leads to both a climate change solution and energy independence. It begins now, not months from now -- with a road to 60 votes in the Senate.

It's true that we come from different parts of the country and represent different constituencies and that we supported different presidential candidates in 2008. We even have different accents. But we speak with one voice in saying that the best way to make America stronger is to work together to address an urgent crisis facing the world.

This process requires honest give-and-take and genuine bipartisanship. In that spirit, we have come together to put forward proposals that address legitimate concerns among Democrats and Republicans and the other constituencies with stakes in this legislation. We're looking for a new beginning, informed by the work of our colleagues and legislation that is already before Congress.

First, we agree that climate change is real and threatens our economy and national security. That is why we are advocating aggressive reductions in our emissions of the carbon gases that cause climate change. We will minimize the impact on major emitters through a market-based system that will provide both flexibility and time for big polluters to come into compliance without hindering global competitiveness or driving more jobs overseas.

Second, while we invest in renewable energy sources like wind and solar, we must also take advantage of nuclear power, our single largest contributor of emissions-free power. Nuclear power needs to be a core component of electricity generation if we are to meet our emission reduction targets. We need to jettison cumbersome regulations that have stalled the construction of nuclear plants in favor of a streamlined permit system that maintains vigorous safeguards while allowing utilities to secure financing for more plants. We must also do more to encourage serious investment in research and development to find solutions to our nuclear waste problem.

Third, climate change legislation is an opportunity to get serious about breaking our dependence on foreign oil. For too long, we have ignored potential energy sources off our coasts and underground. Even as we increase renewable electricity generation, we must recognize that for the foreseeable future we will continue to burn fossil fuels. To meet our environmental goals, we must do this as cleanly as possible. The United States should aim to become the Saudi Arabia of clean coal. For this reason, we need to provide new financial incentives for companies that develop carbon capture and sequestration technology.

In addition, we are committed to seeking compromise on additional onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration -- work that was started by a bipartisan group in the Senate last Congress. Any exploration must be conducted in an environmentally sensitive manner and protect the rights and interests of our coastal states.

Fourth, we cannot sacrifice another job to competitors overseas. China and India are among the many countries investing heavily in clean-energy technologies that will produce millions of jobs. There is no reason we should surrender our marketplace to countries that do not accept environmental standards. For this reason, we should consider a border tax on items produced in countries that avoid these standards. This is consistent with our obligations under the World Trade Organization and creates strong incentives for other countries to adopt tough environmental protections.

Finally, we will develop a mechanism to protect businesses -- and ultimately consumers -- from increases in energy prices. The central element is the establishment of a floor and a ceiling for the cost of emission allowances. This will also safeguard important industries while they make the investments necessary to join the clean-energy era. We recognize there will be short-term transition costs associated with any climate change legislation, costs that can be eased. But we also believe strongly that the long-term gain will be enormous.

Even climate change skeptics should recognize that reducing our dependence on foreign oil and increasing our energy efficiency strengthens our national security. Both of us served in the military. We know that sending nearly $800 million a day to sometimes-hostile oil-producing countries threatens our security. In the same way, many scientists warn that failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will lead to global instability and poverty that could put our nation at risk.

Failure to act comes with another cost. If Congress does not pass legislation dealing with climate change, the administration will use the Environmental Protection Agency to impose new regulations. Imposed regulations are likely to be tougher and they certainly will not include the job protections and investment incentives we are proposing.

The message to those who have stalled for years is clear: killing a Senate bill is not success; indeed, given the threat of agency regulation, those who have been content to make the legislative process grind to a halt would later come running to Congress in a panic to secure the kinds of incentives and investments we can pass today. Industry needs the certainty that comes with Congressional action.

We are confident that a legitimate bipartisan effort can put America back in the lead again and can empower our negotiators to sit down at the table in Copenhagen in December and insist that the rest of the world join us in producing a new international agreement on global warming. That way, we will pass on to future generations a strong economy, a clean environment and an energy-independent nation."

On one wall of the Arts Exchange here, humorous depictions of arctic animals in the midst of global warming include a polar bear playing a grand piano while drifting on a melting glacier. On another wall, a comic strip has a family of four struggling to find a suitable vacation spot as temperature swings turn ordinarily moderate locales into burning-hot and freezing-cold destinations.

First shown at the 2008 Fumetto Internationales Comix-Festival, the illustrations are part of an exhibition, through Nov. 10, in the Grand Banking Room of the Arts Exchange, the headquarters of ArtsWestchester.

"" 'Fumetto' is the Italian word for comics,"" said Janet Langsam, executive director of ArtsWestchester. ""Literally translated, it means 'little puff of smoke' and refers to the speech bubbles, or balloons, that contain the dialogue in a comic strip.""

Compelling because of their artistic vision, narrative voice and humor, fumetti have long been a popular form of creative expression in many European countries. While similar to American comic books in that they tell a story over a series of frames, fumetti are known for addressing social and political issues.

The nine fumetti on display at the Arts Exchange are reproductions of the winning entries chosen from works submitted by about 1,000 artists and illustrators, representing 30 countries, in the 2008 fumetto festival.

The festival, which has been held in Lucerne, Switzerland, for 18 years, is the largest comics competition in Europe. Each year, contestants are asked to create comics addressing a specific theme, and in 2008 it was climate change. The festival was sponsored by Swiss Re, an international reinsurance company, which is also sponsoring the Arts Exchange exhibition.

In addition to the competition winners, the gallery is displaying the work of two Westchester artists who answered an open call to create and submit comics illustrations on the same theme. One of them, Adam Zucker, from Ardsley, responded with several pieces, including ""Melt,"" an acrylic-on-canvas painting that depicts a crying glacier. Among the works by the other artist, Mike D'Ariano of White Plains, is an acrylic-and-marker painting on canvas called ""Hummer,"" showing a bright yellow S.U.V. siphoning the life out of a bare tree. His painting ""Lower"" depicts the earth heating up in a microwave oven.

""I think of fumetto as serious comics, or comics with a twist of irony,"" Ms. Langsam said. ""In substance and content, fumetto are different than the comics we're used to seeing in the United States. They might look similar, but they're not meant to be Superman and Lois Lane.""

Ms. Langsam said she hoped the exhibition would open a dialogue about climate change and sustainability. ""It's definitely a great way to address serious topics,"" she said, ""using humor and inventiveness to get our attention in a way that statistics can't."" LAURA JOSEPH MOGIL

As world leaders struggle to hash out a new global climate deal by December, they face a hurdle perhaps more formidable than getting big polluters like the United States and China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions: how to pay for the new accord.

The price tag for a new climate agreement will be a staggering $100 billion a year by 2020, many economists estimate; some put the cost at closer to $1 trillion. That money is needed to help fast-developing countries like India and Brazil convert to costly but cleaner technologies as they industrialize, as well as to assist the poorest countries in coping with the consequences of climate change, like droughts and rising seas.

This financing is an essential part of any international climate agreement, negotiators and scientists say, because developing nations must curb the growth of their emissions if the world is to limit rising temperatures. Based on calculations by the International Energy Agency for 2005 to 2030, 75 percent of the growth in energy demand will come from the developing world.

Many developing countries have made it clear that they will not sign a treaty unless they get money to help them adapt to a warmer planet. Acknowledging that a new treaty needs unanimity for success, industrialized nations like the United States and those in Europe have agreed in principle to make such payments; they have already been written into the agreed-upon structure of the treaty, to be signed in Copenhagen in December.

But to date there is no concrete strategy to raise such huge sums. There is not even agreement about which nations should pay or in what proportion.

""The level of ambition in funding is not matching up to the sense of urgency everyone now has,"" said Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado, the lead climate negotiator for Brazil, which hopes to get financing to preserve its rain forest.

He added, ""Financing and an inadequate level of financing are a deal breaker for us.""

At a United Nations summit meeting in New York on climate change and at the Group of 20 meetings in Pittsburgh last month, national leaders, including President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China, stressed the urgency of combating climate change. But they offered no new proposals for financing and put no new cash on the table.

Perhaps even more troublesome, the United Nations Adaptation Fund, which officially began operating in 2008 to help poor countries finance projects to blunt the effects of global warming, remains an empty shell, largely because rich nations have failed to come through with the donations they promised. The fund now holds about $18 million, a tiny fraction of what it was supposed to have, according to fund officials.

United Nations officials regard the failure to come up with financing as a blind spot that jeopardizes a new global treaty.

""How important is this? It is critical,"" said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which oversees the treaty negotiations.

The United States and other industrialized nations will certainly have to contribute heavily to any financing program. But the global recession has tightened purse strings, and nations are having trouble backing their good intentions and previous pledges with cash.

The money woes of the United Nations fund, set up as an exemplar of international cooperation in addressing climate change, are symptomatic. The fund was supposed to benefit from two income streams: the first is a 2 percent tax on carbon credits sold in the United Nations carbon trading system, in which rich nations invest in green projects in the developing world to offset emissions at home; the second is voluntary donations by richer countries.

The 2 percent tax is expected to generate at least $1.6 billion by 2012. But the donations have not materialized, Mr. de Boer said.

A number of proposals are on the table to generate money to help developing countries rein in future emissions as well as to adapt to the effects of climate change. But most remain far from producing money.

In September, the European Union offered a plan in which ""industrialized nations and economically more advanced developing countries"" would provide $33 billion to $74 billion a year to help poor countries adapt, with the European Union's share placed at $3 billion to $22 billion. The climate bill passed by the House in the United States in June would auction emissions permits, and donate a portion of revenues to help poor countries. The climate legislation is now before the Senate.

Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister of climate and energy, who will be chairwoman of the Copenhagen meeting, recently suggested imposing a new tax on shipping fuel or on airline flights -- which both cause substantial emissions -- to finance adaptation in poor countries.

""We need more innovative financing,"" Ms. Hedegaard said in an interview. ""The G-20 should come up with fast-track financing that would send a very strong signal that developed countries are serious about this.""

Many poor countries say they are increasingly skeptical, having witnessed the way past promises evaporated when the economy soured. They are likewise nervous about market-based solutions, like using a portion of revenues from carbon credits.

""Developing countries are not convinced that the market will find them the $100 billion they need,"" said Mr. Figueiredo Machado, Brazil's climate negotiator. ""They want guarantees.""

When Germany and France suggested at a recent Group of 20 meeting in London that they would contribute to the fund by reducing other types of aid, India rebelled. Financing to help poor countries adapt to climate change or to reduce emissions ""should not be at the cost of other monetary support,"" said Pranab Mukherjee, India's finance minister.

Equally contentious is the issue of which countries should give, and which should receive. Should the contributors be only industrialized nations, or should they include rapidly developing -- and increasingly wealthy -- polluters like China?

Xie Zhenhua, the lead Chinese climate negotiator, speaking at a news conference in New York last month, said the United Nations should not expect China to pay.

""Global warming is a result of CO2 from developed countries during their industrialization,"" Mr. Xie said. ""China is one of the countries that has borne the brunt of that.""

"Foreign, Thursday, October 15, 2009 1284 mots, p. A 1",,BY DEGREES,,,"By ANDREW C. REVKIN and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Andrew C. Revkin reported from New York and Farmington, N.M., and Clifford Krauss from Franklin, Tex. Andrew E. Kramer contributed reporting from Moscow.

To the naked eye, there was nothing to be seen at a natural gas well in eastern Texas but beige pipes and tanks baking in the sun.

But in the viewfinder of Terry Gosney's infrared camera, three black plumes of gas gushed through leaks that were otherwise invisible.

""Holy smoke, it's blowing like mad,"" said Mr. Gosney, an environmental field coordinator for EnCana, the Canadian gas producer that operates the year-old well near Franklin, Tex. ""It does look nasty.""

Within a few days the leaks had been sealed by workers.

Efforts like EnCana's save energy and money. Yet they are also a cheap, effective way of blunting climate change that could potentially be replicated thousands of times over, from Wyoming to Siberia, energy experts say. Natural gas consists almost entirely of methane, a potent heat-trapping gas that scientists say accounts for as much as a third of the human contribution to global warming.

""This for me is an absolute no-brainer, even more so than putting in those compact fluorescent bulbs in your house,"" said Al Armendariz, an engineer at Southern Methodist University who studies pollutants from oil and gas fields.

Acting quickly to stanch the loss of methane could substantially cut warming in the short run, even as countries tackle the tougher challenge of cutting the dominant greenhouse emission, carbon dioxide, studies by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggest.

Unlike carbon dioxide, which can remain in the atmosphere a century or more once released, methane persists in the air for about 10 years. So aggressively reining in emissions now would mean that far less of the gas would be warming the earth in a decade or so.

Methane is also a valuable target because while it is far rarer and more fleeting than carbon dioxide, ton for ton, it traps 25 times as much heat, researchers say.

Yet while federal and international programs have encouraged companies to seek and curb methane emissions from gas and oil wells, pipelines and tanks, aggressive efforts like EnCana's are still far from the industry norm.

As a result, some three trillion cubic feet of methane leak into the air every year, with Russia and the United States the leading sources, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's official estimate. (This amount has the warming power of emissions from over half the coal plants in the United States.) And government scientists and industry officials caution that the real figure is almost certainly higher.

Unless monitoring is greatly expanded, they say, such emissions could soar as global production of natural gas increases over the next few decades.

The Energy Department projects that gas production could rise nearly 50 percent over the next 20 years as companies race to discover and tap new sources. In the United States, 4,000 miles of new pipeline was laid last year alone.

But the industry has been largely resistant to an aggressive cleanup.

The Bush administration, which opposed mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions, expanded an existing voluntary domestic program for capturing methane emissions and began a related international program -- with both aimed at promoting profitable ways for businesses to cut methane emissions as a relatively easy first step to combat climate change.

In April the Obama administration signaled that it could adopt rules requiring the biggest American companies to report all of their greenhouse gas emissions. Oil and gas industry groups countered that the cost and complexity of dealing with some 700,000 wells were too great.

In September the E.P.A. announced that the obligatory reporting would begin in 2011 but that it excluded oil and gas operations, at least for the time being. (Agency officials say they plan to issue rules for oil and gas by late next year.)

Some scientists reject the industry arguments. ""Further delay on finding and stopping such releases would be irresponsible, given the financial and environmental benefits,"" said F. Sherwood Rowland, a Nobel laureate in chemistry at the University of California, Irvine.

Internationally, the amount of methane escaping from gas and oil operations can be only crudely gauged. But in 2006 the E.P.A. estimated that Russia, the world's largest gas producer, ranked highest, with 427 billion cubic feet of methane escaping annually, followed by the United States at 346 billion, Ukraine at 225 billion and Mexico at 191 billion.

Reflecting the uncertainty in such estimates, Gazprom, Russia's giant state gas monopoly, estimated its annual emissions at half that figure last year.

An E.P.A. review of methane emissions from gas wells in the United States strongly implies that all of these figures may be too low. In its analysis, the E.P.A. concluded that the amount emitted by routine operations at gas wells -- not including leaks like those seen near Franklin -- is 12 times the agency's longtime estimate of nine billion cubic feet. In heat-trapping potential, that new estimate equals the carbon dioxide emitted annually by eight million cars.

In the routine operations, great yet invisible plumes of gas enter the atmosphere when new wells are activated, old wells are invigorated to boost gas flows and wells are purged of fluids by letting out cough-like bursts of gas.

In many gas fields, said Roger Fernandez, a senior methane expert at the E.P.A., fluid-clogged wells are still purged the old-fashioned way, by opening valves or using outdated equipment in ways that release a misty burst of gas directly into the air.

For the E.P.A. and environmental scientists, the challenge is convincing gas and oil producers here and abroad that efforts to avoid such releases often more than pay for themselves.

The use of infrared cameras is expanding as word spreads of the payoff in saved gas, said Ben Shepperd, executive vice president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, which represents 1,200 companies in the oil and gas business around West Texas.

""We would like to see more people doing it,"" he said. ""People are very surprised when they shoot their equipment with these cameras and they see that there are releases in places they wouldn't have expected.""

The benefits are there not only for gas producers but also for companies handling oil. Thousands of oil storage tanks emit plumes of methane and other gases, said Larry S. Richards, the president of Hy-Bon Engineering in Midland, Tex., which is using infrared cameras to survey storage tanks in 29 countries and sells systems that capture the gas.

A clearer view of the worst methane emissions could come next year, when Japan plans to start releasing data from Gosat, a satellite that began orbiting the Earth in January. It may be able to identify the top hot spots within a few miles.

That may increase pressure on countries with particularly large leaks.

As the biggest methane emitter, Russia has begun seeking high-tech solutions. In April, for example, Gazprom, the Russian Defense Ministry and an Israeli aerospace company began discussing the potential use of miniature remotely piloted helicopters to monitor pipelines for leaks.

But gadgets alone will not halt the vast exhalation of methane from Russia, environmentalists say. There is some hope that a successor to the 1997 Kyoto climate change pact will include more incentives for money to flow to Russian methane-reduction projects.

Western companies that have captured methane pointout the money that is often to be made by doing so.

Starting around 2000, BP began introducing methane-catching techniques at 2,300 well sites in New Mexico. At well after well, gas that would have otherwise escaped now flows through meters that field crews affectionately call the ""cash register.""

Among other actions, BP engineers have fine-tuned a system for purging fluids that can stop up wells. The process uses the pressure of gas in the well to periodically raise a plunger through the vertical well pipe. This removes the liquids but typically allows gas to escape.

The new computerized process, which BP calls smart automation, tracks well pressure and other conditions to more precisely time the plunger cycles in ways that avoid gas emissions. From 2000 to 2004, emissions from BP wells in the region dropped 50 percent, the company says. By 2007, they had essentially ended.

On average, installing the systems has cost about $11,000 per well, but they have returned three times that investment, said Reid Smith, an environmental adviser for BP working on the project.

""We spend a lot of money to get gas to the surface,"" Mr. Smith said. ""It makes a huge amount of sense to get all of it through the sales meter.""

"Business/Financial, Monday, October 19, 2009 1007 mots, p. A 1",,Energy Firms Find No Unity On Climate Bill,"By JOHN BRODER and JAD MOUAWAD; John Broder reported from Washington, and Jad Mouawad from New York. Clifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.",,"WASHINGTON - As the Senate prepares to tackle global warming, the nation's energy producers, once united, are battling one another over policy decisions worth hundreds of billions of dollars in coming decades.

Producers of natural gas are battling their erstwhile allies, the oil companies. Electrical utilities are fighting among themselves over the use of coal versus wind power or other renewable energy. Coal companies are battling natural gas firms over which should be used to produce electricity. And the renewable power industry is elbowing for advantage against all of them.

Some supporters of global warming legislation believe that the division in the once-monolithic oil and gas industry, as well as other splits among energy producers, could improve the prospects for the legislation.

""It's much harder to pass clean-energy legislation when big oil and other energy interests are united in their opposition,"" said Daniel J. Weiss, climate policy director at the liberal Center for American Progress. ""The companies that recognize the economic benefits in the bill can help bring along their political supporters.""

The American Petroleum Institute trade group, dominated by major oil companies, opposes the legislation, saying it would discourage domestic exploration and lead to higher oil prices. But some natural gas companies, though longtime members of the institute, have formed a separate lobby and are working actively with the bill's sponsors to cut a better deal for their product.

The proposal moving through Congress would cap the emissions of greenhouse gases each year and allow companies to buy and sell permits to pollute. That approach, known as cap and trade, is meant to guarantee that emissions will decline, while providing market incentives for companies to invest in low-carbon technologies.

The measure would effectively put a price on carbon, raising the prospect that some energy producers might have to pay more than others. For that reason, billions of dollars could be at stake in some of the most arcane language in the bill.

Energy lobbies are using every tactic in the book to protect their industries, producing alarming studies about $5 gasoline and other steep cost increases that might result from a cap-and-trade system. They are also financing protest groups and advertising campaigns. In one case, a public relations firm working for the coal industry even sent opposition letters to Congress under forged names.

The divisions in the energy sector mirror a split in the broader business community. Several large companies like Apple and the utility Exelon left the United States Chamber of Commerce recently over the group's opposition to climate change legislation.

But the biggest fights are among energy producers. They have spent more than $200 million in the first half of the year on lobbying efforts in Washington, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group, up from $174 million in the same period last year.

""The fact that the lobbying is so fast and so furious is a positive sign that this thing is moving along,"" said Mark Brownstein, a managing director at the Environmental Defense Fund and an advocate of climate legislation. ""The fact that everyone is rushing to Washington tells you people believe it is real.""

As legislation inches through Capitol Hill, onetime allies in the utility sector, like Exelon, which operates low-emission nuclear plants, and the Southern Company, a big consumer of coal, find themselves on opposite sides of the debate over renewable energy.

Utilities that have access to hydroelectric power or operate nuclear plants tend to favor a national mandate to increase the use of renewable power, because their carbon emissions are relatively low. Many coal-dependent utilities, particularly in the Southeast and Midwest, oppose the provision because they emit more carbon and would have to buy more permits over time.

In past energy policy debates, the oil and gas lobbies were largely united. In 2005, they won incentives for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Two years later, after Democrats had taken control of Congress, producers were unable to block a huge new mandate for alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel, but managed to save valuable oil industry tax breaks that some Democrats tried to end.

Today, each energy subsector, fearing any legislation that might give it a disadvantage, is battling for favor. The gas producers, for example, have formed the American Natural Gas Alliance, which is spending heavily on advertising and lobbying to point out that gas emits roughly half the carbon dioxide of coal. The group has also helped organize its allies in Congress into a new natural gas caucus, with two dozen members.

""These fissures are happening because a policy is increasingly seen as inevitable,"" said David G. Victor, an energy expert at the University of California, San Diego. ""Old coalitions are splintering and fascinating new alliances are being formed.""

The most important fight is over whether companies have to buy pollution permits, called allowances, or whether the government hands them out free in the early years to help ease the cost of the transition.

President Obama has said the permits should be auctioned, an approach that would cost companies tens of billions of dollars. But after fierce lobbying from electrical utilities, the House made the permits free in the first decade of the program, to help finance the transition to cleaner fuels and to shield electrical consumers from higher prices.

Industry analysts say the utilities' willingness to negotiate with Democratic lawmakers gained them a huge advantage when the House passed its climate bill in June. The oil and natural gas industries, by contrast, felt shunned in the House debate because they would not negotiate, these analysts say.

For example, oil companies complained that their mandated purchase of emissions permits would amount to a tax to be used to clean up dirty coal plants.

""There was an inherent flaw when Congress set off down the road of favoring one fuel source over another,"" said J. Larry Nichols, chairman of Devon Energy, an independent oil and gas company, and also chairman of the American Petroleum Institute. ""You knew there had to be a feeding frenzy among various competing fuels trying to protect themselves.""

Half of the nation's electrical power is generated by burning coal, and emission limits are a long-term threat to the business. The coal industry, through a group it finances called the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, is running a campaign to persuade the public that coal is affordable, abundant and can be cleaned up thanks to still-distant technology that would capture carbon emissions and store them underground.

Some coal executives aim to scuttle legislation in the Senate by continuing to cast doubts on the science of climate change.

""A lot of coal-using utilities seem to be on the wrong side of this issue,"" said Don L. Blankenship, the chief executive of Massey Energy, the largest producer of Appalachian coal, who has called climate legislation a hoax and a Ponzi scheme. ""How can they be so confident that man is changing the world climate?"""
"Foreign, Tuesday, October 20, 2009 380 mots, p. A 4",,Officials Hint At Progress Negotiating Climate Deal,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"A two-day meeting of officials from countries responsible for the bulk of the world's greenhouse gas emissions ended Monday in London with hints that rich and developing nations might be able to bridge at least some of their differences on issues hobbling agreement on a new climate treaty.

The session was the sixth in a string of informal meetings of ""major economies"" -- 16 countries plus the European Union -- initiated by the Obama administration last spring.

The meetings, building on an earlier series of sessions started by the Bush administration, focused on the world's biggest emitters of heat-trapping gases to build momentum toward a new climate treaty when formal negotiations take place in December in Copenhagen.

At a news conference after the meeting, officials from the United States and Britain rejected the idea that a deadline set by the world's countries to negotiate a new climate agreement by December would slip.

Todd Stern, the State Department's special envoy on climate change, said all major countries were committed to seeking ""a strong, pragmatic and solid agreement"" in Copenhagen.

Echoing Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for energy and climate and the chairman of the London session, Mr. Stern added: ""We're not really thinking about a Plan B in that sense.""

Mr. Stern also rejected criticisms by environmental groups and some recent statements from officials in developing countries that the United States was not doing enough to cut emissions at home. While accepting that the United States has the most responsibility for the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere so far, he emphasized that by 2030, two-thirds of emissions could easily be coming from developing countries.

Citing actions by President Obama and in Congress, where climate change and energy legislation is creeping forward, Mr. Stern added that from now on, ""The effort by the United States will be absolutely comparable to what the E.U. is doing.""

Mr. Miliband said there was growing accord among nations at the meeting on the level of aid required to help poor countries withstand threats resulting from climate change and adopt less-polluting energy technology. He also reported some progress on findings ways to incorporate what would surely be varied commitments by individual countries into an overarching pact.

""I think we've made progress on the architecture,"" he said. In a communique posted online, the participating governments said they would publish a list of actions and partnerships on clean energy technology on Nov. 15.

In a speech preceding the final round of talks on Monday, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain admonished attendees to aim for concrete commitments on cutting emissions and on aid for poor countries most exposed to the risks of warming.

But he also said that all factions in the complicated effort would need to be flexible. ""We cannot compromise with the catastrophe of unchecked climate change, so we must compromise with one another,"" he said."
"Foreign, Wednesday, October 21, 2009 825 mots, p. A 13",,"As Time Runs Short for Global Climate Treaty, Nations May Settle for Interim Steps",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - With the clock running out and deep differences unresolved, it now appears that there is little chance that international climate change negotiations in Copenhagen in December will produce a comprehensive and binding new treaty on global warming.

The United States and many other major pollutant-emitting countries have concluded that it is more useful to take incremental but important steps toward a global agreement rather than to try to jam through a treaty that is either too weak to address the problem or too onerous to be ratified and enforced.

Instead, representatives at the Copenhagen meeting are likely to announce a number of interim steps and agree to keep talking next year.

""There isn't sufficient time to get the whole thing done,"" Yvo De Boer, the Dutch diplomat who leads the United Nations climate secretariat and oversees the negotiations, said late last week. ""But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year.""

Negotiators have accepted as all but inevitable that representatives of the 192 nations in the talks will not resolve the outstanding issues in the time remaining before the Copenhagen conference opens in December. The gulf between rich and poor nations, and even among the wealthiest nations, is just too wide.

Representatives of the 16 largest emitting countries and the European Union, who concluded a meeting in London on Monday, said that they had made progress on the level of aid needed to help poor countries adapt to climate change and adopt less-polluting energy technology.

They also said they had settled some questions on the ""architecture"" of any agreement reached in Copenhagen, while acknowledging that it would fall short of a binding treaty.

Yet expectations remain high for a meeting that carries important weight not just for the environment but for a broad range of international issues, including trade, security, economic development, energy production, technology sharing and the survival of some vulnerable island nations.

So officials are now narrowing expectations and defining the areas where there is agreement, such as the need to halt and then reverse the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, although how and by which nations remain the subjects of intense dispute. Negotiators are also discussing what form any declaration that emerges from Copenhagen might take and how to ensure that any promises made there are kept.

Among the chief barriers to a comprehensive deal in Copenhagen is Congress's inability to enact climate and energy legislation that sets binding targets on greenhouse gases in the United States. Without such a commitment, other nations are loath to make their own pledges.

The chief American climate negotiator, Todd Stern, has said that he will not go beyond what Congress is willing to endorse. His deputy, Jonathan Pershing, affirmed this last week at a negotiators' meeting in Bangkok. ""We are not going to be part of an agreement we cannot meet,"" Mr. Pershing said.

Administration officials and Congressional leaders have said that final legislative action on a climate bill would not occur before the first half of next year.

European officials have been pressing hardest for some form of binding treaty modeled on the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which the United States refused to ratify because, American officials said, it imposed emissions limits on developed nations while demanding nothing of rapidly growing economies like China and India.

American officials have said that no agreement in Copenhagen is better than a bad deal that cannot be ratified or enforced. And they note that it took four years after the initial negotiation of the Kyoto accord to complete it.

There is general agreement among international negotiators and knowledgeable observers that the parties to the Copenhagen talks, held under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, will agree to continue discussions next year, and perhaps set a deadline for reaching a final agreement by midyear or December 2010 at the latest.

The rest of the outcome, even the form it may take, remains uncertain. The world's biggest economies agreed at a meeting last summer in L'Aquila, Italy, on a goal of limiting global temperature increases to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above current levels, though they did not agree on the means to get there or on how to enforce it. Such a goal is expected to be part of any declaration from Copenhagen.

Also likely to be included is a statement that wealthy nations should cut their emissions below certain benchmarks and that emerging economies should reduce their rate of emissions growth below a business-as-usual curve. No numbers were attached to either of these pledges, and that remains the stickiest of issues.

Another unresolved issue is the financial structure of any international climate accord. The wealthy nations have agreed in principle to support low-carbon growth in the developing world and to help those countries hardest hit by climate change to adapt. But the amounts of money, the programs and the countries that would qualify for that support and for cost-sharing among donor nations are highly contentious issues unlikely to be settled in Copenhagen.

There will probably also be a promise to create an international system to monitor, report and verify emissions reductions, although there is no consensus yet on who would perform these tasks and what penalties would be assessed for failure to comply.

There is also likely to be a commitment by most nations to produce and publish economic growth plans based on lower carbon emissions and an agreement by advanced nations to share clean new energy technology with developing countries.

""The most likely form any agreement will take will be a political declaration,"" said Nigel Purvis, a former State Department climate negotiator in the administrations of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

""It could be a statement by senior leaders, or it could be adopted by the parties as a formal decision,"" he said. ""That does not make it legally binding, but it sends a signal to the world of the direction the negotiations are going and give guidance to negotiators as they continue their work."""
"Foreign, Friday, October 23, 2009 402 mots, p. A 6",,China and U.S. Try to Speed Climate Strategy,By MICHAEL WINES,,"BEIJING - Senior American and Chinese officials urged their governments on Thursday to accelerate joint efforts to reduce pollution, even as their diplomats appeared at odds over crucial elements of a global strategy to fight climate change to be considered in Copenhagen in December.

The calls for cooperation, led by Vice Premier Li Keqiang, came at a clean-energy forum attended by nearly 200 of both nations' leading experts on climate change issues and technologies. The forum's primary goal is to devise new ways in which Chinese and American researchers, corporations and others can work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

But with the Copenhagen conference barely 45 days away, one subtext was to build momentum for closer collaboration between the world's two biggest producers of greenhouse gases. Negotiations toward a new global climate change agreement have been hobbled by disagreements between China and the United States over whether curbing climate change should be principally the developed world's duty and how much money and technology rich nations should give developing nations to help them cut greenhouse gases.

The prospect that Copenhagen may not produce a landmark accord increases the need for Beijing and Washington to move quickly on their own, officials and analysts here suggested.

""What China has going on now is real, it's substantial,"" Barbara Finamore, the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's China Clean Energy Program, said in an interview on Thursday.

While avoiding binding themselves to reduce carbon emissions by any set level, the Chinese have emerged among the world's leaders in wind, water, solar and nuclear power.

But experts say China needs Western technology to make further advances. The Chinese underscored their desire for more cooperation by sending Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to the forum's opening session Wednesday evening for a private meeting with the conference's leaders.

""He started the meeting by saying: 'We want to have a real meeting, not a meeting in form. I want to hear your ideas,' "" said John L. Thornton, chairman of the Brookings Institution.

Brookings, a private Washington research organization, is holding the clean-energy forum in conjunction with the China Institute of Strategy and Management, a government-sponsored research organization in Beijing.

At Thursday's session, Mr. Li, the vice premier, called on the two governments to engage in ""strategic and practical cooperation"" on a range of environmental issues, from improving energy conservation and efficiency to developing clean-coal technology. He was echoed by David Sandalow, the American assistant energy secretary for international affairs. In a speech to the conference, Mr. Sandalow said each side continued to be dogged by suspicions of the other's motives.

At the same time, however, Chinese and American experts alike agreed that willingness to collaborate on climate-change issues, from sharing research to starting joint business ventures, grew significantly in the past year. The vice chairman of China's National Energy Administration, Wu Yin, said the relationship with Washington on clean energy issues ""has been elevated to a new level."""
"Foreign, Friday, October 23, 2009 1034 mots, p. A 6",,BY DEGREES,,,"By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

STOCKHOLM - Shopping for oatmeal, Helena Bergstrom, 37, admitted that she was flummoxed by the label on the blue box reading, ""Climate declared: .87 kg CO2 per kg of product.""

""Right now, I don't know what this means,"" said Ms. Bergstrom, a pharmaceutical company employee.

But if a new experiment here succeeds, she and millions of other Swedes will soon find out. New labels listing the carbon dioxide emissions associated with the production of foods, from whole wheat pasta to fast food burgers, are appearing on some grocery items and restaurant menus around the country.

People who live to eat might dismiss this as silly. But changing one's diet can be as effective in reducing emissions of climate-changing gases as changing the car one drives or doing away with the clothes dryer, scientific experts say.

""We're the first to do it, and it's a new way of thinking for us,"" said Ulf Bohman, head of the Nutrition Department at the Swedish National Food Administration, which was given the task last year of creating new food guidelines giving equal weight to climate and health. ""We're used to thinking about safety and nutrition as one thing and environmental as another.""

Some of the proposed new dietary guidelines, released over the summer, may seem startling to the uninitiated. They recommend that Swedes favor carrots over cucumbers and tomatoes, for example. (Unlike carrots, the latter two must be grown in heated greenhouses here, consuming energy.)

They are not counseled to eat more fish, despite the health benefits, because Europe's stocks are depleted.

And somewhat less surprisingly, they are advised to substitute beans or chicken for red meat, in view of the heavy greenhouse gas emissions associated with raising cattle.

""For consumers, it's hard,"" Mr. Bohman acknowledged. ""You are getting environmental advice that you have to coordinate with, 'How can I eat healthier?' ""

Many Swedish diners say it is just too much to ask. ""I wish I could say that the information has made me change what I eat, but it hasn't,"" said Richard Lalander, 27, who was eating a Max hamburger (1.7 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions) in the shadow of a menu board revealing that a chicken sandwich (0.4 kilograms) would have been better for the planet.

Yet if the new food guidelines were religiously heeded, some experts say, Sweden could cut its emissions from food production by 20 to 50 percent. An estimated 25 percent of the emissions produced by people in industrialized nations can be traced to the food they eat, according to recent research here. And foods vary enormously in the emissions released in their production.

While today's American or European shoppers may be well versed in checking for nutrients, calories or fat content, they often have little idea of whether eating tomatoes, chicken or rice is good or bad for the climate.

Complicating matters, the emissions impact of, say, a carrot, can vary by a factor of 10, depending how and where it is grown.

Earlier studies of food emissions focused on the high environmental costs of transporting food and raising cattle. But more nuanced research shows that the emissions depend on many factors, including the type of soil used to grow the food and whether a dairy farmer uses local rapeseed or imported soy for cattle feed.

Business groups, farming cooperatives and organic labeling programs as well as the government have gamely come up with coordinated ways to identify food choices.

Max, Sweden's largest homegrown chain of burger restaurants, now puts emissions calculations next to each item on its menu boards. Lantmannen, Sweden's largest farming group, has begun placing precise labels on some categories of foods in grocery stores, including chicken, oatmeal, barley and pasta.

Consumers who pay attention may learn that emissions generated by growing the nation's most popular grain, rice, are two to three times those of little-used barley, for example.

Some producers argue that the new programs are overly complex and threaten profits. The dietary recommendations, which are being circulated for comment not just in Sweden but across the European Union, have been attacked by the Continent's meat industry, Norwegian salmon farmers and Malaysian palm oil growers, to name a few.

""This is trial and error; we're still trying to see what works,"" Mr. Bohman said.

Next year, KRAV, Scandinavia's main organic certification program, will start requiring farmers to convert to low-emissions techniques if they want to display its coveted seal on products, meaning that most greenhouse tomatoes can no longer be called organic.

Those standards have stirred some protests. ""There are farmers who are happy and farmers who say they are being ruined,"" said Johan Cejie, manager of climate issues for KRAV.

For example, he said, farmers with high concentrations of peat soil on their property may no longer be able to grow carrots, since plowing peat releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide; to get the organic label, they may have to switch to feed crops that require no plowing.

Next year KRAV will require hothouses to use biofuels for heating. Dairy farms will have to obtain at least 70 percent of the food for their herds locally; many previously imported cheap soy from Brazil, generating transport emissions and damaging the rain forest as trees were cleared to make way for farmland.

The Swedish effort grew out of a 2005 study by Sweden's national environmental agency on how personal consumption generates emissions. Researchers found that 25 percent of national per capita emissions -- two metric tons per year -- was attributable to eating.

The government realized that encouraging a diet that tilted more toward chicken or vegetables and educating farmers on lowering emissions generally could have an enormous impact.

Sweden has been a world leader in finding new ways to reduce emissions. It has vowed to eliminate the use of fossil fuel for electricity by 2020 and cars that run on gasoline by 2030.

To arrive at numbers for their company's first carbon dioxide labels, scientists at Lantmannen analyzed life cycles of 20 products. These take into account emissions generated by fertilizer, fuel for harvesting machinery, packaging and transport.

They decided to examine one representative product in each category -- say, pasta -- rather than performing analyses for fusilli versus penne, or one brand versus another. ""Every climate declaration is hugely time-intensive,"" said Claes Johansson, Lantmannen's director of sustainability.

A new generation of Swedish business leaders is stepping up to the climate challenge. Richard Bergfors, president of Max, his family's burger chain, voluntarily hired a consultant to calculate its carbon footprint; 75 percent was created by its meat.

""We decided to be honest and put it all out there and say we'll do everything we can to reduce,"" said Mr. Bergfors, 40. In addition to putting emissions data on the menu, Max eliminated boxes from its children's meals, installed low-energy LED lights and pays for wind-generated electricity.

Since the emissions counts started appearing on the menu, sales of climate-friendly items have risen 20 percent. Still, plenty of people head to a burger restaurant lusting only for a burger.

Kristian Eriksson, 26, an information technology specialist, looked embarrassed when asked about the burger he was eating at an outdoor table.

""You feel guilty picking red meat,"" he said.

"National, Sunday, October 25, 2009 539 mots, p. A 16",,Senate Global Warming Bill Is Seeking to Cushion the Impact on Industry,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The Senate bill aimed at reducing global warming pollution will initially grant billions of dollars of free emissions permits to utilities and industry but will require the bulk of the money be returned to consumers and taxpayers, according to newly released details.

The bill will also provide a cushion to energy-intensive manufacturing companies to ease the transition to a lower-carbon economy and to help them compete internationally, although the subsidies will disappear over time. The measure also sets a floor and ceiling on the price of permits to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

With these and other changes considered, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that overall cost of the bill at roughly $100 a year per household, similar to that of a House climate change and energy bill passed in June.

The Senate measure, sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under a cap-and-trade system that sets a nationwide limit on emissions but allows polluters to buy and sell permits to meet it.

The bill's targets for overall emissions reductions are 20 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050. The House bill's limits are similar, except the target for 2020 was set at 17 percent after negotiations with utilities and other major sources of emissions.

Senators Kerry and Boxer introduced their bill in late September with a number of missing provisions. They filled in those blanks late Friday with a more detailed 923-page draft that spells out the formula for distributing pollution allowances and other provisions.

The latest version includes new financing for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, more money for low-carbon transportation projects, additional assistance for rural communities and more favorable treatment for agriculture and forestry.

""We've reached another milestone as we move to a clean energy future,"" Mrs. Boxer said in a statement, ""creating millions of jobs and protecting our children from dangerous pollution.""

The bill is before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which Mrs. Boxer leads. The panel has scheduled three days of hearings next week and has tentatively set markup to begin the following week.

The E.P.A. analysis of the Kerry-Boxer bill found that its costs and impact were roughly equivalent to those of the House bill, which was sponsored by Democratic Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. The two bills would reduce overall American emissions by nearly the same amount over the next 40 years. The costs to consumers are also similar, the agency found.

Neither bill would add to the federal deficit and both measures could actually produce some revenue from the sale of emissions permits, the agency found.

The E.P.A. did not try to quantify the benefits to individuals or society of reducing greenhouse gas pollution.

Other studies have found higher costs, although all such estimates are based on assumptions about how businesses and consumers would behave as energy costs rise and how quickly new technology would appear to replace increasingly costly fossil fuels.

Senate Republicans dismissed the E.P.A. analysis as incomplete and have threatened to boycott committee action until a more thorough analysis is done.

""It's not unreasonable to demand that a committee, prior to legislative hearings, would actually have the bill in question with adequate time for review and analysis,"" said Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the Senate environment committee.

""On top of that,"" added Mr. Inhofe, who is a global warming skeptic, ""one would think that, prior to legislative hearings, the committee would have a thorough, comprehensive economic analysis to understand how an 900-plus page bill, designed to fundamentally reshape the American economy, affects consumers, small businesses, farmers and American families."""
"National, Wednesday, October 28, 2009 610 mots, p. A 19",,Administration Increases Urgency on Climate Change,"By JOHN M. BRODER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Arcadia, Fla., and David Stout from Washington.",,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration and some Senate Democrats expressed fresh urgency on Tuesday about the need to address climate change and refashion the nation's energy economy.

But they faced determined opposition from Republicans, new concerns from some Democrats and reminders of the financial, technological and political hurdles in remaking the way the nation produces and consumes power.

In a Senate hearing on a new climate change and energy bill and in coordinated appearances by President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the administration promoted measures to cap greenhouse gas emissions and support new means of fueling homes and vehicles with far less carbon dioxide intensity. Mr. Obama appeared at a solar energy installation in Florida and Mr. Biden at an auto plant in Delaware that will produce electric vehicles, talking about the potential of alternative energy to create jobs.

On Capitol Hill, five senior administration officials appeared before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to speak in support of a bill to address global warming and encourage development of nonpolluting energy sources. They said such measures were important not only to the environment but to the nation's economic competitiveness.

""When the starting gun sounded on the clean energy race, the United States stumbled,"" Energy Secretary Steven Chu told the Senate panel, saying that spending on green energy technology in China and several European nations was far outstripping that of the United States. ""But I remain confident that we can make up the ground.""

He added, ""When we gear up our research and production of clean energy technologies, we can still surpass any other country.""

The climate change measure, sponsored by Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, aims to cap emissions of the gases linked to the warming of the planet by setting up a program under which industries can buy and sell emissions permits.

The measure also provides a variety of incentives for new energy technology, including billions of dollars in subsidies for research on capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.

Republicans on the committee dismissed the bill as an overly complex one that will harm the economy, kill jobs and favor some parts of the country over others. Democrats generally defended it as a market-based approach to a serious environmental problem that will create jobs by spurring energy innovation.

Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is the second-ranking member of the environment committee and chairman of the Finance Committee, warned his fellow Democrats that the Kerry-Boxer bill went too far and could end up delaying any action on global warming for months or years.

""The legislation before us today is about our economy,"" Mr. Baucus told the committee. ""Montana, with our resource-based agriculture and tourism economies, cannot afford the unmitigated impacts of climate change. But we also cannot afford the unmitigated effects of climate change legislation.""

He said the bill's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent below 2005 levels was too ambitious. He criticized the measure's failure to limit the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to impose additional regulations on carbon dioxide emissions beyond those in the bill.

And he warned Senator Boxer against using her committee's 12-to-7 Democratic majority to pass a bill without some support from moderate Republicans and Democrats.

""We could build that consensus here in this committee,"" Mr. Baucus said. ""If we don't, we risk wasting another month, another year, another Congress without taking a step forward into our future.""

Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, considered by some a potential Republican vote for climate change legislation, also said the committee was moving too quickly on a complex bill that few understand.

""Why are we trying to jam down this legislation now?"" asked Mr. Voinovich, who is retiring at the end of next year. ""Wouldn't it be smarter to take our time and do it right?""

In Arcadia, Fla., Mr. Obama stood in the midst of the nation's largest solar power generation array to highlight $3.4 billion in stimulus spending for projects to modernize the electric grid through projects across the country.

""At this moment, there's something big happening in America, when it comes to creating a clean-energy economy,"" Mr. Obama said. ""But getting there will take a few more days like this one, and more projects like this one."""

A 8",,Building a Bridge Across the Generation Gap on Climate,"By SEBNEM ARSU and JAMES KANTER; Sebnem Arsu reported from Istanbul, and James Kanter from Brussels.",,"ISTANBUL - Archbishop Desmond Tutu's 3-year-old granddaughter, Onalenna, was puzzled.

Her older cousin, Mungi, had just deflated a large, blow-up globe to demonstrate the imminent danger of climate change.

""Are we going to go the moon then?"" Onalenna asked her grandfather.

""I don't know, I will not be here,"" Archbishop Tutu, 78, whispered in his granddaughter's ear.

The rapid march of climate change up the global agenda has prompted a new, and often poignant, conversation between the generations and, in public, among a self-appointed elite.

At its core, that conversation is about whether some of the first beneficiaries of the wonders developed during the past century -- like electricity at the flick of a switch -- have the means, or the will, to help their descendants with the consequences of burning vast quantities of fossil fuels.

The conversation also is playing itself out across the planet as leaders, industrialists and citizens confront issues too costly for any single nation or generation to tackle alone.

For a group of 20th-century leaders called the Elders -- whose members include Archbishop Tutu of South Africa, former President Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson, a former Irish president -- it also was a conversation with their families that they felt would be most usefully conducted before the cameras.

On Thursday, seeking to highlight the responsibility that older generations bear for climate change, members of the group traveled to Istanbul for a symbolic photo shoot accompanied by young relatives.

""This is a rather late wake-up call for all humanity to behave in a more responsible manner,"" said Lakhdar Brahimi, 75, a veteran United Nations envoy who helped broker an agreement ending civil war in Lebanon, and who was accompanied by his grandchildren, Balthazar, 5, and Basile, 3. ""It is the responsibility of today's generations to act,"" he said.

The Elders group was founded in 2007 with the help of Nelson Mandela. Its chairman, Archbishop Tutu, acknowledged that his generation bore the blame for not making tough choices sooner.

""We should have long ago used recyclable energy,"" said Archbishop Tutu, who danced on a lawn as he entertained his grandchildren before the cameras.

""If we had used solar energy or wind power, we wouldn't have been in this predicament.""

Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish political scientist who found fame as the author of the much-criticized book ""The Skeptical Environmentalist,"" said that by campaigning for swift agreement at a global climate conference in December in Copenhagen, the Elders risked backing expensive and ineffective solutions that might divert money from more effective measures to save lives and protect the planet.

""I have no doubt the Elders care deeply about their grandchildren,"" Mr. Lomborg said, ""but we should be concerned about all the other grandchildren who were not at the event and who run the risk of dying tomorrow from lack of sanitation, starvation and disease.""

Ms. Robinson, 65, said she sympathized with that view, but she added that coming generations would not have a planet to enjoy unless action was taken now to resolve the problem.

""Living in New York, I can see the preoccupation with issues like the health care debate, Afghanistan and Iraq, so it's difficult to keep the issue on the front burner,"" she said. ""However, we should make it absolutely clear that it is the supreme political issue of our time.""

The Elders have in the past sought to raise consciousness about conflicts in the Middle East and in Sudan by using their access to high-level figures and staging publicity events.

""We are not restrained by timidity or political niceties or diplomatic propriety,"" said Mr. Carter, 85. Many of the Elders praised the virtues of hybrid cars and, paradoxically for such a mobile group, they described advantages of using technology for virtual conferences rather than using airplanes to attend meetings.

Mr. Carter recounted the story of his wearing a sweater during the energy crisis of the 1970s, an act that prompted mockery from critics, who accused him of ineffectiveness in the face of rising energy prices. But from the perspective of a new generation, wearing the sweater looked prescient, he said.

""It got people to register thermostats in their homes and save electricity,"" Mr. Carter said. ""I never have been very afraid of people making fun. I do what I think is right, and I was right in the end."""
"National, Friday, November 6, 2009 361 mots, p. A 15",,Democrats Push Climate Bill Through Panel Without G.O.P. Debate,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - In a step that reflected deep partisan divisions in the Senate over the issue of global warming, Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee pushed through a climate bill on Thursday without any debate or participation by Republicans.

The measure passed by an 11-to-1 vote with the support of all the Democratic committee members except Senator Max Baucus of Montana. The seven Republicans boycotted the committee meetings this week, saying they had not had sufficient time to study the bill and demanding that the Environmental Protection Agency conduct a thorough study of its economic costs and benefits.

The move suggests that President Obama and Democratic supporters of the bill will have serious problems assembling the votes needed to enact it when it comes to the Senate floor, probably not before next year.

Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, the committee's chairwoman and co-sponsor of the bill, employed a rarely used exception to customary committee rules to muscle the 959-page measure through her panel. She conducted three days of hearings last week on the bill, known as S. 1733, but there was no debate on the complex measure, nor any chance for panel members to offer amendments.

Mrs. Boxer said that the E.P.A. had already conducted a preliminary analysis of the bill and that further study would be costly and duplicative. She said it was necessary to bypass the committee's rule that required Republican participation because of Republican intransigence and the urgency of the issue.

""A majority of the committee,"" she said in a statement, ""believes that S. 1733, and the efforts that will be built upon it, will move us away from foreign oil imports that cost Americans $1 billion a day, it will protect our children from pollution, create millions of clean energy jobs and stimulate billions of dollars of private investment.""

The senior Republican on the environment committee, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, said the bill would harm the American economy and cost millions of jobs. He said the Democrats' decision to ram the bill through ""marked the death knell"" of efforts to enact a comprehensive climate change bill.

Mr. Baucus's vote against the bill was another ominous sign. He is the influential chairman of the Finance Committee and a senior member of the Agriculture Committee, both of which will have major input in any final climate and energy legislation. He said the bill's emission reduction targets were too ambitious and its agriculture provisions too weak. He said the measure had a long way to go.

""This is a first step,"" he said Thursday. ""There will be many other steps."""

BRODER and LESLIE KAUFMAN,,"The Environmental Protection Agency has directed two of its lawyers to makes changes to a YouTube video they posted that is critical of the Obama administration's climate change policy.

The agency, citing federal policies, told the two lawyers, Laurie Williams and Allan Zabel, who are married and based in San Francisco, that they could mention their E.P.A. affiliation only once; must remove language specifying Mr. Zabel's expertise and their years of employment with the agency; and must remove an image of the agency's office in San Francisco.

They have been told that if they do not edit the video to comply with the policy, they could face disciplinary action.

The video, titled ""The Huge Mistake,"" was produced and posted in September. But the agency did not issue its warning until The Washington Post published a widely cited opinion article by the couple on Oct. 31 that raised concerns, echoing those in the video, about cap-and-trade legislation that the Obama administration supports.

Ms. Williams and Mr. Zabel say cap and trade, in which the government sets a limit on gases that contribute to global warming and then lets companies trade permits to meet it, can be easily gamed by industry and fail to reduce the emissions linked to global warming.

On Thursday, Mr. Zabel said, regional ethics officers with the agency met with him to express concerns about the video and to demand that it be taken down by the next day. Ms. Williams was traveling and did not take part in the meeting.

E.P.A. officials said the agency did not object to the content of the video or the op-ed article or challenge the couple's right to express their opinions. But they said that government ethics rules required them to state that the opinions were their own and not those of the agency.

""E.P.A. has nearly 18,000 employees, and all of them are free to -- and many do -- publicly express their views on issues of the day, including issues that are central to E.P.A.'s mission,"" Scott Fulton, the agency's general counsel, said in a statement. However, the video did say the opinions were those of Mr. Williams and Ms. Zabel and were not meant to represent the agency.

In addition, Mr. Williams and Ms. Zabel say they quickly removed the video from their Web site and YouTube. But they said that others had copied the video and put it up on separate YouTube accounts and that it is still easily found."

B 3",,Gloomy Energy Report Sets the Stage for Climate Negotiations,By JAD MOUAWAD,,"As the world heads for tough negotiations over a global climate deal next month, an influential forecasting agency said on Tuesday that current energy policies were not sustainable, and that a vast transformation of energy use was required to fend off the worst consequences of global warming.

In the absence of a global deal to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, energy consumption will soar over the next decades. This would result in a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, according to the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations that is based in Paris.

""Continuing on today's energy path, without any change in government policy, would mean rapidly increasing dependence on fossil fuels, with alarming consequences for climate change and energy security,"" the agency said.

The warning was contained in the annual World Energy Outlook, a 698-page publication that focuses this year on policies needed to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide.

A part of the report was released last month as a map for policy makers considering how to make significant reductions. Government officials from about 190 nations will meet next month in Copenhagen to try to hammer out an international deal to replace the agreement known as the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012.

But international negotiators have signaled that an agreement is unlikely to be reached this year in the absence of a broad consensus on how to share the costs of switching to lower-carbon technologies and fuels.

The recession, the energy agency said, offers an opportunity to make big strides in lowering emissions. As a result of reduced economic activity this year, global emissions are expected to fall as much as 3 percent, the steepest decline in 40 years.

Without a new global agreement, carbon emissions will rise by 40 percent by 2030, the agency said. More than half of that growth will come from China alone, with the rest coming from other developing nations.

The agency's forecasts are based on the assumption of no changes in energy policy from governments.

Global electricity demand, for example, would rise by 76 percent by 2030, requiring the addition of five times as much production capacity as exists today in the United States. Much of that would come from burning coal; its share of the global energy mix would grow by 2 percentage points to reach 44 percent in 2030.

The recession, which has slowed the growth in demand and allowed governments to introduce energy-saving programs, provides some breathing room.

As a result of some of these policies, like stricter fuel economy standards for cars, the energy agency has reduced its forecast for oil demand in coming years.

Forecasters now expect global oil consumption to grow 1 percent a year in the next two decades, reaching 105 million barrels a day by 2030, from 85 million barrels a day in 2008. That estimate is lower than last year's forecast for 2030 of 106 million barrels a day. It is also well below the 120 million barrels a day that the energy agency had projected a few years ago.

If the world agreed on stringent emissions limits, oil demand would reach just 89 million barrels a day by 2030, the agency said. That would represent a modest increase of four million barrels a day over current consumption levels.

As economies recover, energy demand will rise. After two years of declines because of the recession, government forecasters in the United States projected on Tuesday that global oil consumption would rise again next year.

The Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy, projected that oil demand would grow by 1.26 million barrels a day in 2010, almost entirely because of a rebound in demand from developing nations. Oil consumption in the developed world will rise by only 100,000 barrels a day next year, the agency estimated.

The recession has not only reduced energy demand this year, it has also curbed investments in new supplies.

In the oil and gas sector, most companies have announced cutbacks in capital spending, as well as project delays and cancellations, the International Energy Agency said. It estimated that investment budgets for 2009 had been cut by around 19 percent compared with last year, a drop of over $90 billion.

The cost of reducing carbon emissions -- through energy efficiency, more investments in renewable power, electric vehicles, expansion of nuclear power, and building carbon capture and storage technology for coal-burning power plants -- would be high.

But for each year of delay in an agreement, the world will eventually have to spend an additional $500 billion to cut emissions, the agency said."
"Foreign, Saturday, November 14, 2009 1032 mots, p. A 8",,"Turtle Tours, and Turtles, Are Casualties of Climate Change in Costa Rica",By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"PLAYA GRANDE, Costa Rica - This resort town was long known for Leatherback Sea Turtle National Park, nightly turtle beach tours and even a sea turtle museum. So Kaja Michelson, a Swedish tourist, arrived with high expectations. ""Of course we're hoping to see turtles -- that is part of the appeal,"" she said.

But haphazard development, in tandem with warmer temperatures and rising seas that many scientists link to global warming, have vastly diminished the Pacific turtle population.

On a beach where dozens of turtles used to nest on a given night, scientists spied only 32 leatherbacks all of last year. With leatherbacks threatened with extinction, Playa Grande's expansive turtle museum was abandoned three years ago and now sits amid a sea of weeds. And the beachside ticket booth for turtle tours was washed away by a high tide in September.

""We do not promote this as a turtle tourism destination anymore because we realize there are far too few turtles to please,"" said Alvaro Fonseca, a park ranger.

Even before scientists found temperatures creeping upward over the past decade, sea turtles were threatened by beach development, drift net fishing and Costa Ricans' penchant for eating turtle eggs, considered a delicacy here. But climate change may deal the fatal blow to an animal that has dwelled in the Pacific for 150 million years.

Sea turtles are sensitive to numerous effects of warming. They feed on reefs, which are dying in hotter, more acidic seas. They lay eggs on beaches that are being inundated by rising seas and more violent storm surges.

More uniquely, their gender is determined not by genes but by the egg's temperature during development. Small rises in beach temperatures can result in all-female populations, obviously problematic for survival.

""The turtles are very good storytellers about the effect of climate change on coastal habitats,"" said Carlos Drews, the regional marine species coordinator for the conservation group W.W.F. ""The climate is changing so much faster than before, and these animals depend on so much for temperature.""

If the sand around the eggs hits 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), the gender balance shifts to females, Mr. Drews said, and at about 32 degrees (89.6 Fahrenheit) they are all female. Above 34 (93), ""you get boiled eggs,"" he said.

On some nesting beaches, scientists are artificially cooling nests with shade or irrigation and trying to protect broader areas of coastal property from development to ensure that turtles have a place to nest as the seas rise.

In places like Playa Junquillal, an hour south of here, local youths are paid $2 a night to scoop up newly laid eggs and move them to a hatchery where they are shaded and irrigated to maintain a nest temperature of 29.7 degrees Celsius (85.4), which will yield both genders.

On a recent night, Dennis Gomez Jimenez, a 22-year-old in a red baseball cap and jeans, deftly excavated the nest of a three-foot-wide Olive Ridley, one of the smaller sea turtle species. The turtle had just finished the hourlong task of burying 100-plus eggs and then lumbered back into the water.

One by one, Mr. Jimenez placed what looked like table tennis balls into a plastic bag and transferred them to an ersatz nest he had dug in a shaded, fenced-off portion of sand that serves as a hatchery. Sandbags are positioned to protect against tides that could rip nests apart.

When the turtles hatch, in 40 to 60 days depending on the species, they are carried in wicker baskets to the ocean's edge and make a beeline for the water. Gabriel Francia, a biologist who oversees the youths, known locally as the ""baula"" or leatherback boys, likens their work to delivering an endangered infant by Caesarean section.

""In some ways we're playing God -- this is a big experiment,"" he said. The long-term hope, he said, is to build a robust turtle population that will slowly adapt by shifting to cooler, more northern beaches or laying eggs at cooler times of the year.

Worldwide, there are seven sea turtle species, and all are considered threatened. (Turtle populations in the Atlantic have increased over the last 20 years because of measures like bans on trapping turtles and selling their parts.)

The leatherback is considered critically endangered on a global level. Populations are especially depleted in the Pacific, where only 2,000 to 3,000 are estimated to survive today, down from around 90,000 two decades ago. Cooler sands alone will not save them, given the scope of the threats they face. At Playa Junquillal, markers placed a decade ago to mark a point 55 yards above the high tide line are now frequently underwater.

""It's happened really fast -- we have no rain, but water pouring in from the ocean,"" said Adriana Miranda, 30, the manager of a local hangout that serves beer and rice and beans.

Beachside tables have been removed because rising tides have destroyed the restaurant's concrete terrace and uprooted shading trees there. In different circumstances, the beaches could gradually extend backward as the sea level rose. But along much of Costa Rica's Pacific coast, the back of the beach is now filled with hotels, restaurants and planted trees, giving the sand no place to go. ""The squeezing of the beaches where turtles nest is going to be a big problem,"" said Carl Safina, head of the Blue Ocean Institute, a conservation group.

In Playa Grande, the turtle issue has pitted environmentalists against developers and the national government. To ensure a future for the leatherbacks and the national park, biologists wanted a large section of land extending about 140 yards back from the current high-tide line protected from development. Beachfront property owners, many of them foreigners with vacation homes, demanded hefty compensation.

Arguing that the government cannot afford the payouts, President Oscar Arias has instead proposed protecting the first 55 yards, and allowing about 80 yards of somewhat regulated mixed-use development to the rear. But Costa Rica's leading scientists have protested that the new boundaries will lead to ""certain extinction.""

Turtles will not nest if there are lights behind the beach, Mr. Drews said, and those first 55 yards will be underwater by midcentury.

""Turtles will have to find their way between the tennis courts and swimming pools,"" he said dryly.

In a country where turtle eggs are traditionally slurped in bars from a shot glass, uncooked and mixed with salsa and lemon, biologists are also promoting cultural change.

""Of course 25 years ago, you went out with your friends or family and dug up the eggs,"" said Hector Garcia, 42, shopping at the Junquillal market. ""It was a tradition. They are delicious, cooked or raw.""

Today egg collecting is illegal in Costa Rica, but poaching is still common in many towns. It is frowned on at Playa Junquillal, where the five baula boys, with their piercings and baseball caps, patrol for poachers and are idolized by many younger children. Dr. Francia, the biologist, has also invited local families to watch the babies being released. ""There were a lot of people who had eaten eggs but never seen a turtle,"" he said."
"Foreign, Sunday, November 15, 2009 906 mots, p. A 6",,Leaders Will Delay Agreement On Climate,By HELENE COOPER,,"SINGAPORE - President Obama and other world leaders have decided to put off the difficult task of reaching a climate change agreement at a global climate conference scheduled for next month, agreeing instead to make it the mission of the Copenhagen conference to reach a less specific ""politically binding"" agreement that would punt the most difficult issues into the future.

At a hastily arranged breakfast on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting on Sunday morning, the leaders, including Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the prime minister of Denmark and the chairman of the climate conference, agreed that in order to salvage Copenhagen they would have to push a fully binding legal agreement down the road, possibly to a second summit meeting in Mexico City later on.

""There was an assessment by the leaders that it is unrealistic to expect a full internationally, legally binding agreement could be negotiated between now and Copenhagen, which starts in 22 days,"" said Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs. ""I don't think the negotiations have proceeded in such a way that any of the leaders thought it was likely that we were going to achieve a final agreement in Copenhagen, and yet thought that it was important that Copenhagen be an important step forward, including with operational impact.""

With the clock running out and deep differences unresolved, it has, for several months, appeared increasingly unlikely that the climate change negotiations in Denmark would produce a comprehensive and binding new treaty on global warming, as its organizers had intended.

The agreement on Sunday codifies what negotiators had already accepted as all but inevitable: that representatives of the 192 nations in the talks would not resolve the outstanding issues in time. The gulf between rich and poor countries, and even among the wealthiest nations, was just too wide.

Among the chief barriers to a comprehensive deal in Copenhagen was Congress's inability to enact climate and energy legislation that sets binding targets on greenhouse gases in the United States. Without such a commitment, other nations are loath to make their own pledges.

Administration officials and Congressional leaders have said that final legislative action on a climate bill would not occur before the first half of next year.

After his breakfast meeting in Singapore, Mr. Obama was scheduled to meet with Asian leaders and to hold a number of one-on-one sessions, including one with the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev.

After his meeting with Mr. Medvedev, Mr. Obama will attend a symbolically important regional meeting of Southeast Asian nations, in which representatives of Myanmar's government will also be present. Mr. Obama, who has made a point of his willingness to engage with adversaries, noted that for the first time an American president would be at the table with Myanmar's military junta. But he has also called on the government to release the leader of the country's beleaguered democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.

APEC summit meetings are not known for accomplishing much that is substantive. The most memorable moments often involve the photo opportunities, in which leaders wear colorful matching shirts. And often communiques issued on dismantling trade barriers are undermined by the attending countries almost as soon as they are signed.

Speaking to world leaders at the APEC summit meeting Sunday morning, Mr. Obama said he would hold the 2011 gathering in Hawaii.

""The United States was there at the first meeting of APEC at Blake Island when President Clinton started the tradition of having leaders wear outfits picked out by the host nation,"" Mr. Obama said. ""And when America hosts APEC in a few years, I look forward to seeing you all decked out in flowered shirts and grass skirts because today I am announcing that my home state of Hawaii will be hosting this forum in 2011.""

This year's meeting promises more of the same, complete with charges and countercharges of protectionism.

President Felipe Calderon of Mexico got things going early Saturday when he lashed out at what he called politically driven protectionism in the United States. He complained that Congressional coddling of the Teamsters had prevented the United States from opening its borders to Mexican trucks, which it was supposed to do years ago after it signed Nafta.

""Protectionism is killing North American companies,"" Mr. Calderon said in Singapore. ""The American government is facing political pressure that has not been counteracted.""

Mr. Obama is facing high expectations, which may be difficult to meet. For instance, while he has spoken about reducing trade barriers, he also talked during his speech in Tokyo on Saturday of making sure that the United States and Asia did not return to a cycle -- which he termed ""imbalanced"" -- in which American consumerism caused Asians to look at the United States as mainly an export market.

There are also high hopes among American companies and some Asian countries that the United States will commit to joining a regional trading group called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although Mr. Obama did open the door during his speech in Tokyo on Asia policy, he did not explicitly say that the United States would join the pact. A formal announcement that the United States is beginning negotiations would undoubtedly kick off criticism from free-trade opponents in the United States and pushback from Congress.

Mr. Obama spoke, instead, of ""engaging the Trans-Pacific Partnership countries with the goal of shaping a regional agreement that will have broad-based membership and the high standards worthy of a 21st-century trade agreement.""

That line left many trade envoys already in Singapore scratching their heads: did Mr. Obama mean that the United States would begin formal talks to join the regional trade pact, which presently includes Singapore, Brunei and New Zealand, and could later include Vietnam -- an addition that could lead to more Congressional pressure at home?

Many regional officials have been waiting for the United States to join the initiative as a demonstration that Washington will play a more active role in the region. But the Obama administration has yet to establish a firm trade policy, as it is still reviewing its options.

White House officials were not much clearer on what Mr. Obama meant when they were pressed on this after the speech. Mr. Froman, the deputy national security adviser, said that what Mr. Obama meant was that he would engage with the initiative ""to see if this is something that could prove to be an important platform going further."""
"Foreign, Monday, November 16, 2009 777 mots, p. A 1",,NEWS ANALYSIS,,,"By JOHN M. BRODER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Paris, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

WASHINGTON - President Obama came into office pledging to end eight years of American inaction on climate change under President George W. Bush, and all year he has promised that the United States would lead the way toward a global agreement in Copenhagen next month to address the warming planet.

But this weekend in Singapore, Mr. Obama was forced to acknowledge that a comprehensive climate deal was beyond reach this year. Instead, he and other world leaders agreed that they would work toward a more modest interim agreement with a promise to renew work toward a binding treaty next year.

The admission places Mr. Obama in the awkward position of being, at least for now, as unlikely to spearhead an international effort to combat global warming as his predecessor -- if for different reasons.

In Mr. Bush's case, he remained skeptical about the science of global warming until near the end of his presidency and dubious about the need for concerted global action.

And his reluctance was echoed by a Congress that wanted to see clear commitments from developing countries like China.

But Mr. Obama has been a champion of climate change regulation. He has moved unilaterally to limit greenhouse gases from vehicles and large sources such as coal-burning power plants. And in recent months, China, India, Brazil and some other developing countries have issued promises to slow the growth of emissions, although with the knowledge that a binding treaty to enforce such pledges will not take effect for at least several years.

Yet Mr. Obama has found himself limited in his ambitions by a Congress that is unwilling to move as far or as fast as he would like.

American negotiators have been hamstrung in talks leading to the Copenhagen conference by inaction on legislation supported by the administration that would impose strict caps on carbon dioxide emissions. The House passed a relatively stringent bill in June, but the Senate is not expected to begin serious debate on the measure until next year.

Without a firm commitment from the United States -- for decades the world's leading emitter of climate-altering gases -- other nations have been reluctant to deliver firmer pledges of their own. Mr. Obama's aides say he remains determined to use his domestic authority and international clout to continue pressing toward a global agreement. despite the latest setback.

""Is this impasse the United States' fault? Of course. But others are at fault as well,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign in Washington, citing the opposition of polluting industries and the reluctance of emerging economies to commit to binding curbs on emissions. ""We have both the obligation and capability of taking the lead on this issue. The longer we delay, the more extreme the steps that will have to be taken.""

Mr. Obama expressed support on Sunday for a proposal from Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen of Denmark to pursue a two-step process at the Copenhagen conference.

Under the plan, the 192 nations convening in the Danish capital would formulate a nonbinding political agreement calling for reductions in global warming emissions and aid for developing nations to adapt to a changing climate. The group would also promise to work to put together a binding global pact in 2010, complete with firm emissions targets, enforcement mechanisms and specific dollar amounts to aid poorer nations.

""We must in the coming weeks focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not possible,"" Mr. Rasmussen said in Singapore, making clear he would prefer to lock in the progress that has been made to date and not postpone action until countries are prepared to accept legally-binding commitments.

Although many read the compromise as a sign that the Copenhagen talks were doomed to produce at best a weak agreement, Yvo de Boer, the United Nations official managing the climate negotiations, said the statements out of the Singapore meeting did not limit his ambitions.

""Copenhagen can and must deliver clarity on emission reduction targets and the finance to kick start rapid action,"" Mr. de Boer said. ""I have seen nothing that would change my view on that.""

Not everyone blames the United States for the apparent deadlock. A European Union official, who asked that his name not be used so he could speak more freely, said that Mr. Obama was moving to use his executive authority to regulate greenhouse gases, but that India and China had delivered little beyond promises.

He said that it had been clear for months that Copenhagen was not going to yield a breakthrough and that there was plenty of blame to go around.

Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said the compromise agreed to by the leaders in Singapore was an honest admission of what had become obvious over the past several weeks, as negotiations toward a climate treaty stalled.

But he said the admission was a severe disappointment from President Obama and the other leaders.

""It signifies an abandonment of moral responsibility that a position of leadership on the world stage clearly implies,"" Mr. Pachauri said in an e-mail message, adding that the scientific consensus on global warming demanded immediate action, not stalling tactics.

Mr. Obama, speaking in Japan on Friday, seemed to anticipate the criticism the United States will face for the setback in the Copenhagen talks. He said he had started a momentous change in American policy on global warming that would take some time to complete.

""Already, the United States has taken more steps to combat climate change in 10 months than we have in our recent history,"" Mr. Obama said, ""by embracing the latest science, by investing in new energy, by raising efficiency standards, forging new partnerships and engaging in international climate negotiations.

""In short, America knows there is more work to do,"" he said, ""but we are meeting our responsibility, and will continue to do so."""
"Editorial, Wednesday, November 18, 2009 699 mots, p. A 35",,OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,,,"By BEN GELBER

Columbus, Ohio - FEW would argue that the debate on global warming engenders a lot of emotion. What else are we to make of comments that ""within the last 40 or 50 years there has been a very great observable change of climate,"" that ""a change in our climate ... is taking place very sensibly"" and that ""men are led into numberless errors by drawing general conclusions from particular facts""?

That these comments were actually tossed around back in the late 18th century by the Pennsylvania doctor Hugh Williamson, Thomas Jefferson and Noah Webster reminds us that history has a tendency to repeat itself. (One can imagine what television talk shows would have been like then. Would Jefferson have promoted ""An Inconvenient Treatise"" only to be acrimoniously contradicted by Webster on ""Hard Quoits,"" assuming either could get a word in amid the jabbering of the host?)

In the 1780s, Thomas Jefferson opined in his ""Notes on Virginia"" that ""both heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged,"" expressing views articulated as early as 1721 by Cotton Mather: ""Our cold is much moderated since the opening and clearing of our woods, and the winds do not blow roughly as in the days of our fathers, when water, cast up into the air, would commonly be turned into ice before it came to the ground.""

The weather historian James R. Fleming has noted that the vexing scientific challenge in the climate debate has always been ""the response of a large, complex, potentially chaotic system to small changes in forcing factors."" Benjamin Franklin understood climatic forcing factors better than anyone, surmising in a 1763 letter to Ezra Stiles that ""cleared land absorbs more heat and melts snow quicker."" Franklin, our meteorologist emeritus for his seminal work on everything from lightning to northeasters, later surmised (correctly) that a prevailing haze over parts of North America and northern Europe was associated with the eruption of the Laki volcano in Iceland in June 1783, and was possibly the source for the exceptional chill experienced in the winter of 1783-84 in the colonies.

On the other side of the developing weather controversy in the late 18th century, Webster quarreled with Jefferson, insisting that he relied too heavily on the memories of ""elderly and middle-aged people"" for his observation that the climate had moderated. While Webster conceded an anthropogenic influence might still be at work, he argued that it caused something less than climate change: ""All the alterations in a country, in consequence of clearing and cultivation, result only in making a different distribution of heat and cold, moisture and dry weather, among the several seasons.""

Hugh Williamson, astute in his understanding of the hydrological cycle, a key component in any climate change debate, wrote, ""The vapors that arise from the forests are soon converted into rain, and that rain becomes the subject of future evaporation, by which the earth is further cooled."" A century and a half later, land-use studies would confirm quantifiable relationships between clearing trees for extensive farmland and changes in soil temperature, moisture distribution and local and regional climate responses, as well as the urban heat-island effect. In our time, we have learned that tropical deforestation is linked to as much as 15 percent of the world's global warming pollution, largely due to the release of carbon dioxide, one of several ""greenhouse gases"" that trap and re-radiate terrestrial heat.

But the primary goal of Jefferson and other colonials in the national climate discussion was to scuttle the European notion that the New World's climate was too harsh and deleterious for settlement. From Mather to Williamson and Jefferson and many others, the debate was a reaction to European attitudes regarding the presumed rigorous and unhealthful climate of North America.

Instead, early American writers painted a far more favorable picture of the American climate and fauna. The notion took hold that manmade climate change, specifically clearing untamed land for cultivation, would prove beneficial, ameliorating health problems by draining standing water and wetlands thought to breed disease and lethargy.

Not until the middle of the 19th century would the debate on North American climate change finally be put to rest by early climatologists who had cranked out numbers by hand from sparse and slowly accumulating weather observations and phenological data.

The clearing and cultivation climate-change debate of Jefferson's era was driven by literary and anecdotal evidence in the absence of solid data. Now we have satellites monitoring high-latitude snow cover, thinning sea ice and deep-layered atmospheric temperature increases, coupled with ground observations revealing the disappearing snows of Kilimanjaro (85 percent ice loss since 1912) and many other glaciers.

The wealth of data now at our disposal, enhanced by high-resolution computer models that pioneer climatologists would have craved, has, curiously, not turned down the thermostat on the centuries-old global climate change debate, quite likely because the stakes are so much higher."
"Foreign, Saturday, November 21, 2009 941 mots, p. A 1",,Hacked E-Mail Is New Fodder For Climate Change Dispute,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"Hundreds of private e-mail messages and documents hacked from a computer server at a British university are causing a stir among global warming skeptics, who say they show that climate scientists conspired to overstate the case for a human influence on climate change.

The e-mail messages, attributed to prominent American and British climate researchers, include discussions of scientific data and whether it should be released, exchanges about how best to combat the arguments of skeptics, and casual comments -- in some cases derisive -- about specific people known for their skeptical views. Drafts of scientific papers and a photo collage that portrays climate skeptics on an ice floe were also among the hacked data, some of which dates back 13 years.

In one e-mail exchange, a scientist writes of using a statistical ""trick"" in a chart illustrating a recent sharp warming trend. In another, a scientist refers to climate skeptics as ""idiots.""

Some skeptics asserted Friday that the correspondence revealed an effort to withhold scientific information. ""This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud,"" said Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist who has long faulted evidence pointing to human-driven warming and is criticized in the documents.

Some of the correspondence portrays the scientists as feeling under siege by the skeptics' camp and worried that any stray comment or data glitch could be turned against them.

The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument. However, the documents will undoubtedly raise questions about the quality of research on some specific questions and the actions of some scientists.

In several e-mail exchanges, Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and other scientists discuss gaps in understanding of recent variations in temperature. Skeptic Web sites pointed out one line in particular: ""The fact is that we can't account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can't,"" Dr. Trenberth wrote.

The cache of e-mail messages also includes references to journalists, including this reporter, and queries from journalists related to articles they were reporting.

Officials at the University of East Anglia confirmed in a statement on Friday that files had been stolen from a university server and that the police had been brought in to investigate the breach. They added, however, that they could not confirm that all the material circulating on the Internet was authentic.

But several scientists and others contacted by The New York Times confirmed that they were the authors or recipients of specific e-mail messages included in the file. The revelations are bound to inflame the public debate as hundreds of negotiators prepare to negotiate an international climate accord at meetings in Copenhagen next month, and at least one scientist speculated that the timing was not coincidental.

Dr. Trenberth said Friday that he was appalled at the release of the e-mail messages.

But he added that he thought the revelations might backfire against climate skeptics. He said that he thought that the messages showed ""the integrity of scientists."" Still, some of the comments might lend themselves to being interpreted as sinister.

In a 1999 e-mail exchange about charts showing climate patterns over the last two millenniums, Phil Jones, a longtime climate researcher at the East Anglia Climate Research Unit, said he had used a ""trick"" employed by another scientist, Michael Mann, to ""hide the decline"" in temperatures.

Dr. Mann, a professor at Pennsylvania State University, confirmed in an interview that the e-mail message was real. He said the choice of words by his colleague was poor but noted that scientists often used the word ""trick"" to refer to a good way to solve a problem, ""and not something secret.""

At issue were sets of data, both employed in two studies. One data set showed long-term temperature effects on tree rings; the other, thermometer readings for the past 100 years.

Through the last century, tree rings and thermometers show a consistent rise in temperature until 1960, when some tree rings, for unknown reasons, no longer show that rise, while the thermometers continue to do so until the present.

Dr. Mann explained that the reliability of the tree-ring data was called into question, so they were no longer used to track temperature fluctuations. But he said dropping the use of the tree rings was never something that was hidden, and had been in the scientific literature for more than a decade. ""It sounds incriminating, but when you look at what you're talking about, there's nothing there,"" Dr. Mann said.

In addition, other independent but indirect measurements of temperature fluctuations in the studies broadly agreed with the thermometer data showing rising temperatures.

Dr. Jones, writing in an e-mail message, declined to be interviewed.

Stephen McIntyre, a blogger who on his Web site, climateaudit.org, has for years been challenging data used to chart climate patterns, and who came in for heated criticism in some e-mail messages, called the revelations ""quite breathtaking.""

But several scientists whose names appear in the e-mail messages said they merely revealed that scientists were human, and did nothing to undercut the body of research on global warming. ""Science doesn't work because we're all nice,"" said Gavin A. Schmidt, a climatologist at NASA whose e-mail exchanges with colleagues over a variety of climate studies were in the cache. ""Newton may have been an ass, but the theory of gravity still works.""

He said the breach at the University of East Anglia was discovered after hackers who had gained access to the correspondence sought Tuesday to hack into a different server supporting realclimate.org, a blog unrelated to NASA that he runs with several other scientists pressing the case that global warming is true.

The intruders sought to create a mock blog post there and to upload the full batch of files from Britain. That effort was thwarted, Dr. Schmidt said, and scientists immediately notified colleagues at the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. The first posts that revealed details from the files appeared Thursday at The Air Vent, a Web site devoted to skeptics' arguments.

At first, said Dr. Michaels, the climatologist who has faulted some of the science of the global warming consensus, his instinct was to ignore the correspondence as ""just the way scientists talk.""

But on Friday, he said that after reading more deeply, he felt that some exchanges reflected an effort to block the release of data for independent review.

He said some messages mused about discrediting him by challenging the veracity of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Wisconsin by claiming he knew his research was wrong. ""This shows these are people willing to bend rules and go after other people's reputations in very serious ways,"" he said.

Spencer R. Weart, a physicist and historian who is charting the course of research on global warming, said the hacked material would serve as ""great material for historians."""
"Editorial, Sunday, November 22, 2009 391 mots, p. WK 9",,EDITORIAL,,,"The news that world leaders have abandoned hope for a comprehensive, legally binding climate change treaty in Copenhagen next month inspired no end of finger-pointing. Environmentalists blamed eight years of inaction under George W. Bush. The Europeans noted that the Chinese and several other big developing nations had done little to move the ball forward.

Our own candidate for criticism is the United States Senate. We cannot rewrite the Bush years any more than we can persuade the Chinese of the merits of a binding treaty to control greenhouse gases. What the United States can do is assume responsibility for its own emissions, and this the Senate has manifestly failed to do.

It is asking a lot of the Senate to address health care and climate change at the same time, although the House managed to do both. It is also true that a preoccupied White House has applied almost no pressure. But the indecisiveness of the Senate's Democratic leaders is worrisome, as is the Republicans' reflexive and virtually unanimous hostility to anything that challenges the way this country produces and uses energy.

There are exceptions. The Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Jeff Bingaman have produced bills that could form the basis of a broad measure curbing emissions and ushering in alternative energy sources. But Harry Reid, the majority leader, seems at times like a man who wishes the climate change issue would go away. Last week, he suggested that he could not bring a bill forward until ""sometime in the spring,"" and that even then it would be sold as an economic stimulus bill.

With very few exceptions, the Republicans have behaved terribly. They refused en masse to show up when Ms. Boxer tried to get a committee vote on a bill, claiming they had been denied an analysis of the bill's impact on the economy. When Ms. Boxer summoned officials to provide such an analysis, they boycotted again.

This sends a bad signal to the rest of the world. In Beijing, Mr. Obama suggested that the United States would be willing to put some ""emission reduction targets"" on the table in Copenhagen. These would be aspirational, not binding, and would presumably reflect the goals contained in the House bill, which calls for a 17 percent reduction in United States emissions by 2020. Their main purpose would be to show that the United States is committed to change. But how credible can even this modest goal be if the Senate is largely indifferent?

Though there is no chance the Senate will produce a bill in the next three weeks, we have a modest suggestion. That is for Mr. Obama to appear quickly and publicly with Ms. Boxer, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Reid, and climate stalwarts like John Kerry, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham (a Republican outlier) and announce that climate change will be an early order of business next year and that he will not rest until he gets a bill."
"National, Tuesday, November 24, 2009 548 mots, p. A 24",,U.S. to Set Short-Term Goal on Emissions Before Climate Change Meeting,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The United States will propose a near-term target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions before the United Nationsclimate change meeting in Copenhagen next month, a senior administration official said Monday. President Obama, the official said, will announce the specific target ""in coming days.""

The announcement of a target will take the current legislative stalemate over a climate bill into account, the senior official said, and thus might present a range of possible reductions rather than a single figure.

The lack of consensus in Congress puts Mr. Obama in a tricky domestic and diplomatic bind. He cannot promise more than Congress may eventually deliver when it takes up climate change legislation next year. But if he does not offer some concrete pledge, the United States will bear the brunt of the blame for the lack of an international agreement.

The official also said the president would decide shortly whether and for how long he might attend the December climate meeting, which runs from Dec. 7 to Dec. 18. He repeated the president's assertion that he would consider attending if his presence could be a useful impetus to a deal.

The official, a member of the team of American climate change treaty negotiators, spoke at a White House briefing under the condition that he not be identified.

The Obama administration has so far resisted demands that it commit to a specific emissions reduction goal, saying that it could not pre-empt Congress, which has stalled on climate change legislation. China, the world's largest emitter of climate-altering gases, has also refused to spell out its plans for reducing emissions, although President Hu Jintao promised in September that his country would reduce the amount of emissions per unit of economic output by a ""notable margin.""

Many observers of the climate negotiations expect China to deliver a more specific pledge on this so-called carbon intensity target before the Copenhagen meeting opens.

Mr. Obama has come under criticism from leaders of dozens of countries that have already set domestic greenhouse gas reduction targets. He is also under fire from numerous environmental advocates who say the United States, the world's second-largest emitter, must take a credible commitment to Copenhagen to ensure that the talks do not fall apart.

The House passed a measure in June that calls for a 17 percent reduction over 2005 levels of the domestic emissions of the gases that contribute to the heating of the planet. A Senate committee passed a bill last month that sets a 20 percent target, but that is likely to be weakened in future negotiations.

Paul Bledsoe of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy said the president's hands were tied by Congressional inaction. ""The U.S. cannot negotiate at Copenhagen above the targets in domestic legislation without risking support for that legislation in the Senate,"" Mr. Bledsoe said. ""If European demands continue above the U.S. domestic targets, they set up an impossible dynamic for the administration.""

A second administration official briefing reporters on Monday said that Mr. Obama would have a stronger hand at Copenhagen if Congress had already acted on climate change legislation, but that the debate on health care had blocked it.

""We would have preferred that health care be done a long time ago, and we'd be having an energy debate today,"" the official said.

Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Obama could credibly tell delegates to the climate conference that the United States intended to reduce its emissions by 17 percent to 20 percent, based on the legislation that has been approved by the House and the Senate environment committee.

""It's important for the president to exert that leadership with consultation with Congress,"" Mr. Kerry said in an interview late last week.

Mr. Obama and leaders of a number of other major countries have said that the Copenhagen talks would not yield a comprehensive and binding treaty to address global warming. Instead, the more than 190 nations represented there are expected to produce an interim agreement that addresses the major issues without requiring ratification or international enforcement."
"Editorial, Sunday, December 6, 2009 312 mots, p. WK 9",,EDITORIAL,,,"The theft of thousands of private e-mail messages and files from computer servers at a leading British climate research center has been a political windfall for skeptics who claim the documents prove that mainstream scientists have conspired to overstate the case for human influence on climate change.

They are using the e-mail to blast the Obama administration's climate policies. And they clearly hope that the e-mail will undermine negotiations for a new climate change treaty that begin in Copenhagen this week.

No one should be misled by all the noise. The e-mail messages represent years' worth of exchanges among prominent American and British climatologists. Some are mean-spirited, others intemperate. But they don't change the underlying scientific facts about climate change.

One describes climate skeptics as ""idiots,"" another describes papers written by climate contrarians as ""garbage"" and ""fraud."" Still another suggests that the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose 2007 report concluded that humans were the dominant force behind global warming, should pay no attention to contrarian opinions.

Another quotes an exasperated Phil Jones -- director of the climate center at the University of East Anglia, from which the e-mail was stolen -- as expressing the hope that climate change would occur ""regardless of the consequences"" so ""the science could be proved right.""

However, most of the e-mail messages -- judging by those that have seen the light of day -- appear to deal with the painstaking and difficult task of reconstructing historical temperatures, and the problems scientists encounter along the way. Despite what the skeptics say, they demonstrate just how rigorously scientists have worked to figure out whether global warming is real and the true role that human activities play.

The controversy isn't over. James Inhofe, the Senate's leading skeptic, has asked for an inquiry into what some are calling ""Climategate."" And on Friday, Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the United Nations' intergovernmental panel, announced that he would conduct his own investigation.

It is important that scientists behave professionally and openly. It is also important not to let one set of purloined e-mail messages undermine the science and the clear case for action, in Washington and in Copenhagen.

"Week in Review, Sunday, December 6, 2009 987 mots, p. WK 3",,Forecast: Expect Temperatures to Rise in Copenhagen,By TOM ZELLER Jr.,,"With the scientific consensus more or less settled that human activity -- the burning of fossil fuels, torching of forests, and so forth -- is contributing to a warmer and less hospitable planet, one might reasonably ask, why is it so hard to agree on a plan to curb those activities?

The answer lies with the many fault lines that cut through the debate over climate change. Those deep divisions will be on display beginning this week as representatives of 192 nations gather in Copenhagen for a United Nations conference on the issue.

Organizers had hoped to emerge with an international compact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help countries most threatened by rising sea waters and temperatures. But the divisions between nations are such that world leaders agreed last month to put off resolving the most contentious issues until next year. They will try instead to reach a nonbinding interim agreement in Copenhagen, then work toward a binding treaty in 2010.

Just what will happen, of course, remains to be seen. Here's a primer on some of the major themes and fissures:

RICH NATIONS VS. POOR NATIONS

Who should pay whom for what -- and how much?

The Bolivias and Chads and Mauritanias of the world argue that they are more vulnerable to changes in temperature, and have little or no resources to adapt to changes in the growing seasons or increased rainfall or -- worst case -- to relocate large numbers of people.

They want the rich world to commit to far deeper emissions cuts than they already have, and to provide them with cash and technology so they can prepare for the worst and develop a clean energy infrastructure for themselves.

The rich world, meanwhile, is busy trying to figure out just how to calculate the cost of all this (estimates run into the trillions of dollars), and how to divvy up the bill.

DEVELOPED VS. DEVELOPING ECONOMIES

This is where postindustrial economies like the United States and Europe, which became prosperous by burning carbon-dioxide-spewing fossil fuels, face off against industrializing economies like China, Brazil and India, which resent pressure to decarbonize their energy systems now that they are growing.

The standoff between China and the United States underscores the issues. The global trade rivals were reluctant to commit to emissions targets until each had an idea of what the other planned. The two countries together are responsible for 40 percent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. But all players have been eyeing each other warily.

In recent weeks, bidding has begun, with Brazil, then the United States, followed by China and, last week, India, offering up individual emissions goals. But they have used different baselines against which to measure their reductions, making it difficult to determine whether there is parity.

ISLAND AND COASTAL NATIONS VS. THE CLOCK

In mid-October, ministers of the government of the Maldives, a low-lying island nation in the Indian Ocean, donned scuba gear and held a 30-minute cabinet meeting underwater off the coast of the capital, Male.

The stunt was designed to highlight the nation's plight -- and that of three-dozen or so other small island and coastal countries -- should global warming raise sea levels in the coming decades. Even a modest increase could leave a number of low-lying nations uninhabitable.

As a bloc, these countries have been lobbying for an international agreement to keep average temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. They also want global emissions scaled back by as much as 85 percent by midcentury.

The bloc, which includes a wide range of economies, from relatively well-to-do Singapore to strugglers like Haiti, wins points for being at the front lines of a planetary problem, but its political clout at the negotiating table is uncertain.

EUROPE VS. EUROPE

Even though the European Union has been at the vanguard of renewable energy development and emissions reduction through its carbon trading scheme, it is struggling internally over each nation's carbon quotas, assistance to developing countries and fidelity to the emissions reductions agreed to in 1997 under the Kyoto Protocol.

While Europe as a whole is on track to meet its goal of an 8 percent reduction over 1990 emissions levels by 2012, not every country has pulled its weight. Nations unlikely to meet their individual Kyoto targets include Italy, Spain and, yes, Denmark, host of the Copenhagen talks.

Poland and Estonia, meanwhile, have been bickering with the European Commission over the amount of carbon dioxide the two countries should be allowed to emit. Both rely heavily on coal for electricity.

OPEC VS. CLEAN TECH

Oil-producing nations are worried about the impact of a global climate deal, and they have increasingly argued that any agreement that would reduce reliance on fossil fuels should include compensation for their lost revenues.

Saudi Arabia has spearheaded this argument, and while environmental groups and other stakeholders have dismissed the notion as a stunt, oil producers are not without the ability to muddle negotiations if push comes to shove.

Meanwhile, developers of wind, solar and other renewable technologies anticipate a windfall if the community of nations -- including mega-polluters like the United States -- agree to a binding climate treaty. So, too, do global banks, which would presumably do handsomely through an expanded carbon trading market.

Lobbyists from all sides will be wining and dining delegates over the next two weeks.

CARBON TAXERS VS. CARBON TRADERS

Many experts argue that the only way to tackle climate change is to put a price on carbon. Some say the best way to do that is to create a cap-and-trade system, in which industries are issued permits to emit carbon dioxide up to a certain level, or cap. Companies that emit below the cap can then sell their permits on a carbon market, where companies exceeding the cap will, presumably, buy them so they can continue to pollute. The total number of permits would not exceed an overall emissions target.

Europe has had an emissions trading scheme since 2005. Some critics argue, however, that such systems are unnecessarily complicated and prone to manipulation. A simpler solution would be a tax on carbon, they say.

But with a cap-and-trade scheme forming the bedrock of negotiations in Copenhagen, and among legislators in Congress seeking to pass national climate legislation, the carbon-tax camp has been increasingly marginalized.

EMERGENCY VS. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT

The idea that human beings are nudging the planet's thermostat upward is widely accepted among climatologists. But just how rapidly things are changing, to what extent and where -- and at what threshold, if any, should we abandon all hope -- are far less settled questions.

In 2008, the NASA scientist and global warming guruJames Hansen identified 350 parts per million as the upper limit for safe atmospheric carbon concentration. Current levels are approaching 390 parts per million.

Others argue that there is no reason for panic -- nor for what they say is an economy-crushing global climate treaty. They are putting their faith in human ingenuity, arguing that planetary-scale engineering projects like blasting seawater into the atmosphere to increase the heat reflectivity of certain clouds (yes, that's a real idea), will eventually solve the problem."
"Foreign, Monday, December 7, 2009 1358 mots, p. A 1",,"In Face of Skeptics, Experts Affirm Climate Peril","By ANDREW C. REVKIN and JOHN M. BRODER; Andrew C. Revkin reported from New York, and John M. Broder from Washington.",,"Just two years ago, a United Nations panel that synthesizes the work of hundreds of climatologists around the world called the evidence for global warming ""unequivocal.""

But as representatives of about 200 nations converge in Copenhagen on Monday to begin talks on a new international climate accord, they do so against a background of renewed attacks on the basic science of climate change.

The debate, set off by the circulation of several thousand files and e-mail messages stolen from one of the world's foremost climate research institutes, has led some who oppose limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and at least one influential country, Saudi Arabia, to question the scientific basis for the Copenhagen talks.

The uproar has threatened to complicate a multiyear diplomatic effort already ensnared in difficult political, technical and financial disputes that have caused leaders to abandon hopes of hammering out a binding international climate treaty this year.

In recent days, an array of scientists and policy makers have said that nothing so far disclosed -- the correspondence and documents include references by prominent climate scientists to deleting potentially embarrassing e-mail messages, keeping papers by competing scientists from publication and making adjustments in research data -- undercuts decades of peer-reviewed science.

Yet the intensity of the response highlights that skepticism about global warming persists, even as many scientists thought the battle over the reality of human-driven climate change was finally behind them.

On dozens of Web sites and blogs, skeptics and foes of greenhouse gas restrictions take daily aim at the scientific arguments for human-driven climate change. The stolen material was quickly seized upon for the questions it raised about the accessibility of raw data to outsiders and whether some data had been manipulated.

An investigation into the stolen files is being conducted by the University of East Anglia, in England, where the computer breach occurred. Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has also said he will look into the matter. At the same time, polls in the United States and Britain suggest that the number of people who doubt that global warming is dangerous or caused by humans has grown in recent years.

Politics, ideology and economic interests interlace the debate, and the stakes on both sides are high. If scientific predictions about global warming's effects are correct, inaction will lead at best to rising social, economic and environmental disruption, at worst to a calamity far more severe. If the forecasts are wrong, nations could divert hundreds of billions of dollars to curb greenhouse gas emissions at a time when they are struggling to recover from a global recession.

Yet the case for human-driven warming, many scientists say, is far clearer now than a decade ago, when the skeptics included many people who now are convinced that climate change is a real and serious threat.

Even some who remain skeptical about the extent or pace of global warming say that the premise underlying the Copenhagen talks is solid: that warming is to some extent driven by greenhouse gases spewing into the atmosphere from human activities like the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.

Roger A. Pielke Sr., for example, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado who has been highly critical of the United Nations climate panel and who once branded many of the scientists now embroiled in the e-mail controversy part of a climate ""oligarchy,"" said that so many independent measures existed to show unusual warming taking place that there was no real dispute about it. Moreover, he said, ""The role of added carbon dioxide as a major contributor in climate change has been firmly established.""

The Copenhagen conference itself reflects increasing acceptance of the scientific arguments: the negotiations leading to the talks were conducted by high-ranking officials of the world's governments rather than the scientists and environment ministers who largely shaped the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Late last week, President Obamachanged the date of his visit to Copenhagen to Dec. 18, the last day of the talks.

For many, a 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was a marker of a shift in the global warming debate. In it, the panel -- a volunteer network of hundreds of scientists from many disciplines who meet periodically to review climate studies and translate the results into language useful to policy makers -- concluded that no doubt remained that human-caused warming was under way and that, if unabated, it would pose rising risks.

Over the last several decades, other reviews, by the National Academy of Sciences and other institutions, have largely echoed the panel's findings and said the remaining uncertainties should not be an excuse for inaction.

The panel's report was built on two decades of intensive scientific study of climate patterns.

Greenhouse gases warm the planet by letting in sunlight and blocking the escape of some of the resulting heat. ""The physics of the greenhouse effect is so basic that instead of asking whether it would happen, it makes more sense to ask what on earth could make it not happen,"" said Spencer Weart, a physicist and historian. ""So far, nobody has been able to come up with anything plausible in that line.""

The atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases released by humans has risen rapidly in the last century, along with industrialization and electricity use. Carbon dioxide from burning of coal, oil and natural gas is the most potent of the greenhouse gases because it can persist in the atmosphere for a century or more.

Methane -- from landfills, livestock and leaking pipes, tanks and wells -- has recently been found to be a close second. And these gases not only have a heating effect, but also cause evaporation of water from sea and soil, producing water vapor, another powerful heat-trapping gas.

In reaching its conclusion, the climate panel relied only partly on temperature data like that collected by the scientists at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, whose circulated e-mail correspondence set off the current uproar. It also considered a wide range of data from other sources, including measurements showing the retreat of glaciers in mountain ranges around the world, changes in the length and character of the seasons, heating of the oceans and marked retreats of sea ice in the Arctic.

Since 1979, satellites have provided another check on surface temperature measurements. Strong disagreements about how to interpret the satellite data were largely resolved after the Bush administration began a review in which competing research groups worked out some of their differences.

Science is about probability, not certainty. And the persisting uncertainties in climate science leave room for argument. What is a realistic estimate of how much temperatures will rise? How severe will the effects be? Are there tipping points beyond which the changes are uncontrollable?

Even climate scientists disagree on many of these questions. But skeptics have been critical of the data assembled to show that warming is occurring and the analytic methods that climate scientists use, including mathematical models used to demonstrate a human cause for warming and project future trends.

Both sides also have at times been criticized for overstatement in characterizing the scientific evidence. The contents of the stolen e-mail messages and documents have given fresh ammunition to the skeptics' camp.

The Climatic Research Unit's role as a central aggregator of temperature and other climate data has also made it a target. One widely discussed file extracted from the unit's computers, presumed to be the log of a researcher named Ian Harris, recorded his years of frustration in trying to make sense of disparate data and described procedures -- or ""fudge factors,"" as he called them -- used by scientists to eliminate known sources of error.

The research in question concerned attempts to chart past temperature changes by studying tree rings and other indirect indicators, an area of research that has long been fraught with disputes. An influential study that drew in part on the British data was challenged in 2003. In 2006, a review by the National Academy of Sciences concluded, with some reservations, that ""an array of evidence"" supported the broad thrust of the research.

To skeptics, the purloined files suggest a conspiracy to foist an expensive policy agenda on the nations of the world and to keep inconsistent data from the public.

""If we were arguing about archaeology then people could hoard their data,"" said Stephen McIntyre, a blogger and retired Canadian mining consultant who since 2003 has investigated climate data, sometimes finding errors. ""But I don't think the public has any time for that"" in the climate debate.

Many scientists, however, deny that any important data was held back and say that the e-mail messages and documents will in the end prove merely another manufactured controversy.

""There will remain after the dust settles in this controversy a very strong scientific consensus on key characteristics of the problem,"" John Holdren, President Obama's science adviser, told a Congressional hearing last week. ""Global climate is changing in highly unusual ways compared to long experienced and expected natural variations.""

Whichever view prevails, the questions will undoubtedly linger well after the negotiators who are trying to work out the complex issues that still stand in the way of an international climate treaty leave Copenhagen."

COPENHAGEN - Two mock gateways set up by environmental campaigners -- a fiery red one symbolizing the perils of climate change and a green one representing an international climate accord to address it -- greeted delegates on Monday as they filed into a conference center here.

""Political deals and global warming this way,"" the advocates shouted as they beckoned the delegates toward the inverted U-shaped red gate. Placards at the entrance to the green one read: ""Binding Deal for a Safe Future.""

The delegates, who had first passed under a giant wind turbine blade, were not required to go through the gates, set up by the Worldwide Fund for Nature. But some chose to: one man jokingly did the limbo all the way through the red hellfire passage.

Dante or Michelangelo might have sniffed at the text and the visuals. But evocations of Judgment Day were a consistent undercurrent in speeches and conference materials on the opening day of the meetings, where representatives of about 200 nations hope to hammer out the details of an international climate accord.

To help establish the mood, the choreographers of the meeting screened a short film. In one scene, a young girl awakens to a grim inheritance should negotiators leave the meeting empty-handed: a scorched earth, menacing storms and an all-swallowing sea. ""Please,"" the girl says to the camera as violins rise to a crescendo, ""help the world.""

As with the climate talks in Poznan, Poland, in 2008 and in Bali, Indonesia, in 2007, any serious political horse trading among nations is expected to take place in the second week, when world leaders arrive. President Obama is scheduled to visit on Dec. 18, the last day of the meetings.

Meanwhile, the assembled delegates listened to opening remarks and prepared to hunker down and sort out things like beach erosion, targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, payments to developing countries for preserving forests and other thorny issues.

""Let's get it done!"" said Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister presiding over the conference.

But with no sign that the many factions in the climate debate were any closer to agreement, Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, nodded to the gravity of the challenge.

""Welcome to two weeks where we are to perform what is most difficult in politics,"" he said.

A Plan With Skeptics

Jonathan Pershing, the State Department's deputy special envoy on climate change, talked about emissions reductions at a news conference after the opening session, defending the targets promised by the United States -- a reduction in the range of 17 percent over 2005 levels by 2020, 30 percent by 2025, etc.

But a British reporter wanted to know about the e-mail messages and documents that a British climate research center says were stolen from one of its servers: Would they undermine the talks?

The files -- which include mentions of deleting potentially embarrassing e-mail messages, seeming attempts to block the publication of papers by competing scientists and adjustments to research data -- have been seized upon by skeptics as evidence of corruption in climate science. But Mr. Pershing predicted that the e-mail flap would end up as ""a small blip on the history of this process.""

""I think they'll have virtually no effect,"" he said, adding that the e-mail messages had also ""released a barrage of additional information which makes clear the robustness of the science, the multitude -- the enormous multitude -- of different strands of evidence that support the urgency and the severity of the problem.""

Mr. Pershing said it was ""unfortunate, and in fact shameful,"" that ""some scientists who've devoted their lives are being pilloried in the press without due regard to process.""

Moving Right Along

As the plenary session moved from harp and trumpet music to administrative details, Ms. Hedegaard, the hard-driving climate minister serving as president of the conference, was clearly fearing a long series of long-winded speeches. Be brief, she beseeched the participants, and keep things moving. But perhaps predictably, few listened.

Kevin Conrad, a representative of Papua New Guinea known for admonishing the United States for slowing things down at negotiations in Bali in 2007, interrupted what was supposed to be a procedural nicety, the reading of the rules. He said he disagreed with the rules and wanted to make a change. Ms. Hedegaard encouraged him to delay consideration of the issue. But he doggedly pressed his buzzer again, asking when she would hear him out.

Ms. Hedegaard finally yielded. Later this week, she said.

A Dubious Honor

In the evening, it was time for the announcement of the Fossil of the Day awards.

Since 1999, that dubious honor has been doled out each day at annual climate talks. Environmentalists vote for the country judged to have made the most outstanding effort to block progress in negotiations.

Clad in a tuxedo, Ben Wikler of Cambridge, Mass., announced that Canada had come in third. He cited statements before the conference by Canada's environment minister, Jim Prentice, that the ""hype"" around the event would not sway the country to bolster its emission targets.

Second place went to Finland, Austria and Sweden, for floating a proposal, since adopted by the European Union, to prevent countries from being penalized for the full extent of greenhouse gas emissions from logging.

First place, he said, went to all the industrialized countries ""for collectively showing up in Copenhagen with too low an ambition level to cut carbon and prevent catastrophic climate change."""
"Foreign, Tuesday, December 8, 2009 989 mots",,Climate Talks Open With Calls for Urgent Action,By TOM ZELLER Jr.; Andrew C. Revkin and James Kanter contributed reporting from Copenhagen.,,"COPENHAGEN -- A much-anticipated global meeting of nearly 200 nations -- all seeking what has so far been elusive common ground on the issue of climate change -- began here on Monday with an impassioned airing of what leaders here called the political and moral imperatives at hand.

""The clock has ticked down to zero,"" said the United Nations' climate chief, Yvo de Boer. ""After two years of negotiation, the time has come to deliver.""

From now until Dec. 18, delegates will try to hammer out some of the most vexing details involved in the pursuit of a global climate accord.

While the critical action will unfold much later in the process, when higher-level ministers and, ultimately, heads of state arrive, the opening day of the conference was an opportunity for the United Nations to nurture a sense of mission and for delegates to begin staking out their positions.

Among the most difficult hurdles, many participants acknowledged throughout the day, are achieving adequate cuts in greenhouse gas emissions -- particularly from big polluters like the United States and China.

So, too, are securing commitments from wealthy nations to deliver what could ultimately be hundreds of billions of dollars in financing to poor countries, which argue that they are ill equipped to deal with a problem they did little to create.

Several countries announced new emissions goals in the days leading up to the meeting, including China, Brazil, the United States, India and South Africa -- although many participants have noted that the targets are far too low to keep rising temperatures in check in coming decades.

The pledges so far are ""not going to get us as far we need to go, to really stay within the two-degree limit,"" said Koko Warner, an observer with the United Nations University in Bonn, Germany. He was referring to scientists' recommendations that temperature increases be capped at two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.

""We don't want to admit it, because the consequences are so bad,"" she said.

Still, speakers at the conference's opening plenary session -- which began with a video appeal from children across the world to save them from what looked like an apocalyptic future of deserts and rising seas -- were clearly aiming to spur negotiators forward.

After several hundred delegates and observers settled inside the main conference hall of the Bella Center to music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish Girls Choir, Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister presiding over the conference, noted the recent string of emissions commitments by various countries.

""Every positive announcement will improve our chances of staying below the two degrees Celsius target,"" she said. ""But as we all know only too well, we are not there yet.""

""This goes for financing as well,"" Ms. Hedegaard said, noting that arriving at a consensus on that issue ""may be an even bigger challenge"" than emissions cuts.

Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, spoke before delegates of the urgent need for action. And, alluding to a recent controversy over e-mail messages between scientists hacked from a university computer server, he had pointed remarks for those who ""find it difficult to accept"" climate change science.

Climate change skeptics have argued that the e-mail shows that the evidence for global warming is less unequivocal than scientists assert.

But Dr. Pachauri ticked off a list of trends that robustly reflect the warming of the global climate. ""Internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including the individuals singled out in these e-mail messages,"" he said.

Both inside and outside the plenary session, the mood among negotiators and other participants was one of cautious optimism. Alden Meyer, who directs climate policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said he was encouraged that the meeting appeared to have nudged previously reluctant nations to begin offering up emissions cuts.

""It has focused attention and gotten all the major players to put their initial offers on the table,"" Mr. Meyer said. ""I think that's good news.""

Still, negotiators who have spent the last year working out the technical details of a potential treaty are now coming up hard against political pressures at much higher levels that will ultimately shape any agreement.

The challenge, Mr. Meyer said, will be getting parties to ""rise above the politics as usual"" that threatens to bog down the process.

Jonathan Pershing, the State Department's special climate envoy, who represented the United States at the opening plenary, said he saw strong signs that the conference would prove critical in getting traction on curbing emissions and helping poor countries that are urgently threatened by climate change -- particularly given the decision by more than 100 leaders, including President Obama, to attend.

He said he saw no indication that efforts could be blunted by Saudi Arabia and other countries that have cited the e-mail flap in challenging climate findings.

At a subsequent news conference, however, Mr. Pershing faced questions from European reporters about the adequacy of Mr. Obama's plan for emissions cuts, which is roughly parallel to what is laid out in legislation in the House and Senate.

Mr. Pershing said the American proposal -- which calls for a reduction in emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, 42 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050 -- was in keeping with cuts that scientists say would avert the worst dangers, but only if all countries, including emerging economies, did their part.

""It's a vision that moves the United States down the curve of greenhouse gas emissions at a level that no other country has even begun to seriously contemplate,"" Mr. Pershing said. While the United States produces one-fifth of worldwide greenhouse emissions, he noted, four-fifths are coming from elsewhere.

""Unless the world can combine its efforts, we won't solve the problem,"" he said.

Outside the Bella Center, calls were growing for conference participants to overcome their differences and deliver results in coming days.

An open letter from a coalition of groups, including Friends of the Earth, the Third World Network and others, accused Danish leaders of ""undemocratic practices"" and of ""convening small and exclusive groups of countries before the Copenhagen meeting.""

The assertion is a reference to rumors that ""alternate"" treaties are being readied by some big players, including conference organizers, should efforts to resolve differences on the current text prove fruitless.

Meanwhile, 56 newspapers around the world published the same editorial calling for ""decisive action"" in Copenhagen.

""In scientific journals the question is no longer whether humans are to blame, but how little time we have got left to limit the damage,"" read the editorial, which was widely distributed in a campaign led by Britain's Guardian newspaper. ""Yet so far the world's response has been feeble and half-hearted.""

Continued inaction will ravage the planet and wreak havoc on economies and livelihoods, the editorial's authors warned.

""The politicians in Copenhagen have the power to shape history's judgment on this generation: one that saw a challenge and rose to it, or one so stupid that we saw calamity coming but did nothing to avert it,"" the editorial said. ""We implore them to make the right choice."""
"Editorial, Wednesday, December 9, 2009 647 mots, p. A 43",,OP-ED COLUMNIST,,,"By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

In 2006, Ron Suskind published ""The One Percent Doctrine,"" a book about the U.S. war on terrorists after 9/11. The title was drawn from an assessment by then-Vice President Dick Cheney, who, in the face of concerns that a Pakistani scientist was offering nuclear-weapons expertise to Al Qaeda, reportedly declared: ""If there's a 1% chance that Pakistani scientists are helping Al Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response."" Cheney contended that the U.S. had to confront a very new type of threat: a ""low-probability, high-impact event.""

Soon after Suskind's book came out, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein, who then was at the University of Chicago, pointed out that Mr. Cheney seemed to be endorsing the same ""precautionary principle"" that also animated environmentalists. Sunstein wrote in his blog: ""According to the Precautionary Principle, it is appropriate to respond aggressively to low-probability, high-impact events -- such as climate change. Indeed, another vice president -- Al Gore -- can be understood to be arguing for a precautionary principle for climate change (though he believes that the chance of disaster is well over 1 percent).""

Of course, Mr. Cheney would never accept that analogy. Indeed, many of the same people who defend Mr. Cheney's One Percent Doctrine on nukes tell us not to worry at all about catastrophic global warming, where the odds are, in fact, a lot higher than 1 percent, if we stick to business as usual. That is unfortunate, because Cheney's instinct is precisely the right framework with which to think about the climate issue -- and this whole ""climategate"" controversy as well.

""Climategate"" was triggered on Nov. 17 when an unidentified person hacked into the e-mails and data files of the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, one of the leading climate science centers in the world -- and then posted them on the Internet. In a few instances, they revealed some leading climatologists seemingly massaging data to show more global warming and excluding contradictory research.

Frankly, I found it very disappointing to read a leading climate scientist writing that he used a ""trick"" to ""hide"" a putative decline in temperatures or was keeping contradictory research from getting a proper hearing. Yes, the climate-denier community, funded by big oil, has published all sorts of bogus science for years -- and the world never made a fuss. That, though, is no excuse for serious climatologists not adhering to the highest scientific standards at all times.

That said, be serious: The evidence that our planet, since the Industrial Revolution, has been on a broad warming trend outside the normal variation patterns -- with periodic micro-cooling phases -- has been documented by a variety of independent research centers.

As this paper just reported: ""Despite recent fluctuations in global temperature year to year, which fueled claims of global cooling, a sustained global warming trend shows no signs of ending, according to new analysis by the World Meteorological Organization made public on Tuesday. The decade of the 2000s is very likely the warmest decade in the modern record.""

This is not complicated. We know that our planet is enveloped in a blanket of greenhouse gases that keep the Earth at a comfortable temperature. As we pump more carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse gases into that blanket from cars, buildings, agriculture, forests and industry, more heat gets trapped.

What we don't know, because the climate system is so complex, is what other factors might over time compensate for that man-driven warming, or how rapidly temperatures might rise, melt more ice and raise sea levels. It's all a game of odds. We've never been here before. We just know two things: one, the CO2 we put into the atmosphere stays there for many years, so it is ""irreversible"" in real-time (barring some feat of geo-engineering); and two, that CO2 buildup has the potential to unleash ""catastrophic"" warming.

When I see a problem that has even a 1 percent probability of occurring and is ""irreversible"" and potentially ""catastrophic,"" I buy insurance. That is what taking climate change seriously is all about.

If we prepare for climate change by building a clean-power economy, but climate change turns out to be a hoax, what would be the result? Well, during a transition period, we would have higher energy prices. But gradually we would be driving battery-powered electric cars and powering more and more of our homes and factories with wind, solar, nuclear and second-generation biofuels. We would be much less dependent on oil dictators who have drawn a bull's-eye on our backs; our trade deficit would improve; the dollar would strengthen; and the air we breathe would be cleaner. In short, as a country, we would be stronger, more innovative and more energy independent.

But if we don't prepare, and climate change turns out to be real, life on this planet could become a living hell. And that's why I'm for doing the Cheney-thing on climate -- preparing for 1 percent."
"Foreign, Wednesday, December 9, 2009 857 mots, p. A 1",,Climate Deal Likely to Bear Big Price Tag,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - If negotiators reach an accord at the climate talks in Copenhagen it will entail profound shifts in energy production, dislocations in how and where people live, sweeping changes in agriculture and forestry and the creation of complex new markets in global warming pollution credits.

So what is all this going to cost?

The short answer is trillions of dollars over the next few decades. It is a significant sum but a relatively small fraction of the world's total economic output. In energy infrastructure alone, the transformational ambitions that delegates to the United Nationsclimate change conference are expected to set in the coming days will cost more than $10 trillion in additional investment from 2010 to 2030, according to a new estimate from the International Energy Agency.

As scary as that number sounds, the agency said that the costs would ramp up relatively slowly and be largely offset by economic benefits in new jobs, improved lives, more secure energy supplies and a reduced danger of climate catastrophe. Most of the investment will come from private rather than public funds, the agency contends.

""People often ask about the costs,"" said Kevin Parker, global head of Deutsche Bank Asset Management, who tracks climate policy. ""But the figures people tend to cite don't take into account conservation and efficiency measures that are easily available. And they don't look at the cost of inaction, which is the extinction of the human race.""

Whatever global warming's effects -- and most scientific projections are less dire -- there are also varying estimates of the economic costs of failing to act to address the problem soon, some of them very high.

Some of the most difficult topics for negotiators center on any potential deal's near-term financial arrangements. The poorest and most vulnerable nations seek a gigantic transfer of wealth from richer nations to island nations and countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America that are most likely to feel the ravages of climate change.

Many poor nations are insisting that richer nations make deeper emissions cuts and contribute more to help poorer nations, a split that widened Tuesday as competing documents of a potential deal circulated.

Over time, some of the hundreds of billions of dollars the poorer countries are demanding will begin to flow, as global carbon markets become established and governments in rich countries begin to open the spigot.

But for now, the industrialized countries have proposed a relatively modest fund of about $10 billion a year for the next three or four years to help poorer countries adapt. Even that effort remains the subject of conflict over which countries should contribute how much, what body should oversee the spending and how to determine which projects qualify.

President Obama's spokesman said last week that Mr. Obama supported a short-term fund to aid developing nations and that the United States would pay ""its fair share."" In many multilateral efforts, the United States picks up a quarter to a third of the tab.

""Providing this assistance,"" the White House said, ""is not only a humanitarian imperative -- it's an investment in our common security, as no climate change accord can succeed if it does not help all countries reduce their emissions.""

The money would be used to help developing nations reduce emissions by switching to renewable energy sources like wind and solar and by compensating landowners for not cutting down or burning forests, a major source of emissions. Other funds might be used to adjust to effects of a changing climate, like rising seas, by building flood walls or relocating settlements.

Mr. Obama will go to Copenhagen on Dec. 18 for the final day of the meeting, a sign that the White House believes that a far-reaching accord is possible.

""This is the question that is being posed in Copenhagen,"" said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard. ""How much money do the developed countries have to put on the table to bring developing countries into the conversation?""

Mr. Stavins said that the bulk of the money would have to come from private investment because, he said, it was ""inconceivable"" that the governments of the wealthy countries would come up with adequate financing and also because private entities spent money much more efficiently.

The climate and energy legislation passed by the House in June sets aside roughly $8 billion a year for assistance to developing countries by 2030, he said.

Alvaro Umana Quesada, the leader of Costa Rica's delegation, said that it was important to the developing world to have early resources and a predictable flow of long-term financing. He said that the $10 billion in so-called quick start financing now on the table was adequate but that such spending had to rise to roughly $80 billion and as much as $150 billion a year by 2020.

""That is not very much compared to the size of the world economy or the financial crisis bailouts,"" he said. ""There are great needs for adaptation, where the small island nations are really at risk. Some of them are one severe weather event away from disappearing.""

The European Union has endorsed a fund of that size; the United States remains noncommittal. Mr. Obama has asked for $1.2 billion in climate-related financing in the 2010 budget.

Perhaps the most detailed analysis of the financing needs of any climate agreement comes from Project Catalyst, an initiative of the European Union and ClimateWorks, a policy group.

The group estimates that roughly $100 billion will be needed by 2020 to finance climate-change programs in the developing world. About half could come from the growing global market in carbon emissions credits under a cap-and-trade system, which would be worth an estimated $2 trillion a year by 2020.

A cap-and-trade system is operating in Europe and is being considered by Congress. It sets a ceiling on the carbon emissions of a country or industry and allows trading of pollution permits within the cap. As the limit on emissions grows tighter, the price of pollution permits rises, creating a market in carbon credits.

Countries would grant some of the carbon market allowances directly to energy and environmental programs in the developing world, with other funds coming from a fee on each transaction.

An additional $10 billion to $20 billion would come from taxes on fuels used in aviation and shipping. The rest, $25 billion to $35 billion, would be loans and grants from rich nations to poorer ones."
"Foreign, Thursday, December 10, 2009 540 mots, p. A 8",,"And in This Corner, Climate Contrarians",By TOM ZELLER Jr.,,"COPENHAGEN - Their numbers were small and former Vice President Al Gore was not among them.

But the climate skeptics who met inside a stuffy second-floor gallery near this city's Christianshavn neighborhood on Wednesday displayed at least as much passion for their cause as the environmental activists who have flocked to Copenhagen to push for action on global warming.

""They've got us outnumbered,"" said Ian Plimer, an Australian geologist, who has interests in several mining operations. ""But we've got them outgunned.""

Sitting in tidy rows of chairs, the group's members -- who included an atmospheric physicist, a gentleman farmer, a policy adviser and about 60 others -- sipped coffee, shared PowerPoint presentations and discussed climate. Or rather, what they see as a world gone mad over global warming.

The scientific evidence for human-driven climate change may be widely accepted. But those who gathered in the tiny parlor offered a variety of alternative explanations. One presentation contended that volcanoes emitted far more carbon dioxide than human activities like the burning of fossil fuels. Another presentation disputed data suggesting that sea levels were rising. Still another asserted that solar activity caused climate shifts.

Speaking of the case made by scientists for global warming, S. Fred Singer, an atmospheric physicist, said: ""They have no evidence. None.""

The two-day event was organized in part to show that ""climate realists,"" as they prefer to be called, are nothing if not diverse in their views.

But the contrarian spirit of the meeting was buoyed by the recent uproar over a trove of e-mail messages and documents stolen -- or liberated, as the skeptics see it -- from a renowned British climate research center. The material, which mentions adjustments to data, has been seized upon by global warming doubters as evidence of a conspiracy to promote the idea of human-driven climate change. Many scientists, however, have said that the contents of the messages and documents do not undercut decades of peer-reviewed science.

Among the skeptics who assembled in the parlor, the prevailing theory about the e-mail messages was that they had been leaked by a whistle-blower who would eventually be celebrated as a hero.

""In my view, not only will he not be prosecuted, but he should not be prosecuted,"" said Christopher Monckton, a policy adviser with the Science and Public Policy Institute, a British group concerned chiefly with trying to debunk the notion of a climate crisis.

Lord Monckton, like many at the meeting, was concerned about the economic effects of putting limits on emissions of greenhouse gases.

Such restrictions, he said, would be devastating to the economies of all countries, particularly poor nations'.

He added, ""That's why it's necessary to allow them to burn plenty of fossil fuels, because that's the cheapest way to get the electricity that will help to lift them from poverty.""

The participants at the meeting agreed that their views -- as scientists, economists and passionate lay people -- were not taken seriously enough.

""We're unified in the idea that these theories have not received a fair shake,"" said Craig Rucker, the conference chairman.

Still, even at this meeting those theories did not go unchallenged.

John Vidal, environment editor for The Guardian in London, demanded that a panel's members explain why a variety of villages in India and Bangladesh were slowly being swallowed by the sea if, as the Swedish physicist and geologist Nils-Axel Morner had contended the day before, sea levels were not rising.

Mr. Morner, who has spent much time measuring sea levels in South Asia, said his most recent data pointed to plenty of erosion, but ""zero rise in sea level.""

Then, as debates over global warming often do, the discussion dissolved into incomprehensible shouting."
"Foreign, Thursday, December 10, 2009 496 mots, p. A 12",,U.S. Negotiator Dismisses Reparations for Climate,By ANDREW C. REVKIN and TOM ZELLER Jr.,,"COPENHAGEN - The top American envoy to climate talks here flatly rejected arguments Wednesday by diplomats from poor lands that the United States owes a debt to developing nations for decades of American emissions that contributed to global warming.

It was not the first time that the American negotiator, Todd D. Stern, had dismissed the notion. But his words highlighted the divide that persists between the poor and the wealthy as nearly 200 nations try to sketch the outlines of a new pact on climate change here.

Asked about arguments by diplomats and some protesters that the United States should provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid to developing nations as reparations, Mr. Stern, the special envoy for climate change, bluntly fired back at a news conference.

""I actually completely reject the notion of a debt or reparations or anything of the like,"" he said. ""For most of the 200 years since the Industrial Revolution, people were blissfully ignorant of the fact that emissions caused a greenhouse effect. It's a relatively recent phenomenon.""

At the same time, he made clear that the United States was prepared to join other industrialized countries both in cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and in giving aid to the poorest and most vulnerable countries to deal with rising seas, drought and other phenomena that are expected to worsen as the planet warms.

Mr. Stern also demurred at a persistent proposal among some larger developing countries that the United States and other major emitters of long standing provide financial aid to emerging economic powerhouses, particularly China, to shift to cleaner energy technologies.

""China has $2 trillion in reserves,"" said Mr. Stern, whose arrival in Copenhagen on Wednesday suggested that the talks, which run through Dec. 18, were moving into a more significant phase. ""We don't think China would be the first candidate for public funding.""

The framework for a potential accord must be in decent shape before top ministers arrive to prepare for the more than 100 heads of state, including President Obama, who will come to close out the negotiations at the end of next week.

For Mr. Obama and other leaders who have made action on climate a priority, the pressure is enormous to produce an agreement that has enough concrete commitments to be considered politically binding and pave the way for a formal treaty next year.

Reflecting the pressures on Mr. Obama, Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, defended the president's record in a speech at the climate conference and made a pointed jab at Bush administration policies.

""In less than 11 months since taking office, we have done more to promote clean energy and prevent climate change than happened in the last eight years,"" she said.

She cited investments under the fiscal stimulus bill, new fuel emissions standards for cars and her agency's finding that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide pose a danger to public health, a decision that gives it regulatory power over emitters.

Ms. Jackson also sought to assure delegates that the Obama administration would press Congress to pass climate and energy legislation that is stalled in the Senate. The delays have fostered unease about Washington's willingness to set emissions targets or ratify a global treaty should one be reached in 2010.

Across Copenhagen, police officers are meanwhile gearing up for protests. The police reported that they raided a building early Wednesday in the city's Osterbro section and confiscated paint bombs and equipment like bolt cutters that they said demonstrators were readying to overcome barricades. No arrests were reported. A large-scale march is planned on Saturday."
"Foreign, Friday, December 11, 2009 736 mots, p. A 12",,"American Climate Envoy's Good Cop, Bad Cop Roles",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - As the United States' chief climate change negotiator, Todd Stern sometimes plays the bad cop, and seems to rather enjoy it.

He arrived in Copenhagen on Wednesday, took a quick shower, then called a news conference, where he blasted the Chinese for not doing enough to reduce climate-altering emissions, the Europeans for demanding too much of the United States and the tiniest and poorest nations for demanding ""reparations"" from rich countries for their part in polluting the planet.

""We absolutely recognize our historic role in putting emissions in the atmosphere up there that are there now,"" Mr. Stern said sternly, ""but the sense of guilt or culpability or reparations, I just categorically reject that.""

But there is a good cop, too. Those who work with him or who have sat across the negotiating table from him say that though he can be blunt, Mr. Stern is generally accommodating, low-key and highly artful in handling one of the most difficult diplomatic portfolios in government.

Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister and chief climate negotiator, said this week of Mr. Stern, ""Obviously India's stance on climate change is quite different from that of the United States, and there are many things in U.S. policy that I disagree with strongly, but that has not stood in the way of our developing a warm personal rapport.""

Mr. Ramesh recalled taking a long walk with Mr. Stern around a lake in Copenhagen last month during a preliminary meeting to the major climate conference under way there now. The two men engaged in a detailed discussion of a technical but important issue in the climate treaty talks: how to verify that developing countries are meeting their emissions-reductions promises.

The United States is insisting on a fairly intrusive monitoring regime, particularly for those projects that receive international financing. India and other developing countries reject some such measures as infringements of their sovereignty. While they did not come to agreement during their walk, Mr. Ramesh said: ""We discussed our differences frankly. He understood me better, I think, and I certainly got a fuller understanding of where he was coming from.""

Mr. Stern, 58, was named special envoy for climate change in late January. He came to the post from a background more political than technical, although he has been involved in the climate change issue since 1997, when he was a member of the Clinton administration team negotiating the Kyoto Protocol.

Tall, bespectacled and lean, he is a native of Chicago and a graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School. He worked at a New York law firm and on the Senate Judiciary Committee staff for Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat, before being recruited to help prepare Bill Clinton for the 1992 presidential debates.

He was rewarded with the largely invisible but influential role as White House staff secretary, overseeing the paper flow to the president and making sure that executive branch directives were carried out.

While at the White House, Mr. Stern met his future wife, Jennifer Klein, a young policy aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton. The couple now have three boys, ages 4 to 13. Ms. Klein works part time on women's issues under Mrs. Clinton, now the secretary of state and Mr. Stern's boss.

During the Clinton administration, Mr. Stern immersed himself in the climate change issue for the Kyoto talks, and took away from it an important lesson: Do not get ahead of the Senate in negotiating an international agreement. Although the Clinton administration accepted the terms of the Kyoto pact, including mandatory reductions in emissions in the United States, the Senate refused -- by a unanimous vote -- to even consider ratifying the treaty because it made no demands of developing nations.

Some countries, particularly in Europe, would like to see the current round of negotiations result in an extension or expansion of the Kyoto accord -- major provisions of which expire in 2012 -- this time involving the United States.

Cue the bad cop.

""We are certainly not going to become part of the Kyoto Protocol, so that's not on the table,"" Mr. Stern said at his news conference on Wednesday. ""If you mean basically taking the Kyoto Protocol and putting a new title on it, we're not going to do that either.""

A senior administration official who is part of the current climate negotiating team said that some of Mr. Stern's feistiness came from the year of pummeling he had taken as the American spokesman for an often unpopular agenda.

""This is an issue where the United States traditionally did not have a lot of friends,"" said this official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak more freely. ""I remember at one early meeting, you would have thought there hadn't been an election here. These other representatives were so used to beating up on the United States under the Bush administration that Todd and I had to remind them there was a different administration with a different approach.""

Mr. Stern said one of his biggest frustrations was the inability of his counterparts to understand the political constraints he must operate under.

""They look at what Congress has already done and say, 'Can't you do 10 percent more?' The answer is no, not really,"" Mr. Stern said. ""They have learned more about our Congressional system and things like filibuster rules than they probably ever wanted to know."""
"Foreign, Saturday, December 12, 2009 905 mots",,Europe Pledges Billions in Climate Change Funding,"By JAMES KANTER and ANDREW C. REVKIN; James Kanter reported from Brussels, and Andrew C. Revkin from Copenhagen. Tom Zeller contributed reporting from Copenhagen, and John Broder from Washington.",,"BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders agreed on Friday to pay $10.5 billion over the next three years to help poor countries begin tackling the effects of global warming -- and to improve the odds of reaching an international climate accord next week at a conference in Copenhagen.

But the developing world is also seeking a commitment from industrial powers to provide long-term financing of more than $100 billion each year by the end of the next decade. European Union leaders left unanswered how much they would give in the longer term.

The push in Brussels, where the European Union is based, came as a group of negotiators in Copenhagen who were convened by the United Nations issued a six-page informal outline of a new climate agreement. The outline sought to pull together a growing stream of conflicting proposals from nations involved in the climate-treaty talks.

The outline calls for wealthy nations to commit themselves to sharp reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in the next decade, and for all nations to seek jointly to nearly eliminate the emissions by 2050.

But the disagreements on vital numbers remained wide, and sections of the outline concerning some contested issues were left entirely blank. Among the sidestepped items were any long-term goals for financing the deal and provisions for how trade rules might be employed.

Expressing skepticism at a briefing, Todd Stern, the top American negotiator, said that the proposal lacked any language requiring emerging economic powers like China and India to take concrete steps to curb emissions.

Mr. Stern said that the United States would remain steadfast in demanding such a commitment, given that nearly all of the growth in emissions of greenhouse gases in the coming decades is projected to come from such countries.

Suggesting that much remains to be done, he said the section of the outline on curbing emissions reflected ""old think"" and was ""unbalanced in a whole host of ways.""

Still, he struck a note of optimism. He said that after months of one-on-one discussions with counterparts from China, he was confident that there was ""language we could both agree to, if we can get to the serious stage.""

The European Union's pledge to contribute to a global climate fund -- one that the United Nations has said should add up to $30 billion over the next three years -- is one of the largest financing efforts announced so far. The money is meant to help vulnerable nations adapt to the effects of climate change and develop their economies in ways that will help limit emissions of carbon dioxide.

The pledge ""is a very clear message indeed to Copenhagen that we are more than ready to assume our share of responsibility,"" Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said at a news conference in Brussels after a meeting of European Union heads of state and government.

Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain sought to underline what was at stake in Copenhagen, both for developing nations threatened by climate change and for wealthier nations seeking to remold the ways they produce and consume energy.

He said there were ""few moments in history when nations are summoned to common decisions that will reshape the lives of men and women potentially for generations to come.""

In Copenhagen, some of the smallest and most vulnerable countries -- island states facing the prospect of centuries of rising seas in a warming world -- fired off a warning shot in the form of a new draft text of their own.

They called for the proposed ceiling for a rise in global temperature accepted by most nations to be lowered by 0.5 degrees Celsius.

The world's industrialized countries and emerging economic powers have pledged over the past year to work to limit warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above where temperatures stood in the 1800s. That translates roughly into a rise of no more than 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit from today's average global temperature of about 59 degrees.

But given projections for greenhouse gas emissions and what is known about how the gases trap heat, even that target will be tough to reach, many climate scientists say.

Money is central to the demands by poor nations. Most African countries and small island states have demanded aid as a condition for signing a new pact to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.

The European Union has led efforts to raise money for what is known as a fast-start fund, with its contributions meant to be joined by donations from other advanced nations, including the United States.

But it is not yet clear if or when the money will be available.

The Obama administration has asked Congress for $1.2 billion in financing for adaptation, technology transfer and clean-energy projects in the developing world. But Congress has not yet acted on the request.

The rest of the hoped-for American contribution could come from a government auction of emissions permits as part of a cap-and-trade system for limiting emissions by American industries. But legislation on such a system still is stuck in the Senate.

In Brussels, Ms. Merkel warned on Friday that long-term financing for developing countries would be crucial to any deal next week. ""This is the biggest headache to me,"" she said.

She also suggested that the United States needed to make a commitment to long-term financing before the European Union clarified how much it would put on the table.

Meanwhile. Mr. Brown and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France supported using ""innovative financing mechanisms,"" like a tax on global financial transactions, to help developing countries transform their energy systems.

Advocacy groups and some environmental campaigners condemned the pledges in Brussels as inadequate.

Tim Gore, a climate change advisor for Oxfam, a group that fights poverty, said the offer was ""mostly a recycling of past promises and payments that have already been made,"" and would siphon funds from areas other than climate protection.

Fredrik Reinfeldt, the Swedish prime minister, acknowledged that the pledges were ""a combination of new and old resources.""

Over the weekend, attention is expected to shift back to Copenhagen, where environment ministers are to hold negotiations. Police officers there have begun bracing for several planned protests. On Friday, at least 76 protesters were arrested in various parts of the city center after signaling an intention to disrupt business at the sites of several international corporations in Copenhagen, including the shipping giant Maersk, McDonald's and other firms.

Chants of ""our climate is not your business!"" could be heard as groups of demonstrators made their way through the streets, many of them carrying maps and instructions about which businesses to make targets.

On Saturday, a much larger demonstration is planned by a broad coalition of organizations. Protesters are expected to march along an approved route from the Parliament to the Bella Center, where thousands of negotiators and delegates are gathered."
"Foreign, Monday, December 14, 2009 1210 mots, p. A 1",,"In Bolivia, Water and Ice Tell A Story of a Changing Climate","By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Jean Friedman-Rudovsky contributed reporting from El Alto, Bolivia.",,"EL ALTO, Bolivia - When the tap across from her mud-walled home dried up in September, Celia Cruz stopped making soups and scaled back washing for her family of five. She began daily pilgrimages to better-off neighborhoods, hoping to find water there.

Though she has lived here for a decade and her husband, a construction worker, makes a decent wage, money cannot buy water.

""I'm thinking of moving back to the countryside; what else can I do?"" said Ms. Cruz, 33, wearing traditional braids and a long tiered skirt as she surveyed a courtyard dotted with piglets, bags of potatoes and an ancient red Datsun. ""Two years ago this was never a problem. But if there's not water, you can't live.""

The glaciers that have long provided water and electricity to this part of Bolivia are melting and disappearing, victims of global warming, most scientists say.

If the water problems are not solved, El Alto, a poor sister city of La Paz, could perhaps be the first large urban casualty of climate change. A World Bank report concluded last year that climate change would eliminate many glaciers in the Andes within 20 years, threatening the existence of nearly 100 million people.

For the nearly 200 nations trying to hammer out an international climate accord in Copenhagen, the question of how to address the needs of dozens of countries like Bolivia is a central focus of the negotiations and a major obstacle to a treaty.

World leaders have long agreed that rich nations must provide money and technology to help developing nations adapt to problems that, to a large extent, have been created by smokestacks and tailpipes far away. But the specifics of that transfer -- which countries will pay, how much and for what kinds of projects -- remain contentious.

Last week, a group of the poorest small countries debated whether they would stage a walk-out in Copenhagen if rich nations failed to provide enough money. Todd Stern, the lead negotiator for the United States, while reiterating that the United States would help pay, bridled at the idea that the money was a ""climate debt."" And on Friday, the European Unionmade an initial pledge to pay $3.5 billion annually for three years to help poor countries cope -- though economists project the total cost to be $100 billion or more.

An Angry Voice

With its recent climate-induced catastrophes, Bolivia has become an angry voice for poor nations, demanding that any financing be paid out in full and rapidly.

""We have a big problem and even money won't completely solve it,"" said Pablo Solon, Bolivia's ambassador to the United Nations. ""What do you do when your glacier disappears or your island is under water?""

Scientists say that money and engineering could solve La Paz-El Alto's water problems, with projects including a well-designed reservoir. The glaciers that ring the cities have essentially provided natural low-maintenance storage, collecting water in the short rainy season and releasing it for water and electricity in the long dry one. With warmer temperatures and changing rainfall, they no longer do so.

""The effects are appearing much more rapidly than we can respond to them, and a reservoir takes five to seven years to build. I'm not sure we have that long,"" said Edson Ramirez, a Bolivian glaciologist who has documented and projected the glaciers' retreat for two decades.

The retreat has outpaced his wildest dreams. He had predicted that one glacier, Chacaltaya, would last until 2020. It disappeared this year. .

But global warming alone cannot be blamed for the longstanding woes of this exotic but desperately poor landlocked country, where per capita income is around $1,000. Urban water supplies are also taxed by population growth as well as checkered management, in part because there is little money to manage anything, but also because the government nationalized the water company a few years ago, having declared water a human right. El Alto still does not employ a full-time water technician.

Populations at the Brink

""These are populations at the brink of surviving anyway, and then you have the extra stress of climate change and you have huge social problems,"" said Dirk Hoffmann, head of the climate change program at the Universidad Mayor de San Andres in La Paz. ""What's at stake is conflict -- you wouldn't talk about civil war exactly. But it will be unrest.""

In fact, when taps dried up in Celia Cruz's neighborhood, the Solidarity District of El Alto, rich La Paz residents still had water. In a nation that has rallied behind socialist rhetoric and indigenous rights, there were complaints. ""The sense of injustice is palpable,"" said Edwin Chuquimia Velez, an official in El Alto formerly in charge of water.

Glaciers are part of the majestic landscape here, visible from almost everywhere in the neighboring cities of La Paz and El Alto, each with one million people. Their disappearance from certain vistas is as startling to Bolivians as the absence of the twin towers is to New Yorkers.

""To see this change fills me with sadness. It fills me with pain,"" said Gonzalo Jaimes, a climbing guide from La Paz.

Chacaltaya, at 17,500 feet, was the world's highest ski area from 1939 until 2005, when the glacier retreated beyond the slopes. The lodge, still stocked with rental gear and decorated with ski murals, sits mostly abandoned.

For residents, water has been the biggest issue. Though the region's electricity comes from hydroelectric plants, these depend heavily on rainfall and water from the Amazon, so power loss has so far not been a problem.

In Khapi, a village two hours' drive from La Paz, people regard the Illimani glacier as ""our God, our great protector,"" said Mario Ariquipa Laso, 55, a wizened farmer who grows potatoes and corn on sheer slopes in the shadow of the glacier. Ten years ago, it provided a steady, gentle stream during dry months to keep crops watered. Today, with Illimani in retreat, water ""just pours"" off the glacier, a yellowish mix.

""A lot of us think about not having kids anymore,"" said Margarita Limachi Alvarez, 46, a blue Andean cap with ear flaps pulled over her head. ""Without water or food, how would we survive? A hundred miles away, in a middle-class neighborhood of El Alto, water has also become a gnawing concern. From September through November, the taps gave forth at best eight hours a day, often with little pressure.

""Sometimes you didn't have it in the morning. Sometimes you didn't have it in the evening -- you never knew,"" said Julia Torrez, 31 and eight months pregnant, in a neat sitting room furnished with plaid couches and hung with oil paintings. When the tap started spurting, she recalled, she ran to fill an array of buckets and jugs, an incongruous routine for this family of jeans-wearing, college-educated professionals.

In the last few years, Bolivian lives have also been buffeted by an almost biblical array of extreme weather events, many of which scientists believe are probably linked to climate change. This year brought scorching temperatures and intense sun. A drought killed 7,000 farm animals and sickened nearly 100,000.

Severe Storms

Severe storms normally associated with El Nino periods, every seventh year, now occur regularly. Warmer temperatures mean new crop pests -- crickets and worms -- as well as diseases like malaria and dengue fever.

On a recent morning in Huaricana, a village an hour from La Paz, people used rocks and timber to repair a road bisected by a 40-foot-wide river of mud delivered by a potent storm..

""This has only been happening the last three years,"" said Oswaldo Vargas, 55, as he towed a public bus across the mud with his Fiat tractor.

Developed countries agree that they have an obligation to help relieve such stresses, but many remain hesitant to release funds, in part because poor countries have few concrete plans to address climate problems. But with little cash or expertise, it is hard to plan a giant new reservoir or a system to transfer water from one part of the country to another. Bolivia's poor, said Edwin Torrez Soria, an engineer with Aqua Sustentable, who works with villages near the Illimani glacier, ""aren't responsible for what's happening to the glacier but they suffer the most, and unfortunately the government doesn't have much of a plan."""
"Science, Tuesday, December 15, 2009 793 mots, p. D 1",,FINDINGS,,,"By JOHN TIERNEY

Imagine there's no Copenhagen.

Imagine a planet in which global warming was averted without the periodic need for thousands of people to fly around the world to promise to stop burning fossil fuels. Imagine no international conferences wrangling over the details of climate policy. Imagine entrusting the tough questions to a referee: Mother Earth.

That is the intriguing suggestion of Ross McKitrick, an economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario who, like me, is virtuously restricting his carbon footprint by staying away from Copenhagen this week. Dr. McKitrick expects this climate conference to yield the same results as previous ones: grand promises to cut carbon emissions that will be ignored once politicians return home to face voters who are skeptical that global warming is even a problem.

To end this political stalemate, Dr. McKitrick proposes calling each side's bluff. He suggests imposing financial penalties on carbon emissions that would be set according to the temperature in the earth's atmosphere. The penalties could start off small enough to be politically palatable to skeptical voters.

If the skeptics are right and the earth isn't warming, then the penalties for burning carbon would stay small or maybe even disappear. But if the climate modelers and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change are correct about the atmosphere heating up, then the penalties would quickly, and automatically, rise.

""Either way we get a sensible outcome,"" Dr. McKitrick argues. ""The only people who lose will be those whose positions were disingenuous, such as opponents of greenhouse policy who claim to be skeptical while privately believing greenhouse warming is a crisis, or proponents of greenhouse gas emission cuts who neither understand nor believe the I.P.C.C. projections, but invoke them as a convenient argument on behalf of policies they want on other grounds even if global warming turns out to be untrue.""

Dr. McKitrick is in the skeptical camp himself and has published critiques of the past warming trends reported at weather stations on the earth's surface (like the data now being re-examined after the much-publicized hacking of e-mail messages and files of British climate scientists). But he says that temperature readings from satellites and weather balloons are trustworthy enough to use for monitoring future trends.

Specifically, he proposes tying carbon penalties to the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere (called the troposphere, which extends from the surface of the earth to a height of about 10 miles). He suggests using the readings near the equator because climate models forecast pronounced warming there.

These temperature readings could be incorporated into the kind of cap-and-trade system being negotiated in Copenhagen, which is intended to impose limits on the amount of greenhouse emissions. If the atmosphere warmed, the cap would be tightened to lower greenhouse emissions; if it cooled, the cap would be loosened.

But it would be even better, Dr. McKitrick says, to use the temperature readings as the basis for a carbon tax instead of a cap-and-trade system. Like many economists and environmentalists, he argues that the carbon tax would be more effective at reducing emissions because it is simpler, more transparent, easier to enforce and less vulnerable to accounting tricks and political favoritism.

The carbon tax might start off at a rate that would raise the cost of a gallon of gasoline by a nickel -- or, if there were political will, perhaps 10 or 15 cents. Those numbers are all too low to satisfy environmentalists worried about climate change.

But if the climate models are correct, Dr. McKitrick calculates, within a decade his formula would cause the tax to at least double and possibly sextuple -- with further increases on the way if the atmosphere kept heating. The prospect would give immediate pause to any investors trying to decide today what kind of cars, power plants and other long-range energy projects to finance. To estimate future profits, they would need to study climate.

""The best results will accrue to firms incorporating the most accurate climate forecasts into their decision making, precisely the kind of forward-looking behavior environmentalists want to encourage,"" Dr. McKitrick writes. ""Consequently, it's not the case that we have to wait until it is 'too late' to respond to global warming. The market will force investors to make the best possible use of information and to press for improvements in climate forecasting in the process.""

The revenues from a carbon tax might be refunded to the public, as Dr. McKitrick and others have suggested, or the money might be spent developing low-carbon energy sources, as recommended in the journal Nature by two economists from McGill University, Isabel Galiana and Christopher Green. After comparing different climate-change strategies for the Copenhagen Consensus Center, they recommend committing at least $100 billion per year to energy research and development by dedicating the revenues from a global carbon tax.

It would take some diplomacy to work out a formula for tying carbon penalties to temperatures -- which temperatures to count, how much to weight trends. Some researchers question whether the tropical atmosphere is the best measure, and they fear that climate science could become even more politicized if it is directly tied to taxes. (For reactions to Dr. McKitrick's proposal, go to nytimes.com/tierneylab.)

But negotiating a temperature tax wouldn't necessarily be any more complicated or acrimonious than the emission cuts being debated in Copenhagen. Instead of arguing about the reliability of forecasts by computer modelers, instead of issuing competing prophecies, both sides would have to abide by what actually happens in the atmosphere.

By starting off with a small penalty for carbon emissions, politicians wouldn't have to take the blame for imposing immediate pain on the public. The pain, if it came, wouldn't be felt until later -- and at that point they wouldn't have to take direct responsibility anyway.

They wouldn't have to vote for higher taxes and utility bills. They could blame it all on Mother Earth, and she never has to worry about being re-elected."
"oreign, Tuesday, December 15, 2009 957 mots, p. A 1",,CHINA AND U.S. HIT STRIDENT IMPASSE AT CLIMATE TALKS,"By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES KANTER; Andrew C. Revkin and Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting from Copenhagen, and Neil MacFarquhar from the United Nations.",,"COPENHAGEN - China and the United States were at an impasse on Monday at the United Nationsclimate change conference here over how compliance with any treaty could be monitored and verified.

China, which last month for the first time publicly announced a target for reducing the rate of growth of its greenhouse gas emissions, is refusing to accept any kind of international monitoring of its emissions levels, according to negotiators and observers here. The United States is insisting that without stringent verification of China's actions, it cannot support any deal.

The stalemate came on a day of public and private brinkmanship as the talks moved into their second and final week. Earlier Monday, a group of poor nations staged a brief walkout from the bargaining table, and a chaotic registration system left thousands of attendees freezing outside the conference hall and forced the temporary closing of the subway stop near the Bella Center, where the meetings are being held.

The slow progress of the climate negotiations could pose problems later in the week, when the heads of government begin arriving. It is not customary for so many technical, financial and emotional issues to be unsettled when national leaders sit down to negotiate an agreement. President Obama and other world leaders have said that they hope to reach some interim agreement at the Copenhagen talks, but that a binding global accord is not likely to be completed until next year.

Negotiators for the United States and China have been trading public accusations in recent days and making little progress in negotiations on the critical issue of treaty compliance.

Chinese negotiators have said little during formal negotiation sessions here, where they have been working in partnership with the developing countries. They have made clear that they do not expect money from the industrial powers to help make the shift to a more energy-efficient economy.

But they will not accept any outside monitors to ensure that they are indeed making the changes that they have promised to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide and other pollutants emitted per unit of economic output.

""I think there's no doubt that China, when it says 40 to 45 percent reduction in energy intensity, is serious about that,"" said Ed Miliband, the British secretary of state for energy and climate change. ""The more challenging hurdle is finding a formula for ensuring the outside world that an avoided ton of gas is in fact a ton.""

He Yafei, the Chinese vice foreign minister, said China's laws would guarantee compliance.

""This is a matter of principle,"" even if it scuttles the talks, he said in an interview with The Financial Times.

American officials said that despite nearly a year of negotiations with the Chinese, there were still fundamental problems that may not be fixed here before the meetings end. The United States says it believes that the Chinese emissions target is too low -- a top American official called it ""disappointing"" the day it was announced. Without a stronger emissions commitment and an agreement to international monitoring by China, Congress is unlikely to approve a tough new domestic climate regime for the United States.

""If China or any other country wants to be a full partner in global climate efforts, that country must commit to transparency and review of their emissions-cutting regime,"" said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a co-sponsor of the climate and energy bill that passed the House in June. ""Without that commitment, other governments and industries, including those in America, will be hesitant to engage with those countries when they try to partner on global warming.""

And the Chinese refusal to accept verification measures could also lead to calls for punitive tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the United States. The House bill allows for the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries that do not constrain their carbon output. A group of 10 Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Obama two weeks ago warning that the Senate would not ratify any treaty that did not protect American industry from foreign competitors who do not have to meet global warming emissions limits.

That threat could, paradoxically, help drive the Chinese to cement a deal here, an American official said. ""Their No. 1 motivation is to avoid border tariffs,"" the official said.

Barbara Finamore director of the China program for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the top Chinese leadership was pursuing a cautious and calculated strategy as the talks near a decisive phase this week.

""They're going to wait until the last hour of the last day and just as the other side is walking out they'll say, 'Hey, come back.' Just as they do every day in every market in China,"" Ms. Finamore said. ""That's why they're the best negotiators in the world.""

As the dispute between China and the United States was playing out in private, a group of poor nations threw the talks off track for a time with a public protest. They complained that the industrial countries were doing too little to curb their own climate-altering emissions and consigning them to perpetual poverty.

Representatives of several African officials demanded that the rich countries sign a binding treaty that included a large transfer of wealth to the developing world. They brought the public sessions of the meeting to a halt at midday, but delegates began returning to the large conference hall as evening fell, and the talks resumed in desultory fashion.

John Hay, a spokesman for the United Nations body sponsoring the conference, said: ""The plenary was suspended. A slew of technical meetings have not taken place. It's an indication of how adamant the G-77 are about these issues,"" he said, referring to the group of less-developed nations.

In New York on Monday, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, warned the negotiators in Copenhagen that leaving too much for the heads of state and government to hammer out at the end of the week risked enfeebling any final deal.

""There is no time left for posturing or blaming,"" he said at a news conference, before leaving for the Danish capital. ""If everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute, we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all, and this will be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequences.""

Todd Stern, the chief American negotiator, acknowledged that Monday had been a difficult day but said that progress continued to be made.

""In any big and complicated negotiation, and this may be the biggest and most complicated ever, it never goes smoothly,"" he said. ""It never goes as planned. There's always bumps. There's always zigs and zags, people getting up and down, and that's to be expected."""

COPENHAGEN - With the temperature below zero and a light snow falling, it was easy to feel jealous of the protesters in chicken suits. At least they were warm.

As talks broke down briefly in the Bella Center, the site of international climate talks here, things were not going much better outside. Thousands of participants, from national delegates to representatives of advocacy groups to world-class scientists, faced four-hour waits to pick up credentials for the conference's second and final week.

While vegans offered sandwiches and the people in chicken costumes demonstrated on behalf of animal welfare, many in the line were frantically dialing cellphones to seek an alternative way in or to apologize for missed meetings.

Among them was Anand Patwardhan, a professor specializing in climate adaptation technology who is a member of the Indian delegation and who had just gotten off a plane from Mumbai.

""I can't believe this,"" he said exhaustedly.

At one point several hundred participants, including college students from Pennsylvania and a Korean businessman in a dark suit, pushed up against the gates, chanting: ""Let us in. Let us in.""

Officials from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change attributed the delays to ""a capacity problem."" When the conference center reached its legal capacity of 15,000, the Danish police refused to admit more people until others left, said John Hay, a spokesman.

Yet the United Nations has allowed 45,000 people to register. ""Up to now, we've allowed everyone to participate who wants to and who has a legitimate stake in climate change,"" Mr. Hay said. That includes big delegations from universities and trade unions, as well as 3,500 journalists.

""We have been overwhelmed,"" he said. Still, the freezing participants ""haven't missed a lot today,"" he noted dryly, citing the temporary breakdown in talks.

Move Over, Al Gore

It could be called ""An Inconvenient Truth, Part 2.""

A new film on climate change screened Sunday night at the Staerekassen Theater in central Copenhagen illustrates the consequences of a global rise in temperature of one degree Celsius, two degrees, three degrees and, finally, four degrees with gorgeous imagery shot mostly in Greenland.

The premiere of the film, ""One Degree Matters,"" was organized by the European Environment Agency as part of a new Web-based campaign called Bend the Trend, in which the agency invites people to make specific online pledges to generate fewer heat-trapping emissions. The promised emissions cuts are then calculated and summed up at the Bend the Trend Web site.

To start the project, Jacqueline McGlade, a marine biologist and executive director of the agency, a nongovernmental entity affiliated with the European Union, pledged at a public event to buy a new, more efficient heater for her home.

She then had other event sponsors do likewise onstage. Volker Liebig of the European Space Agency said he would give up his car. Or, he said, backtracking slightly, he would use it only when no public transport was available. Claus Andersen, an executive with Microsoft, promised to substitute videoconferencing for flying on 10 business trips next year.

Will It Play in New York?

Michael R. Bloomberg just doesn't understand wind-turbine detractors.

After flying in unapologetically in his private jet, the New York mayor donned an orange rubber jumpsuit for a 20-minute helicopter trip over the North Sea to view a field of 91 giant turbines, the world's largest wind farm.

Back home, the mayor is hoping that a consortium linking government agencies and utilities will soon begin fielding proposals for a 700-megawatt wind farm that could cost up to $3 billion.

""It's very impressive,"" Mr. Bloomberg said, standing on a multistory offshore rig planted amid the rotating blades. ""It gives you a feeling for what it will be, I hope, off the Long Island shore.""

Of course, offshore wind proposals in New York have struggled for acceptance in the past, partly because residents objected to what they saw as a blighted view.

""I don't understand what there is to complain about,"" Mr. Bloomberg said as the craft swooped low along a bank of turbines 13 miles off the Danish coast. ""Would they rather be staring at a coal plant?""

From the shore, the turbines at the Danish wind farm can just be made out -- tiny dots along the horizon -- on a clear day.

Invoking the work of Olafur Eliasson, the sculptor who fashioned manmade waterfalls at four spots along the New York waterfront last year, the mayor said, ""He would do something like this, and we'd all ooh and ahh."""
"Foreign, Thursday, December 17, 2009 611 mots, p. A 12",,"Outside Climate Talks, Protesters March on the Hall",By JAMES KANTER and TOM ZELLER Jr.,,"COPENHAGEN - Perhaps the strangest sight at protests that turned violent here on Wednesday was a group of young men and women in fur coats and white bow ties who came bearing Champagne, fistfuls of dollar bills and grapes on a silver platter.

The group, which called itself Lobbyists for Profitable Climate Solutions, called on other protesters to stop their ""global whining."" Corporations are already working hard enough to save the planet, they argued.

""We are very inspired by the International Chamber of Commerce,"" said Morten Anderson, a 21-year-old from near Copenhagen who almost managed to keep a straight face while speaking for the group. ""A great global market for trading carbon will solve matters related to the climate.""

The police said 260 people were arrested during the day of protests, in which demonstrators also tried to scale fences and descend on the conference center where international delegates are meeting on climate change. That brought the total detained since the meeting began Dec. 7 to 1,800.

The demonstrations bore many of the hallmarks of rallies that have accompanied other international policy meetings in recent years.

The organizers of the march to the Bella Center, a group called Climate Justice Action, said they were pushing for radical measures to curb global warming in the final days of the conference. Yet the protests also seemed to reflect an enduring frustration with the capitalist world order.

One of the most prominent slogans on placards was ""System Change, Not Climate Change."" Members of groups like La Via Campesina, an international movement of farmers from the developing world, were among those at the head of the march.

The protesters said they were determined to enter the building and hold a ""people's assembly.""

As the helmeted police closed in, nearly pushing some protesters off the road and into a watery marsh, the protesters chanted ""Anti, anti, capitalista!"" before drawing back a few hundred yards to proceed with the assembly.

Some protesters tried to cross a stretch of water around the conference center on inflatable rafts tied together to form a makeshift pontoon bridge, but they were also stopped.

The rally brought together climate activists; representatives of countries suffering from drought, floods or other phenomena linked to global warming; and indigenous peoples. Speakers denounced markets, consumerism and animal cruelty, and asserted that wealthy northern countries owed a debt to the poor south.

Although there was a revolutionary fervor in the air, many of the protesters had specific objections to the way the United Nations organized the conference and controlled access. Some complained that the authorities had moved to limit participation by campaign groups.

""They can't make decisions without us,"" insisted Gopal Dayaneni, 40, one speaker at the open-air assembly. Mr. Dayaneni, a member of an environmental justice group in Oakland, Calif., called Movement Generation, said that the meeting was ""corrupted by back-room deals.""

The ranks of demonstrators spanned generations as well as continents.

After the group she had been part of scattered to a nearby apartment complex, Vicky Moller, 63, of Wales, leaned against a support column for the Metro railway that runs above the road leading to and from the Bella Center.

With one bare hand, she clutched the corner of a ""Save Our Climate"" quilt she had made, and held her coat closed against the cold wind with the other. When a fellow protester walked by and offered her a pair of gloves, she gladly accepted.

Ms. Moller, who said she wrote the environmental pages for her local newspaper, traveled to Copenhagen as part of a British group called the Camp for Climate Action. ""I feel that grass-roots organizations are more effective than governments,"" she said.

She said she had no confidence that negotiators in the Bella Center had the planet's best interests in mind, although she allowed that if they did commit themselves to emissions cuts, it would be a good start.

But she lamented the underlying premise of the negotiations. ""The wrong thing is on the table,"" she said. ""They're talking about emissions, instead of not pulling fossil fuels out of the ground."""
"Foreign, Thursday, December 17, 2009 952 mots, p. A 16",,Poor and Emerging States Stall Climate Negotiations,By JOHN M. BRODER; Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting.,,"COPENHAGEN - If the United Nations climate talks here are entering their final two days in virtual deadlock, it is in large measure because of delays and diversions created by a group of poor and emerging nations intent on making their dissatisfaction clear.

The Group of 77, as it is called, has raised repeated objections to what its members see as the economic and environmental tyranny of the industrial world, often in florid language.

""The rich are destroying the planet,"" said Hugo Chavez, the socialist president of Venezuela, on Wednesday. ""Perhaps they think they're going off to another one after they've destroyed this one.""

On Monday, African nations briefly brought the climate talks to a standstill. China, by far the largest economic power in the group, has dragged its feet throughout the week by raising one technical objection after another to the basic negotiating text. And on Wednesday night, the group refused to take part in negotiations that conference organizers had hoped would produce a definitive negotiating text by Thursday morning. Instead, many Group of 77 leaders spent the day hurling accusations at wealthier countries.

President Obama and other world leaders have said that the Copenhagen meetings are unlikely to produce a binding treaty; some sort of interim political agreement is far more likely, they said. But few appreciated the depth of anger in the developing world and the height of grandstanding that would consume so much of the conference's time. Now it is hard to find someone who confidently predicts even that much success.

The Group of 77 is a group in name only. Made up of 130 countries, it represents tiny island nations like Vanuatu and advanced middle-income states like Argentina. Its nominal leader is Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, a Sudanese diplomat who speaks on behalf of the group and who led a walkout on Monday, saying the developed nations' offer of $10 billion in ""quick-start"" financing after completion of a deal here was wholly inadequate.

Many developing nations have united under the group's auspices of because there is strength in numbers, and because they can take advantage of the far greater negotiating power and resources of countries like China and Brazil. Many small countries have neither a big enough delegation nor the organizational structure to negotiate effectively on their own.

China has been a natural godfather to many of the Group of 77 countries because its government has extensive investments in Africa and Latin America, often involving lucrative deals to bring oil and minerals home.

The coalition is united on a few central issues. They include making sure that industrialized countries keep the emissions reductions pledges they made as part of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and that the Copenhagen conference produces enough money for poorer countries to adapt to climate change, said Maria Fernanda Espinosa, Ecuador's minister of cultural and ecological patrimony.

But the group is neither a tight negotiating unit, nor particularly well organized. While larger countries like Brazil and China have well-appointed headquarters in one part of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are being held, the Group of 77 office itself is made up of two spartan rooms equipped with two computers, where some delegates from the poorest African nations sat Wednesday morning drinking soda and nibbling biscuits.

""The G-77 is an incredibly diverse group,"" said Michael A. Levi, a climate change specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations who is attending the Copenhagen meeting. ""Its richest countries are 50 times as wealthy on a per-capita basis as its poorest ones. All of this makes a common yet constructive position very difficult. The easiest thing to agree on is to obstruct action.""

The cost of such obstruction is growing higher by the day. On Thursday and Friday, ministers and heads of government are expected to fashion a complex political agreement encompassing a host of issues that have divided them for years. Seldom, if ever, have national leaders engaged in negotiations as complex -- and as poorly prepared -- as these.

The strain is showing both inside the Bella Center and outside. On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators tried to storm the hall, but were pushed back by truncheon-wielding riot police officers who made 260 arrests. Inside, numerous groups staged demonstrations, sit-ins and noisy disruptions of public sessions.

Yvo de Boer, the United Nations official in charge of the conference, said that he was concerned about the safety of the arriving leaders and the rest of the participants. ""The incidents that have taken place today inside the conference center test my courage to continue in this way,"" he said, suggesting he would sharply limit access to the hall for the final two days.

In recent days, various officials have given gloomy assessments of the talks, including Connie Hedegaard, the former Danish environment minister who stepped down on Wednesday as president of the conference, yielding the chair to the Danish prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen. Officials said the turnover was dictated by protocol because the conference president shares a stage with fellow heads of government.

""Ten billion dollars will not buy developing countries' citizens enough coffins,"" Mr. Di-Aping said bitterly last week.

But no one has figured out a way to reconcile the divergent and often conflicting interests of such a large group of countries.

A bloc of African and Pacific island nations, for example, want an agreement that limits the global temperature increase by 2050 to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, a demand that China and other major emitters strongly resist. Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing states are wary of any deal that brings a rapid reduction in consumption of fossil fuels. But Brazil and many of the poorest countries in Asia and Latin America could immediately benefit from a deal here because money would rapidly flow to them to support environmentally friendly energy and agriculture projects.

The invective some members of the group hurl at one another is sometimes as fierce as the insults they throw at wealthier nations. Meles Zenawi, prime minister of Ethiopia and an important leader of the African bloc, came under attack by some of his African colleagues on Wednesday over a proposal he offered on financial aid for the poorest countries.

""If Prime Minister Meles wants to sell out the lives and hopes of Africans for a pittance, he is welcome to, but that is not Africa's position,"" said Mithika Mwenda of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance.

The Obama administration, trying to inject a hopeful note into an increasingly grim atmosphere, announced late Wednesday that it would contribute $1 billion to a multilateral fund to slow and eventually reverse deforestation in developing countries, contingent on reaching an overall deal here. The fund would total $3.5 billion from 2010 to 2012, and include contributions from Australia, France, Japan, Norway and Britain.

"Editorial, Tuesday, January 27, 2009 359 mots, p. A 30",,New Day on Climate Change,,,"Once California receives permission to move ahead -- as it surely will -- 13 states, and possibly more, are expected to impose similar rules. The result will be to force automakers here and overseas to begin producing cars and trucks that are considerably more fuel efficient than today's models and on a faster timetable.

The California decision is of great significance not only for that reason but for what it says about Mr. Obama's commitment to the cause of reversing the rise in greenhouse gases. Mr. Bush began his tenure by breaking a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide and by withdrawing the United States from the Kyoto agreement on climate change. Mr. Obama begins his with a clear signal that he will not hesitate to use the regulatory levers provided by the Clean Air Act and other federal statutes to fight global warming.

California has long had the right to set stronger air pollution standards than the rest of the nation, provided it has federal permission. Its earlier requests to set stronger air pollution standards were routinely approved, but in this case the Bush administration said no, dredging up all manner of arguments to support its case. One was that California had not demonstrated ""extraordinary and compelling"" reasons to limit greenhouse gases; another was that a national regulatory system was preferable to state-by-state laws -- even though the administration itself had shown no interest whatsoever in a national system.

In a companion move, Mr. Obama directed the Transportation Department to finalize the interim nationwide fuel-efficiency standards called for in the 2007 energy bill. These standards would eventually require fuel-efficiency increases in the American car and light-truck fleet to roughly 35 miles per gallon by 2020 from the current average of 27 m.p.g. The California standards would require automakers to reach the same 35 m.p.g. target four years ahead of the federal timetable.

The California rules cannot by themselves stop the rise in greenhouse gases. In addition to regulatory controls, Mr. Obama must eventually embrace a broader strategy involving major federal investments in clean-energy technologies and, down the road, some effort to put a price on greenhouse-gas emissions in order to unlock private investment. But after eight years of inaction, this is a wonderful start."
"Foreign, Thursday, February 5, 2009 908 mots, p. A 14",,Experts in U.S. and China See a Chance for Cooperation Against Climate Change,"By EDWARD WONG and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.",,"BEIJING - When Chinese officials and the Obama administration begin serious discussions over issues at the heart of relations between China and the United States, the usual suspects will no doubt emerge: trade, North Korea, human rights, Taiwan.

But an increasing number of officials and scholars from both countries say climate change is likely to become another focal point in the dialogue. American and Chinese leaders recognize the urgency of global warming, the scholars and officials say, and believe that a new international climate treaty is impossible without agreements between their nations, the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

In a sign of this new emphasis, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton plans to stress the importance of new steps on energy and global warming when she visits China, perhaps as soon as this month, an Obama administration official said.

Two reports being released Thursday propose ways for President Obama and Chinese leaders to begin addressing together, as a major priority, how to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases linked to rising temperatures.

One report, ""A Roadmap for U.S.-China Cooperation on Energy and Climate Change,"" is a joint project of the Asia Society and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, both based in the United States. Scientists and policy advisers from both countries contributed to the report.

The origins of the report indicate that it could carry weight in the White House. It was produced by a committee led by Steven Chu, a Nobel laureate in physics who is now the secretary of energy, and John L. Thornton, a professor at Tsinghua University who has been mentioned as a possible candidate for United States ambassador to China. John P. Holdren, Mr. Obama's choice for science adviser, is another contributor.

The report recommends that China and the United States convene a presidential summit meeting to create a broad plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, followed by the appointment of senior officials and independent experts to councils and task forces to develop concrete programs. It says the two governments should lay out areas for cooperation, including low-emissions coal technologies, energy efficiency and conservation, and renewable energy.

The other report, by two Brookings Institution fellows, David B. Sandalow and Kenneth G. Lieberthal, presents a menu of nine ways to build political support in both countries for sustained cooperation on cutting emissions.

In China, scholars and policy advisers who support the proposals in the ""Roadmap"" report say talks on energy technology and climate change could foster cooperation between the Obama administration and China. A central question is whether Chinese leaders and American lawmakers will be too focused on reviving their economies to pay serious attention to curbing emissions.

But at least in public, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and other officials have said recently that the financial crisis gives China an opportunity to turn its growth model away from one that was not environmentally sustainable.

""I believe climate change may become a very important issue which will put China-U.S. relations in a new framework in the 21st century because the stakes are high,"" said Wu Jianmin, a senior adviser to the Foreign Ministry. ""We all understand we don't have much time left. We've got to work together.""

This largely meshes with Mr. Obama's hope for helping to revive the American economy by developing non-polluting energy technologies and ""green jobs.""

Todd Stern, appointed Mrs. Clinton's special envoy for climate change, said the administration hoped to end sparring between the nations over who needs to do what first.

""Secretary Clinton is keenly aware that the United States, as the largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, and China, as the largest emitter going forward, need to develop a strong, constructive partnership to build the kind of clean-energy economies that will allow us to put the brakes on global climate change,"" he said in an e-mail message.

But some American officials and experts on climate and energy say that although Chinese leaders declare they are serious about the issue, it has been hard to pin them down on specifics.

Mr. Wen, in an interview with The Financial Times published Monday, restated China's position that it does not intend to agree to specific limits at a United Nations conference on climate change scheduled for December in Copenhagen.

""It's difficult for China to take quantified emission reduction quotas at the Copenhagen conference, because this country is still at an early stage of development,"" he said. ""Europe started its industrialization several hundred years ago, but for China, it has only been dozens of years.""

Gao Guangsheng, who directs the climate change office at the National Development and Reform Commission, presented a white paper in October that said the world's richest countries should contribute 1 percent of their gross domestic product to helping developing countries combat global warming.

Zhang Haibin, an associate professor at Peking University who specializes in international environmental politics, said that China and the United States had historically had weak cooperation on the climate change problem, but that Chinese leaders believed that the relationship could change under Mr. Obama.

Several American experts on energy, climate and Chinese-American relations said the ""Roadmap"" report built on recent calls for sustained partnerships on energy efficiency, technology for capturing carbon dioxide from power plants and other initiatives. But they said that task forces and summit meetings would be ineffective unless they led to programs and investments that continued for many years.

""Nearly everything that these two countries have tried to do jointly on climate and energy has been episodic,"" said David G. Victor, a political scientist at Stanford University who studies energy and climate. ""The financial crisis has created an opportunity for a dialogue, but it also creates a host of new risks as the countries turn inward.""

Orville Schell, journalist who helped supervise the writing of the report as director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-China Relations, said that in recent meetings Chinese officials had begun to recognize the need to take action on climate change.

""We have watched as officials in China have become much more receptive to the need to do 'something' about climate change, although they are still unwilling to set caps,"" Mr. Schell said in an e-mail message. ""We have also watched our own country molt out of stubborn opposition to a far more open willingness to recognize the scientific basis of the problem and the need to do something about it."""
"National, Saturday, February 7, 2009 475 mots, p. A 12",,"Environmental Views, Past and Present CLIMATE: The Legacy of Kyoto",By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"CLIMATE

The Legacy of Kyoto

The public view of Mr. Bush's record on global warming was largely set by his blunt rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, his swift abandonment of his campaign pledge to restrict some greenhouse gases and the disclosures of interference by presidential appointees with government climate scientists.

But now, with many adherents of the Kyoto climate pact struggling to meet its targets, some climate policy experts say that, in efforts to draw up a new treaty, Mr. Bush may have left useful groundwork behind.

Particularly useful were meetings late in Mr. Bush's tenure that brought together a group of rich and poor nations responsible for 80 percent of the human output of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.

The idea was to devise partnerships within sectors like transportation and steel-making that could curb gas releases without the complexity of negotiating among nearly 200 countries in the climate-treaty talks.

Eileen Claussen, the president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the meetings helped frame some steps China could take that might satisfy senators worried about jobs flowing to Asia under a flawed climate deal.

Measurable action by China is vital if Mr. Obama is to gain Senate approval for any climate treaty resulting from international talks culminating in December in Copenhagen. China has so far resisted mandatory limits on emissions and is building new coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace.

Over all, Ms. Claussen said, Mr. Bush's climate legacy is mainly one of delay and lost opportunities.

Through most of his presidency, Mr. Bush largely framed his approach to global warming around two talking points: the uncertainties in forecasts of a dangerously human-heated world and the certainty that economic harm would come from mandatory cuts in emissions of heat-trapping gases.

A result was a series of mainly voluntary climate and energy initiatives intended to slow the release of such gases, with no commitment to binding reductions at home or abroad.

Mr. Obama has taken precisely the opposite tack. He spoke late last month of the specter of ""violent conflict, terrible storms, shrinking coastlines"" and other perils from unchecked warming, while pressing his vision of prosperity rebuilt around clean cars and pollution-free power from the wind and sun.

Many analysts say that Mr. Obama must navigate among an array of campaigners, lobbyists and lawmakers with particular interests -- from dependency on coal to aversion to power lines or nuclear plants. But if he makes too many political compromises, he may find that his plan fails on environmental grounds.

""That is why he must educate a public grappling with uncertain science and a grinding recession that work on long-term energy and climate security cannot be deferred until better times,"" said Kimberly Thompson, who teaches risk management at Harvard.

Aides to Mr. Bush who dealt with the environment and energy insist that they left plenty for Mr. Obama to build on, including greatly increased financing for nonpolluting energy sources and a 30 percent increase in energy-efficiency standards for government buildings.

James L. Connaughton, the former chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, blamed environmentalists, as well as Congress, for some of the lack of progress on new energy options.

Congress failed to provide adequate financing for new power lines to distribute electricity from alternative energy sources, Mr. Connaughton said. And many environmental groups, he added, spoke of concerns about global warming but never dropped their opposition to nuclear power, a carbon-free source of electricity. ANDREW C. REVKIN"
"National, Thursday, February 12, 2009 611 mots, p. A 24",,Big Science Role Is Seen In Global Warming Cure,By JOHN M. BRODER and MATTHEW L. WALD,,"WASHINGTON - Steven Chu, the new secretary of energy, said Wednesday that solving the world's energy and environment problems would require Nobel-level breakthroughs in three areas: electric batteries, solar power and the development of new crops that can be turned into fuel.

Dr. Chu, a physicist, spoke during a wide-ranging interview in his office, where his own framed Nobel Prize lay flat on a bookcase, a Post-it note indicating where it should be hung on the wall.

He addressed topics that included global warming, renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, the use of coal and a proposed repository for nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

Dr. Chu said a ""revolution"" in science and technology would be required if the world is to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and curb the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.

Solar technology, he said, will have to get five times better than it is today, and scientists will need to find new types of plants that require little energy to grow and that can be converted to clean and cheap alternatives to fossil fuels.

Dr. Chu, who once called coal ""a nightmare"" in the way it is currently used, said the United States must also lead the world in finding a way to burn the fuel cleanly, because other countries with big coal reserves, like India and China, will not turn away from coal.

But Dr. Chu said such developments were not impossible. At the turn of the last century, he noted, scientists like Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch made Nobel-winning discoveries that allowed the development of cheap nitrogen fertilizers, saving Europe from starvation.

""I think science and technology can generate much better choices,"" Dr. Chu said. ""It has, consistently, over hundreds and hundreds of years.""

Dr. Chu said members of Congress who are drafting legislation to limit emissions of global warming gases had not yet sought his advice, although he added, ""I would expect that they might.""

He said that while President Obama and Congressional Democratic leaders had endorsed a so-called cap-and-trade system to control global warming pollutants, there were alternatives that could emerge, including a tax on carbon emissions or a modified version of cap-and-trade.

Dr. Chu said reaching agreement on legislation to combat climate change would be difficult in the current recession because any scheme to regulate greenhouse gas emissions would probably cause energy prices to rise and drive manufacturing jobs to countries where energy is cheaper.

""The concern about cap-and-trade in today's economic climate,"" Dr. Chu said, ""is that a lot of money might flow to developing countries in a way that might not be completely politically sellable.""

But, he said, he supports putting a price on carbon emissions to begin to address climate change.

The Energy Department is involved with efforts as varied as developing nuclear weapons and sequencing the human genome. Dr. Chu said the department's nuclear weapons program, which the White House is considering moving to the Defense Department, should be more tightly coupled to science in critical tasks like safeguarding nuclear materials and detecting nuclear proliferation.

One major decision facing his department is what to do about Yucca Mountain, a site 100 miles from Las Vegas chosen by Congress for burial of high-level radioactive waste. Mr. Obama and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, have opposed the project.

Dr. Chu said the political difficulties in trying to obtain a license for the Yucca Mountain site should serve as a guide in searching for other nuclear waste repositories in the future. ""There are political realities,"" he said.

Last year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has the final say, began work on an application from the Energy Department for a license for the project. Dr. Chu said the Energy Department should continue to answer questions from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about the application and then let the commission make a decision.

Dr. Chu would not say whether the department would open the site if allowed to do so. But, he said, ""you can put a hold on"" preparation.

The electric utilities, he noted, expected the department to live up to contracts signed in the 1980s for it to dispose of the nuclear waste.

Dr. Chu said he was still adjusting to his surroundings and title after most of a career spent as an academic scientist. Asked whether he preferred to be called ""Dr. Chu"" or ""Mr. Secretary,"" he answered, ""Steve is fine."""
"Business/Financial, Thursday, February 12, 2009 659 mots, p. B 3",,Oil Industry Is Stressing Cooperation On Climate,By CLIFFORD KRAUSS and JAD MOUAWAD,,"HOUSTON - Confronted with a sharp change of priorities in Washington, international oil executives are expressing an eagerness to work with President Obama to fashion new policies to tackle global warming.

At an industry conference here this week, the executives struck a conciliatory tone on how to limit the emissions that are contributing to climate change, with many of them sounding like budding conservationists as they stressed energy efficiency and the need to develop renewable fuels.

At the same time, they declared that the country would still need oil for a long time, and sought to persuade the new administration of the need for more drilling off the nation's coasts.

On tackling global warming, a subject that has long divided the industry, some executives said they supported a tax on carbon, while others favored a trading system like the one adopted by Europe. Almost all of them seemed reconciled to the United States' adopting some kind of climate policy, and said they were eager to work with the new administration to devise an effective energy strategy.

""President Obama comes to office with a strong commitment to tackle climate change,"" said Tony Hayward, the chief executive of BP. ""Suddenly the challenges many of us have been wrestling with for a long time -- the importance of energy security in providing economic security, and tackling the issue of climate change in a way that is commercially viable -- are center stage.""

During his election campaign, Mr. Obama frequently criticized big oil companies, expressed skepticism about offshore drilling, and pledged to try to replace hydrocarbons with more renewable fuels. He has made energy and environmental policy a cornerstone of both his national security and economic efforts.

The executives strongly urged the administration to open up the continental shelf for offshore drilling at the very time that the interior secretary, Ken Salazar, announced that the government would review and probably scale back the Bush administration's plan to give oil and gas drillers new rights.

Exxon Mobil, which had long been skeptical of global warming, offered its own suggestions. One of the company's top executives, Michael J. Dolan, said that Exxon would back a tax on carbon, while criticizing a so-called cap-and-trade approach.

Under the cap-and-trade formula, which has considerable momentum in Washington, the government would set a ceiling on how much carbon dioxide could be emitted into the atmosphere each year. It would then give or sell permits that companies would be allowed to trade to meet their limit. Emitting carbon dioxide at present involves no penalties in the United States, meaning that companies have little incentive to curb their pollution.

Mr. Dolan, a senior vice president at Exxon, said that a carbon tax would be simpler and less subject to manipulation than a trading system. ""A carbon tax reduces policy risks for businesses and investors in a way that cap-and-trade schemes do not,"" Mr. Dolan said during his address at the industry conference, organized by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm.

""In addition,"" he said, ""by reducing other taxes -- such as income or excise taxes -- we can make a carbon tax revenue-neutral and offset the impact of higher taxes on the economy.""

His European counterparts, meanwhile, offered a different approach, favoring the sort of cap-and-trade system that has already taken hold in Europe.

Jeroen van der Veer, chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, said the key was to assign a cost to carbon. ""I don't lose any sleep if the United States or anyone else gets a carbon tax,"" Mr. van der Veer said. ""The world is helped by pricing carbon dioxide, whichever way you do it.""

A cap-and-trade system establishes a clear environmental goal by setting an upper limit on emissions, something a carbon tax does not necessarily do, he said. Meanwhile, the possibility of trading carbon permits provides companies with an economic incentive to invest in technologies that reduce emissions. He said that a cap-and-trade system had worked well in the United States for cutting the emissions that cause acid rain.

But he added that higher fuel taxes largely explain why European vehicles are far more efficient than American ones.

""Both can work, and even coexist,"" he said. ""They both price CO2,"" or carbon dioxide.

Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research and the organizer of the conference, said oil companies recognized that major policy changes were coming, and that they need to be a part of the debate.

""They are not arguing about basic philosophy anymore, but about practical steps,"" he said. ""We're moving into a new era of policy making that will have very important and far-reaching implications for energy markets."""
"Metropolitan, Wednesday, February 18, 2009 426 mots, p. A 23",,"City Must Prepare for Effects of Global Warming, Mayor's Panel Says",By MIREYA NAVARRO,,"New York City must prepare for higher temperatures, more rain and an increased risk of coastal flooding in the coming decades as a result of global climate change, an advisory panel said on Tuesday.

The panel, formed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to study the potential effects of global warming on the city, said that mean annual temperatures in New York could increase by up to 3 degrees and the average sea levels rise by 2 to 5 inches by the 2020s. By the 2080s, temperatures could increase by up to 7 1/2 degrees, and sea levels could rise 12 to 23 inches by the end of the century, the panel said.

Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University, who is the chairwoman of the panel, acknowledged that it was difficult to make predictions about the effects of climate change on specific regions and that climate models that attempt to do so carried uncertainties.

But Dr. Rosenzweig said that the main value of the panel's research, which used climate models and local climate data, was to identify risks in order to make the city less vulnerable to them. ""We're providing the science by which the City of New York can get ready and prepare,"" she said.

City officials said that to prepare for the expected effects of climate change, the city should plan to keep cooling centers for people without air-conditioning open longer during heat waves, move critical equipment in city buildings above sea level and incorporate climate changes into the design of buildings, among other measures.

Higher temperatures could mean more brownouts and blackouts in the summer because of heavier electricity use on hot days, panel members said, and more flooding of streets and basements from intense rainstorms.

The panel, made up of scientists and representatives of private companies, presented its findings at a news conference on Tuesday at the Rockaway Wastewater Treatment Plant in Queens, where the Department of Environmental Protection is moving electrical equipment like pump motors and circuit breakers to 14 feet above sea level from 25 feet below sea level.

The issue of how to prepare for uncertain climate changes now goes to a second task force, made up of representatives of public agencies and private companies. That task force is expected to issue its report later this year as part of the timetable set by Mr. Bloomberg in his environmental agenda for New York City.

""Planning for climate change today is less expensive than rebuilding an entire network after the catastrophe,"" the mayor said in response to the report. ""We cannot wait until after our infrastructure has been compromised to begin to plan for the effects of climate change now.""

Rohit T. Aggarwala, the director of long-term planning and sustainability in the Mayor's Office of Operations, said that the city's economic crisis should not interfere with preparations for climate change. Much of the financial burden will be shouldered by private companies as they take steps to prepare, and other expenses can be built into the city's budget for capital projects, he said. ""You just build it into the way you do business."""
"Editorial, Saturday, February 21, 2009 263 mots, p. A 20",,EDITORIAL,,,"In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its fourth assessment report, summarizing evidence collected and weighed by scientists around the world. At the time, it was the best estimate of where the planet was, climatically speaking, and where it was likely to be going, and the news the report offered was daunting.

There was unequivocal evidence of a warming climate, with human activity the dominant cause. The panel warned that further warming could have devastating consequences for societies around the world, including rising seas and widespread drought.

The 2007 assessment established a base line of expectation, but it is already looking outdated. From all over the globe, in bits and pieces, data are accumulating that suggest we may have already left behind the world of possibilities portrayed in the panel's report. Sea ice has melted more quickly than expected. And, according to a recent report from the United States Geological Survey, sea levels in 2100 could increase by more than double the 1.5 feet rise projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (it chose not to add in water from eroding ice sheets because they remain poorly understood). Add to that the hard reality that carbon dioxide is a long-lived gas, and the picture of global warming is both volatile and forbidding.

The authors of the climate-change panel's report knew that events could overtake their findings. A fifth assessment is currently under way. And while the worldwide recession might provide a slight breather, population pressures and energy demands are likely to drive emissions inexorably higher without a major shift to new energy sources.

It is imperative, of course, that the Obama administration -- and every other government around the world -- keep abreast of the changing data. What is equally imperative is that the governments tailor any prescriptions to the possibility of more ominous news in the future."
"Foreign, Sunday, February 22, 2009 1070 mots, p. A 8",,Enlisting Fish and Chips To Fight Climate Change,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"NUNEATON, England - As he has done frequently over the last 18 months, Andy Roost drove his blue diesel Peugeot 205 onto a farm, where signs pointed one way for ""eggs"" and another for ""oil.""

He unscrewed the gas cap and chatted nonchalantly as Colin Friedlos, the proprietor, poured three large jugs of used cooking oil -- tinted green to indicate environmental benefit -- into the Peugeot's gas tank.

Mr. Friedlos operates one of hundreds of small plants in Britain that are processing, and often selling to private motorists, used cooking oil, which can be poured directly into unmodified diesel cars, from Fords to Mercedes.

Last year, when the price of crude oil topped $147 a barrel, a number of large companies in Europe and the United States were spurred to set up plants to collect and refine used cooking oil into biodiesel.

The global recession and the steep drop in oil prices have now killed many of those large refining ventures. But smaller, simpler ones like Mr. Friedlos's are moving in to fill the void with their direct-to-tank product, having been deluged by offers of free oil from restaurants.

A tumble of tin containers now sit on the farm. Some dealers here offer fill-ups in suburban yards and barns. Others -- like John Nicholson, founder of a small company in Wales -- deliver jugs of green car fuel to the doors of hundreds of customers, much like a vehicular milkman.

Used cooking oil has attracted growing attention in recent years as a cleaner, less expensive alternative to fossil fuels for vehicles. In many countries, including the United States, the oil is collected by companies and refined into a form of diesel. Some cities use it in specially modified municipal buses or vans. And the occasional environmentalist has experimented with individually filtering the oil and using it as fuel.

Here, however, the direct-to-the-tank approach is gaining a bit of mainstream popularity, attracting people like Mr. Roost, on his way to work, dressed in a suit. The oil, he said, is ""good for the environment and it's cheaper than diesel, even now that prices have dropped."" It costs $4.88 per gallon, which is about 10 percent less than diesel costs now -- and about one-third less than diesel cost at its peak last year. Used cooking oil will never erase the need for filling stations, nor will it, by itself, reverse climate change, transportation experts say.

""You can't eat enough French fries"" to serve all the cars driven in the West, said Peder Jensen, a transport specialist at the European Environment Agency. At most, he said, cooking oil might supplant a few percent of diesel fuel consumption. But he said that it was one of many small adjustments that, added together, could have an important effect on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

Dr. Jensen said that cooking oil fuel was ""feasible"" for diesel engines -- Rudolf Diesel predicted that his engine, patented in the 1890s, would run on it -- and that it was, ""from an environmental point of view, a good idea, taking this waste and making it useful.""

The main barriers to the widespread use of cooking oil, Dr. Jensen said, are ""structural,"" like the lack of standards for processing the fuel and adapting and maintaining vehicles to run on it.

Others disagree. Stuart Johnson, manager of engineering and environment at Volkswagen of America, called putting raw vegetable oil in cars ""a bad idea"" and said, ""We don't recommend it."" The inconsistent quality of cooking oil fuel, he said, means that ""it may contain impurities and it may be too viscous,"" especially for newer, more complex diesel engines with injection systems.

None of that seems to stir concern in Mr. Nicholson, the Welsh entrepreneur. He said he first poured vegetable oil from his kitchen into the family car eight years ago, when the filling stations were emptied by a gas crisis. His wife, a nurse, had to get to work.

Over the next few years, he experimented with different techniques and started Bio-Power (UK), a national umbrella group to assist small producers like himself.

""People say, 'I've got no choice but the regular filling station, and they sell only fossil fuel,' "" Mr. Nicholson said. ""You've got to think differently. This does challenge the status quo.""

Many diesel vehicles, particularly older models, run fine on cooking oil and do not need adaptation, he said. He said that he was lucky the car his wife was driving was ""tolerant.""

But Dr. Jensen said it was safer to adapt cars for cooking oil use, an adjustment that can be done for about $300 and involves putting in a small heater to pre-warm fuel so that it is thinner, and installing injection nozzles that are somewhat wider. Thousands of kits have been sold in Europe and the United States, though it is illegal in America to sell cars that have been adapted.

But Dr. Jensen cautioned that drivers who used cooking oil fuel were taking a risk and might lose their warranty protection.

Vegetable oil is cleaner than either gas or diesel, producing virtually no carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas linked to climate change, and far fewer of the tiny airborne particles in pollution that are harmful to human health. But if the cooking oil is not adequately filtered or prepared for use in cars, studies show, it can also produce high levels of another chemical, NOx, the main component of smog.

A directive of the European Union stipulating that all fuel at the pump should contain 5.75 percent biofuel by 2010 encouraged many large corporations to jump into the market.

In Scotland, for instance, Argent Oils set up the largest plant in the world, capable of collecting 330 million pounds of used cooking oil a year to produce 45 million gallons of biodiesel.

Nor has the movement been limited to Europe. Towns in Texas and other states have engaged companies like Biodiesel Industries to collect local oil and convert it to biodiesel for municipal vehicles.

Officials in Westchester County, N.Y., recently announced that they would collect cooking oil from restaurants for a fleet of modified vehicles, including a Veggie Van that travels to schools to educate students about biofuel diesel.

Producers like Mr. Friedlos have taken advantage of simpler brews and lower overhead. Instead of being refined with explosive chemicals at large factories, the oil is simply filtered and mixed with an additive to thin it and make it burn better. And transport costs are minimal.

Used cooking oil is a problematic waste, which clogs sewers and pipes if tossed down the drain, forming huge, slimy stalactites in sewers, and killing wildlife if it gets into lakes and streams. In Britain, cooking oil cannot be sent to landfills. The oil was once used to make animal feed, but that is no longer allowed because of concerns about mad cow disease.

Two years ago, in the affluent London suburb of Leatherhead, Chris Leveritt starting filtering oil from his restaurant, Trattoria Vecchia, to run the family car. He is now creating a small commercial factory to produce 132 gallons a day in his backyard. Mr. Leveritt's partner, a wine distributor, picks up jugs of used oil when he delivers wine to dozens of restaurants in and around London.

In Wales, Mr. Nicholson delivers cooking oil to the National Trust, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and about 300 other customers, who like it because it contains no fossil fuel.

But still, many motorists hesitate, Mr. Leveritt said. ""There is a lot of resistance,"" he said, ""to putting something into your precious car that you brewed in the kitchen sink."""
"National, Wednesday, February 25, 2009 685 mots, p. A 14",,NEWS ANALYSIS,,,"By ANDREW C. REVKIN

In the effort to shape the public's views on global climate change, hyperbole is an ever-present temptation on all sides of the debate.

Earlier this month, former Vice President Al Gore and the Washington Post columnist George Will made strong public statements about global warning -- from starkly divergent viewpoints.

Mr. Gore, addressing a hall filled with scientists in Chicago, showed a slide that illustrated a sharp spike in fires, floods and other calamities around the world and warned the audience that global warming ""is creating weather-related disasters that are completely unprecedented.""

Mr. Will, in a column attacking what he said were exaggerated claims about global warming's risks, chided climate scientists for predicting an ice age three decades ago and asserted that a pause in warming in recent years and the recent expansion of polar sea ice undermined visions of calamity ahead.

Both men, experts said afterward, were guilty of inaccuracies and overstatements.

Mr. Gore removed the slide from his presentation after the Belgian research group that assembled the disaster data said he had misrepresented what was driving the upward trend. The group said a host of factors contributed to the trend, with climate change possibly being one of them. A spokeswoman for Mr. Gore said he planned to switch to using data on disasters compiled by insurance companies.

Mr. Will, peppered with complaints from scientists and environmental groups who claimed the column was riddled with errors, has yet to respond. The Post's ombudsman said Mr. Will's column had been carefully fact-checked. But the scientists whose research on ice formed the basis for Mr. Will's statements said their data showed the area of the ice shrinking, not expanding.

The events illustrate the fine line that advocates on all sides walk -- and sometimes cross -- in using science to bolster their arguments over what should or should not be done about global warming, the buildup of emissions of heat-trapping gases that scientists have linked to rising temperatures.

President Obama has not been immune from the lure of hype. As president-elect, Mr. Obama, making a video appearance at a California climate conference, began by saying that the science pointing to human-caused warming was beyond dispute -- a statement backed by a strong consensus among scientists. But he went on to push the point, taking the same step as Mr. Gore onto shakier ground.

""We've seen record drought, spreading famine and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season,"" Mr. Obama said, linking this to global warming.

While climate scientists foresee more intense droughts and storms, there is still uncertainty, and significant disagreement, over whether recent patterns can be attributed to global warming.

Social scientists who study the interface of climate science and public policy say that campaigners and officials who seek to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases face an uphill battle in changing people's minds about the issue. Even with the success of ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" the Oscar-winning 2006 documentary featuring Mr. Gore, and widely publicized images of melting Arctic ice, surveys show that most Americans are either confused about climate change, mildly concerned about it or completely disengaged from the issue.

A variety of surveys show that roughly 20 percent of Americans are in Mr. Gore's camp and another 20 percent in Mr. Will's, rejecting the idea that humans could dangerously alter global climate. That division is unlikely to change any time soon, said David Ropeik, a consultant on risk communication who teaches at Harvard University.

Once science moves from the laboratory or ice caps into fights over policy and the economy, Mr. Ropeik said, the issues are mainly framed by polarizing figures who tailor their message to people who already strongly support their views.

""Gore and Will will rally their supporters and entrench their opponents, and we will be no closer to progress,"" Mr. Ropeik said. ""They are merely two leaders of their tribes waving the tribal flag.""

In a paper being published in the March-April edition of the journal Environment, Matthew C. Nisbet, a professor of communications at American University, said Mr. Gore's approach, focusing on language of crisis and catastrophe, could actually be serving the other side in the fight.

""There is little evidence to suggest that it is effective at building broad-based support for policy action,"" Dr. Nisbet said. ""Perhaps worse, his message is very easily countered by people such as Will as global-warming alarmism, shifting the focus back to their preferred emphasis on scientific uncertainty and dueling expert views.""

But Dr. Nisbet said that for Mr. Will, there was little downside in stretching the bounds of science to sow doubt.

Criticism of Mr. Will's columns, Dr. Nisbet said, ""only serves to draw attention to his claims while reinforcing a larger false narrative that liberals and the mainstream press are seeking to censor rival scientific evidence and views."""
"National, Wednesday, February 25, 2009 918 mots, p. A 12",,Economic Crisis Complicates California's Goals on Climate,By FELICITY BARRINGER,,"COLTON, Calif. - Only a few years ago, CalPortland planned on keeping its plant here operating as long as Mount Slover's limestone held out. For more than a century, Colton's kilns and crushing machines have been churning out cement for the streets and buildings of Los Angeles.

But the company says the plant's future is now uncertain. The recession has sent cement prices plunging, lowered profits and forced CalPortland's drivers to cut back on hours. And the company says it faces new expenses: the cost of meeting California's new requirements that manufacturers take steps to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas linked to global warming.

State regulators have projected that retrofitting the state's 11 cement plants would cost $220 million and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12 percent per ton of cement. But CalPortland's executives say it would cost more than that to retrofit the Colton plant alone.

""We don't have enough limestone left to invest $200 million,"" said James A. Repman, the company's president.

California was one of the first states to enact legislation to tackle global warming, with legislators passing a 2006 measure to curb carbon dioxide emissions in all economic sectors, including manufacturing, transportation and real estate development. But the state is also providing a lesson in how contentious carrying out such a law can be, especially at a time of economic crisis.

What happens in California -- and in other states that have taken steps to reduce emissions -- is being closely watched in Washington, where lawmakers will soon debate federal climate legislation. The Obama administration has said it plans to push for a cap-and-trade bill this year.

California's law, like federal proposals, has stirred intense fighting over whether its benefits outweigh its costs and what those costs will actually turn out to be.

""We're talking about a transformation of the way of life,"" said Greg Freeman, an economist with the Los Angeles Economic Development Commission. ""There's going to be transitional costs. We can't have the debate about whether the cost is worth paying unless we have a realistic idea of what the cost will be.""

State regulators predicted in an economic analysis last fall that the climate law would create 100,000 jobs in the state and increase per-capita income by $200 annually by 2020. The upfront cost for the first five years after the law takes effect, they estimated, would be $31.4 billion, about $8.5 billion more than the savings in those years. But if carbon-control costs were spread over the lifespan of the new equipment, the $25 billion in annual costs in the year 2020 would be more than offset by $40 billion in savings.

The state's plan includes a cap-and-trade model, in which polluters would have to either reduce emissions on their own or buy credits from more efficient producers.

At the time of the analysis, Mary D. Nichols, chairwoman of California's Air Resources Board, called them ""good-news numbers.""

But the projections were strongly criticized as unrealistic by the affected industries and by independent economists who reviewed the analysis -- including two from the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, which supports the emission reduction goals.

In one withering review, Matthew E. Kahn of the University of California, Los Angeles said the analysis unconvincingly portrayed the law as ""a riskless free lunch."" Another economist, Robert N. Stavins of Harvard, said the regulators were ""systematically biased"" in ways ""that lead to potentially severe underestimates of costs.""

Now, with the recession deepening -- unemployment in California is 9.3 percent -- manufacturers like Mr. Repman say the recession will make carrying out the state's plan, the first stage of which goes into effect in 2010, even more difficult and could make the economy worse.

Mr. Repman said ""2006 was a boom like I'd never seen,"" and ""2008 was a bust like I'd never seen.""

With profits and Mount Slover's supply of limestone both dwindling, Mr. Repman said, he cannot justify the expense of upgrading the core of the Colton plant, its coal-burning kilns, where 2,000-degree heat turns limestone into a building block of cement.

If he closes the plant when the new rules take effect, Mr. Repman said, 140 jobs will disappear.

State regulators say new jobs in renewable energy and green technologies, created as a result of the law, will more than make up for the jobs that are lost. And the law's supporters note that less economic activity means reduced emissions of heat-trapping gases, making the law's goals -- cutting carbon-dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 -- easier to meet.

In an interview, Ms. Nichols, of the air resources board said she thought the study's cost estimates fell within an acceptable range. The models used, she said, ""showed the effect of fully implementing the plan on the California economy is minimal -- it could be plus or minus, but it would be minimal.""

She said the critiques by the economists, who were chosen by the state, might have contained some harsh words, but were ""very typical of the kinds of things you would see in peer review of an academic study.""

A new group of economists -- academics and experts from the business world -- is being assembled to guide planners in the next round of decisions about the rules set to take effect next year.

Chris Busch, a climate economist with the Center for Resource Solutions, an environmental group, also defended the Air Board's work.

""The excuse that more study is needed,"" Mr. Busch said, ""has been a standard excuse going back to the earliest"" discussions about combating climate change.

He added that, ""now that the science is increasingly clear,"" opponents of climate change measures are shifting the debate to economic models ""which are easier to manipulate.""

Yet until the models used by economists estimating the costs and benefits of the legislation can be tested by reality, the debate is likely to continue unresolved.

""There will be job gains -- there will also probably be job losses,"" said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. ""It's not a black and white picture. Those who don't want to do something will focus on the negatives and those who do will focus on the positives."""
"Foreign, Sunday, March 1, 2009 1289 mots, p. A 1",,OBAMA'S BACKING INCREASES HOPES FOR CLIMATE PACT,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting.,,"Until recently, the idea that the world's most powerful nations might come together to tackle global warming seemed an environmentalist's pipe dream.

The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, was widely viewed as badly flawed. Many countries that signed the accord lagged far behind their targets in curbing carbon dioxide emissions. The United States refused even to ratify it. And the treaty gave a pass to major emitters in the developing world like China and India.

But within weeks of taking office, President Obama has radically shifted the global equation, placing the United States at the forefront of the international climate effort and raising hopes that an effective international accord might be possible. Mr. Obama's chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern, said last week that the United States would be involved in the negotiation of a new treaty -- to be signed in Copenhagen in December -- ""in a robust way.""

That treaty, officials and climate experts involved in the negotiations say, will significantly differ from the agreement of a decade ago, reaching beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions and including financial mechanisms and making good on longstanding promises to provide money and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with climate change.

The perception that the United States is now serious has set off a flurry of diplomacy around the globe. ""The lesson of Kyoto is that if the U.S. isn't taking it seriously there is no reason for anyone else to,"" said Bill McKibben, who runs the environmental organization www.350.org.

This week the United Nation's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, will make the rounds in Washington to discuss climate issues. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is organizing a high-level meeting on climate and energy. Teams from Britain and Denmark have visited the White House to discuss climate issues. In China, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made climate a central focus of her visit and proposed a partnership between the United States and China. And a special envoy from China is coming soon.

But a global treaty still faces serious challenges in Washington and abroad, and the negotiations will be a test of how far the United States and other nations are prepared to go to address climate change at a moment when economies around the world are unspooling. The global recession itself is expected to result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as manufacturing and other polluting industries shrink, lessening the pressure on countries to take action.

""The No. 1 thing will be for everyone to see that the U.S. is on an urgent and transformational path to a low carbon economy -- that would have a galvanizing effect,"" said John Ashton, the British foreign secretary's special representative for climate change.

The Obama administration has said that it will push through federal legislation this year to curb carbon dioxide emissions in the United States -- a promise that Mr. Obama reiterated Tuesday in his speech to Congress.

The Kyoto Protocol has been a touchstone of the environmental movement. Thirty-seven developed countries, including Japan, Australia and nations in the European Union, ratified the accord, agreeing to reduce or limit the growth of carbon dioxide emissions by specified amounts. President George W. Bush, pressed by the Senate, rejected the accord, because countries like China were not also subject to mandatory emission levels. China and India also refused to ratify the protocol.

At the tail end of his administration, Mr. Bush made tentative overtures toward China and other countries on climate matters. In 2007, he convened a meeting of countries that were major emitters of greenhouse gases. Later, in bilateral economic talks, China and the United States agreed that they would cooperate on clean technology development and some other climate issues.

But Kyoto was shaped largely by climate scientists and environment ministers, not the higher-level officials now laying the groundwork. And even many who participated in the earlier accord now say they see it as weak and naive about political and economic realities. Of the countries that signed, more than half are not on track to meet their targets according to 2008 United Nations data, including Germany, Ireland and Canada.

""In Kyoto we made a lot of promises to each other, but we hadn't done the domestic politics,"" Mr. Ashton said, ""and that is why Kyoto -- though a valuable step forward -- has ultimately been so fragile.""

The talks on the new treaty, said Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ""provides an opportunity to fill this gap that we've seen, and this time perform up to expectations.""

The 1997 protocol was a narrow accord about the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses linked to global warming. The new agreement will need to address how those reductions can be achieved in a way that takes account of their effects on energy supplies and economies -- especially at a time of global recession.

Negotiating the treaty when countries are under extreme economic stress presents challenges, Mr. de Boer acknowledged. Politicians in Italy and Canada have complained that it will be difficult to clean up industries to meet their Kyoto goals because of the economic downturn. But others say a global industrial recession, in which emissions tend to drop anyway and countries are poised to spend billions to stimulate economies, is the time to craft a global effort to combat global warming.

With developing countries like China and India emerging as major carbon dioxide emitters in the past few years, experts said that if the new treaty was to be effective, every nation would have to accept emissions limits. ""If one part of the world acts and the other does not, that doesn't really generate a climate benefit,"" said Mr. de Boer, who is responsible for organizing the December meetings.

Developed countries would most likely get binding numerical targets, as some did in Kyoto. Developing countries, which were exempt under Kyoto, would probably be given less stringent goals, though it is not clear if these will be longer-term numerical targets or some other mechanism that ties allowable emissions to economic growth.

Mr. Obama has said the United States will lead the effort, but over the next months, he will have to show what exactly that means. A good first step, environmentalists say, would be to commit to trying to limit warming to two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial temperatures, an ambitious goal that the European Union has adopted but that the Bush administration steadfastly avoided. It could also pledge to reduce emissions by 50 or 80 percent by 2050.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that humans could largely adapt to two degrees of warming, but that a greater temperature increase could cause far more serious consequences, from a dangerous rise in sea levels to mass extinctions.

Climate experts added that the United States did not need to have in place national legislation to limit greenhouse gasses, a process that could take months, to negotiate in Copenhagen. ""It's not just about analyzing a piece of legislation,"" Mr. Ashton said. ""It's about the feeling you get if you're a leader sitting in Beijing. It's like love; you know it when you feel it.""

A more complex issue is whether negotiators will retain the system of trading carbon credits that is central to the Kyoto Protocol, a kind of global commodities market for carbon.

That system allows developed countries that produce more than their allotted share of emissions to balance their emissions budget by investing in projects that curtail emissions elsewhere. Such projects might include the cleaning up of a coal power plant in China, planting trees in Africa or converting pig manure to electricity in the Netherlands. The same cap and trade concept is now used in Europe's emissions.

But as the European Union and the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol have tried such projects over the past few years, problems have emerged. Most notably, it is hard to determine the emissions-reducing value of carbon credit projects, making it easy to game the system. The new treaty, experts say, will also have to broaden Kyoto's focus beyond industrial emissions to activities like airline travel, one of the fastest-growing sources of carbon emissions. In the end, it will also have to include financial mechanisms and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with climate change.

""This is not just about emissions but about creating a massive investment in a new global energy economy"" that includes forests, oceans and the transfer of technology, said Angela Anderson, director of the Pew Environment Group's Global Warming Campaign.

American negotiators were limited in Kyoto by a Senate resolution saying that the United States would not accept numerical caps unless China did as well. But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ""There has been a sea change in the Senate,"" and he added that he believed that there were enough votes -- Democratic and Republican -- to ratify a strong treaty.

What is unclear is whether politicians will be willing to commit to large enough changes to have a significant effect on global warming. ""The Bush administration set the bar very low,"" Mr. McKibben said."
"National, Monday, March 9, 2009 965 mots, p. A 12",,Skeptics Gather to Discuss Why Global Warming Isn't Such a Big Worry,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"More than 600 self-professed climate skeptics are meeting in a Times Square hotel this week to challenge what has become a broad scientific and political consensus: that without big changes in energy choices, humans will dangerously heat up the planet.

The three-day International Conference on Climate Change -- organized by the Heartland Institute, a nonprofit group seeking deregulation and unfettered markets -- brings together political figures, conservative campaigners, scientists, an Apollo astronaut and the president of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Klaus.

Organizers say the discussions, which began Sunday, are intended to counter the Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers, who have vowed to tackle global warming with legislation requiring cuts in the greenhouse gases that scientists have linked to rising temperatures.

But two years after the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with near certainty that most of the recent warming was a result of human influences, global warming's skeptics are showing signs of internal rifts and weakening support.

The meeting participants hold a wide range of views of climate science. Some concede that humans probably contribute to global warming but they argue that the shift in temperatures poses no urgent risk. Others attribute the warming, along with cooler temperatures in recent years, to solar changes or ocean cycles.

But large corporations like Exxon Mobil, which in the past financed the Heartland Institute and other groups that challenged the climate consensus, have reduced support. Many such companies no longer dispute that the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels pose risks.

From 1998 to 2006, Exxon Mobil, for example, contributed more than $600,000 to Heartland, according to annual reports of charitable contributions from the company and company foundations.

Alan T. Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said by e-mail that the company had ended support ""to several public policy research groups whose position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion about how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner.""

Joseph L. Bast, the president of the Heartland Institute, said Exxon and other companies were just shifting their stance to improve their image. The Heartland meeting, he said, was the last bastion of intellectual honesty on the climate issue.

""Major corporations are painting themselves green around global warming,"" Mr. Bast said, adding that the companies have shifted their lobbying and public relations efforts toward trying to shape climate legislation in their favor. He said that contributions, over all, had continued to rise.

But Kert Davies, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace, who is attending the Heartland event, said that the experts giving talks were ""a shrinking collection of extremists"" and that they were ""left talking to themselves.""

Organizers expected to top the attendance of about 500 at the first Heartland conference, held last year. They also point to the speaker's roster, which included Mr. Klaus and Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, Apollo astronaut and former senator.

A centerpiece of the 2008 meeting was the release of a report, ""Nature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Planet."" The document was expressly designed as a challenge to the reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

This year, the meeting will focus on a more nuanced question: ""Global warming: Was it ever a crisis?""

Most of the talks at the meeting will challenge climate orthodoxy. But some presenters, including prominent figures who have been vocal in their criticism in the past, say they will also call on their colleagues to synchronize the arguments they are using against plans to curb greenhouse gases.

In a keynote talk Sunday night, Richard S. Lindzen, a professor at M.I.T. and a longtime skeptic of the mainstream consensus that global warming poses a danger, first delivered a biting attack on what he called the ""climate alarm movement.""

There is no solid scientific evidence to back up the models used by climate scientists who warn of dire consequences if warming continues, he said. But Dr. Lindzen also criticized widely publicized assertions by other skeptics that variations in the sun were driving temperature changes in recent decades. To attribute short-term variation in temperatures to a single cause, whether human-generated gases or something else, is erroneous, he said.

Speaking of the sun's slight variability, he said, ""Acting as though this is the alternative"" to blaming greenhouse gases ""is asking for trouble.""

S. Fred Singer, a physicist often referred to by critics and supporters alike as the dean of climate contrarians, said that he would be running public and private sessions on Monday aimed at focusing participants on which skeptical arguments were supported by science and which were not.

""As a physicist, I am concerned that some skeptics (a very few) are ignoring the physical basis,"" Dr. Singer said in an e-mail message.

""There is one who denies that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, which goes against actual data,"" Dr. Singer said, adding that other skeptics wrongly contend that ""humans are not responsible for the measured increase in atmospheric CO2.""

There are notable absences from the conference this year. Russell Seitz, a physicist from Cambridge, Mass., gave a talk at last year's meeting. But Dr. Seitz, who has lambasted environmental campaigners as distorting climate science, now warns that the skeptics are in danger of doing the same thing.

The most strident advocates on either side of the global warming debate, he said, are ""equally oblivious to the data they seek to discount or dramatize.""

John H. Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama who has long publicly questioned projections of dangerous global warming, most recently at a House committee hearing last month, said he had skipped both Heartland conferences to avoid the potential for ""guilt by association.""

Many participants said that any division or dissent was minor and that the global recession and a series of years with cooler temperatures would help them in combating changes in energy policy in Washington.

""The only place where this alleged climate catastrophe is happening is in the virtual world of computer models, not in the real world,"" said Marc Morano, a speaker at the meeting and a spokesman on environmental issues for Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma.

But several climate scientists who are seeking to curb greenhouse gases strongly criticized the meeting. Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University and an author of many reports by the intergovernmental climate panel, said, after reviewing the text of presentations for the Heartland meeting, that they were efforts to ""bamboozle the innocent.""

Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations office managing international treaty talks on climate change, said, ""I don't believe that what the skeptics say should provide any excuse to delay further"" action against global warming.

But he added: ""Skeptics are good. It's important to give people the confidence that the issue is being called into question."""
"Foreign, Friday, March 20, 2009 605 mots, p. A 8",,Nations Near Arctic Declare Polar Bears Threatened by Climate Change,By ANDREW C. REVKIN; Walter Gibbs contributed reporting from Oslo.,,"Five countries that created a treaty nearly four decades ago to protect polar bears through limits on hunting issued a joint statement on Thursday identifying climate change as ""the most important long-term threat"" to the bears.

The statement came at the end of a three-day meeting in Tromso, Norway, of scientists and officials from the United States, Norway, Canada, Russia and Denmark, all with territory abutting the Arctic Ocean that serves as habitat for the bears. (Denmark was represented through Greenland, which is moving toward becoming an independent country.)

Bear experts at the meeting said the treaty parties were committed to collaborating on programs aimed at limiting direct threats to bear populations from increasing tourism, shipping and oil and gas drilling in the warming region.

But they said the countries bound by the 1973 bear agreement would be unable, without worldwide cooperation, to address the looming risk to the species: the prospect that global warming from emissions of greenhouse gases would continue to erode the sheath of Arctic sea ice that the half-ton bears roam in pursuit of seals.

In a telephone interview from Tromso, Rosa Meehan, the division chief in Alaska for marine mammals management of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, said that the agreement -- among countries with a range of environmental views -- signaled the strength of the science pointing to perils for the bears.

""Polar bears are facing a pretty rough road,"" Dr. Meehan said. ""The thing we need to do is look to the global community to seriously address and mitigate climate change."" The Norwegian government posted background on the meeting on the Internet at polarbearmeeting.org.

The species has probably existed across the Arctic for several hundred thousand years, researchers say. The animals are resilient, eating walrus, grasses and even snow goose eggs when they cannot hunt their preferred prey, bearded and ringed seals.

The bears were greatly depleted by unregulated hunting across much of the Arctic until the Soviet Union clamped down in 1956 and other countries followed, with the 1973 treaty one result. The current population across the Arctic has been estimated at 22,000 to 25,000 bears.

But last year the United States Interior Department granted the bears threatened status under the Endangered Species Act, citing the threat from retreating summertime sea ice. Other countries have been ratcheting up protections, although about 700 bears a year are still shot in Canada, Alaska and Greenland, according to Norway's environment agency.

Not everyone from countries ringing the Arctic agrees that the bears need to be singled out for protection in the face of climate change. Fernando Ugarte, head of mammal and bird science at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, said the government was concerned that the rising pressure to protect bears, particularly in the face of global warming, might prompt other countries to press Greenland to clamp down on hunting.

""I am not sure there is a scientific reason to appoint polar bears as the main icon of climate change,"" he said by telephone in Nuuk, Greenland's capital. ""There's a long list of animals that will be affected. Why not the walrus, the narwhal, the ringed seal?"" Mr. Ugarte said that scientists disagreed over why people around Baffin Bay and elsewhere had reported an increase in polar bear sightings in recent years. One explanation may be that the local bear population is robust. Another -- more likely in Mr. Ugarte's opinion -- is that climate change is forcing the bears into new migration patterns.

The Tromso meeting was watched closely by environmental groups, which had warned that some countries might press to exclude strong language about global warming. The bears have been enduring icons in climate campaigns conducted by such groups, with at least three groups seeking contributions through ""adopt a polar bear"" programs.

But the animals have also become a focal point for some elected officials and scientists who reject the need for cuts in the heat-trapping greenhouse gases, despite broad scientific consensus linking the gases to warming since 1950. Their argument, pointing to studies by American government scientists and other groups, is that hunting restrictions have caused most of the populations of bears around the Arctic to grow in recent decades and that long-term forecasts of ice retreats are flawed."
"Foreign, Friday, March 20, 2009 858 mots, p. A 6",,"In Silt, Bangladesh Sees Potential Shield Against Climate Shift",By SOMINI SENGUPTA,,"BEEL BHAINA, Bangladesh - The rivers that course down from the Himalayas and into this crowded delta bring an annual tide of gift and curse. They flood low-lying paddies for several months, sometimes years, at a time. And they ferry mountains of silt and sand from far away upstream.

Most of that sediment washes out into the roiling Bay of Bengal. But an accidental discovery by desperate delta folk here may hold clues to how Bangladesh, one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change, could harness some of that dark, rich Himalayan muck to protect itself against sea level rise.

Instead of allowing the silt to settle where it wants, Bangladesh has begun to channel it to where it is needed -- to fill in shallow soup bowls of land prone to flooding, or to create new land off its long, exposed coast.

The efforts have been limited to small experimental patches, not uniformly promising, and there is still ample concern that a swelling sea could one day soon swallow parts of Bangladesh. But the emerging evidence suggests that a nation that many see as indefensible to the ravages of human-induced climate change could literally raise itself up and save its people -- and do so cheaply and simply, using what the mountains and tides bring.

""You can do a lot with the silt that these rivers bring,"" said Bea M. ten Tusscher, the Dutch ambassador to Bangladesh. The Netherlands, itself accustomed to engineering its vulnerable low-lands, helps Bangladesh with water management projects. ""Those are like little diamonds,"" Ms. ten Tusscher said. ""You have to use it.""

Satellite images show that in the natural process of erosion and accretion -- in some places speeded up by a series of man-made dams and channels -- Bangladesh has actually gained land over the last 35 years.

Skeptics say it is folly to expect silt accretion to save the country. Accretion happens slowly, over centuries, they argue, while human-induced climate change is hurtling fast toward Bangladesh. The new land is too muddy and slushy for people to safely live on, and the force of the Himalayan rivers is so powerful that it can wash away newly gained land in one fluke season.

""If you have time to wait, it will happen,"" said Atiq Rahman of the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies. His country, he added, does not have time to wait.

The silt-trapping experiment has yielded tentative but visible gains here in Beel Bhaina, a low-lying 600-acre soup bowl of land on the banks of the Hari River, a tributary of the Ganges, about 55 miles upstream from the Bay of Bengal. Even at this distance from the coast, it is among the country's most susceptible to sea rise. The river swells each day with the tides. Creeping salinity in the water table is a harbinger of future danger.

Here, misery made way for a discovery. A devastating flood 10 years ago left this soup bowl -- a ""beel"" in Bengali -- inundated with water that reached above Abdul Lateef's head. No paddy could grow, recalled Mr. Lateef, now 56. Houses went under. The river was so heavily silted it hardly moved. Many families were reduced to penury.

One night, desperate to drain the water, Mr. Lateef and his neighbors punched a hole through the mud embankment that encircled the soup bowl. They watched as the water rushed out. Then the high tide began to haul in sediment, and the soup bowl swiftly filled with silt.

When the chief engineer of the local water board, Sheikh Nurul Ala, came to measure it, he saw that in four years, Beel Bhaina had risen by as much as three feet or more near the river bank, and almost as much farther inland. Today, it is a quilt of green and gray square patches of paddy, cut by square ponds to cultivate fish and shrimp. The river flows more freely now. Mr. Lateef collects an annual harvest of rice, the local staple, and farms shrimp, the most lucrative cash crop, after the rains.

Mr. Ala is trying the experiment in other soup bowls upstream, with mixed results. At one site, the accretion was too limited; at another, it has been promising in patches, but uneven.

American scientists have recommended a somewhat similar silt diversion program: opening Mississippi River levees south of New Orleans to allow sediment-rich water to flow over the region's marshes, which have been starved of silt since levee-building began in the region hundreds of years ago.

Bangladesh is among the nations most susceptible to climate change. Already prone to cyclones, it could be hit by more frequent and intense tropical storms. Seawater is creeping into the agricultural land. Its long coast is exposed to the hungry sea.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that a three-foot rise in sea levels could swallow nearly 20 percent of Bangladesh's territory. The peril is compounded by the fact that every inch of this densely populated country is settled, even those areas at the constant mercy of the water.

Taming the waters that spill into Bangladesh is no easy task. The rivers change course, banks shift, channels meander at will. They swell when the snows melt thousands of miles away and then again when the clouds burst, turning the green fields gray. They are also heavily engineered upstream: a dam built upstream in neighboring India can critically stanch the flow of freshwater down here, increasingly the chances of salinity and siltation.

The simple silt-trapping engineering here was not designed as an adaptation to sea rise, but Mr. Ala is convinced that it can outpace the projected three-foot rise in sea levels and at least offer some protection. ""Some benefit it will provide, I think, by raising the beels,"" he said. ""The problem will not be as severe for the land we can raise."""

"Week in Review, Sunday, March 29, 2009 782 mots, p. WK 3",,"Among Climate Scientists, a Dispute Over 'Tipping Points'",By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The language was apocalyptic. Last month, a leading climate scientist warned that Earth's rising temperatures were poised to set off irreversible disasters if steps were not taken quickly to stop global warming.

""The climate is nearing tipping points,"" the NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen wrote in The Observer newspaper of London. ""If we do not change course, we'll hand our children a situation that is out of their control.""

The resulting calamities, Dr. Hansen and other like-minded scientists have warned, could be widespread and overwhelming: the loss of untold species as ocean reefs and forests are disrupted; the transformation of the Amazon into parched savanna; a dangerous rise in sea levels resulting from the melting of the mile-high ice sheets in West Antarctica and Greenland; and the thawing of the Arctic tundra, which would release torrents of the greenhouse gas methane into the atmosphere.

But the idea that the planet is nearing tipping points -- thresholds at which change suddenly becomes unstoppable -- has driven a wedge between scientists who otherwise share deep concerns about the implications of a human-warmed climate.

Environmentalists and some climate experts are increasingly warning of impending tipping points in their efforts to stir public concern. The term confers a sense of immediacy and menace to potential threats from a warming climate -- dangers that otherwise might seem too distant for people to worry about.

But other scientists say there is little hard evidence to back up specific predictions of catastrophe. They worry that the use of the term ""tipping point"" can be misleading and could backfire, fueling criticism of alarmism and threatening public support for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

""I think a lot of this threshold and tipping point talk is dangerous,"" said Kenneth Caldeira, an earth scientist at Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution and an advocate of swift action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. ""If we say we passed thresholds and tipping points today, this will be an excuse for inaction tomorrow,"" he said.

While studies of climate patterns in the distant past clearly show the potential for drastic shifts, these scientists say, there is enormous uncertainty in making specific predictions about the future.

In some cases, there are big questions about whether climate-driven disasters -- like the loss of the Amazon or a rise in sea levels of several yards in a century -- are even plausible. And even in cases where most scientists agree that rising temperatures could lead to unstoppable change, no one knows where the thresholds lie that would set off such shifts.

Nevertheless, the use of the tipping point concept has intensified recently, as the Obama administration and Congress work on legislation to curb greenhouse gas emissions and the world's nations negotiate a new climate treaty.

In reports released this month, both the World Bank and the United Nations Environment Program focused on tipping points as a prime concern. And last year, a team of European scientists published an influential paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences compiling what is known and not known about various climatic tipping points -- including the loss of summer sea ice around the North Pole and worrisome changes in the West African monsoon.

The authors said they wanted to reduce the chance that ""society may be lulled into a false sense of security by smooth projections of global change.""

On the other hand, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its influential 2007 report, expressly avoided specifying tipping points and instead concluded simply that the gradient of risk for a host of ""large-scale discontinuities"" increased with each degree of warming.

Dr. Hansen defends the use of the term tipping point and said that it accurately depicts some probable consequences of unchecked global warming. There is abundant evidence, he says, that rising temperatures can have an abrupt, calamitous and ""nonlinear"" effect on glaciers and ecosystems.

""I assure you that nonlinear systems exist,"" Dr. Hansen said. ""Ice sheets really do disintegrate. Documented sea-level rises of 4 to 5 meters per century exists -- that was nonlinear collapse. Ecosystems also can collapse.""

He said that in discussing global warming, he refers not only to tipping points but to more general threats and that he was ""not sure where the confusion about tipping points comes from.""

But other scientists, who study the response to climate change of polar ice and tropical forests, said that they saw scant evidence of runaway disruption.

For example, the idea that recent sharp retreat of summer sea ice around the North Pole has now taken on its own momentum has been challenged recently in papers by the earth scientists John S. Wettlaufer of Yale and Ian Eisenman of the California Institute of Technology. They contend that thin ice floes have the capacity to regrow quickly as summer ends, balancing out the melting that occurs as sunlight hits and heats dark open water.

More generally, Dr. Wettlaufer has stressed the importance of being ""caustically honest about what we know and don't know.""

As policymakers try to address the risks facing the planet from a warming climate, some experts worry that focusing on tipping points and thresholds will perpetuate paralyzing debates over specifics -- and obscure the reality that decisions need to be made, even in the face of uncertainty.

""It would be far better to spend less time musing over tipping points,"" said Christopher Green, an economist who studies energy and climate at McGill University.

""Whether the probability is high, medium, or low, I think the response is the same: climate cannot be stabilized without an energy technology revolution,"" he said. ""One way or the other, we just need to get busy."""
"National, Sunday, March 29, 2009 319 mots, p. A 16",,White House Announces International Meetings to Address Energy and Climate Issues,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The Obama administration announced Saturday that it had organized a series of meetings among representatives of 16 countries and the European Union to discuss energy and climate issues.

The meetings, to be held in Washington in April and in La Maddalena, Italy, in July, will seek to resolve longstanding issues that have blocked the development of an international climate treaty.

The participants, who include Chinese and Indian representatives, will also try to create ""concrete initiatives and joint ventures that increase the supply of clean energy while cutting greenhouse gas emissions,"" according to a White House news release. The talks, called the Major Economies Meetings on Energy Security and Climate Change, echo in name and goals an initiative begun in the last two years of the Bush administration.

Those meetings gathered developing and developed countries that were the largest emitters of the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. The meetings were cast by the Bush administration as intended to set long-term goals for reducing emissions and to seek actions that could be taken in sectors of economies like power generation and manufacturing.

The talks organized by the Bush administration were criticized by some small developing countries, European officials and environmental groups as an effort to circumvent global climate negotiations led by the United Nations, although President George W. Bush said at the time that the meetings were intended to support the global talks.

The United States refused to ratify an earlier international agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, objecting that developing countries like China and India were not bound by its restrictions on emissions of heat-trapping gases.

Negotiations for a new global treaty are under way and will culminate in talks in Copenhagen in December.

The president of the National Wildlife Federation, Larry Schweiger, said Saturday that any such meetings were useful as ways to seek common ground among the world's biggest emitters of heat-trapping gases.

At the time, some environmentalists credited the Bush administration's effort for initiating direct exchanges about climate with China and India.

But Mr. Schweiger said he expected the Obama administration's initiative to be more productive.

""It's a matter of intent,"" he said. ""I think the Bush administration never intended to come up with a big solution. I think this administration is truly committed to finding a solution for everybody."""
"Foreign, Thursday, April 9, 2009 529 mots, p. A 12",,"At U.N. Talks On Climate, Plans by U.S. Raise Qualms",By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"BONN, Germany - At the start of the United Nations climate talks here 12 days ago, the Obama administration's chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern, received a round of rowdy applause. It was the first appearance of the new negotiating team at any global meeting.

But by Wednesday, as the meetings drew to a close, some delegates -- and even some United Nations officials -- were grumbling that the United States was not moving fast enough to take action on global warming.

On Wednesday, Mr. Stern's team offered the first broad hints of a new international climate policy for the United States, noting that more details would be submitted in a proposal to the United Nations later this month. But even in its broadest brush strokes, the American proposal differs significantly from other plans to curb carbon dioxide emissions enacted by the United Nations and the European Union.

The Obama administration's plan would require all countries, including developing nations like China and India, to curb greenhouse gas emissions, said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy special envoy for climate change, at a news conference. The plan's main focus is on long-range goals -- as distant as 2050 -- for greenhouse gas reduction.

Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, initial emission-reduction targets for the developed nations that signed the agreement were set for 2012. And most other proposals to lower emissions, including the plan in use in the European Union, focus on 2020 as an initial target. Though he praised Europe's efforts, Mr. Pershing said, ""U.S. policy is something we're developing at home, according to what we see as the science and political capacity.""

But many officials here were clearly impatient. ""We are still waiting for the U.S. to put its position on the table,"" said Michael Zammit-Cutajar, a top official of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. ""They have asked us to keep the door open, and it is,"" he said.

Mr. Pershing said that the Obama administration was working to fill in the plan. ""We promise in June to come back with a much more detailed set of policies,"" Mr. Pershing said. Negotiations resume here on June 1.

Mr. Pershing said the United States was committed to working within the United Nations process. He suggested, however, that specifics -- like how much the United States would reduce emissions, when the reductions would take place and how much money would be spent on curbing emissions -- were unlikely to be forthcoming by June. ""Those numbers will be determined by Congress,"" he said. Congress has started debating legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade system.

Under the Bush administration, the United States never accepted binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions -- a policy that Mr. Obama promised to overturn. During the campaign, he proposed that the United States should reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and reduce levels progressively to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050.

At the time, many environmental groups regarded the 2020 target as inadequate. The European Union has proposed reductions of between 25 and 40 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2020. Various plans floated here by China, South Africa and the Philippines would require developed countries to reduce emissions by up to 50 percent by 2020. Mr. Pershing dismissed such proposals as a ""a negotiating gambit.""

Even so, many said the lack of any numbers from the United States was holding up progress.

""Countries are very, very nervous to come forward without seeing the United States' numbers,"" said Harald Dovland, the official in charge of negotiations among countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol.

The Obama team held dozens of bilateral meetings here with other countries, contributing to a generally positive atmosphere.

""Its great to have them reengaged,"" said Keya Chatterjee, deputy director of the climate change program at WWF in Washington. ""But they've got to come back with some concrete proposals -- with some goods -- next time to really get the negotiations going."""
"National, Thursday, April 9, 2009 865 mots, p. A 17",,Climate Legislation Sends Chill Through Areas Fueled by Coal,By FELICITY BARRINGER,,"ST. LOUIS - Chatting with a visitor about energy issues in the back of the Greater Mount Carmel Baptist Church here, a group of women exploded in laughter at the idea that their electric rates were among the lowest in the nation.

""We can barely afford what we have now,"" said Renee Daniels-Hanner, 48, an office manager who lives with her husband, a postal employee, and their teenage daughter in a three-bedroom brick home in the city's Baden neighborhood.

The house, built in 1953, has central air-conditioning to ward off the heat and humidity of Mississippi River summers, a double-door refrigerator, a washer and dryer, six televisions, three computers and an iron (""We iron all the time,"" Ms. Daniels-Hanner said). The family's monthly electric bill averages $160 in winter and $250 in summer.

From the wheat fields of the north-central region to Kansas City's necklace of industrial parks to the brick street fronts of St. Louis, Missouri's reliance on cheap electricity is deeply ingrained.

But few pay attention to the origin of their little-noticed savings: 21 coal-fired power plants that emit more than 75 million tons of carbon dioxide annually and generate 80 percent of Missouri's electricity. Even residents who endorse wind and solar energy have grown accustomed to the benefits of state policies that favor coal by putting a premium on low-cost electricity. So the idea of federal climate legislation that could increase electricity bills by putting a price on emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide is unsettling.

For Missourians, said Robert Clayton, chairman of the state's Public Service Commission, ""the consequence of using more power hasn't been great.""

Missouri is hardly alone. Nebraska, Indiana and Iowa are also states where coal turns on most of the lights.

That is why, even before Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, proposed legislation that would put a price on carbon-dioxide emissions, Senate and House Democrats from coal-using states began to push back.

They are concerned that the new costs would get passed on to consumers, to Ms. Daniels-Hanner, to farmers from rural Missouri and to employers like the energy-hungry Noranda aluminum plant in New Madrid in the southeast of the state, which has 1,000 workers. And they worry that in an already wounded economy, increased costs could turn one of the relatively few economic blessings into a blight.

Here in Missouri, economic incentives built into the state's laws, history and habits encourage burning as much coal as possible. Peabody Energy started as a local business a century ago and now promotes itself as the world's leading coal merchant. Trainloads of Wyoming coal cross Missouri daily.

The cars arrive at places like Meramec, a 56-year-old, 850-megawatt power plant in south St. Louis County. The cost of building the sprawling plant has long since been paid off by its owner, AmerenUE, an investor-owned utility. Because Meramec generates electricity from cheap fuel, it produces cheap power. And because Meramec's operational costs are low and most equipment-replacement costs have been recouped, AmerenUE often underbids competitors in selling excess electricity out of state. These profits give Missouri consumers an extra discount. From 1987 to 2007, AmerenUE and its predecessor, Union Electric, did not raise electric rates, while power production rose about 65 percent.

Estimates of the effects of the proposed federal climate legislation on electric rates vary. The central thrust of the Waxman-Markey bill is to make carbon-dioxide emissions expensive by capping them and creating allowances that utilities must acquire to function.

In Washington, the measure is seen as a starting point and has little Republican support, which would make the backing of coal-state Democrats like Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri critical.

Jaime Haro, AmerenUE's director of asset management and trading, said his company paid $30 to produce a megawatt of electricity. The coal burned emits roughly a ton of carbon dioxide. If federal legislation effectively prices emissions at $30 a ton -- estimates have varied from $20 to $115 -- ""my costs could double,"" Mr. Haro said.

Those costs probably would be passed on to customers.

For now, Missouri ranks among the lowest five states in retail electricity rates -- about 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with a national average of 8.9 cents.

Ms. Daniels-Hanner and LaVerne McCoy find that surprising. Ms. McCoy, who works for a community-based group, ADE Consulting Services, has spent $4,000 weatherizing her split-level home in Richmond Heights, just west of St. Louis. Her bills still average $320 monthly.

About 130 miles to the northwest, Wendi Wood, a teacher, and her husband, Lee Wood, a fourth-generation farmer, live near the small town of Clarence with their three teenagers. Their six-bedroom house is four years old, and they, too, have many appliances, including seven televisions.

Electricity costs them about $280 in winter, $360 in summer. After the fall harvest, they dry grain in a silo; then the bills run $600 a month.

""Electricity is a major factor in what we can afford,"" Ms. Wood said. She wants Washington to fight climate change, but said, ""Don't hurt the rural farmer and rural America to do it.""

The state is taking some steps to reduce its dependence on coal, like legislation pending in the General Assembly to give financial incentives for conservation. In November, voters approved expanding renewable-energy options.

State utilities have varied plans. AmerenUE talks of building a companion to its nuclear power plant. Kansas City Power & Light is buying more wind power to offset emissions from a coal plant under construction. Springfield's municipal utility is experimenting with underground storage of carbon dioxide. Associated Electrical Cooperative Inc. offers energy-saving light bulbs to its 800,000 rural customers and subsidizes home energy audits.

""Ultimately, there's going to have to be a re-evaluation of Missouri's future,"" Mr. Clayton said.

Like Ms. Wood, Ms. Daniels-Hanner and Ms. McCoy worry about the effects of climate change.

""We want to help our grandchildren,"" Ms. McCoy said. ""My problem is that the brunt of the improvement is going to be put on the backs of those who can't afford it."""
"National, Saturday, April 11, 2009 769 mots, p. A 10",,"Obama, Who Vowed Rapid Action on Climate Change, Turns More Cautious",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - President Obama came to office promising swift and comprehensive action to combat global climate change, and the topic remains a surefire applause line in his speeches here and abroad.

Yet the administration has taken a cautious and rather passive role on the issue, proclaiming broad goals while remaining aloof from details of climate legislation now in Congress.

The president's budget initially included roughly $650 billion in revenue over 10 years from a cap-and-trade emissions plan that he wants adopted. But the administration, while insisting that its health care initiative be protected, did not fight to keep cap-and-trade in the budget resolutions that Congress passed last week, and it wound up in neither the House's version nor the Senate's.

Overseas, American officials are telling their counterparts that they need time to gauge the American public's appetite for an ambitious carbon reduction scheme before leading any international effort.

Has the administration scaled back its global-warming goals, at least for this year, or is it engaged in sophisticated misdirection?

Maybe some of both. While addressing climate change appears to be slipping down the president's list of priorities for the year, he is holding in reserve a powerful club to regulate carbon dioxide emissions through executive authority.

That club takes the form of Environmental Protection Agency regulation of the gases blamed for the warming of the planet, an authority granted the agency by the Supreme Court's reading of the Clean Air Act. Administration officials consistently say they would much prefer that Congress write new legislation to pre-empt the E.P.A. regulatory power, but they are clearly holding it in reserve as a prod to reluctant lawmakers and recalcitrant industries and as evidence of good faith to other nations.

Industry lobbyists and members of Congress who are engaged in writing energy and global warming bills say they are well aware of the E.P.A. process bearing down on them.

""Once the Supreme Court declared carbon dioxide to be a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, E.P.A. had no choice but to act,"" said Representative Rick Boucher, a moderate Democrat from a coal-producing region of Virginia. ""Most people would rather have Congress act. We can be more balanced; we can take into account the effects on the economy. But if we don't undertake this, E.P.A. certainly will.""

Still, the agency's regulations would take months to write and years to become fully effective. Meanwhile, Congress is already starting work on energy and climate legislation, though without significant guidance from the White House, at least in public.

Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator of energy and climate policy, issued a surprisingly bland statement last week when two top House Democrats unveiled a far-reaching plan to cap greenhouse gases and move the nation toward an economy less dependent on carbon-rich fuels like coal and oil.

Ms. Browner stopped short of endorsing that plan, issued by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, saying instead that Mr. Obama ""looks forward to working with members of Congress in both chambers to pass a bill that would transition the nation to a clean-energy economy."" She gave little clue as to what she and the president believe such a measure should say.

At an international climate conference in Germany that ended Wednesday, some delegates said they were disappointed in the Obama administration's lack of robust leadership. The explanation offered by Jonathan Pershing, a leader of the American delegation, was that the administration was waiting to measure the American technological and political capacity to address climate change and was looking to Congress to set specific targets for reducing carbon pollution.

Business lobbyists welcome the White House's go-slow approach, saying the issue is too complicated and too costly to be rushed, especially in a recession.

""We have not until now had a national debate on a climate change proposal, period,"" said Karen A. Harbert, a former senior Energy Department official who now heads the United States Chamber of Commerce's energy institute. ""That has to happen for any piece of legislation to achieve broad support across the country.""

Ms. Harbert and other business lobbyists also welcomed the administration's hesitancy to undertake regulation of climate-altering gases under E.P.A. authority, saying the matter should be fully aired before Congress so that all interests and regions could be heard.

Keith McCoy, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, said his organization was ""strongly opposed to an E.P.A. regulatory process for greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.""

Mr. McCoy said his members would prefer a binding international treaty that would cover all nations, particularly those whose industries compete with energy-intensive American manufacturers. ""Absent that,"" he said, ""we would prefer a robust and transparent debate within Congress.""

The administration's caution leaves many environmental advocates frustrated, although most are reluctant to speak on the record for fear of alienating their allies inside government.

One environmental and energy lobbyist with close ties to the White House said the administration had been inhibited by a number of factors, including vacancies in many top policy jobs, an intense early focus on the financial and economic crises, and an unwillingness to alienate business and Congressional leaders with a heavy-handed approach.

""With those realities, coupled with the fact that the president himself realizes this is harder to do in the midst of recession, they are basically content to see what Congress will do,"" this lobbyist said. ""Plus, Henry Waxman has put together a very serious piece of legislation, and that in my mind justifies their lack of forceful intervention. That's just where they are now."""
"Foreign, Thursday, April 16, 2009 1286 mots, p. A 1",,BY DEGREES,,,"Soot From Third-World Stoves Is New Target in Climate Fight
By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

KOHLUA, India - ""It's hard to believe that this is what's melting the glaciers,"" said Dr. Veerabhadran Ramanathan, one of the world's leading climate scientists, as he weaved through a warren of mud brick huts, each containing a mud cookstove pouring soot into the atmosphere.

As women in ragged saris of a thousand hues bake bread and stew lentils in the early evening over fires fueled by twigs and dung, children cough from the dense smoke that fills their homes. Black grime coats the undersides of thatched roofs. At dawn, a brown cloud stretches over the landscape like a diaphanous dirty blanket.

In Kohlua, in central India, with no cars and little electricity, emissions of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas linked to global warming, are near zero. But soot -- also known as black carbon -- from tens of thousands of villages like this one in developing countries is emerging as a major and previously unappreciated source of global climate change.

While carbon dioxide may be the No. 1 contributor to rising global temperatures, scientists say, black carbon has emerged as an important No. 2, with recent studies estimating that it is responsible for 18 percent of the planet's warming, compared with 40 percent for carbon dioxide. Decreasing black carbon emissions would be a relatively cheap way to significantly rein in global warming -- especially in the short term, climate experts say. Replacing primitive cooking stoves with modern versions that emit far less soot could provide a much-needed stopgap, while nations struggle with the more difficult task of enacting programs and developing technologies to curb carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels.

In fact, reducing black carbon is one of a number of relatively quick and simple climate fixes using existing technologies -- often called ""low hanging fruit"" -- that scientists say should be plucked immediately to avert the worst projected consequences of global warming. ""It is clear to any person who cares about climate change that this will have a huge impact on the global environment,"" said Dr. Ramanathan, a professor of climate science at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, who is working with the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi on a project to help poor families acquire new stoves.

""In terms of climate change we're driving fast toward a cliff, and this could buy us time,"" said Dr. Ramanathan, who left India 40 years ago but returned to his native land for the project.

Better still, decreasing soot could have a rapid effect. Unlike carbon dioxide, which lingers in the atmosphere for years, soot stays there for a few weeks. Converting to low-soot cookstoves would remove the warming effects of black carbon quickly, while shutting a coal plant takes years to substantially reduce global CO2 concentrations.

But the awareness of black carbon's role in climate change has come so recently that it was not even mentioned as a warming agent in the 2007 summary report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that pronounced the evidence for global warming to be ""unequivocal."" Mark Z. Jacobson, professor of environmental engineering at Stanford, said that the fact that black carbon was not included in international climate efforts was ""bizarre,"" but ""partly reflects how new the idea is."" The United Nations is trying to figure out how to include black carbon in climate change programs, as is the federal government.

In Asia and Africa, cookstoves produce the bulk of black carbon, although it also emanates from diesel engines and coal plants there. In the United States and Europe, black carbon emissions have already been reduced significantly by filters and scrubbers.

Like tiny heat-absorbing black sweaters, soot particles warm the air and melt the ice by absorbing the sun's heat when they settle on glaciers. One recent study estimated that black carbon might account for as much as half of Arctic warming. While the particles tend to settle over time and do not have the global reach of greenhouse gases, they do travel, scientists now realize. Soot from India has been found in the Maldive Islands and on the Tibetan Plateau; from the United States, it travels to the Arctic. The environmental and geopolitical implications of soot emissions are enormous. Himalayan glaciers are expected to lose 75 percent of their ice by 2020, according to Prof. Syed Iqbal Hasnain, a glacier specialist from the Indian state of Sikkim.

These glaciers are the source of most of the major rivers in Asia. The short-term result of glacial melt is severe flooding in mountain communities. The number of floods from glacial lakes is already rising sharply, Professor Hasnain said. Once the glaciers shrink, Asia's big rivers will run low or dry for part of the year, and desperate battles over water are certain to ensue in a region already rife with conflict.

Doctors have long railed against black carbon for its devastating health effects in poor countries. The combination of health and environmental benefits means that reducing soot provides a ""very big bang for your buck,"" said Erika Rosenthal, a senior lawyer at Earth Justice, a Washington organization. ""Now it's in everybody's self-interest to deal with things like cookstoves -- not just because hundreds of thousands of women and children far away are dying prematurely.""

In the United States, black carbon emissions are indirectly monitored and minimized through federal and state programs that limit small particulate emissions, a category of particles damaging to human health that includes black carbon. But in March, a bill was introduced in Congress that would require the Environmental Protection Agency to specifically regulate black carbon and direct aid to black carbon reduction projects abroad, including introducing cookstoves in 20 million homes. The new stoves cost about $20 and use solar power or are more efficient. Soot is reduced by more than 90 percent. The solar stoves do not use wood or dung. Other new stoves simply burn fuel more cleanly, generally by pulverizing the fuel first and adding a small fan that improves combustion.

That remote rural villages like Kohlua could play an integral role in tackling the warming crisis is hard to imagine. There are no cars -- the village chief's ancient white Jeep sits highly polished but unused in front of his house, a museum piece. There is no running water and only intermittent electricity, which powers a few light bulbs.

The 1,500 residents here grow wheat, mustard and potatoes and work as day laborers in Agra, home of the Taj Majal, about two hours away by bus.

They earn about $2 a day and, for the most part, have not heard about climate change. But they have noticed frequent droughts in recent years that scientists say may be linked to global warming. Crops ripen earlier and rot more frequently than they did 10 years ago. The villagers are aware, too, that black carbon can corrode. In Agra, cookstoves and diesel engines are forbidden in the area around the Taj Majal, because soot damages the precious facade.

Still, replacing hundreds of millions of cookstoves -- the source of heat, food and sterile water -- is not a simple matter. ""I'm sure they'd look nice, but I'd have to see them, to try them,"" said Chetram Jatrav, as she squatted by her cookstove making tea and a flatbread called roti. Her three children were coughing.

She would like a stove that ""made less smoke and used less fuel"" but cannot afford one, she said, pushing a dung cake bought for one rupee into the fire. She had just bought her first rolling pin so her flatbread could come out ""nice and round,"" as her children had seen in elementary school. Equally important, the open fires of cookstoves give some of the traditional foods their taste. Urging these villagers to make roti in a solar cooker meets the same mix of rational and irrational resistance as telling an Italian that risotto tastes just fine if cooked in the microwave.

In March, the cookstove project, called Surya, began ""market testing"" six alternative cookers in villages, in part to quantify their benefits. Already, the researchers fret that the new stoves look like scientific instruments and are fragile; one broke when a villager pushed twigs in too hard.

But if black carbon is ever to be addressed on a large scale, acceptance of the new stoves is crucial. ""I'm not going to go to the villagers and say CO2 is rising, and in 50 years you might have floods,"" said Dr. Ibrahim Rehman, Dr. Ramanathan's collaborator at the Energy and Resources Institute. ""I'll tell her about the lungs and her kids and I know it will help with climate change as well."""
"National, Thursday, April 23, 2009 634 mots, p. A 17",,Administration Stops Short Of Endorsing Climate Bill,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - Obama administration officials said Wednesday that an ambitious energy and climate-change proposal sponsored by House Democrats could help create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but they stopped short of endorsing it.

Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, and Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a House committee considering the measure that they believed it could help accomplish President Obama's goals of moderating climate change, spurring clean-energy technology and reducing dependence on foreign oil.

Yet both said they were still studying the details of the 648-page draft, unveiled late last month by two Democratic lawmakers, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. In fact, Dr. Chu and Ms. Jackson said that they had not read the entire draft and that the administration had not given its blessings to the bill. They said they would work closely with Congress to help fashion acceptable legislation.

The House measure, the most far-reaching piece of energy and environmental legislation to come before Congress in years, would require large changes in the way the United States generates electricity, manufactures products, heats and lights its homes and offices, and moves people and goods.

One central provision would establish a cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Obama has repeatedly pushed the idea of a cap-and-trade plan as part of any eventual measure -- he did so again Wednesday at an Earth Day observance in Iowa -- but he and his senior aides have left the details to Congress.

Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Dr. Chu and Ms. Jackson testified Wednesday along with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, has begun a month of intensive work on the legislation with the announced goal of moving it through the committee by late May. The panel will hear from 67 witnesses this week and will begin subcommittee work next week.

Mr. Waxman faces vocal skepticism from most Republicans on his committee, several of whom complained at Wednesday's hearing that the bill would drastically raise energy costs and lead to large job losses. They also said Mr. Waxman was moving too quickly on a measure with such profound consequences.

Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, called the legislation a ""cap and tax"" proposal that would ""kick working families when they're down.""

But Mr. Waxman and other Democrats cited an E.P.A. study issued on Tuesday that said the bill would have a negligible effect on the American economy and consumers' pocketbooks.

Ms. Jackson said the Waxman-Markey measure would impose ""modest costs compared to the benefits.""

While the committee will be exposed to hour upon hour of such argument from lawmakers, government officials, industry executives, academics and environmental advocates over the next days and weeks, the real action on the bill is going on behind the scenes.

Under any sort of cap-and-trade scheme, government sets an overall limit on emissions while allowing companies to trade permits, known as allowances, to pollute. But the House draft does not address two central issues. First, it does not say how many of the allowances the government will give away, if any, and how many it will auction. Democrats from states dependent on coal and manufacturing are asking that a sizable portion of the allowances be granted free, to mitigate the costs of the carbon cap.

Second, the legislation does not say what will be done with the proceeds of any auction of permits, estimated in Mr. Obama's budget proposal to be worth at least $65 billion a year.

Negotiations are under way to resolve those questions, and the answers will determine how many Democrats ultimately support the bill and whether any Republicans do.

Those financial issues will also be crucial to winning support in the Senate, where on Wednesday two unlikely bedfellows announced legislation requiring the E.P.A. to conduct a study on the environmental effects of so-called black carbon, the soot that lands on Arctic ice and other reflective surfaces and contributes to global warming.

Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who are usually about as far apart on environmental issues as it is possible to be, are among the sponsors of the bill. They called black carbon a ""dangerous pollutant"" emitted by old, dirty diesel engines and the burning of wood, peat and dung. They said it was thought to be the second-largest cause of global climate change, after carbon dioxide."
"National, Friday, April 24, 2009 971 mots, p. A 1",,"On Climate Issue, Industry Ignored Its Scientists",By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"For more than a decade the Global Climate Coalition, a group representing industries with profits tied to fossil fuels, led an aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign against the idea that emissions of heat-trapping gases could lead to global warming.

""The role of greenhouse gases in climate change is not well understood,"" the coalition said in a scientific ""backgrounder"" provided to lawmakers and journalists through the early 1990s, adding that ""scientists differ"" on the issue.

But a document filed in a federal lawsuit demonstrates that even as the coalition worked to sway opinion, its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted.

""The scientific basis for the Greenhouse Effect and the potential impact of human emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied,"" the experts wrote in an internal report compiled for the coalition in 1995.

The coalition was financed by fees from large corporations and trade groups representing the oil, coal and auto industries, among others. In 1997, the year an international climate agreement that came to be known as the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated, its budget totaled $1.68 million, according to tax records obtained by environmental groups.

Throughout the 1990s, when the coalition conducted a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign challenging the merits of an international agreement, policy makers and pundits were fiercely debating whether humans could dangerously warm the planet. Today, with general agreement on the basics of warming, the debate has largely moved on to the question of how extensively to respond to rising temperatures.

Environmentalists have long maintained that industry knew early on that the scientific evidence supported a human influence on rising temperatures, but that the evidence was ignored for the sake of companies' fight against curbs on greenhouse gas emissions. Some environmentalists have compared the tactic to that once used by tobacco companies, which for decades insisted that the science linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer was uncertain. By questioning the science on global warming, these environmentalists say, groups like the Global Climate Coalition were able to sow enough doubt to blunt public concern about a consequential issue and delay government action.

George Monbiot, a British environmental activist and writer, said that by promoting doubt, industry had taken advantage of news media norms requiring neutral coverage of issues, just as the tobacco industry once had.

""They didn't have to win the argument to succeed,"" Mr. Monbiot said, ""only to cause as much confusion as possible.""

William O'Keefe, at the time a leader of the Global Climate Coalition, said in a telephone interview that the group's leadership had not been aware of a gap between the public campaign and the advisers' views. Mr. O'Keefe said the coalition's leaders had felt that the scientific uncertainty justified a cautious approach to addressing cuts in greenhouse gases.

The coalition disbanded in 2002, but some members, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute, continue to lobby against any law or treaty that would sharply curb emissions. Others, like Exxon Mobil, now recognize a human contribution to global warming and have largely dropped financial support to groups challenging the science.

Documents drawn up by the coalition's advisers were provided to lawyers by the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, a coalition member, during the discovery process in a lawsuit that the auto industry filed in 2007 against the State of California's efforts to limit vehicles' greenhouse gas emissions. The documents included drafts of a primer written for the coalition by its technical advisory committee, as well as minutes of the advisers' meetings.

The documents were recently sent to The New York Times by a lawyer for environmental groups that sided with the state. The lawyer, eager to maintain a cordial relationship with the court, insisted on anonymity because the litigation is continuing.

The advisory committee was led by Leonard S. Bernstein, a chemical engineer and climate expert then at the Mobil Corporation. At the time the committee's primer was drawn up, policy makers in the United States and abroad were arguing over the scope of the international climate-change agreement that in 1997 became the Kyoto Protocol.

The primer rejected the idea that mounting evidence already suggested that human activities were warming the climate, as a 1995 report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had concluded. (In a report in 2007, the panel concluded with near certainty that most recent warming had been caused by humans.)

Yet the primer also found unpersuasive the arguments being used by skeptics, including the possibility that temperatures were only appearing to rise because of flawed climate records.

""The contrarian theories raise interesting questions about our total understanding of climate processes, but they do not offer convincing arguments against the conventional model of greenhouse gas emission-induced climate change,"" the advisory committee said in the 17-page primer.

According to the minutes of an advisory committee meeting that are among the disclosed documents, the primer was approved by the coalition's operating committee early in 1996. But the approval came only after the operating committee had asked the advisers to omit the section that rebutted the contrarian arguments.

""This idea was accepted,"" the minutes said, ""and that portion of the paper will be dropped.""

The primer itself was never publicly distributed.

Mr. O'Keefe, who was then chairman of the Global Climate Coalition and a senior official of the American Petroleum Institute, the lobby for oil companies, said in the phone interview that he recalled seeing parts of the primer.

But he said he was not aware of the dropped sections when a copy of the approved final draft was sent to him. He said a change of that kind would have been made by the staff before the document was brought to the board for final consideration.

""I have no idea why the section on the contrarians would have been deleted,"" said Mr. O'Keefe, now chief executive of the Marshall Institute, a nonprofit research group that opposes a mandatory cap on greenhouse gas emissions.

""One thing I'm absolutely certain of,"" he said, ""is that no member of the board of the Global Climate Coalition said, 'We have to suppress this.' ""

Benjamin D. Santer, a climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory whose work for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was challenged by the Global Climate Coalition and allied groups, said the coalition was ""engaging in a full-court press at the time, trying to cast doubt on the bottom-line conclusion of the I.P.C.C."" That panel concluded in 1995 that ""the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.""

""I'm amazed and astonished,"" Dr. Santer said, ""that the Global Climate Coalition had in their possession scientific information that substantiated our cautious findings and then chose to suppress that information."""
"National, Tuesday, April 28, 2009 395 mots, p. A 16",,"U.S. Ready to Lead on Climate Pact, Clinton Says",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - After eight years largely on the sidelines of the international policy debate on climate change, the United States is prepared to lead negotiations toward a new global warming treaty, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday.

""The United States is fully engaged and determined to lead and make up for lost time both at home and abroad,"" Mrs. Clinton told delegates from 16 countries at a State Department conference on energy and climate. ""We are back in the game.""

The meeting in Washington was the first of three planned sessions among the participating countries, who together account for roughly 75 percent of emissions of the gases blamed for the heating of the planet. Officials said the conference, the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, was intended to supplement, not replace, broader talks that begin in Copenhagen in December to write a new international treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol.

The Kyoto accord, which was negotiated in 1997 by the United Nations and expires in 2012, set emissions targets for industrialized nations, but many have not met them. The United States never ratified the treaty, in part because it did not include growing economies like China and India.

Mrs. Clinton said there was no longer any question that growing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases were causing a warming of the planet, with potentially catastrophic results. She said global climate change posed environmental, economic, health and security challenges that must be addressed by individual countries and by the community of nations.

Speaking directly to representatives of developing nations, who are skeptical of the motives of the United States and other industrialized countries on the issue, Mrs. Clinton that the United States would not seek to limit the use of energy in the developing world but would help make it cleaner.

""We want your economies to grow,"" she said as representatives of Brazil, China, India and Indonesia listened. ""We want your people to have a higher standard of living.""

Dinesh K. Patnaik, a member of the Indian delegation, said his country was glad to see the Obama administration taking climate change seriously and devoting significant money and political attention to the issue.

Mr. Patnaik said India and other developing nations hoped the talks would establish a level of trust with the industrial world that had so far been lacking.

""We want assurances that the developed countries will not renege on their commitments,"" he said, adding, ""The United States cannot solve the world's problems, but the problems cannot be solved without the United States.""

The meeting concludes Tuesday. American officials said they did not expect the group to issue any major policy statements."
"National, Saturday, May 2, 2009 634 mots, p. A 11",,Another Weapon Emerges in the Combat Over Global Warming: A Thesaurus,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The problem with global warming, some environmentalists believe, is ""global warming.""

The term turns people off, fostering images of shaggy-haired liberals, economic sacrifice and complex scientific disputes, according to extensive polling and focus group sessions conducted by ecoAmerica, a nonprofit environmental marketing and messaging firm in Washington.

Instead of grim warnings about global warming, the firm advises, talk about ""our deteriorating atmosphere."" Drop discussions of carbon dioxide and bring up ""moving away from the dirty fuels of the past."" Don't confuse people with cap and trade; use terms like ""cap and cash back"" or ""pollution reduction refund.""

EcoAmerica has been conducting research for the last several years to find new ways to frame environmental issues and so build public support for climate change legislation and other initiatives. A summary of the group's latest findings and recommendations was accidentally sent by e-mail to a number of news organizations by someone who sat in this week on a briefing intended for government officials and environmental leaders.

Asked about the summary, ecoAmerica's president and founder, Robert M. Perkowitz, requested that it not be reported until the formal release of the firm's full paper later this month, but acknowledged that its wide distribution now made compliance with his request unlikely.

The research directly parallels marketing studies conducted by oil companies, utilities and coal mining concerns that are trying to ""green"" their images with consumers and sway public policy.

Environmental issues consistently rate near the bottom of public worry, according to many public opinion polls. A Pew Research Center poll released in January found global warming last among 20 voter concerns; it trailed issues like addressing moral decline and decreasing the influence of lobbyists. ""We know why it's lowest,"" said Mr. Perkowitz, a marketer of outdoor clothing and home furnishings before he started ecoAmerica, whose activities are financed by corporations, foundations and individuals. ""When someone thinks of global warming, they think of a politicized, polarized argument. When you say 'global warming,' a certain group of Americans think that's a code word for progressive liberals, gay marriage and other such issues.""

The answer, Mr. Perkowitz said in his presentation at the briefing, is to reframe the issue using different language. ""Energy efficiency"" makes people think of shivering in the dark. Instead, it is more effective to speak of ""saving money for a more prosperous future."" In fact, the group's surveys and focus groups found, it is time to drop the term ""the environment"" and talk about ""the air we breathe, the water our children drink.""

""Another key finding: remember to speak in TALKING POINTS aspirational language about shared American ideals, like freedom, prosperity, independence and self-sufficiency while avoiding jargon and details about policy, science, economics or technology,"" said the e-mail account of the group's study.

Mr. Perkowitz and allies in the environmental movement have been briefing officials in Congress and the administration in the hope of using the findings to change the terms of the debate now under way in Washington.

Opponents of legislation to combat global warming are engaged in a similar effort. Trying to head off a cap-and-trade system, in which government would cap the amount of heat-trapping emissions allowed and let industry trade permits to emit those gases, they are coaching Republicans to refer to any such system as a giant tax that would kill jobs. Coal companies are taking out full-page advertisements promising ""clean, green coal."" The natural gas industry refers to its product as ""clean fuel green fuel."" Oil companies advertise their investments in alternative energy.

Robert J. Brulle of Drexel University, an expert on environmental communications, said ecoAmerica's campaign was a mirror image of what industry and political conservatives were doing. ""The form is the same; the message is just flipped,"" he said. ""You want to sell toothpaste, we'll sell it. You want to sell global warming, we'll sell that. It's the use of advertising techniques to manipulate public opinion.""

He said the approach was cynical and, worse, ineffective. ""The right uses it, the left uses it, but it doesn't engage people in a face-to-face manner,"" he said, ""and that's the only way to achieve real, lasting social change.""

Frank Luntz, a Republican communications consultant, prepared a strikingly similar memorandum in 2002, telling his clients that they were losing the environmental debate and advising them to adjust their language. He suggested referring to themselves as ""conservationists"" rather than ""environmentalists,"" and emphasizing ""common sense"" over scientific argument.

And, Mr. Luntz and Mr. Perkowitz agree, ""climate change"" is an easier sell than ""global warming."""
"Editorial, Friday, May 8, 2009 469 mots, p. A 30",,EDITORIAL,,,"Earlier this week, and not a moment too soon, President Obama put the weight of his office behind a bill that aims to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, tackle the rise in greenhouse gases and create millions of clean-energy jobs.

The bill has been stuck in a House committee: uniformly opposed by Republicans; feared by rust-belt Democrats who think it will hurt manufacturers; regarded with suspicion by some environmentalists who think it offers too many escape hatches.

Mr. Obama told Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to work out a consensus, which they must do. Though flawed, the bill is an honorable start on a problem too long neglected. Fix it, but get on with it, in the certain knowledge that failure to act would almost certainly doom comprehensive climate change legislation for this year and, probably, for this Congress.

The heart of the bill is a provision to reduce greenhouse gases by 20 percent from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by midcentury -- cuts scientists say are necessary to avert the worst consequences of global warming. The mechanism for achieving them is a cap-and-trade system that would place a steadily declining ceiling on emissions while allowing emitters to trade permits, or allowances, to give them more flexibility in meeting their targets. This would put a price on carbon, ideally raising the cost of older, dirtier fuels while steering investment to cleaner ones.

Since previous bills focusing exclusively on capping emissions have gone nowhere, the two seasoned politicians behind this one -- Representatives Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts -- are offering other provisions aimed at increasing energy efficiency, encouraging cleaner energy sources and providing subsidies for industries that produce them. Their theory is that if they can win over the diverse and cantankerous energy committee they can win the House itself.

The bill deliberately left big questions open for discussion, and as negotiations proceed, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey must resist crippling concessions. One debate is whether companies should get the allowances the government will assign to polluters for free or whether they should pay for them at an auction.

Legislators from coal-dependent states want free allowances to mitigate costs of compliance and give emitters time to switch to cleaner fuels. Others fear that free allowances would delay hard choices while reducing revenues the government could use to make clean-energy investments and help the poor with higher energy costs.

Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey should make only modest adjustments, if any, in their original targets; better no bill than one that would cut the 2020 reduction goal from 20 percent to 6 percent, as some Democrats have suggested. That's a joke, not a compromise.

The Republicans are no help at all, insisting without exception that the bill would bankrupt the economy. The truth is that no one knows how much this bill will cost. A lot depends on how it is structured, how the auction revenues are applied, how quickly new, job-producing technologies come online and how much the country can save through efficiencies.

We do know that the emissions cap will not begin to bite until 2012 and that past programs to clean the air have always cost less than predicted. And, if the scientists are right, we know that the costs of doing nothing will dwarf the costs of acting now."
"National, Thursday, May 14, 2009 506 mots, p. A 19",,House Panel Nears Agreement on Energy and Climate Bill,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - With a series of compromises on the stickiest issues behind them, the House Energy and Commerce Committee is poised to approve far-reaching legislation on energy and global warming by the end of next week. Where it goes from there remains highly uncertain.

President Obama on Wednesday praised the committee's ""extraordinary progress"" toward writing a bill that can survive among the panel's fractious Democrats. After a White House meeting with House leaders, Mr. Obama said that the bill as it now stands, though weaker in a number of areas than the original version introduced six weeks ago, represented a major step toward his goals of addressing climate change and reducing the nation's reliance on dirty fuels.

But with that modest endorsement, Mr. Obama quickly pivoted to his more immediate legislative priority, changes in health care costs and coverage, which he insisted have to be made this year. He has set no deadline for energy legislation.

Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he was eager to complete committee work on the energy bill so he could turn his attention to health care.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she intended to hold a full House vote on health care legislation by the end of July. On energy, she has said only that she hoped for a vote ""this year,"" an aide said.

The measure before the House panel, written by Mr. Waxman and Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, now calls for a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020; the original target was 20 percent. The long-range target, an 83 percent reduction by 2050, still stands.

Among the most difficult discussions were those that concerned the granting of free emissions permits under the bill's cap-and-trade provisions. In the current compromise, 35 percent of all permits will be granted to local utility companies to cushion the higher costs of producing electricity in a way that emits less carbon dioxide.

An additional 15 percent of permits will be given to reduce costs in energy-intensive industries like steel, cement and aluminum, which face stiff international competition.

Three percent of permit value will go to the auto industry for work on electric and advanced-technology vehicles, although the subsidy falls to 1 percent after five years. Committee members are still negotiating the level of free allowances for petroleum refiners.

The free allowances would be phased out over 10 to 15 years.

Panel members also agreed to soften the original measure's mandates for the proportion of electricity production that must come from renewable sources like wind, solar or geothermal power. The first Waxman-Markey draft called for a nationwide standard of 25 percent by 2025; that has now been reduced to 15 percent by 2020, with complex exemptions for some regions and energy sources.

Representative Rick Boucher, the Virginia Democrat who leads the so-called Brown Dog Democrats, who represent regions heavily dependent on coal for power generation, said he believed that the committee was on track to pass the bill. But he cautioned that several issues remained to be settled and that ""until everything is agreed, nothing is agreed.""

Because of the makeup of the committee, Mr. Waxman can move his bill without any Republican support. He will probably need to: Representative Joe Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the committee, said his 23 members were united in opposition. Mr. Barton, an outspoken skeptic on the science of climate change, predicted that even if the committee passed the bill, the full House and Senate were unlikely to act on it any time soon.

""It's just not a good political tactic in this kind of economy,"" he said. ""This is not the time to tackle this kind of issue."""
"Science, Tuesday, May 19, 2009 223 mots, p. D 3",,OBSERVATORY,,,"By Henry Fountain

One concern about climate change is its potential for disrupting the delicate timing that exists within ecosystems. If warmer temperatures cause a bird to migrate earlier in the spring, for example, it might arrive before there are enough insects for food.

Using data from ocean surveys and remote-sensing satellites, Peter Koeller of the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, and colleagues have revealed a similar potential for disruption in a marine ecosystem involving northern shrimp. In a paper in Science, the researchers show that the development and hatching of the shrimp eggs throughout the North Atlantic closely match the spring bloom of phytoplankton, which the shrimp live on.

They found that the temperature of the water on the ocean bottom, which varies by latitude, determines the length of the development period and hatching times for the shrimp (from about 6 months in warmer areas to 10 months in colder spots).

The timing of the phytoplankton bloom varies too, due to the amount of sunlight and water temperatures nearer the surface. But almost everywhere, over the long term, the eggs hatch as the bloom peaks, providing an abundance of food for the larval shrimp.

It would not take much to disrupt this synchrony, the researchers say. If sea surface temperatures increased over time (as atmospheric temperatures increased), the bloom might happen earlier. Similarly, if bottom temperatures changed, the eggs would hatch sooner or later, before the full phytoplankton bloom."
"National, Friday, May 22, 2009 733 mots, p. A 13",,"Ambitious Energy and Climate Bill Clears a House Hurdle, but Others Remain",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The House Energy and Commerce Committee, splitting largely along party lines, approved on Thursday the most ambitious energy and global warming legislation ever debated in Congress.

The bill's passage, on a 33-to-25 vote, served as a bookend to a week that began with President Obama's announcing a deal with auto manufacturers to impose tough new mileage and emissions standards for all cars and trucks sold in the United States starting in 2012.

With progress on this legislation and his own executive actions, Mr. Obama is assembling the pieces of a credible American package to take to Copenhagen later this year as United Nations negotiators gather for talks on a new global warming treaty.

But the energy legislation passed on Thursday still faces a tortuous path through several more House committees before it can be brought up for a vote later this year. In the Senate, leaders say they lack the votes to pass the bill as it is now written.

Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, sponsored the bill. Mr. Waxman called it ""decisive and historic.""

""When this bill is enacted,"" Mr. Waxman said, ""we'll break our dependence on foreign oil, make our nation a leader in clean-energy jobs and technology and cut global warming pollution.""

The objections of the Republican opponents were summed up in the words of Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, who said the bill would mean sharp increases in energy costs and the loss of millions of jobs.

""This is the biggest energy tax in the history of the United States,"" Mr. Rogers said.

Mr. Obama did not play a major public role in the committee's work, but intervened quietly on several occasions, calling nervous conservative Democrats to assure them that a vote for the bill would not hurt them politically. Two weeks ago, he gathered all of the panel's Democrats at the White House to urge them to set aside their differences to produce a bill that met his goals of energy conservation and global warming abatement.

The measure approved by the House committee runs more than 930 pages. It establishes a cap-and-trade program to control climate-altering emissions; dictates an increase in the use of renewable energy sources; and sets new efficiency standards for buildings, lighting and industrial facilities. It calls for a 17 percent reduction in emissions of heat-trapping gases from 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050.

It was the object of one of the biggest lobbying campaigns of any piece of environmental legislation, with millions of dollars spent on both sides in the months leading up to Thursday's vote. Lawmakers heard from former Vice President Al Gore, local utility companies, hunters and fishermen, national environmental groups, agricultural interests and the coal, oil and natural gas industries.

Much more is to come as the bill, known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act, is taken up by the Ways and Means Committee and, possibly, House panels on agriculture, transportation and natural resources.

The measure has critics and supporters on the left and right. Many large manufacturers and the majority of the big utilities support it, for now, as the least-bad option for what is considered the inevitable imposition of controls on heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide.

The National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce opposed it, although some members of both groups broke with leadership to endorse the measure. These two big lobbies argued that it was a burdensome tax on business that would drive companies and jobs overseas while doing little to address climate change.

The major environmental advocacy groups are, for the most part, enthusiastic backers. ""Clearly, it's an unprecedented step forward in the critical effort to create millions of clean-energy jobs, reduce our dependence on oil and protect our planet from global warming pollution,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters.

But some groups, like Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and Public Citizen, expressed concern that the bill as drafted gave away too much to polluting industries and depended excessively on hypothetical reductions in emissions of heat-trapping gases from developing countries.

""Despite the best efforts of Chairman Waxman, the decision-making process was co-opted by oil and coal lobbyists determined to sustain our addiction to dirty fossil fuels,"" said a joint statement from the groups. ""The resulting bill reflects the triumph of politics over science, and the triumph of industry influence over public interest.""

When Mr. Waxman first unveiled his plan in late March, at least a dozen of the panel's 36 Democrats had qualms of it. These so-called Brown Dogs were mainly from states dependent on coal for power and manufacturing for jobs, and needed assurance that their constituents would be protected.

In weeks of closed-door negotiations with these Democrats, Mr. Waxman doled out billions of dollars worth of free pollution permits, known as allowances, to cushion any price shock caused by imposing a cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases.

In the end, 85 percent of all pollution allowances were given at no cost for various purposes, including compensating energy-intensive industries, state governments, oil refiners and low-income households, at least in the early years of the program. Mr. Obama's position during the presidential campaign was that all of the permits should be auctioned, not given away, but the White House did not object to Mr. Waxman's generous allocations."
"Foreign, Thursday, May 28, 2009 623 mots, p. A 12",,"In Beijing, Pelosi Seeks Cooperation On Climate",By MICHAEL WINES,,"BEIJING - Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, met China's two top leaders on Wednesday to discuss cooperation on energy and environmental problems, and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said Beijing would join Washington to ""push for positive results"" at the next global warming summit meeting this fall in Copenhagen.

Mr. Wen's public statements, reported by the state's Xinhua news agency, offered no specifics, however, and some experts here noted that the two nations' official positions on reducing climate-changing pollution remained far apart.

Ms. Pelosi and five House legislators involved in energy and environmental issues met with Mr. Wen and separately with President Hu Jintao on the third day of an eight-day tour of China.

In a statement issued late Wednesday, a Pelosi spokesman said the meetings had also addressed North Korea's recent nuclear test and missile launchings, human rights issues, the global economic crisis and intellectual property rights. Beyond expressing general hopes that North Korea would resume multilateral talks and concern about China's human rights record, the statement offered little detail.

In a speech on Tuesday in Beijing, Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, called the climate change issue ""a game changer in the U.S.-China relationship"" and ""an opportunity we cannot miss.""

""We are the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world,"" she said, at a meeting of the U.S.-China Clean Energy Forum, an alliance of Chinese economic officials and American leaders from business and government. ""We have a responsibility to ourselves, to each other and to the world. We must work together.""

After Wednesday's meeting with Ms. Pelosi, Mr. Wen appeared to agree. ""China will cement policy dialogue with the United States, take the joint tackling of climate change as an important aspect of cooperation, and push for positive results in the Copenhagen climate change conference,"" the successor to the 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, which produced the last global warming agreement.

Much of the world is looking to the United States and China, which together emit nearly half the world's climate-changing gases, to find common ground on a new treaty that will reduce pollutants.

The United States has said that any new global climate agreement will have to restrict the growth of emissions in China, the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases.

Just last week, however, China issued a new position paper on climate change that rejected any mandatory caps on its emissions and demanded that wealthy countries provide at least .5 percent to 1 percent of their gross domestic product to help developing countries upgrade technology and cope with the results of climate change.

A bill being considered by the House would compel the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and to 83 percent below by 2050. But that plan is well below the opening demand by Chinese leaders, who want developed nations to reduce 2020 emissions by 40 percent from 1995 levels, and it falls short of commitments by the European Union as well.

American officials have already rejected the Chinese proposal as unattainable. The Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning research organization, said in a report published Wednesday that the House legislation was unlikely to win enough Chinese support for the two nations to present a united front at the Copenhagen talks in December.

A leading Beijing expert on climate change economics, Zhang Shiqiu, said Wednesday that she was optimistic that the two nations would reach some accord on global warming before the Copenhagen meeting. But she also cautioned that American negotiators needed to appreciate the steps that China had already taken to improve its environment.

""Many Chinese -- not only politicians, but academic society and the general public -- would say that before the U.S. blames China, the U.S. should clean up first,"" said Ms. Zhang, a professor of environmental economics and policy at Peking University.

By some estimates, China's huge package of stimulus spending aimed at addressing the global economic crisis includes more measures aimed at improving energy efficiency than the American package. The economic downturn has also reduced energy use, though most likely temporarily.

But China remains highly inefficient in energy use by global standards. And its rapidly expanding industrial economy, with its dependence on electricity from coal-fired power plants, is by far the world's fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Foreign, Friday, May 29, 2009 368 mots, p. A 5",,Forum Says Climate Shift Brings Deaths,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"Global warming is causing more than 300,000 deaths and about $125 billion in economic losses each year, according to a report by the Global Humanitarian Forum, an organization led by Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general.

The report, to be released Friday, sifted data sets and existing studies of health, disaster, population and economic trends. It found that human-influenced climate change -- mainly by exacerbating flooding and drought -- was elevating the global death rates from illnesses including malnutrition, diarrheal disease, malaria and heat-related ailments. But even before its release, the report drew criticism from some experts on climate and risk, who questioned its methods and conclusions.

Along with the deaths, the report said that the lives of 325 million people, primarily in poor countries, were being seriously affected by climate change. It projected that the number would double by 2030.

Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who studies disaster trends, said the forum's report was ""a methodological embarrassment"" because there was no way to distinguish deaths or economic losses related to human-driven global warming amid the much larger losses resulting from the growth in populations and economic development in vulnerable regions. Dr. Pielke said that ""climate change is an important problem requiring our utmost attention."" But the report, he said, ""will harm the cause for action on both climate change and disasters because it is so deeply flawed.""

However, Soren Peter Andreasen, a social scientist at Dalberg Global Development Partners who supervised the writing of the report, defended it, saying that it was clear that the numbers were rough estimates. The report appeared aimed at world leaders, who will meet in Copenhagen in December to negotiate a new international climate treaty.

In a press release describing the report, Mr. Annan stressed the need for the negotiations to focus on increasing the flow of money from rich to poor regions to help reduce their vulnerability to climate hazards while still curbing the emissions of the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. More than 90 percent of the human and economic losses from climate change are occurring in poor countries, according to the report.

The next round of preliminary talks leading up to the December negotiations is scheduled to begin Monday in Bonn, Germany.

Jeffrey D. Sachs, an economist, was one of 12 experts who vetted the report for the forum. He acknowledged that some of the report's conclusions were oversimplified. Still, he said, he endorsed the report's message. He and others who work in vulnerable regions like Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, he said, are convinced that global warming is already harming communities."
"Foreign, Friday, May 29, 2009 966 mots, p. A 4",,Islanders Fearing Climate Change Press a U.N. Debate,By NEIL MacFARQUHAR,,"UNITED NATIONS - With their boundless vistas of turquoise water framed by swaying coconut palms, the Carteret Islands northeast of the Papua New Guinea mainland might seem the idyllic spot to be a castaway.

But sea levels have risen so much that during the annual king tide season, November to March, the roiling ocean blocks the view from one island to the next, and residents stash their possessions in fishing nets strung between the palm trees.

""It gives you the scary feeling that you don't know what is going to happen to you, that any minute you will be floating,"" Ursula Rakova, the head of a program to relocate residents, said by telephone. The chain could well be uninhabitable by 2015, locals believe, but two previous attempts to abandon it ended badly, when residents were chased back after clashing with their new neighbors on larger islands.

This dark situation underlies the thorny debate over the world's responsibilities to the millions of people likely to be displaced by climate change.

There could be 200 million of these climate refugees by 2050, according to a new policy paper by the International Organization for Migration, depending on the degree of climate disturbances. Aside from the South Pacific, low-lying areas likely to be battered first include Bangladesh and nations in the Indian Ocean, where the leader of the Maldives has begun seeking a safe haven for his 300,000 people. Landlocked areas may also be affected; some experts call the Darfur region of Sudan, where nomads battle villagers in a war over shrinking natural resources, the first significant conflict linked to climate change.

In the coming days, the United Nations General Assembly is expected to adopt the first resolution linking climate change to international peace and security. The hard-fought resolution, brought by 12 Pacific island states, says that climate change warrants greater attention from the United Nations as a possible source of upheaval worldwide and calls for more intense efforts to combat it. While all Pacific island states are expected to lose land, some made up entirely of atolls, like Tuvalu and Kiribati, face possible extinction.

""For the first time in history, you could actually lose countries off the face of the globe,"" said Stuart Beck, the permanent representative for Palau at the United Nations. ""It is a security threat to them and their populations, which will have to be relocated, which is the security threat to the places where they go, among other consequences.""

The issue has inspired intense wrangling, with some nations accusing the islanders of both exaggerating the still murky consequences of climate change and trying to expand the mandate of the Security Council by asking it to take action.

""We don't consider climate change is an issue of security that properly belongs in the Security Council; rather, it is a development issue that has some security aspects,"" said Maged A. Abdelaziz, the Egyptian ambassador. ""It is an issue of how to prevent certain lands, or certain countries, from being flooded.""

The island states are seeking a response akin to the effort against terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks. ""The whole system bent itself to the task, and that is what we want,"" Mr. Beck said, adding that the Council should even impose sanctions on countries that fail to act. ""If you really buy into the notion that the Suburban you are driving is causing these islands to go under, there ought to be a cop.""

As it is, the compromise resolution does not mention such specific steps, one of the reasons it is expected to pass. Britain, which introduced climate change as a Security Council discussion topic two years ago, supports it along with most of Europe, while other permanent Council members -- namely, the United States, China and Russia -- generally backed the measure once it no longer explicitly demanded Council action.

Scientific studies distributed by the United Nations or affiliated agencies generally paint rising seas as a threat. A 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, detailing shifts expected in the South Pacific, said rising seas would worsen flooding and erosion and threaten towns as well as infrastructure. Some fresh water will turn salty, and fishing and agriculture will wither, it said.

The small island states are not alone in considering the looming threat already on the doorstep. A policy paper released this month by Australia's Defense Ministry suggests possible violent outcomes in the Pacific. While Australia should try to mitigate the humanitarian suffering caused by global warming, if that failed and conflict erupted, the country should use its military ""as an instrument to deal with any threats,"" said the paper.

Australia's previous prime minister, John Howard, was generally dismissive of the problem, saying his country was plagued with ""doomsayers."" But a policy paper called ""Our Drowning Neighbors,"" by the now governing Labor Party, said Australia should help meld an international coalition to address it. Political debates have erupted there and in New Zealand over the idea of immigration quotas for climate refugees. New Zealand established a ""Pacific Access Category"" with guidelines that mirror the rules for any emigre, opening its borders to a limited annual quota of some 400 able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 45 who have no criminal records.

But its position has attracted criticism for leaving out the young and the old, who have the least ability to relocate. Australia's policy, by contrast, is to try to mitigate the circumstances for the victims where they are, rather than serving as their lifeboat.

The sentiment among Pacific Islanders suggests that they do not want to abandon their homelands or be absorbed into cultures where indigenous people already struggle for acceptance.

""It is about much more than just finding food and shelter,"" said Tarita Holm, an analyst with the Palauan Ministry of Resources and Development. ""It is about your identity.""

Ms. Rakova, on the Carteret Islands, echoes that sentiment. A year ago, her proposed relocation effort attracted just three families out of a population of around 2,000 people. But after last season's king tides -- the highest of the year -- she is scrounging for about $1.5 million to help some 750 people relocate before the tides come again.

Jennifer Redfearn, a documentary maker, has been filming the gradual disappearance of the Carterets for a work called ""Sun Come Up."" One clan chief told her he would rather sink with the islands than leave. It now takes only about 15 minutes to walk the length of the largest island, with food and water supplies shrinking all the time.

""It destroys our food gardens, it uproots coconut trees, it even washes over the sea walls that we have built,"" Ms. Rakova says on the film. ""Most of our culture will have to live in memory."""
The New York Times on the Web,"Foreign, Friday, May 29, 2009 475 mots",,"Hope, but No Advances, in China-U.S. Climate Talks",ANDREW JACOBS,"BEIJING - Five days of talks aimed at bringing China and the United States closer together on the issue of climate change did not yield substantial progress, according to a Congressional delegation that met with environmental officials and the country's top leaders this week.

During a news conference on Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of House, said she was ""hopeful"" after meeting with a number of officials, including President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.

But Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican who took part, said he was discouraged by the Chinese refusal to commit to greater cuts in greenhouse gases while insisting that developed nations do more to reduce their emissions.

""It's business as usual for China,"" said Mr. Sensenbrenner, the ranking Republican on the House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. ""The message that I received was that China was going to do it their way regardless of what the rest of the world negotiates in Copenhagen.""

He was referring to the United Nations summit on climate change to be held in Denmark this year, the successor to the meeting in Kyoto, Japan, which produced the last global warming agreement in 1997. In previous statements, China has suggested that developed nations reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2020 from 1995 levels. By contrast, Mr. Sensenbrenner said, Chinese officials have linked their proposed reductions to the size of China's economy, which is growing significantly. The resulting math, he said, would mean ""a significant increase in emissions in China.""

China and the United States are responsible for nearly half the world's output of carbon gases, although many scientists say the Chinese share is larger and growing at a rapid pace due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants.

In addition to discussing climate change, Ms. Pelosi said she raised a number of issues during her talks with Chinese leaders, including intellectual property rights, human rights and North Korea's test of a nuclear device on Monday.

While she did not provide details of those talks, she described them as ""candid"" and said they included such delicate topics as Tibet and China's rights record. She said she had ""encouraged conversations with his holiness, the Dalai Lama, or his representatives."" Until Thursday, Ms. Pelosi, who is known here for her strident criticisms of China's human rights record, had not spoken about the issue in public statements or during an appearance before students and faculty at Tsinghua University.

Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House global warming committee, acknowledged that without significant concessions from China, Congress might be disinclined to act on its own package of emissions limits.

But after years of American intransigence on global warming, Mr. Markey said he thought China would be influenced by the Obama administration's commitment to the issue. ""We leave here with some sense that we can reach an agreement,"" he said, although he added a caveat. ""This is going to be on one of the most complex diplomatic negotiations in the history of the world,"" he said.

Not everyone involved in the discussions was so pessimistic. During a news conference earlier in the day, Senator John Kerry said he was encouraged by Chinese leaders' commitment to tackling climate change. He noted that China in recent years had tripled its capacity for wind generation, enacted vehicle fuel standards tougher than those in America and closed hundreds of obsolete, coal-fired power plants. ""It's unequivocally the most constructive and productive discussions I've ever had with Chinese officials,"" he said."
"Foreign, Saturday, June 13, 2009 426 mots, p. A 5",,"Climate Change Treaty, to Go Beyond the Kyoto Protocol, Is Expected by the Year's End",By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"The world is on track to produce a new global climate treaty by December, the top United Nations climate official said Friday as delegates from more than 100 nations concluded 12 days of talks in Bonn, Germany.

The delegates issued a 200-page document that they said would serve as the starting point for treaty negotiations that open in Copenhagen in December.

""Time is short, but we still have enough time,"" the official, Yvo de Boer, who is the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said at a briefing. ""I'm confident that governments can reach an agreement and want an agreement.""

The goal is a climate treaty that would go beyond the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, a climate-change agreement that set emissions targets for industrialized nations. Many of those goals have not been met, and the United States never ratified the accord.

The document issued Friday outlines proposals for cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases by rich countries and limiting the growth of gases in the developing world. It also discusses ways of preventing deforestation, which is linked to global warming, and of providing financing for poorer nations to help them adapt to warmer temperatures.

But many environment advocates and politicians suggested that delegates had not made enough progress in winnowing down those options. ""Of course we have to respect the way the United Nations works,"" Denmark's minister for climate and energy, Connie Hedegaard, said in a statement after the talks ended. ""But to me, there is no doubt that things are moving too slow.""

Representatives of poor countries complained repeatedly in the talks that developed nations had not made an adequate commitment to reduce their emissions. They expressed particular dismay over Japan's announcement this week to reduce emissions by only 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.

Shyam Saran, India's envoy on climate change, called such targets ""unsatisfactory."" China and other developing countries have demanded that richer nations reduce emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels in that period.

Experts described some of the back-and-forth as predictable jockeying in the months leading up to the make-or-break talks to negotiate a treaty in December.

Jonathan Pershing, who led the American delegation at the Bonn talks, said the discussions had unfolded about as fast as could be expected given the number of nations involved and the size of the task. He predicted a treaty would emerge in December.

He said that American negotiators acknowledged at the talks that ""climate change is an urgent problem and it needs a global and immediate response.""

Despite the shortage of specific commitments, environmentalists took heart from the strong involvement of many nations, especially the United States and China, which jointly produce 40 percent of the world's heat-trapping emissions. (In declining to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the United States cited China and India's lack of participation.)

""There are a lot of options to work out, but we have come a long way,"" said Alex Kaat, a spokesman for Wetlands International, which fights the destruction of rainforests and decaying bogs. ""There is now text on paper, and that's progress."""
"National, Tuesday, June 16, 2009 443 mots, p. A 13",,Government Study Warns Of Climate Change Effects,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The impact of a changing climate is already being felt across the United States, like shifting migration patterns of butterflies in the West and heavier downpours in the Midwest and East, according to a government study to be released on Tuesday.

Even if the nation takes significant steps to slow emissions of heat-trapping gases, the impact of global warming is expected to become more severe in coming years, the report says, affecting farms and forests, coastlines and floodplains, water and energy supplies, transportation and human health.

The study was prepared by the United States Global Change Research Program, a joint scientific venture of 13 federal agencies and the White House. Under a 1990 law, the group is required to report every 10 years on natural and human-caused effects on the environment. The current study, which began in the George W. Bush administration, builds on the findings of the 2000 one.

The study, overseen by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, will be posted at www.globalchange.gov/usimpacts.

Some of the effects being seen today and cited in the report are familiar, like more powerful tropical storms and erosion of ocean coastlines caused by melting Arctic ice. The study also cites an increase in drought in the Southwest and more intense heat waves in the Northeast as a result of growing concentrations of carbon dioxide and other climate-altering gases in the atmosphere.

Reduced mountain snowpack means earlier melt-offs and reduced stream volumes across the West and Northwest, affecting residential and agricultural water supplies, habitats for spawning fish and reduced hydroelectric power generation, the study found.

But the speed and severity of these effects in the future are expressed with less certainty in the report and will depend to some extent on how quickly the United States and other nations move to reduce emissions.

""What we would want to have people take away is that climate change is happening now, and it's actually beginning to affect our lives,"" said Thomas R. Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a principal author of the report. ""It's not just happening in the Arctic regions, but it's beginning to show up in our own backyards.""

Dr. Karl said that unless the country acted soon to reduce emissions and to adapt to inevitable effects of a changing climate, the costs would be severe.

""Our destiny is really in our hands,"" he said. ""The size of those impacts is significantly smaller with appropriate controls.""

Dr. Karl said the section of the 188-page report dealing with human-health effects generated the most discussion and uncertainty among the agencies. The study said rising average temperatures would cause more heat-related illnesses and deaths, along with some reduction in deaths from extreme cold.

The study also showed that higher temperatures combined with air pollution would cause a higher incidence of asthma and other respiratory ailments.

Michael C. MacCracken, a leader of the 2000 study and a principal outside reviewer of the current one, said in an e-mail message that the new report was a useful overview of the state of current climate science in the United States, but ""there is not much that is new."""
"Business/Financial, Friday, June 19, 2009 198 mots",,Greenpeace Parody of Newspaper Spotlights Climate,By THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE,,"PARIS -- The environmental group Greenpeace on Thursday distributed a spoof version of The International Herald Tribune, in an effort to draw attention to climate change as European Union leaders gathered to discuss the issue in Brussels.

""Heads of state agree historic climate-saving deal,"""" the parody proclaimed on Page 1, along with a picture of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission. It was dated Dec. 19, 2009, the day after the end of the planned United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.

The newspaper said in a statement that it had contacted Greenpeace and asked it to remove any fake Web pages from its site, and that it had received no advance notice of the project. The Herald Tribune is owned by The New York Times Company.

""The I.H.T. is a trusted resource for world opinion leaders and to have our name and image paraded among this community as a politically motivated publicity stunt is wholly contrary to our values of independence and accuracy,"" the paper said in a statement.

Gerd Leipold, executive director of Greenpeace International, urged the newspaper to consider the spoof a ""compliment"" to the paper's ""history of excellent coverage on a variety of issues, including climate change.""

Greenpeace said 50,000 copies of the spoof I.H.T. were distributed, mostly in Brussels. In a letter to the newspaper, Mr. Leipold said the goal was to show ""world leaders, and all of us, the future we might have if they do right by the planet."""
"Editorial, Friday, June 26, 2009 424 mots, p. A 24",,EDITORIAL,,,"American politicians, from both parties, insist that they want to combat global warming and reduce this country's dependence on fossil fuels. Members of the House will soon have a chance to show they mean it. Voters should watch carefully to see what they do.

The American Clean Energy and Security Act would, for the first time, put a price on carbon emissions. The bill has shortcomings. But we believe that it is an important beginning to the urgent task of averting the worst damage from climate change. Approval would show that the United States is ready to lead and would pressure other countries to follow. Rejection could mean more wasted years and more damage to the planet.

The outcome depends on perhaps 30 Democrats who fear higher energy costs for businesses and consumers, and a dozen or so Republican moderates who also worry about costs and who have been pressed by their leadership not to give President Obama a victory.

We urge all to examine several recent studies showing the costs of the legislation to be minimal. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects average costs of $175 a year per American household by 2020 -- vastly lower than the $3,000-plus figure bandied about by Republican leaders. We also urge them to read the scientific analysis forecasting the catastrophic costs to the planet, this country's security and its economy if global warming is left unchecked.

The centerpiece of the legislation is a provision that aims to cut America's production of greenhouse gases by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by midcentury -- the minimum reductions scientists say are necessary to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

Its mechanism for doing so is a cap-and-trade system that would place a steadily declining ceiling on emissions while allowing emitters to trade permits, or allowances, to give them flexibility in meeting their targets. The point is to raise the cost of older, dirtier fuels while steering investments to cleaner ones.

The two seasoned politicians behind this bill -- Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts -- have also insisted on provisions that would mandate more efficient buildings, require cleaner energy sources like wind power and provide subsidies for new technologies. They have tried hard to shield poor consumers from higher energy costs. The C.B.O. estimates that, with rebates, the bottom 20 percent would actually come out ahead.

They have bent over backwards -- too far backwards, according to some critics -- to ease the cost of compliance for polluters by giving them relatively inexpensive ways to satisfy their emissions quotas before they have to invest heavily in cleaner energy sources and new technologies.

The C.B.O. did not factor in the potential cost savings to consumers from other parts of the bill -- the energy efficiency provisions, for instance. Nor was it asked to quantify the costs of doing nothing.

But we know the answer to that. By any measure -- drought, famine, coastal devastation -- the costs of inaction, of clinging to a broken energy policy, will dwarf the costs of acting now. It is this truth that the House must keep firmly in mind as it votes."
"National, Saturday, June 27, 2009 1018 mots, p. A 1",,"House Backs Bill, 219-212, to Curb Global Warming",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The House passed legislation on Friday intended to address global warming and transform the way the nation produces and uses energy.

The vote was the first time either house of Congress had approved a bill meant to curb the heat-trapping gases scientists have linked to climate change. The legislation, which passed despite deep divisions among Democrats, could lead to profound changes in many sectors of the economy, including electric power generation, agriculture, manufacturing and construction.

The bill's passage, by 219 to 212, with 44 Democrats voting against it, also established a marker for the United States when international negotiations on a new climate change treaty begin later this year.

At the heart of the legislation is a cap-and-trade system that sets a limit on overall emissions of heat-trapping gases while allowing utilities, manufacturers and other emitters to trade pollution permits, or allowances, among themselves. The cap would grow tighter over the years, pushing up the price of emissions and presumably driving industry to find cleaner ways of making energy.

President Obama hailed the House passage of the bill as ""a bold and necessary step."" He said in a statement that he looked forward to Senate action that would send a bill to his desk ""so that we can say, at long last, that this was the moment when we decided to confront America's energy challenge and reclaim America's future.""

Mr. Obama had lobbied wavering lawmakers in recent days, and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore had made personal appeals to dozens of fence-sitters.

As difficult as House passage proved, it is just the beginning of the energy and climate debate in Congress. The issue now moves to the Senate, where political divisions and regional differences are even more stark.

Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, a co-sponsor of the bill, called the vote a ""decisive and historic action"" that would position the United States as a leader in energy efficiency and technology.

But the legislation, a patchwork of compromises, falls far short of what many European governments and environmentalists have said is needed to avert the worst effects of global warming. And it pitted liberal Democrats from the East and West Coasts against more conservative Democrats from areas dependent on coal for electricity and on heavy manufacturing for jobs.

While some environmentalists enthusiastically supported the legislation, others, including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth, opposed it. Industry officials were split, with the United States Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers opposing the bill and some of the nation's biggest corporations, including Dow Chemical and Ford, backing it.

Republican leaders called the legislation a national energy tax and predicted that those who voted for the measure would pay a heavy price at the polls next year.

""No matter how you doctor it or tailor it,"" said Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania, ""it is a tax.""

Only eight Republicans voted for the bill, which runs to more than 1,300 pages.

Representative John Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, stalled the vote by using his privilege as a party leader to consume just over an hour by reading from a 300-page amendment added in the early hours of Friday.

Apart from its domestic implications, the legislation represents a first step toward measurable cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that administration officials can point to when the United States joins other nations in negotiating a new global climate change treaty later this year. For nearly 20 years, the United States has resisted mandatory limits on heat-trapping emissions.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who was in Washington on Friday to meet with Mr. Obama, strongly endorsed the bill even though it fell short of European goals for reducing the emissions of heat-trapping gases.

Mrs. Merkel, a longtime advocate of strong curbs on emissions, has been pushing the United States to take a leading role before the climate negotiations, set for December in Copenhagen.

After meeting with Mr. Obama, she said she had seen a ""sea change"" in the United States on climate policy that she could not have imagined a year ago when President George W. Bush was in office.

The House legislation reflects a series of concessions necessary to attract the support of Democrats from different regions and with different ideologies. In the months of horse-trading before the vote Friday, the bill's targets for emissions of heat-trapping gases were weakened, its mandate for renewable electricity was scaled back, and incentives for industries were sweetened.

The bill's sponsors were making deals on the House floor right up until the time of the vote. They set aside money for new energy research and a hurricane study center in Florida.

The final bill has a goal of reducing greenhouse gases in the United States to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent by midcentury.

When the program is scheduled to begin, in 2012, the estimated price of a permit to emit a ton of carbon dioxide will be about $13. That is projected to rise steadily as emission limits come down, but the bill contains a provision to prevent costs from rising too quickly in any one year.

The bill would grant a majority of the permits free in the early years of the program, to keep costs low. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the average American household would pay an additional $175 a year in energy costs by 2020 as a result of the provision, while the poorest households would receive rebates that would lower their annual energy costs by $40.

Several House members expressed concern about the market to be created in carbon allowances, saying it posed the same risks as those in markets in other kinds of derivatives. Regulation of such markets would be divided among the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The bill also sets a national standard of 20 percent for the production of renewable electricity by 2020, although a third of that could be met with efficiency measures rather than renewable energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal power.

It also devotes billions of dollars to new energy projects and subsidies for low-carbon agricultural practices, research on cleaner coal and electric vehicle development.

Mr. Gore, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize for his work on global warming, posted an appeal on his blog for passage of the legislation.

""This bill doesn't solve every problem,"" Mr. Gore said, ""but passage today means that we build momentum for the debate coming up in the Senate and negotiations for the treaty talks in December which will put in place a global solution to the climate crisis. There is no backup plan."""
"National, Sunday, June 28, 2009 815 mots, p. A 20",,CONGRESSIONAL MEMO,,,"By CARL HULSE

WASHINGTON - As Democrats strained to win over crucial holdouts on the way to narrow, party-line approval of global warming legislation, they were dogged by a critical question: Has the political climate changed since 1993?

Veteran members of both parties vividly remember when many House Democrats, in the early months of the Clinton administration, reluctantly backed a proposed B.T.U. tax -- a new levy on each unit of energy consumed -- only to see it ignored by the Senate and seized as a campaign issue by Republicans, who took control of the House the next year.

""A lot of Democrat members got burnt on that vote,"" warned Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, who called the climate change measure the defining vote of this, the 111th, Congress.

In a Congress likely to consider a health care overhaul, new ways to govern the financial sector and immigration changes after already approving a $787 billion economic stimulus, there is serious competition for the title of defining vote.

But the climate change measure, a high priority of President Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will no doubt be right at the top of the list. Interest groups on both sides of the issue promise to hinge their support on how lawmakers vote on the bill and actively oppose those who go the other way.

The moment the House approved the bill, Mr. Obama took the opportunity to start increasing pressure on the Senate, where the legislation again faces tough opposition. He had already recorded and distributed the text of his weekly Saturday address, on the urgency of doing something about health care this year. But he pulled it back and substituted a message focusing on the climate victory.

""I want to congratulate the House for passing this bill,"" he said, ""and I want to urge the Senate to take this opportunity to come together and meet our obligations -- to our constituents, to our children, to God's creation and to future generations.""

Leading Democrats say they are more than happy to have the energy bill serve as a signature issue. They say it represents a transformative moment -- their party's effort to take on a genuine threat to the planet. They say voters will appreciate the legislation as an overdue effort to lessen the nation's dangerous dependence on foreign oil while creating millions of new jobs in the production and distribution of cleaner energy and in energy conservation technology.

""The American people understand that we can no longer sweep big national problems under the rug and that we had to have an energy policy for the 21st century,"" said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

The two parties have dueled for months over the costs and benefits of the measure, and that debate is certain to continue into the midterm elections of November 2010. But it will mainly be a message battle because even if a climate change bill is passed and signed into law this year as Congressional Democrats and the White House hope, the practical effects will not be felt until after the election.

Republicans obviously saw the parallels between the 1993 vote and the one Friday. As the gavel came down on their failed push to derail the bill, Republicans chanted ""B.T.U., B.T.U."" and seemed almost in a celebratory mood.

""On the floor, it felt like we won,"" said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a party political strategist. ""They put a lot of guys on the line.""

The votes were strikingly similar. In 1993, the legislation containing the Clinton energy tax was adopted on a 219-to-213 vote with 38 Democrats defecting. On Friday, the House bill was approved 219 to 212, with 44 Democrats defecting.

In an indication of the queasiness among some Democrats, House approval came only after a determined campaign to sway wavering lawmakers. It took personal intervention by the president and vice president; members of the cabinet; the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel; Ms. Pelosi; and even last-minute agreements were struck on the House floor.

It was a significant victory for both the president and Congressional Democrats, and it came on an issue that many expected could prove tougher than a health care overhaul. But as progress on health care legislation slowed and consumed much of the attention, Democrats were able to ease the climate change legislation forward, almost under the radar.

Top Democrats say they believe the victory on climate change -- setting up a tough summer debate in the Senate -- can translate to progress on other difficult issues as lawmakers see Democrats can advance even the most problematic measures.

""Momentum builds on momentum,"" Mr. Emanuel said.

Still, the vote represents a significant risk. As on the economic stimulus and potentially on a health care bill, Republican votes were scarce, creating a clear contrast between the two parties.

And Republicans -- who last year made ""drill, baby, drill"" their slogan for more, not less, production of the fossil fuels that generate heat-trapping gases along with power, and scored some political gains before the price of oil and gasoline plunged from historic peaks -- believe that energy is an issue where they have shown the ability to get some traction.

They also intend to pound home the prospect that the legislation could put the United States at a competitive disadvantage and drive more jobs overseas.

But Democrats view the measure as a singular achievement, with Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of its authors, comparing it to a combination of the Apollo Project and the Civil Rights Act.

Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, said that he believed the political impact of the B.T.U. tax had been exaggerated and that he expected no serious fallout over the new measure. Also, many of the most vulnerable Democrats voted against the measure.

""Mark this day, June 26, 2009,"" Mr. Hoyer intoned on the floor just before passage of the climate bill.

No doubt both parties already have."
"National, Monday, June 29, 2009 883 mots, p. A 1",,OBAMA OPPOSES TRADE SANCTIONS IN CLIMATE BILL,By JOHN M. BRODER; David D. Kirkpatrick contributed reporting.,,"WASHINGTON - President Obama on Sunday praised the energy bill passed by the House late last week as an ""extraordinary first step,"" but he spoke out against a provision that would impose trade penalties on countries that do not accept limits on global warming pollution.

""At a time when the economy worldwide is still deep in recession and we've seen a significant drop in global trade,"" Mr. Obama said, ""I think we have to be very careful about sending any protectionist signals out there.""

He added, ""I think there may be other ways of doing it than with a tariff approach.""

The passage of the House bill on Friday night was an important, if tentative, victory for the president, becoming the first time either chamber of Congress had approved a mandatory ceiling on the gases linked to global warming.

Mr. Obama, hoping to build momentum in the Senate after the narrow victory in the House, delayed the start of a Sunday golf game to speak to a small group of reporters in the Oval Office.

He acknowledged that the initial targets for reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases set by the House bill were quite modest and would probably not satisfy the governments of other countries or many environmental groups. But he said he hoped to build on those early targets in fashioning a more robust program in the future as part of his administration's efforts to move the nation from an economy based on fossil fuels toward one built on renewable energy sources.

Mr. Obama predicted that similar energy legislation would face a difficult slog through the Senate and require months of tough negotiations and additional compromises. The horse-trading and vote-buying that helped House leaders secure a 219-to-212 victory will be magnified in the Senate, where several powerful committee leaders are already asserting authority and Democratic moderates hold more power than their counterparts in the House.

Mr. Obama set no timetable for Senate action but exhorted its leadership to take the House bill as a benchmark and ""seize the day.""

The president used the interview to put the House vote in the context of his broader efforts to modernize the American economy by shifting to cleaner and more efficient forms of energy.

He said the House bill was a ""comprehensive approach"" that included a cap-and-trade program to limit heat-trapping gas emissions, incentives for new energy efficiency measures and support for wind and solar energy as well as nuclear power and so-called clean coal technology.

He said that those measures, combined with the administration's new automobile mileage standards and stimulus spending on research and home weatherization, represented a sea change in American energy policy.

""I think it's fair to say that over the first six months we've seen more action on shifting ourselves away from dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels than at any time in several decades,"" Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama linked the energy and health care fights, saying that major revisions in both were necessary because ""everybody knows what we're doing isn't working.""

""The status quo is unacceptable,"" he said.

As he has done in the health care discussions, Mr. Obama refused to deliver definitive judgments on specific provisions of the energy bill, leaving the legislative wrangling to members of Congress. But he said his bottom line for energy and climate change legislation included meaningful reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions, strong incentives for energy efficiency, protections for consumers and businesses against spikes in energy costs, and deficit neutrality.

""If it meets those broad criteria,"" he said, ""then it's a bill I want to embrace.""

The House bill contains a provision, inserted in the middle of the night before the vote Friday, that requires the president, starting in 2020, to impose a ""border adjustment"" -- or tariff -- on certain goods from countries that do not act to limit their global warming emissions. The president can waive the tariffs only if he receives explicit permission from Congress.

The provision was added to secure the votes of Rust Belt lawmakers who were wavering on the bill because of fears of job losses in heavy industry.

In the floor debate on the bill Friday, one of its authors, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said, ""As we act, we can and must ensure that the U.S. energy-intensive industries are not placed at a competitive disadvantage by nations that have not made a similar commitment to reduce greenhouse gases.""

In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Obama said American industries like steel, aluminum, paper and glass had legitimate concerns about competition from developing nations. But he warned that trade sanctions based on the extent to which other countries curbed carbon dioxide emissions might be illegal and counterproductive.

Mr. Obama has sometimes sent mixed signals about his attitude toward free trade. In the Democratic presidential primary, he was fiercely critical of several free trade agreements with China, Caribbean countries and Mexico for failing to include strict enough environmental standards. He argued that the United States should threaten to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement to renegotiate protections for the environment as well as workers' rights.

But as president, Mr. Obama has not made a priority of renegotiating Nafta or other trade agreements. And he has always indicated that though he favors adjusting some rules, he supports the principle of free trade.

In the interview, Mr. Obama had few words of comfort for those who may have taken a political risk by voting for the House climate change bill, and no threats for the 44 House Democrats who defied their leadership to oppose it.

""I think those 44 Democrats are sensitive to the immediate political climate of uncertainty around this issue,"" Mr. Obama said. ""They've got to run every two years, and I completely understand that.""

Many of the Democrats who voted against the legislation represent districts that rely heavily on coal for electricity and manufacturing for jobs.

Mr. Obama said the House bill contained transitional assistance for these regions.

But he expressed scorn for the Republicans who fought the bill in the House. He noted that some of them had predicted political doom for those who voted for it, recalling the 1993 battle over an energy tax that failed and helped Republicans gain control of the House a year later.

Those Republicans ""are 16 years behind the times,"" he said, comparing their position to that of Republican leaders in the energy and health care debates of the early Clinton years.

""They're fighting not even the last war,"" he said. ""They're fighting three wars ago."""
"Editorial, Wednesday, July 1, 2009 356 mots, p. A 32",,EDITORIAL,,,"The House's approval last week of a bill capping greenhouse gases was a remarkable achievement, almost unthinkable six months ago. Yet all of the hard work -- the hearings, the negotiating, the arm-twisting -- will add up to zero if the Senate cannot be persuaded to do the same, and preferably better. The country would be left with an outdated energy policy and the planet would be stuck with steadily rising emissions.

The Senate will not be an easy sell. It has rejected less ambitious climate bills before. While 60 filibuster-proof votes are needed, only 45 Senators mostly Democrats, can be counted as yes or probably yes. There are 23 fence-sitters and very little Republican support.

Despite federal studies suggesting that the costs to businesses, consumers and the economy will be minimal, the Republican leadership continues to claim that the bill will cause an unacceptable rise in energy prices.

Democratic leaders should nevertheless resist calls to weaken the targets on emissions reductions. The House bill is itself a compromise, and a weaker Senate bill could be worse than no bill at all.

The Senate should also remove the House version's more glaring defects. Among these is a provision -- inserted at the insistence of the farm lobby -- that would postpone a systematic accounting of the carbon emissions from biofuels like corn ethanol. The farm lobby and its allies on the Agriculture Committee are clearly nervous that the accounting would cast corn ethanol in an unfavorable light.

Another flaw is a last-minute provision imposing a mandatory tariff on imports from countries that do not adopt comparable systems for limiting global warming gases. The original bill would have left that to the president's discretion. The mandatory tariff would not take effect until 2020, but the provision could fan already dangerous protectionist sentiments overseas. The Senate should restore the president's discretionary power.

There is much to commend in the House bill. It seeks a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gases from 2005 levels by 2020 and an 80 percent reduction by midcentury -- the minimum, according to most scientists, required to avert the worst consequences of climate change. The bill also provides money for developing more energy-efficient vehicles and buildings and other steps that would provide even bigger and faster reductions in global warming emissions.

We hope for even better in the Senate. What there cannot be is backsliding. Global negotiations to replace the expiring Kyoto agreement on climate change resume in the fall. The world is waiting for the United States, after years of indifference, to take a strong leadership role. So is the American public.

,,"Adding Something for Everyone, House Leaders Gained a Climate Bill",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - As the most ambitious energy and climate-change legislation ever introduced in Congress made its way to a floor vote last Friday, it grew fat with compromises, carve-outs, concessions and out-and-out gifts intended to win the votes of wavering lawmakers and the support of powerful industries.

The deal making continued right up until the final minutes, with the bill's co-author Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, doling out billions of dollars in promises on the House floor to secure the final votes needed for passage.

The bill was freighted with hundreds of pages of special-interest favors, even as environmentalists lamented that its greenhouse-gas reduction targets had been whittled down.

Some of the prizes were relatively small, like the $50 million hurricane research center for a freshman lawmaker from Florida.

Others were huge and threatened to undermine the environmental goals of the bill, like a series of compromises reached with rural and farm-state members that would funnel billions of dollars in payments to agriculture and forestry interests.

Automakers, steel companies, natural gas drillers, refiners, universities and real estate agents all got in on the fast-moving action.

The biggest concessions went to utilities, which wanted assurances that they could continue to operate and build coal-burning power plants without shouldering new costs. The utilities received not only tens of billions of dollars worth of free pollution permits, but also billions for work on technology to capture carbon-dioxide emissions from coal combustion to help meet future pollution targets.

That deal, negotiated by Representative Rick Boucher, a conservative Democrat from Virginia's coal country, won the support of the Edison Electric Institute, the utility industry lobby, and lawmakers from regions dependent on coal for electricity.

Liberal Democrats got a piece, too. Representative Bobby Rush, Democrat of Illinois, withheld his support for the bill until a last-minute accord was struck to provide nearly $1 billion for energy-related jobs and job training for low-income workers and new subsidies for making public housing more energy-efficient.

Representative Joe Barton, a Texas Republican staunchly opposed to the bill, marveled at the deal-cutting on Friday.

""It is unprecedented,"" Mr. Barton said, ""but at least it's transparent.""

Mr. Waxman defended the deal making as necessary to address a problem that affected every region and every industry.

""We worked hard to craft compromises that addressed the legitimate concerns of industry without undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation,"" Mr. Waxman said. ""Tackling hard issues that have been ignored for years is never easy.""

In its odyssey from introduction in late March to House passage, the climate-change bill sponsored by Mr. Waxman and Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, grew to more than 1,400 pages from 648 pages.

Although watered down from the original vision, it was still the first time either house of Congress passed a bill imposing a limit on the emissions blamed for the warming of the planet. The legislation awaits action in the Senate.

Despite all the concessions, President Obama worked hard for the bill and called it an extraordinary step for the nation. He said in an interview Sunday that the compromises had been necessary to moderate the different effects of greenhouse-gas controls on different parts of the country.

""I think that finding the right balance between providing new incentives to businesses, but not giving away the store, is always an art; it's not a science because it's never precise,"" Mr. Obama said.

One of the major changes in the bill came early at the insistence of Democrats from Southeastern states, including John Barrow of Georgia, G. K. Butterfield of North Carolina and Bart Gordon of Tennessee. Prodded by utilities in the region, they pressed for a weakening of the national mandate for renewable energy.

The original bill called for all utilities to secure 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources like wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy by 2025.

This was seen as either impossible or enormously expensive in the Southeast, which does not have abundant supplies of such energy. The standard was weakened to 15 percent by 2020, with states given the ability to reduce it further if they cannot meet the target. That helped win Mr. Gordon and Mr. Butterfield's votes. Mr. Barrow voted no.

The bill's centerpiece is a cap-and-trade program that sets a ceiling on emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide and allows polluting industries to trade emission permits or allowances to meet it. Mr. Obama said during the presidential campaign that all of those permits should be sold at auction, but the bill's authors ended up giving away 85 percent free at the outset of the program, which won votes but that some environmental advocates said undercut the bill's integrity.

Industries fought among themselves for a share of the permits. Oil refiners were frozen out at the beginning, but called on lawmakers from refinery-rich districts to press their case.

Representative Gene Green, a Democrat from near Houston, demanded 5 percent of the permit value, worth more than $3 billion a year, to help refiners deal with the costs of carbon controls. ""Refineries are very energy-intensive,"" Mr. Green said. ""They need a breather to adapt.""

He got them 2 percent of the allowances.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, a major supplier of power in the Farm Belt, was squeezed out by the big utilities and received none of the permits in the early negotiations. But ultimately the head of the group, Glenn English, a former Democratic member of Congress from Oklahoma, secured nearly $400 million in annual emissions permits to help the small co-ops.

With that deal done, some farm-state Democrats who had previously opposed the bill were willing to vote for it.

Some of the toughest negotiations were between Mr. Waxman and Representative Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota and a fierce defender of agricultural interests.

Mr. Peterson wrung numerous concessions on provisions opposed by agribusinesses and forestry companies. Several had to do with so-called offsets, which allow industrial polluters to meet emissions targets by buying carbon reductions from other sectors, particularly farms and forests, which actually take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

In the original bill, those offsets were to have been regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency, considered a bogyman in the farm states. Mr. Peterson got oversight shifted to the farmer-friendly Department of Agriculture. He also broadened the list of activities that would qualify as offsets, bringing a potential windfall to farm interests.

His deal cut, Mr. Peterson threw his support behind the bill.

Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff and a former Democratic leader in the House, said the president did not believe that the compromises had done it fatal harm.

""He loves this bill and lobbied hard for it,"" Mr. Emanuel said, ""including the great, the good and the not-so-great provisions."""
"Foreign, Wednesday, July 8, 2009 786 mots, p. A 9",,"Despite Shift on Climate By U.S., Europe Is Wary","By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES KANTER; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and James Kanter from Brussels.",,"WASHINGTON - The United States, long a laggard in international efforts to reduce global warming pollution, will arrive at the meeting of the world's major powers in Italy this week carrying a newly assertive message on the dangers of climate change and the steps needed to address it.

The European hosts of the Group of 8 summit meeting welcome the shift. But the new stance also worries them, in part because they fear that the United States is working toward an independent deal with China outside the global negotiating framework.

President Obama has stated a commitment to addressing climate change. That has been followed by the recent passage by the House of a landmark bill that, if also approved by the Senate, would begin to regulate heat-trapping gases. Those moves have given the Europeans, as well as climate scientists and some environmental groups, hope that the United States will take a leadership role in global talks toward a new climate-change treaty.

Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said during a visit to Washington in late June that she had detected a ""sea change"" in Washington's approach to climate change since Mr. Obama took office, raising the odds for a successful outcome to the treaty negotiations, to be held in Copenhagen in December.

But Europe is also unhappy with the Obama administration's reluctance to accept aggressive near-term goals for cutting greenhouse gases and its refusal so far to formally accept language that would limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above pre-industrial levels.

On Thursday, 17 developed and developing nations will attend a meeting on climate issues in L'Aquila, Italy, during the three-day Group of 8 summit meeting. In a draft of the declaration obtained by The New York Times that is scheduled to be released after the session, the countries say they agree on an ""aspirational global goal"" of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050, the same target President George W. Bush accepted a year ago at a Group of 8 meeting in Japan.

To achieve that, the draft document states, the United States and other advanced economies will have to reduce their emissions by 80 percent, consistent with Mr. Obama's position and the House climate legislation. Several leaders who will be at the summit meeting are also hoping to overcome Washington's reluctance to setting a temperature target.

The United States, however, has resisted European pressure to set strong goals over the next decade and has insisted on language that leaves vague the starting year against which emissions reductions will be measured. The Europeans wanted 1990, which would require much steeper near-term cuts, while the United States, Australia and Japan preferred a 2005 benchmark.

The draft is still subject to change before it is adopted on Thursday.

Mr. Obama, in an interview a week ago, said he recognized that Mrs. Merkel, other Europeans and many developing nations wanted more from the United States.

""My argument to her and to the Europeans is we don't want to make the best the enemy of the good,"" Mr. Obama said.

The president and other American policy makers also insist that no deal can effectively reduce emissions unless China, India and other major developing countries are on board. The United States has been pursuing a separate track of climate diplomacy directly with Beijing.

Michael Starbaek Christensen, a senior climate-change official in Denmark, said he was worried that the United States and China -- the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world -- would cut a separate deal and push the rest of the world into a treaty that did too little to curb emissions.

""I can only encourage Europe to stay in the lead and not let a bilateral U.S.-China relationship take over,"" Mr. Christensen said, ""because one concern I would have with the U.S.-China relationship is that they would find a lower common denominator.""

Discussions between China and the United States have progressed, but the countries remain far apart on emissions targets, trade measures, technology transfer and payments from rich countries aimed at helping developing nations adapt to the anticipated effects of rising temperatures, surging seas and the clearing of forests. There appears little prospect for resolution of those differences before December.

The draft declaration for the meeting on Thursday says that aid to the poorest and most vulnerable countries is essential, but it does not specify a formula for contributions to such a fund or how the money should be spent.

Industrial countries do appear willing to commit to a smaller, immediate payment to the most vulnerable countries.

As diplomats from around the world wrangle over details, a parallel track is under way that tries to look at concrete actions that can be taken outside of a negotiated international framework.

Hal Harvey, the chief executive of ClimateWorks, a group that supports projects to reduce global warming, says there are steps individual nations are taking in their own best economic and environmental interest that, if accelerated, would go a long way toward easing the challenge of reaching a global deal.

China should do more to improve the energy efficiency of its industries, Mr. Harvey said. The United States and Europe should adopt greener building and appliance standards, he added, while Brazil should alter its forest practices.

Mr. Harvey said that Mr. Obama had begun to speak out on these measures.

""It's such a breath of fresh air for the Obama administration to push for strong and aggressive policies that will flip the dynamic,"" he said. ""Good will is higher than ever. But that alone is not enough to make it happen. It's going to require some political alchemy.""

"Foreign, Friday, July 10, 2009 1130 mots, p. A 12",,BY DEGREES,,,"By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

BOGOTA, Colombia - Like most thoroughfares in booming cities of the developing world, Bogota's Seventh Avenue resembles a noisy, exhaust-coated parking lot -- a gluey tangle of cars and the rickety, smoke-puffing private minibuses that have long provided transportation for the masses.

But a few blocks away, sleek red vehicles full of commuters speed down the four center lanes of Avenida de las Americas. The long, segmented, low-emission buses are part of a novel public transportation system called bus rapid transit, or B.R.T. It is more like an above-ground subway than a collection of bus routes, with seven intersecting lines, enclosed stations that are entered through turnstiles with the swipe of a fare card and coaches that feel like trams inside.

Versions of these systems are being planned or built in dozens of developing cities around the world -- Mexico City, Cape Town, Jakarta, Indonesia, and Ahmedabad, India, to name a few -- providing public transportation that improves traffic flow and reduces smog at a fraction of the cost of building a subway.

But the rapid transit systems have another benefit: they may hold a key to combating climate change. Emissions from cars, trucks, buses and other vehicles in the booming cities of Asia, Africa and Latin America account for a rapidly growing component of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. While emissions from industry are decreasing, those related to transportation are expected to rise more than 50 percent by 2030 in industrialized and poorer nations. And 80 percent of that growth will be in the developing world, according to data presented in May at an international conference in Bellagio, Italy, sponsored by the Asian Development Bank and the Clean Air Institute.

To be effective, a new international climate treaty that will be negotiated in Copenhagen in December must include ""a policy response to the CO2 emissions from transport in the developing world,"" the Bellagio conference statement concluded.

Bus rapid transit systems like Bogota's, called TransMilenio, might hold an answer. Now used for an average of 1.6 million trips each day, TransMilenio has allowed the city to remove 7,000 small private buses from its roads, reducing the use of bus fuel -- and associated emissions -- by more than 59 percent since it opened its first line in 2001, according to city officials.

In recognition of this feat, TransMilenio last year became the only large transportation project approved by the United Nations to generate and sell carbon credits. Developed countries that exceed their emissions limits under the Kyoto Protocol, or that simply want to burnish a ""green"" image, can buy credits from TransMilenio to balance their emissions budgets, bringing Bogota an estimated $100 million to $300 million so far, analysts say.

Indeed, the city has provided a model of how international programs to combat climate change can help expanding cities -- the number of cars in China alone could increase sevenfold by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency -- pay for transit systems that would otherwise be unaffordable.

""Bogota was huge and messy and poor, so people said, 'If Bogota can do it, why can't we?' "" said Enrique Penalosa, an economist and a former mayor of the city who took TransMilenio from a concept to its initial opening in 2001 and is now advising other cities. In 2008, Mexico City opened a second successful bus rapid transit line that has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions there, according to Lee Schipper, a transportation expert at Stanford University, and the city has applied to sell carbon credits as well.

But bus rapid transit systems are not the answer for every city. In the United States, where cost is less constraining, some cities, like Los Angeles, have built B.R.T.'s, but they tend to lack many of the components of comprehensive systems like TransMilenio, like fully enclosed stations, and they serve as an addition to existing rail networks.

In some sprawling cities in India, where a tradition of scooter use may make bus rapid transit more difficult to create, researchers are working to develop a new model of tuk-tuk, or motorized cab, that is cheap and will run on alternative fuels or with a highly efficient engine. ""There are three million auto rickshaws in India alone, and the smoke is astonishing, so this could have a huge impact,"" said Stef van Dongen, director of Enviu, an environmental network group in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, that is sponsoring the research.

Bus rapid transit systems have not always worked well in cities that have tried them, either. In New Delhi, for example, the experiment foundered in part because it proved difficult to protect bus lanes from traffic. And a system that does not succeed in drawing passengers out of their cars just adds buses to existing vehicles on the roads, making traffic and emissions worse.

But with its wide streets, dense population and a tradition of bus travel, Bogota had the ingredients for success. To create TransMilenio, the city commandeered two to four traffic lanes in the middle of major boulevards, isolating them with low walls to create the system's so-called tracks. On the center islands that divide many of Bogota's two-way streets, the city built dozens of distinctive metal-and-glass stations. Just as in a subway, the multiple doors on the buses slide open level with the platform, providing easy access for strollers and older riders. Hundreds of passengers can wait on the platforms, avoiding the delays that occur when passengers each pay as they board.

Mr. Penalosa noted that the negative stereotypes about bus travel required some clever rebranding. Now, he said, upscale condominiums advertise that they are near TransMilenio lines. ""People don't say, 'I'm taking the bus,' they say, 'I'm taking TransMilenio,' "" he added, as he rode at rush hour recently, chatting with other passengers.

Jorge Engarrita, 45, a leather worker who was riding TransMilenio to work, said the system had ""changed his life,"" reducing his commuting time to 40 minutes with one transfer from two or three hours on several buses. Free shuttle buses carry residents from outlying districts to TransMilenio terminals.

To the dismay of car owners, Bogota removed one-third of its street parking to make room for TransMilenio and imposed alternate-day driving restrictions determined by license plate numbers, forcing car owners onto the system.

With an extensive route system, TransMilenio moves more passengers per mile every hour than almost any of the world's subways. Most poorer cities that have built subways, like Manila and Lagos, Nigeria, can afford to build only a few limited lines because of the expense.

Subways cost more than 30 times as much per mile to build than a B.R.T. system, and three times as much to maintain. And bus rapid transit systems can be built more quickly. ""Almost all rapidly developing cities understand that they need a metro or something like it, and you can get a B.R.T. by 2010 or a metro by 2060,"" said Walter Hook, executive director of the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy, in New York.

Although TransMilenio buses run on diesel, their efficient engines mean they emit less than half the nitrous oxide, particulate matter and carbon dioxide of the older minibuses. Cleaner fuels were either too expensive or did not work at Bogota's altitude, 9,000 feet above sea level.

TransMilenio is building more lines and underpasses to allow the buses to bypass clogged intersections, but for the moment the real challenge is overcrowding. Juan Gomez, 21, a businessman, takes TransMilenio only on days when he cannot drive, and he griped that it was often hard to find a seat.

""It's O.K., but I prefer the car,"" he said.

This is the third in a series of articles about stopgap measures that could limit global warming. Future articles will address appliance- efficiency standards, building codes, reducing global-warming gases other than carbon dioxide and other efforts."
"Editorial, Sunday, July 19, 2009 486 mots, p. WK 9",,EDITORIAL,,,"When leaders of the world's richest nations and the big developing countries agreed at the Group of 8 summit this month to restart global trade negotiations, they sent a powerful signal about the need for concerted action to deal with the world's economic emergency.

It was disturbing, however, that they could not agree on a common strategy for reducing the greenhouse emissions causing global warming. Trade and climate policy have become increasingly entangled. A failure to agree on how to address global warming could undermine half a century of opening world trade.

The House of Representatives proved the point last month when it passed a climate bill that would impose trade penalties on countries that do not accept limits on carbon emissions. Last year, the European Commission approved the idea of an ""equalization"" levy on imports from countries that have not agreed to cut emissions.

President Obama rightly opposed the penalties in the House bill. Unilateral sanctions are unlikely to work and more than likely to provoke a dangerous protectionist tit-for-tat trade war. Yet if the world's biggest emitters of CO2 -- including the United States, China and India -- fail to reach an agreement at a meeting in Copenhagen in December, the temptation for countries that accept limits on emissions to impose unilateral sanctions on countries that do not could well become irresistible.

The main reason trade and climate change are linked is that the damage inflicted by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is not mainly local or regional. If big emitters do not cut back, atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will continue to rise dangerously no matter what the rest of the world does.

Moreover, without a worldwide agreement on emissions, strict limits in signatory countries would very likely lead to a fall in energy prices in countries that did not agree to cuts -- encouraging even more energy consumption in those places and undermining the goal of stopping climate change.

Congress is concerned that domestic limits on carbon emissions would put American companies at a competitive disadvantage with rivals in countries with no such caps. But that is not the only problem. In the absence of a system of import duties related to carbon, industries with high emissions might relocate to nonsignatory countries to save money. Or they might fail, unable to compete with dirtier and cheaper foreign rivals.

There are precedents for using trade measures for environmental goals. The Montreal Agreement to curb the use of ozone-depleting gases included trade controls on such substances. And the World Trade Organization has suggested that levying taxes at the border on the carbon content of imports would be acceptable if they are devised properly -- in the same sort of way as some consumption taxes are levied on imports, ensuring equal treatment with domestic products.

Such tariffs must be part of an international agreement on climate change. Unilateral penalties against fast-growing polluters like China and India would be seen as illegitimate and could easily backfire, scuttling chances of an agreement on climate issues. Congress must refrain from putting sanctions in its climate bill.

An international accord that includes trade-related enforcement measures must also include commitments on emission reductions all around, as well as financial aid for poorer countries, like India and China, to meet the caps without sacrificing economic growth.

Further, any deal must set clear guidelines on how to identify and quantify transgressions and establish appropriate countermeasures. It also must not open a backdoor for protectionism. Without such a deal, trade is going to have problems. Failing to conclude the current negotiations will be the least of them."
"Foreign, Monday, July 20, 2009 660 mots, p. A 6",,Event Shows U.S.-India Split on Climate,By MARK LANDLER,,"GURGAON, India - It was supposed to be a showcase for how the United States and India can find common cause in fighting climate change: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton toured an innovative, energy-efficient office building on Sunday in this city on the outskirts of New Delhi.

But simmering grievances about how countries should share the burden of cutting greenhouse gases abruptly changed the mood. No sooner had Mrs. Clinton marveled at the building's environmentally friendly features -- like windows that flood rooms with light but keep out heat -- than her hosts vented frustration at American pressure on India to cut its emissions.

In a meeting with Mrs. Clinton, India's environment and forests minister, Jairam Ramesh, said there was ""no case"" for the West to push India to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when it already had among the lowest levels of emissions on a per capita basis. ""If this pressure is not enough,"" he said, ""we also face the threat of carbon tariffs on our exports to countries such as yours.""

Rather than projecting solidarity, the visit ended up laying bare the deep divide between developed and developing countries on climate policy -- a gulf the Obama administration will have to bridge as it tries to forge a new global agreement on climate change later this year.

Mrs. Clinton, in the first visit to India by a top Obama administration official, offered reassurances that the United States had no intention of forcing India into an economically crippling deal.

""No one wants to, in any way, stall or undermine economic growth that is necessary to lift millions more people out of poverty,"" Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference. ""The United States does not, and will not, do anything that would limit India's economic progress.""

American officials said they did not expect these differences to be aired during what was supposed to be an upbeat event, focusing on technology. But they said they did not feel betrayed.

To some extent, India's tough tone is a negotiating tactic as it and other countries prepare to advance their positions in talks leading up to a critical United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen in December.

""We are simply not in a position to take over legally binding emission reduction targets,"" Mr. Ramesh declared at the news conference. ""That does not mean that we are oblivious of our responsibilities.""

India's refusal to accept mandatory national cuts in emissions is neither new nor unique. China also opposes a deal with compulsory targets. Both countries say their economic growth should not be constrained when the West never faced such restrictions during its industrialization.

India's stance may reflect its pique at a bill passed in Washington by the House of Representatives, which would impose sanctions on countries that did not accept binding emissions cuts.

It may also reflect domestic political pressure because India acceded this month to an ""aspirational"" goal by the Group of 8 industrialized countries to cap the rise in temperatures because of global warming to two degrees Celsius. The group had sought a pledge of far-reaching reductions in global emissions.

Even the presence here of Todd Stern, Mrs. Clinton's special envoy for climate change, has raised eyebrows: On Saturday, The Times of India published an article with the headline ""Climate man's visit shocks India."" American officials insist Mrs. Clinton had long planned to bring Mr. Stern, who said climate change presented an opportunity for India to invest in windmills and solar panels. ""India, with its knowledge base and entrepreneurial talent and elan, is well positioned to be a winner,"" he said.

Mr. Ramesh leavened his tough words with a promise of cooperation in ""green technology."" He proposed teaming up with the United States on solar energy and biomass, and setting up Indian-American centers to study the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions.

Despite India's opposition to binding reductions, he said the Indian government was committed to reaching an agreement in Copenhagen. ""It is possible for us to narrow our positions,"" he said.

Mrs. Clinton also sought to put a good face on the differences. ""We have many more areas of agreement than has perhaps been appreciated,"" she said, ""and what we're looking for is a way to have a framework that includes everyone and which demands certain steps.""

She still seemed fascinated by her tour of the office building, a squat structure built around a circular atrium and known as the ITC Green Center, which has been certified by an American green building council with its highest classification.

Its owner, ITC Ltd., is a conglomerate that operates hotels and owns India's second-largest cigarette maker, a line of business that Indian officials say has made it eager to be regarded as a good corporate citizen. Mrs. Clinton compared the building to great Indian monuments like the Taj Mahal, though she conceded, ""No one will confuse it with the Taj Mahal."""
"Science, Tuesday, August 4, 2009 1187 mots, p. D 1",,Nobel Halo Fades Fast For Panel On Climate,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"Two years ago, an international scientific panel seized worldwide attention by reporting that human activity was warming the planet in ways that could greatly disrupt human affairs and nature.

The work of the group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore. After two decades of delivering climate reports to the world without fanfare, it suddenly had a wide following.

But as the panel gears up for its next climate review, many specialists in climate science and policy, both inside and out of the network, are warning that it could quickly lose relevance unless it adjusts its methods and focus.

Although the panel, founded in 1988 and operating under the United Nations' auspices, has garnered awards and acclaim, there is scant evidence that nations are acting on its warnings. Emissions of heat-trapping gases have grown. Talks about a new climate treaty remain largely deadlocked.

""Like grabbing the tail of a tiger, the I.P.C.C. has gotten the world's attention, but now the challenge is to get the tiger to head in the right direction,"" said Michael MacCracken, a longtime contributor to panel reports and a chief scientist for the Climate Institute, a nonprofit group. ""For the I.P.C.C., this means providing guidance that will minimize climate impacts and maximize investments in a prosperous and sustainable future.""

Environmentalists assert that the reports by the panel are watered down by a requirement that sponsoring governments approve its summaries line by line.

Some experts fret that the organization, charged with assessing fast-evolving science, has failed to keep pace with an explosion of climate research.

At the same time, scientists who question the likelihood of a calamitous disruption of the Earth's climate accuse the panel of cherry-picking studies and playing down levels of uncertainty about the severity of global warming.

""It just feels like the I.P.C.C. has gone from being a broker of science to a gatekeeper,"" said John R. Christy, a climate scientist at the University of Alabama, Huntsville, and a former panel author.

In an interview, Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the I.P.C.C., rejected the charge of bias, noting layers of transparent peer review.

But he acknowledged the challenges that the group faces in translating complex science in a way that produces meaningful responses.

Under its charter, the group cannot recommend a course of action to cut climate risks. It has laid out specific paths for emissions of greenhouse gases that governments would need to follow to avoid overheating the planet, but governments need not follow those paths.

For example, Dr. Pachauri noted that while the leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations pledged last month to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Fahrenheit beyond the planet's current temperature, they failed to embrace the emissions reductions that the panel says would be needed to keep that promise.

Finding ways to guide nations without being prescriptive is a prime focus as the network of scientists embarks on its fifth assessment of research on climate trends, projections and policy options.

While the new study is not scheduled for release until 2014, its shape will be determined at an October meeting of government representatives from more than 80 countries.

In preparation for that meeting, 200 scientists who have held leading roles in the climate assessments met in Venice last month to identify new priorities. Building on a ""vision document"" developed by Dr. Pachauri, they began writing an outline of the fifth report to present to the government representatives meeting in Bali in October.

One goal for the next report is a much more thorough assessment of how fast and far seas could rise from unabated warming. The panel's 2007 report expressly excluded the influence of melting ice sheets because of limited understanding of how fast they could melt.

Shying away from discussing such possibilities because there is low scientific confidence can imply there is also a low probability they may occur, said Stephen H. Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford and longtime panel member. That is not necessarily the case, he said.

More attention will be devoted to research on the potential for dangerous changes in ocean chemistry as seas absorb billions of tons of carbon dioxide. Another focus will be large-scale artificial methods of countering warming, called geo-engineering.

The panel will also try harder to identify anticipated impacts of climate change on certain regions, and options for fostering resilience in especially vulnerable places like sub-Saharan Africa.

Dr. Pachauri noted that the panel put its Nobel Prize winnings, around $670,000, into an account for helping the world's poorest countries respond to drought, flood and other climate risks. (Mr. Gore gave his share to the Alliance for Climate Protection. )

But tens of billions of dollars in aid will be needed as explosive population growth and shifting climate patterns make poor nations more vulnerable, according to a variety of studies.

Some specialists in climate modeling warn that governments may have overinflated expectations that science can reliably forecast how global warming will play out locally.

Gavin A. Schmidt, a climate modeler at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said that efforts to use computer simulations of local conditions to forecast specific results of climate shifts over a decade or so were still in early stages of development.

""Simply hoping that higher resolution will magically improve predictability at smaller scales is just wishful thinking,"" Dr. Schmidt said in an e-mail message.

Other scientists involved in shaping the next report worry that the runaway growth in peer-reviewed studies of climate change is making a broad, fair assessment of such research impossible.

At a meeting in Budapest last year on the future of the climate panel, Neville Nicholls, a lead writer on several parts of the last report, submitted a chart showing that 4,500 climate studies were published in 2007, triple the total a decade earlier.

Given that the hundreds of scientists on the panel volunteer their time, this presents a daunting challenge, said Dr. Nicholls, a climate scientist at Monash University in Victoria, Australia.

He proposes that the group write more focused, expeditious reports on issues relevant to setting policy.

Dr. Nicholls suggested that the panel could eventually shift to reviewing the flow of research on more basic questions through a constantly updated Wikipedia-style system.

The panel already does occasional special reports, with one coming next year on the potential of renewable energy technologies to cut greenhouse emissions, and another in 2011 on limiting risks from drought and other climate-driven disasters.

Christopher Field, a participant and chairman of one section of the forthcoming assessment, said that an important focus was psychological and sociological research on how people act in the face of uncertain but substantial threats.

""We've identified the nature of the problem, and social science shows it's of the toughest category,"" said Dr. Field, who directs the Carnegie Institution department of global ecology at Stanford.

One hope is that the final October outline, once approved, will encourage governments to invest more resources in such research, so that the 2014 report can incorporate findings.

In the end, perhaps the most vital shift is for the panel to pay more attention to the murkier but most consequential possibilities in a warming world, said Dr. Schneider.

The panel, he said, could do more to distinguish between outcomes from warming that research shows are truly unlikely, like a shutdown of Atlantic Ocean currents, and those that are possible but uncertain. One example of this kind, he said, is the chance that the planet could heat up far more than climate models project; another is the possible sustained disintegration of ice sheets.

Dr. Schneider noted that society relied on risk analyses of this sort all the time, with issues like choosing treatments for rare but poorly understood cancers (Dr. Schneider survived such an episode) and with assessing military strategies.

It may be uncomfortable for scientists who seek certainty in data to turn to the issue of how to weigh uncertain threats. But decision makers are not well served if the spectrum of poorly known possibilities, along with the level of uncertainty, are not also conveyed by experts, he said.

""If you say nothing until you have high confidence and solid evidence,"" he said, ""you're failing society."""
"Foreign, Thursday, August 6, 2009 394 mots, p. A 8",,"China Sees Progress on Climate Accord, but Resists an Emissions Ceiling",By MICHAEL WINES,,"BEIJING - China's envoy to global negotiations on climate change expressed optimism on Wednesday that a new agreement to reduce greenhouse gases would be reached this year, and he said that his nation's efforts to curb carbon pollution already had produced results that he called ""second to none.""

But the envoy, Yu Qingtai, also underscored China's opposition to placing a ceiling on its emissions of greenhouse gases, a step that some experts have called crucial to efforts to slow global warming.

China now emits more carbon dioxide than the United States, although it remains well behind when pollutants are measured on a per-person basis. Together, China and the United States account for about 40 percent of pollutants linked to climate change.

In a briefing at China's Foreign Ministry, Mr. Yu presented a list of Chinese achievements in limiting carbon emissions, including claims that Beijing is the world's foremost user of nonpolluting hydropower and solar power, and fourth in wind power. By 2020, he said, 15 percent of China's energy will come from renewable sources.

Mr. Yu also said the nation had made impressive strides in energy efficiency, reducing the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product by a tenth since 2005. The government has said it will achieve a total reduction of 20 percent by 2020, a goal Mr. Yu called ""a binding target.""

Mr. Yu said he was hopeful that a comprehensive agreement to reduce greenhouse gases could be reached at a December meeting in Copenhagen, where nations will try to devise a successor to the protocol reached at a 1997 United Nations meeting in Kyoto, Japan. Part of that optimism, he said, stemmed from the fact that global climate problems are so fearsome that ""we cannot afford to fail.""

""Not a single country in the world will be able to stay out of trouble,"" he said. ""Not a single country can say that it can keep safe and intact from global warming. So the only way out is cooperation -- global cooperation.""

Still, he repeated China's longstanding opposition to placing an absolute limit on its own emissions of greenhouse gases. Limiting China's development would hamstring efforts to raise its living standards closer to the level of the developed world, which Mr. Yu noted is largely responsible for climate change problems.

Mr. Yu devoted much of his briefing to calls for the world's rich nations to take concrete steps toward reducing their pollutants instead of issuing what he suggested were empty pledges. China has proposed that the developed world commit to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020.

""The developed countries, in realizing their industrialization, have discharged a large amount of greenhouse gases in the course of one or two centuries,"" he said. ""The cumulative emissions by the developed countries have caused global warming. Who should take the historical responsibilities?""

Mr. Yu also said that talks with the Obama administration on climate change issues had been ""quite fruitful"" and that China saw great potential for further progress in bilateral negotiations."
"National, Friday, August 7, 2009 368 mots, p. A 12",,Climate Bill Is Threatened By Senators,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - Ten moderate Senate Democrats from states dependent on coal and manufacturing sent a letter to President Obama on Thursday saying they would not support any climate change bill that did not protect American industries from competition from countries that did not impose similar restraints on climate-altering gases.

The letter warned that strong actions to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases would add to the cost of goods like steel, cement, paper and aluminum. Unless other countries adopt similar emission limits, the senators warned, jobs will migrate overseas and foreign manufacturers will have a decided cost advantage.

""As Congress considers energy and climate legislation,"" the senators wrote, ""it is important that such a bill include provisions to maintain a level playing field for American manufacturing.""

""It is essential that any clean energy legislation not only address the crisis of climate change, but include strong provisions to ensure the strength and viability of domestic manufacturing,"" the letter said.

The 10 senators are seen as crucial undecided votes in the Senate debate on climate legislation. The House narrowly passed a climate bill in late June, but the Senate is moving slowly, in part because it is preoccupied with health care legislation.

The senators represent Midwestern and coal-producing states from which many of the 44 Democrats who voted against the measure in the House come from. Without their support, it is unlikely that the Senate can pass a major climate change bill.

The 10 senators were Evan Bayh of Indiana; Sherrod Brown of Ohio; Robert C. Byrd and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia; Bob Casey and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania; Russ Feingold of Wisconsin; Al Franken of Minnesota; and Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

They called for transition aid for energy-intensive manufacturers in the form of rebates on their energy costs; negotiation of a strong international agreement on emissions; programs to monitor emissions in other countries; and significant financing for clean energy technology.

The authors also proposed ""border adjustments,"" tariffs, on goods from countries that do not agree to an international program for carbon dioxide reductions. The House bill gives the president the power to impose such penalties on goods from countries that do not adhere to an international climate change regime.

""Climate change is a reality and the world cannot afford inaction,"" the senators wrote. ""However, we must not engage in a self-defeating effort that displaces greenhouse gas emissions rather than reducing them and displaces U.S. jobs rather than bolstering them.""

In an interview shortly after the House vote, President Obama said he was concerned about the tariff provision of the House bill, calling it potentially protectionist"
"Money and Business/Financial, Sunday, August 9, 2009 719 mots, p. BU 4",,ECONOMIC VIEW,,,"By N. GREGORY MANKIW

DURING the presidential campaign of 2008, Barack Obama distinguished himself on the economics of climate change, speaking far more sensibly about the issue than most of his rivals. Unfortunately, now that he is president, Mr. Obama may sign a climate bill that falls far short of his aspirations. Indeed, the legislation making its way to his desk could well be worse than nothing at all.

Let's start with the basics. The essential problem of climate change, scientists tell us, is that humans are emitting too much carbon into the atmosphere, which tends to raise world temperatures. Emitting carbon is what economists call a ""negative externality""-- an adverse side effect of certain market activities on bystanders.

The textbook solution for dealing with negative externalities is to use the tax system to align private incentives with social costs and benefits. Suppose the government imposed a tax on carbon-based products and used the proceeds to cut other taxes. People would have an incentive to shift their consumption toward less carbon-intensive products. A carbon tax is the remedy for climate change that wins overwhelming support among economists and policy wonks.

When he was still a candidate, Mr. Obama did not exactly endorse a carbon tax. He wanted to be elected, and embracing any tax that hits millions of middle-class voters is not a recipe for electoral success. But he did come tantalizingly close.

What Mr. Obama proposed was a cap-and-trade system for carbon, with all the allowances sold at auction. In short, the system would put a ceiling on the amount of carbon released, and companies would bid on the right to emit carbon into the atmosphere.

Such a system is tantamount to a carbon tax. The auction price of an emission right is effectively a tax on carbon. The revenue raised by the auction gives the government the resources to cut other taxes that distort behavior, like income or payroll taxes.

So far, so good. The problem occurred as this sensible idea made the trip from the campaign trail through the legislative process. Rather than auctioning the carbon allowances, the bill that recently passed the House would give most of them away to powerful special interests.

The numbers involved are not trivial. From Congressional Budget Office estimates, one can calculate that if all the allowances were auctioned, the government could raise $989 billion in proceeds over 10 years. But in the bill as written, the auction proceeds are only $276 billion.

Mr. Obama understood these risks. When asked about a carbon tax in an interview in July 2007, he said: ""I believe that, depending on how it is designed, a carbon tax accomplishes much of the same thing that a cap-and-trade program accomplishes. The danger in a cap-and-trade system is that the permits to emit greenhouse gases are given away for free as opposed to priced at auction. One of the mistakes the Europeans made in setting up a cap-and-trade system was to give too many of those permits away.""

Congress is now in the process of sending President Obama a bill that makes exactly this mistake.

How much does it matter? For the purpose of efficiently allocating the carbon rights, it doesn't. Even if these rights are handed out on political rather than economic grounds, the ""trade"" part of ""cap and trade"" will take care of the rest. Those companies with the most need to emit carbon will buy carbon allowances on newly formed exchanges. Those without such pressing needs will sell whatever allowances they are given and enjoy the profits that resulted from Congress's largess.

The problem arises in how the climate policy interacts with the overall tax system. As the president pointed out, a cap-and-trade system is like a carbon tax. The price of carbon allowances will eventually be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for carbon-intensive products. But if most of those allowances are handed out rather than auctioned, the government won't have the resources to cut other taxes and offset that price increase. The result is an increase in the effective tax rates facing most Americans, leading to lower real take-home wages, reduced work incentives and depressed economic activity.

The hard question is whether, on net, such a policy is good or bad. Here you can find policy wonks on both sides. To those who view climate change as an impending catastrophe and the distorting effects of the tax system as a mere annoyance, an imperfect bill is better than none at all. To those not fully convinced of the enormity of global warming but deeply worried about the adverse effects of high current and prospective tax rates, the bill is a step in the wrong direction.

What everyone should agree on is that the legislation making its way through Congress is a missed opportunity. President Obama knows what a good climate bill would look like. But despite his immense popularity and personal charisma, he appears unable to persuade Congress to go along.

As for me, I hope the president refuses to sign a bill that fails to auction most of the allowances. Some might say a veto would make the best the enemy of the good. But sometimes good is not good enough."
"Foreign, Sunday, August 9, 2009 1031 mots, p. A 1",,Climate Change Seen as Threat To Security and Drain on Military,By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The changing global climate will pose profound strategic challenges to the United States in coming decades, raising the prospect of military intervention to deal with the effects of violent storms, drought, mass migration and pandemics, military and intelligence analysts say.

Such climate-induced crises could topple governments, feed terrorist movements or destabilize entire regions, say the analysts, experts at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies who for the first time are taking a serious look at the national security implications of climate change.

Recent war games and intelligence studies conclude that over the next 20 to 30 years, vulnerable regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, will face the prospect of food shortages, water crises and catastrophic flooding driven by climate change that could demand an American humanitarian relief or military response.

An exercise last December at the National Defense University, an educational institute that is overseen by the military, explored the potential impact of a destructive flood in Bangladesh that sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into neighboring India, touching off religious conflict, the spread of contagious diseases and vast damage to infrastructure. ""It gets real complicated real quickly,"" said Amanda J. Dory, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy, who is working with a Pentagon group assigned to incorporate climate change into national security strategy planning.

Much of the public and political debate on global warming has focused on finding substitutes for fossil fuels, reducing emissions that contribute to greenhouse gases and furthering negotiations toward an international climate treaty -- not potential security challenges.

But a growing number of policy makers say that the world's rising temperatures, surging seas and melting glaciers are a direct threat to the national interest.

If the United States does not lead the world in reducing fossil-fuel consumption and thus emissions of global warming gases, proponents of this view say, a series of global environmental, social, political and possibly military crises loom that the nation will urgently have to address.

This argument could prove a fulcrum for debate in the Senate next month when it takes up climate and energy legislation passed in June by the House.

Lawmakers leading the debate before Congress are only now beginning to make the national security argument for approving the legislation.

Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a leading advocate for the climate legislation, said he hoped to sway Senate skeptics by pressing that issue to pass a meaningful bill.

Mr. Kerry said he did not know whether he would succeed but had spoken with 30 undecided senators on the matter.

He did not identify those senators, but the list of undecided includes many from coal and manufacturing states and from the South and Southeast, which will face the sharpest energy price increases from any carbon emissions control program.

""I've been making this argument for a number of years,"" Mr. Kerry said, ""but it has not been a focus because a lot of people had not connected the dots."" He said he had urged President Obama to make the case, too.

Mr. Kerry said the continuing conflict in southern Sudan, which has killed and displaced tens of thousands of people, is a result of drought and expansion of deserts in the north. ""That is going to be repeated many times over and on a much larger scale,"" he said.

The Department of Defense's assessment of the security issue came about after prodding by Congress to include climate issues in its strategic plans -- specifically, in 2008 budget authorizations by Hillary Rodham Clinton and John W. Warner, then senators. The department's climate modeling is based on sophisticated Navy and Air Force weather programs and other government climate research programs at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Pentagon and the State Department have studied issues arising from dependence on foreign sources of energy for years but are only now considering the effects of global warming in their long-term planning documents. The Pentagon will include a climate section in the Quadrennial Defense Review, due in February; the State Department will address the issue in its new Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review.

""The sense that climate change poses security and geopolitical challenges is central to the thinking of the State Department and the climate office,"" said Peter Ogden, chief of staff to Todd Stern, the State Department's top climate negotiator.

Although military and intelligence planners have been aware of the challenge posed by climate changes for some years, the Obama administration has made it a central policy focus.

A changing climate presents a range of challenges for the military. Many of its critical installations are vulnerable to rising seas and storm surges. In Florida, Homestead Air Force Base was essentially destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Ivan badly damaged Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2004. Military planners are studying ways to protect the major naval stations in Norfolk, Va., and San Diego from climate-induced rising seas and severe storms.

Another vulnerable installation is Diego Garcia, an atoll in the Indian Ocean that serves as a logistics hub for American and British forces in the Middle East and sits a few feet above sea level.

Arctic melting also presents new problems for the military. The shrinking of the ice cap, which is proceeding faster than anticipated only a few years ago, opens a shipping channel that must be defended and undersea resources that are already the focus of international competition.

Ms. Dory, who has held senior Pentagon posts since the Clinton administration, said she had seen a ""sea change"" in the military's thinking about climate change in the past year. ""These issues now have to be included and wrestled with"" in drafting national security strategy, she said.

The National Intelligence Council, which produces government-wide intelligence analyses, finished the first assessment of the national security implications of climate change just last year.

It concluded that climate change by itself would have significant geopolitical impacts around the world and would contribute to a host of problems, including poverty, environmental degradation and the weakening of national governments.

The assessment warned that the storms, droughts and food shortages that might result from a warming planet in coming decades would create numerous relief emergencies.

""The demands of these potential humanitarian responses may significantly tax U.S. military transportation and support force structures, resulting in a strained readiness posture and decreased strategic depth for combat operations,"" the report said.

The intelligence community is preparing a series of reports on the impacts of climate change on individual countries like China and India, a study of alternative fuels and a look at how major power relations could be strained by a changing climate.

""We will pay for this one way or another,"" Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, a retired Marine and the former head of the Central Command, wrote recently in a report he prepared as a member of a military advisory board on energy and climate at CNA, a private group that does research for the Navy. ""We will pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today, and we'll have to take an economic hit of some kind.

""Or we will pay the price later in military terms,"" he warned. ""And that will involve human lives."""
"National, Saturday, August 29, 2009 724 mots, p. A 10",,A Sometimes Lonely Trek for Global Warming Awareness,By LESLIE KAUFMAN,,"On Route 11 north of Tuscaloosa, Ala., last April, a pickup truck pulled up next to Greta Browne, and a young man began lecturing her about global warming.

He had seen Ms. Browne's T-shirt announcing that she was ""Walking for the Climate,"" and he wanted to set her straight. Humans, he told her, have nothing to do with heating up the planet.

Ms. Browne, 65, a Unitarian minister from Bethlehem, Pa., has encountered more than one global warming naysayer since last March, when she began a trek up the Eastern seaboard to draw attention to climate change.

""Sometimes, you just have to stand up,"" she said.

So far, Ms. Browne says, she has logged about 1,100 miles, walking from outside New Orleans to Rouses Point, N.Y., near the Canadian border, where she will end her journey Saturday. A grandmother of three, she blogs for adults, and for children.

When she began the trip, Ms. Browne had hoped to attract crowds of other people to walk with her (think Forrest Gump running cross country in the 1994 film). Instead, it has been a mostly solo journey, which she describes as ""a meditation, a prayer,"" for Earth.

Still, her shirt and her beckoning smile invite people to approach. Sometimes they pull their cars over and hand her fistfuls of dollar bills -- she is financing the trip with small donations, and her Social Security checks.

Sometimes people run up alongside and proffer water bottles, which she accepts, even though they violate her principles on garbage and waste. And sometimes they stop to tell her not to worry: God would never allow Earth to warm disastrously, they say. She listens patiently and argues her case.

In choosing to promote her cause this way -- as opposed to, say, pressing for legislative change -- Ms. Browne joins a growing list of environmental activists who are hoping to draw public attention to the issue through stunts: Colin Beavan, for example, the writer who lived without toilet paper and electricity, or David de Rothschild, a self-described ""eco-adventurer"" in San Francisco who has built a boat made of reused plastic water bottles and plans to sail to Sydney, Australia.

As she has plodded along, Ms. Browne said, she has come to understand her journey as a one-woman survey of the American mindset on global warming, though one, she readily concedes, that is deeply unscientific. Normally a glass-half-full type, she says the trip has made her ""more pessimistic.""

""Mostly people think it is a problem,"" she said, ""but mostly they think it will not impact them anytime soon.""

A longtime member of the Green Party and the founder of a vegetarian cooperative restaurant, she has been concerned for years about global warming. But after she retired last year, she joined an environmental group and read ""Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet"" by Mark Lynas. The book, which argues that most of humanity could be wiped out by the end of the century if Earth's temperatures continue to warm, galvanized her.

As the child of Presbyterian missionaries, Ms. Browne lived in Brazil, China and Niger, and was used to a peripatetic lifestyle, so she decided to take to the road. Her role model was Doris Haddock, better known as Granny D, who in 1999, at age 90, walked across the country for campaign finance reform, generating both crowds and headlines.

Ms. Browne's trek has not quite turned out that way, and, she says, her adventure has other shortcomings. To make the walk logistically possible, she has lived out of a 1982 van -- complete with gold-colored shag carpeting and rust velour sofas -- that is, by her own admission, ""a disgusting gas guzzler.""

By living abstemiously on other fronts, she said she had managed to keep her carbon footprint to half that of the average American. She never eats out and, except for her T-shirts, all her clothes are second-hand. Even her white Clarks sneakers were bought from a thrift store.

On Sundays, she goes to Unitarian Universalist churches along the way. She has handed out fliers listing small actions people can take to fight global warming, like using compact fluorescent light bulbs and lobbying for schools to teach the subject.

Crowds or no, Ms. Browne says, she is convinced that she has reached people and ""raised awareness."" She estimates that 500 to 1,000 cars pass her on the road every day and about 1 percent, she says, honk or give her a thumbs-up.

In the end, Ms. Browne said, she thinks that most people are sympathetic and want to do something -- just not too much. She was particularly discouraged by a woman who approached her after one church talk and said, ""Oh, you are preaching to the choir. We already recycle.""

Ms. Browne remembers thinking that recycling was ""so 1980s"" -- perfectly good, she said, but not nearly enough in itself.

""People just don't see enough urgency to change their life,"" she said.

But she understands. She plans, she says, to keep the van."
"National, Friday, September 4, 2009 505 mots, p. A 16",,"Global Warming Is Delaying Ice Age, Study Finds",By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The human-driven buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere appears to have ended a slide, many millenniums in the making, toward cooler summer temperatures in the Arctic, the authors of a new study report.

Scientists familiar with the work, to be published Friday in the journal Science, said it provided fresh evidence that human activity is not only warming the globe, particularly the Arctic, but could also even fend off what had been presumed to be an inevitable descent into a new ice age over the next few dozen millenniums.

The reversal of the slow cooling trend in the Arctic, recorded in samples of layered lakebed mud, glacial ice and tree rings from Alaska to Siberia, has been swift and pronounced, the team writes.

Earlier studies have also shown that the Arctic, more than the planet as a whole, has seen unusual warming in recent decades. But the new analysis provides decade-by-decade detail on temperature trends going back 2,000 years -- five times further than previous work at that detailed a scale.

Several climate scientists said the new study was most significant for showing just how powerfully the Arctic climate appears to be responding to a greenhouse-gas buildup that is having more complex and subtle mix of effects elsewhere around the globe.

Darrell S. Kaufman, the lead author and a climate specialist at Northern Arizona University, said the biggest surprise was the strength of the shift from cooling to warming, which started in 1900 and intensified after 1950.

""The slow cooling trend is trivial compared to the warming that's been happening and that's in the pipeline,"" Dr. Kaufman said.

Several scientists who were not involved with the study concurred that the pace of the temperature reversal far exceeded the natural variability in Arctic temperatures, supporting the idea that the warm-up is human-caused and potentially disruptive.

According to the study, after a slow cooling of less than half a degree Fahrenheit per millennium, driven by a cyclical change in the orientation of the North Pole and the Sun, the region warmed 2.2 degrees just since 1900, with the decade from 1998 to 2008 the warmest in 2,000 years.

In theory, summer temperatures in the Arctic region would be expected to cool for at least 4,000 more years, given the growing distance between the Sun and the North Pole during the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the study says.

But Jonathan T. Overpeck, a study author and climate specialist at the University of Arizona, said the rising concentration of long-lived greenhouse gases guaranteed warming at a pace that could stress ecosystems and cause rapid melting of Greenland's great ice sheet.

""The fast rate of recent warming is the scary part,"" Dr. Overpeck said. ""It means that major impacts on Arctic ecosystems and global sea level might not be that far off unless we act fast to slow global warming.""

In the very long term, the ability to artificially warm the climate, particularly the Arctic, could be seen as a boon as the planet's shifting orientation to the Sun enters a phase that could initiate the next ice age.

As a result of such periodic shifts, 17 ice ages are thought to have come and gone in two million years. The last ice age ended 11,000 years ago and the next one, according to recent research, could be 20,000 or 30,000 years off discounting any influence by humans. The last ice age buried much of the Northern Hemisphere under a mile or more of ice.

With humans' clear and growing ability to alter the climate, Dr. Overpeck said, ""we could easily skip the next opportunity altogether."""
"National, Friday, September 11, 2009 422 mots, p. A 13",,"Nations Remain Divided on Global Warming Policy, U.S. Negotiator Says",By JOHN M. BRODER,,"WASHINGTON - The Obama administration's senior negotiator on global warming warned Thursday that developed and developing nations remained deeply divided in talks on reducing greenhouse gases and that time was running out before United Nations treaty negotiations in December.

The negotiator, Todd Stern, the State Department special envoy on the issue, told a Congressional panel that it was critical that Congress act on proposed energy and global warming legislation to demonstrate the nation's willingness to play its part in reducing harmful emissions.

""Let me say bluntly that the tenor of negotiations in the formal U.N. track has been difficult,"" Mr. Stern told the House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming. ""Developing countries tend to see a problem not of their own making that they are being asked to fix in ways which, they fear, could stifle their ability to lift their standards of living.""

""Developed countries,"" he said, ""tend to see an unforgiving problem with potentially grave and irreversible consequences and that cannot be solved without the full participation of developing countries, particularly China and the other emerging market economies.""

Mr. Stern said China, India, Brazil and other rapidly industrializing countries were taking significant unilateral steps to slow the growth of emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to the warming of the planet. He said their efforts in some cases outstripped those of the United States and some other advanced economies.

Still, officials from those countries are wary of any treaty that binds them to enforceable targets, believing that such measures could permanently condemn them to second-class economic status.

""I have said on occasion that countries like these are often willing to do more than they are willing to agree to do,"" Mr. Stern said. ""But we can't get an international deal done unless they are willing to agree in an international context.""

He said the United States could also pose a major hurdle to the global talks to produce a treaty to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 accord that expires in 2012.

While the House approved a fairly aggressive climate and energy bill in June, action in the Senate this fall is uncertain at best.

""It is critical that the Senate now do its part to move this process forward in a timely manner,"" Mr. Stern said. ""Nothing the United States can do is more important for the international negotiation process than passing robust, comprehensive clean energy legislation as soon as possible.""

Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the select committee, is a co-sponsor of the House climate bill. Mr. Markey said that House passage of the bill had helped prompt the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations to agree to try to limit the global rise in temperature to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and that Senate action could help spur agreement at the December treaty talks in Denmark.

""With a few months left before climate negotiations in Copenhagen,"" Mr. Markey said, ""it's now time for the Senate to act and pass a bill so America will have the stature to craft a global climate agreement."""
"Editorial, Wednesday, September 16, 2009 312 mots, p. A 30",,EDITORIAL,,,"Senators Barbara Boxer and John Kerry have delayed the introduction of their long-awaited climate change bill until the end of this month -- one more sign that Congress will be hard pressed to get a bill to President Obama's desk before the international summit on global warming in Stockholm in December.

The chances of action this year, never all that good, are even slimmer now that the White House and the Senate leadership have pretty much agreed to keep controversial issues -- and a bill limiting greenhouse gas emissions certainly falls into that category -- on the back burner until the health care debate is resolved.

Though smart politics, it is a disappointment to everyone who hoped that the United States would be able to go to Stockholm with a clear strategy in hand.

All is not lost. The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling out rules that, when fully effective, could place limits on at least half the greenhouse gas emissions emitted in this country.

On Tuesday, the E.P.A. and the Department of Transportation jointly proposed standards to improve fuel economy and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in all new cars and light trucks beginning with the model year 2012. The E.P.A. has already sent the White House preliminary proposals involving the regulation of carbon dioxide from large stationary sources, including refineries and power plants.

The agency also continues to fine-tune its finding formally declaring that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases constitute a danger to human health and welfare. Under the Clean Air Act, an ""endangerment finding"" must be made before final rules limiting emissions can take effect.

Nobody, including the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa Jackson, believes that one agency can address the complex problem of climate change. Ultimately, Congress will have to produce robust legislation authorizing major public investments in alternative energy sources and putting a price on carbon to unlock private investment.

That is just what the climate change bill approved by the House aims to do and what Senators Boxer and Kerry eventually hope to do with their bill. In the meantime, however, smart regulation can get the ball rolling and, we hope, goad Congress into action."
"Foreign, Sunday, September 20, 2009 930 mots, p. A 6",,"You First, Nations Say, as 100 Leaders Prepare to Meet on Climate Change",By NEIL MacFARQUHAR,,"UNITED NATIONS - Economists point to powerhouse countries like India to illustrate the hurdles facing some 100 world leaders due to gather in New York this Tuesday for the highest level summit meeting on climate change ever convened.

The Indian government has announced a major commitment to solar power as a renewable means of bringing electricity to more than 400 million people now living without it. Yet the government was pilloried at home last summer for accepting the international goal of preventing a global temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit above present temperatures by limiting emissions. Opposition parties accused it of selling out the country's future development.

While virtually all of the largest developed and developing nations have made domestic commitments toward creating more efficient, renewable sources of energy to cut emissions, none want to take the lead in fighting for significant international emissions reduction targets, lest they be accused at home of selling out future jobs and economic growth.

The negotiations for a new climate change agreement to be signed in Copenhagen in December are badly stalled. With the agreement running more than 200 pages -- including what negotiators estimate are a couple of thousand brackets denoting points of differences -- diplomats and negotiators fear that the document is too unwieldy to garner a consensus in the coming months.

In convening the meeting, the United Nations is hoping that collectively the leaders can summon the will to overcome narrow national interests and give the negotiators the marching orders needed to cut at least the outline of a deal.

""I have been urging them to speak and to act as global leaders; just go beyond their national boundaries,"" Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, said Thursday.

On Tuesday, the leaders, including the heads of state or government of most economic powers, are to engage in a series of round-table discussions on outstanding climate change issues that will be less like negotiations than a series of college seminars designed to forge political momentum.

""They won't do it one by one,"" said Robert Orr, the United Nations assistant secretary general for policy planning. ""Politically, they all have to jump together, and this is the essence of this summit. We will see if any governments are ready to say, 'I am stepping through the door now; are you going to come with me?' That would be a huge break.""

Senior organizers said they had never been involved in such a high-level summit meeting where the outcome was not predetermined. Fundamentally, although limiting the temperature rise to 2 degrees Fahrenheit is an accepted goal, there is no consensus on how to get there.

This 2-degree Fahrenheit rise is the equivalent of the original goal of 2 degrees Celsius above the planet's temperature just before the Industrial Revolution.

The industrialized nations have not agreed on midterm targets. They have made pledges of roughly half the target set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2020.

Developing countries have agreed on the need to mitigate their emissions, but have rejected any mandatory limit, and they demand financial and technical support in exchange.

The issue of aid for the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change has been shunted aside. Finally, there is no agreement on what institutions would verify that targets are being met and supervise the finances.

""The mood in the negotiations has been that I should do as little as possible as late as possible and let the other person go first,"" said Kim Carstensen, the director of the Global Climate Initiative of the World Wildlife Fund.

In recent weeks, sharp divisions have emerged between the United States and the European Union. The Europeans said that they would donate $2 billion to $15 billion a year for the next decade to help less developed nations adapt to climate change. The Obama administration has not offered anything close.

The Europeans also want binding, near-term targets for developed nations, a legacy of the last significant global climate accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration rejected because it did not set limits on emissions from China and other major developing nations.

The European target is a 20 percent reduction of 1990 levels by 2020, still less than the 25 percent recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel, although the Europeans said they would accept 30 percent if everyone agreed.

The American position is that any targets be enforced by domestic laws rather than international treaties, that they be verifiable and distributed equally. A House bill approaches the European target, but the Senate is expected to dilute it.

But the chances of a final bill's clearing Congress by December are increasingly unlikely, so experts are eagerly waiting to hear what President Obama, who made climate change a key issue in his administration, proposes in his speech on Tuesday.

A speech by President Hu Jintao of China is also widely anticipated, with experts hoping he will announce a significant commitment to renewable energy and emissions reductions in China's next five-year plan. Mr. Hu is the first Chinese president to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly, where leaders will convene Wednesday.

Between them, the United States and China account for about 40 percent of world emissions, split almost evenly, so if the two reach a consensus it will also provide significant impetus for a global agreement.

The United States also suffers from the ""after you"" syndrome, with some Congressional leaders demanding that China agree to reductions before the United States agrees to an overall framework, a formula that experts warn will kill progress.

""We don't want to get hung up on trying to say that the U.S. and China will reduce the same percentage or the same amount,"" said Timothy E. Wirth, the president of the United Nations Foundation and a former Colorado senator who has long been involved in climate negotiations.

Blocs of smaller, poorer nations have their own agendas. The island countries of the Pacific and the Caribbean will be pushing for an even lower temperature ceiling because they fear that the rising seas caused by even a 2-degree rise would drown or severely damage them. The Africans are threatening to walk out of the negotiations if they are not promised $300 billion in aid.

New Zealand objects to the fact that the negotiations have basically ignored agriculture, which accounts for 13 percent to 14 percent of greenhouse gases. Developing nations fear that any regulation of agriculture could deepen the severe problems in feeding their populations.

Such issues, while parochial, may be no less important in building an agreement that works across political borders.

""The instinct is a kind of nationalist response that can get it exactly backwards,"" said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University. ""We should be viewing this as global problem solving, not as global negotiation."""
"Foreign, Sunday, September 20, 2009 961 mots, p. A 14",,Danish Conservative Prepares to Take Reins of Climate Debate,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,,"COPENHAGEN - Connie Hedegaard, Denmark's minister of climate and energy, feels little kinship with the green end of the political spectrum -- people who stage sit-ins at power plants or vote for the Green parties in elections.

""I've never understood why the environment should be a left-wing issue,"" said Ms. Hedegaard, with an exasperated sigh. ""In my view there is nothing as core to conservative beliefs -- that what you inherit you should pass on to the next generation.""

Denmark -- and Ms. Hedegaard -- will play host in December to hundreds of nations that will gather in Copenhagen for the United Nation-sponsored global climate treaty negotiations. The meetings are tasked with finalizing a new global plan to tackle climate change. Ms. Hedegaard, who two years ago offered her city as the site for the negotiations, will be the president and the chairwoman of the 12-day event.

""It's a very, very important job,"" said John Hay, a spokesman for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting that the president of the climate meeting is the one who ""hammers through the deal.""

Ms. Hedegaard, he said, ""fully appreciates that role and is taking it very seriously."" The placement of Ms. Hedegaard, a lifelong conservative, at the center of the preparations reflects in large part the shifting of global environmental issues from the fringe into the political mainstream. A movement whose symbols were fuzzy endangered animals is now more concerned with oil futures and budget sheets.

Unlike Germany, the Netherlands and France, Denmark has never had a Green party, Ms. Hedegaard points out. In fact, she said, she sees herself as an environmentalist in the model of Theodore Roosevelt, a lifelong hunter who campaigned ardently for protecting natural resources.

""People say environment is a soft issue, but it's not,"" she said recently, sitting in her spartan office in a pink sweater and neatly pressed slacks. ""It's about where we get our energy from, about security, about growing economies. I'm a conservative, I worry about that.""

Blunt and no-nonsense, Ms. Hedegaard, 49, has already emerged as a producer, director, arm-twister, therapist and matchmaker for the Copenhagen meetings -- Time magazine this week named her one of the world's 100 most influential people.

In preparation for the December meetings, she is promoting her goals via Twitter and a blog. And though she does not have any official position until the conference opens on Dec. 8, she has spent the last year crisscrossing the globe -- in the last few months alone, she has visited Brazil, India, China, the United States, Mexico and a number of African nations -- urging reluctant countries to pony up and do their share to combat climate change.

Ms. Hedegaard arrived in Washington on Wednesday to attend the Major Economies Forum on Climate Change and to meet with officials in preparation for the Group of 20 summit meeting in Pittsburgh this week. She will then travel to New York for a climate summit meeting convened by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Monday. The Danes, who have been hyperkinetically anticipating the December meetings, are holding their own ""pre-summit"" of environmental ministers just outside New York City this weekend.

Long viewed as something of a wunderkind, Ms Hedegaard was the youngest member of Parliament in Danish history when she was elected in 1984, at age 25. She left politics in 1990 and spent 15 years as a columnist and anchorwoman for Denmark's top news outlets, then returned to government in 2004 as the nation's environment minister.

Although the United Nations has held a big climate meeting each year since 1995, December's gathering is extraordinary for many reasons. The emissions reduction commitments that countries made under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol expire in 2012. And while the Bush administration was seen by many countries as an obstacle to achieving a global accord, President Obama has declared that he wants to be a leader in environment issues.

Ms. Hedegaard views the moment as an opportunity that must be seized.

""Our contribution has been to try to get the parties together before it's too late,"" she said.

Still, hers is a kind of tough-love approach and, like Teddy Roosevelt, she has used her bully pulpit to be extraordinarily blunt about the kinds of concessions she expects, ""putting pressure on all governments to make the political price of being an obstacle so high that no one will pay it,"" she said.

For example, Ms. Hedegaard has expressed impatience with the United States, which has focused on reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the lead heat-trapping gas linked to global warming, by 2050, but has been far less clear about what it intends to do by 2020.

""It's rather crucial that the U.S. can show a credible pathway, and the sooner we get started the more realistic it will be to achieve a goal,"" Ms. Hedegaard said. ""If we postpone, then we'll have such a steep path that it may be hard or impossible to achieve.""

She is quick to point out that the United States emits twice as much carbon dioxide per capita as Denmark, without gaining anything in quality of life.

Ms. Hedegaard would also like fast-developing countries like India and -- especially -- China to commit in some way to limiting their emissions, noting that by 2020 two-thirds of emissions will come from countries now considered developing nations.

""China and other emerging nations must accept it even if it isn't fair,"" she said, adding, ""I get it. If I were a developing country I would say, 'Why should I do this?' They are feeling the consequences of climate change first and foremost. And they didn't create the situation.""

But, she said, ""it's just an arithmetic fact that if China and India continue at the current rate they'll use up the whole global carbon space in a very short time.""

Ms. Hedegaard's no-nonsense style has raised some hackles, and some United Nations officials have said they worry that developing nations might feel strong-armed by her pronouncements, since she is supposed to be a neutral host and is not a negotiator. But some negotiators say they are grateful for the Danish efforts.

""It is entirely appropriate,"" said Todd Stern, lead negotiator for the United States. ""Connie is working hard, as is the prime minister's office.""

Good or bad, any climate agreement that comes out of the December meeting will bear Copenhagen's name. And the tenor of the meetings is likely to reflect Denmark's sober brand of environmentalism. The government has proposed new fines to keep activists in check during the meetings -- $2,000 for breaking through a police cordon or wearing a mask during demonstrations-- and the penalties have angered grass-roots groups.

But the conference, in the end, is not about Denmark, Ms. Hedegaard said.

""Of course we're investing a huge amount in hosting this event and we're working hard for a success,"" she said. ""But Denmark doesn't decide that. The major economies will decide whether it works or not."""
"Foreign, Monday, September 21, 2009 952 mots, p. A 4",,Europeans Say U.S. Lacks Will On Climate,"By JOHN M. BRODER and JAMES KANTER; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and James Kanter from Brussels.",,"WASHINGTON - As world leaders gather in New York for the highest-level conference yet on climate change, European leaders are expressing growing unease about the United States' stance in international talks aimed at reaching a global agreement in Copenhagen in December.

Officials of several European countries have cited what they see as a lack of political will on the part of the United States to adequately address climate change. The American reluctance to accept any agreement that would require legally binding and internationally enforceable targets for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could doom the Copenhagen session, they said.

Ahead of this week's climate talks at the United Nations, the Europeans also expressed little hope that the United States Senate would act on a climate bill before the Copenhagen talks begin. They said the lack of domestic consensus sows doubt about whether the United States can keep any pledges it makes at Copenhagen, either on the level of reductions in global warming emissions or on financial commitments to help developing nations adapt to a changing climate.

Inaction in the Senate also limits the flexibility of America's chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern.

The Obama administration is trying to satisfy European demands for firm targets and timetables, while reassuring a wary Senate that it is not signing on to a system that would impose steep economic costs on the United States that are not shared by developing countries like China and India.

Although the administration and its allies in Congress say they are deeply committed to meaningful action on climate change, they do not want to repeat the experience of Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, when the Clinton administration signed an international agreement that was repudiated by the Senate because it made few demands on the developing world. The United States never ratified the agreement, called the Kyoto Protocol.

John Ashton, the British foreign secretary's special representative for climate change, said several large gaps need to be closed among the major industrialized countries before there could be any hope of success in Copenhagen.

Chief among them, he said, is the ""ambition gap"" between the United States and the nations of the European Union. While the United States discusses the broad outlines of climate policy, the Europeans have already pledged to cut their emissions by 20 percent by 2020, and more deeply if there is an international agreement.

The Europeans say a bill passed by the House in June showed American goodwill but still fell short of the European target and what scientists say is necessary to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius over the planet's temperature early in the Industrial Revolution, which means limiting future changes to about 2 degrees Fahrenheit above current temperatures. This limit is the internationally accepted goal.

The Senate has yet to act, but its targets are likely to be less ambitious.

Mr. Ashton said that the path forward is clear, but that politics are hampering movement in the United States and several other large countries. ""There is no technological obstacle. There is no macroeconomic obstacle,"" said Mr. Ashton, in Washington late last week for a meeting of major industrial countries on climate change. ""The barriers are political.""

John Bruton, the European Commission ambassador to the United States, was less diplomatic in a statement on Thursday.

""The United States is just one of the 190 countries coming to this conference,"" Mr. Bruton said, referring to the Copenhagen meeting in December. ""But the United States emits 25 percent of all the greenhouse gases that the conference is trying to reduce. Is the U.S. Senate really expecting all the other countries to make a serious effort on climate change at the Copenhagen conference in the absence of a clear commitment from the United States?""

Mr. Stern sharply denied an ""ambitions gap"" with the Europeans, but he acknowledged that his bargaining position was limited by what the Senate was willing to accept. He said he would not repeat the mistakes of Kyoto.

""The Europeans have a particularly warm affection for Kyoto, but we don't,"" Mr. Stern said. ""It has been my view from the beginning that unlike what happened in Kyoto we need to have our international and domestic postures in sync, so there is domestic and political support for whatever it is we do. We don't want the cart before the horse this time.""

Mr. Stern added that the Senate was embroiled in a difficult debate on health care and that the administration was moving ahead on its own on a number of climate-related policies, including major new auto efficiency standards.

""It may be that some people on the other side of the pond don't understand the system that well,"" Mr. Stern said with a note of exasperation, ""but that's -- that is the way our system works, and we're pushing ahead.""

Fundamentally dividing the United States and the European Union are questions on how any global climate agreement would be monitored and enforced. The Europeans are committed to a system, similar to that in the Kyoto agreement, under which nations set numerical targets and timetables for emissions reductions, bound together in a global trading scheme and enforced by the United Nations climate change directorate.

The United States instead is now exploring a ""pledge and review"" system, under which individual nations would set their own targets that are, in the jargon, ""measurable, reportable and verifiable"" but enforced by domestic -- not international -- law.

Even as Europeans publicly press the United States to produce firm commitments, they also do not want to be blamed for undermining chances of an agreement by taking an unrealistic stance with the United States.

In recent days, some leaders signaled they could soften their demands.

Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said that he ""could imagine other ways of binding"" nations to their pledges besides a full-blown treaty.

Stavros Dimas, the European Union commissioner for the environment, said he was prepared to use an alternative form of agreement to the Kyoto accord to give the United States the broadest opportunity to join a new agreement in Copenhagen.

""In the United States, you know, Kyoto is a dirty word,"" Mr. Dimas said in an interview on Friday.

Mr. Dimas said those alternatives included amending the Kyoto Protocol, abolishing it or adopting new treaties or protocols tailored to suit different countries.

Mr. Stern said that Australia and South Korea have put forward proposals in recent days that could narrow the gaps between the United States and Europe and also between the industrialized and the developing nations.

The Australian plan sets out a schedule of commitments by all nations to reduce their emissions below a certain baseline level and regularly report progress toward those goals. The South Koreans proposed a registry that would provide a blueprint against which developing countries could track their reductions against a business-as-usual scenario.

All countries, Mr. Stern said, are taking steps now to reduce their emissions.

""It is clearly the case that countries, including the developing countries, are doing a lot at home,"" he said. ""The question is how to capture that in an international agreement."""
"Foreign, Wednesday, September 23, 2009 915 mots, p. A 5",,Proposals Lag Behind Promises On Climate,By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.,,"UNITED NATIONS - World leaders gathered here for a global summit meeting on climate change made modest proposals on Tuesday for combating the problem, underscoring the way domestic political battles still trump what United Nations officials had hoped would be a sense of global urgency.

The negotiations for a new international agreement to curb emissions of greenhouse gases have stalled, making an agreement in Copenhagen by December difficult. In calling the conference, Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, asked heads of state and government both in public and in private to set aside national concerns and become ""global leaders.""

In speech after speech, presidents and prime ministers of countries large and small spoke with soaring promises about the importance of confronting the problem for future generations. But when it came down to the nuts-and-bolts promises of what they were prepared to do in the next decade, experts and analysts were disappointed that there were no bold new proposals, particularly from the United States.

""It was really great to have the vision, but with just 70 days left to Copenhagen, it is time to put some substance on the table,"" said Steve Howard, the founder of the Climate Group, an international organization pushing for a climate change agreement. ""The two most important countries on this issue are being guarded in their positions.""

Those two countries -- the United States and China -- account for more than 40 percent of the carbon emissions, roughly divided between both.

Speaking at the green marble lectern of the General Assembly chamber, President Obama told the audience of some 100 heads of state and government that ""unease is no excuse for inaction.""

China's president, Hu Jintao, spoke of reducing the ""carbon intensity"" of his fast-growing economy, or cutting emissions as a percentage of future economic output, by a ""notable"" margin that he did not specify.

Mr. Obama acknowledged that the United States once played down the issue, but now recognized its gravity. The world ""cannot allow the old divisions that have characterized the climate debate for so many years to block our progress,"" he said, adding that forging consensus would come slowly. ""And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge.""

In a shift of emphasis, Mr. Obama divided developing nations into two categories. The nations with a strong industrial base -- countries like China, India and Brazil, although he did not name them -- would need to accept curbing their emissions in any agreement. But the poorest nations, he said, deserve financial and other aid to tackle current climate problems and future green development.

Mr. Obama said he was committed to having the United States make its largest investment ever in renewable energy, to setting new standards for reducing pollution from vehicles and to making clean energy profitable, among other initiatives.

The United States is considered essential to success in Copenhagen. It never joined the 1997 Kyoto accord, the first major attempt to limit emissions in a global treaty, partly because the accord did not set mandatory targets for powerhouse developing states like China.

In his speech, President Hu of China said his nation would take four steps toward greener development. He said China would reduce the amount of carbon dioxide it emits to produce each dollar of gross domestic product by a ""notable margin"" by 2020 compared with 2005 levels; increase forests by 40 million hectares (about 98.8 million acres); increase nuclear or nonfossil fuels to 15 percent of power by 2020 and work to develop a green economy.

Analysts gave China credit for taking carbon emissions more seriously. Its leaders now accept the need to reduce pollution, partly because their country is vulnerable environmentally and partly because they hope to become leaders in green technology. But Mr. Hu neither defined ""notable"" nor accepted any binding cuts on emissions. He also tied the emissions reduction effort to the growth in China's gross domestic product, so the amount of emissions per dollar of output -- or ""carbon intensity"" -- might shrink, but the overall number could still rise as the economy expanded.

""Developing countries need to strike a balance between economic growth, social development and environmental protection,"" President Hu said.

Todd Stern, the United States envoy for climate change, reflected the general reaction to the Chinese proposal by saying, ""That can be good, but it all depends on what the number is.""

The president of India did not attend, but the country's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, told reporters that the government hoped to enact a series of measures that would curb emissions, including new building codes, limits on deforestation, reductions in greenhouse gases generated by agriculture and increases in renewable sources of energy to 20 percent by 2020 from 8 percent now.

Mr. Ramesh said the lack of specific promises from Mr. Obama should not have been a surprise because like India, the United States is a democracy in which actions depend on popular approval.

The prospect of action by the United States Senate this year appears dim, with Congress mired in the fight over health care and Democrats divided on climate change measures. In late June, the House passed a climate change and energy bill sponsored by two Democratic representatives, Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.

But on the domestic front, even some enthusiastic Obama supporters expressed disappointment that he had not used such an important global pulpit to make a stronger case for both international action and a forceful declaration of what the United States would do.

""We need President Obama to step up and say, 'I need an economywide emissions cap,' "" said Andrew Deutz, director of the Nature Conservancy's international government relations program. "" 'I need money to negotiate. I need Waxman-Markey passed by X date so I can go to Copenhagen and negotiate.' ""

A few leaders did make significant commitments.

Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan, who took office last week, said that his country would seek to cut greenhouse gas levels 25 percent, to 1990 levels, by 2020, and that Japan would provide significant financial and technical aid for green development.

Mohamed Nasheed, the president of Maldives, an Indian Ocean island state threatened with extinction if global warming causes seas to rise, said developing states should commit to mandatory limits. He said his country would commit to being carbon neutral by 2020.

Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, warned that current emissions trajectories were speeding the world toward the panel's worst-case possibilities.

""Science leaves us with no space for inaction now,"" he said."
"Foreign, Wednesday, September 23, 2009 826 mots, p. A 6",,Plateau in Temperatures Adds Difficulty to Task Of Reaching a Solution,By ANDREW C. REVKIN,,"The world leaders who met at the United Nations to discuss climate change on Tuesday are faced with an intricate challenge: building momentum for an international climate treaty at a time when global temperatures have been relatively stable for a decade and may even drop in the next few years.

The plateau in temperatures has been seized upon by skeptics as evidence that the threat of global warming is overblown. And some climate experts worry that it could hamper treaty negotiations and slow the progress of legislation to curb carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.

Scientists say the pattern of the last decade -- after a precipitous rise in average global temperatures in the 1990s -- is a result of cyclical variations in ocean conditions and has no bearing on the long-term warming effects of greenhouse gases building up in the atmosphere.

But trying to communicate such scientific nuances to the public -- and to policy makers -- can be frustrating, they say.

Mojib Latif, a prize-winning climate and ocean scientist from the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Kiel, in Germany, wrote a paper last year positing that cyclical shifts in the oceans were aligning in a way that could keep temperatures over the next decade or so relatively stable, even as the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming continued to increase.

But Dr. Latif, who gives about 200 talks to the public, business leaders and officials each year, said he had been met with confusion and even anger when he tried to describe this normal variation in climate while at the same time conveying the long-term threat of global warming.

""People understand what I'm saying, but then basically wind up saying, 'We don't believe anything,' "" he said in a telephone interview.

Other climate researchers dispute Dr. Latif's forecast, saying that climate cannot be reliably predicted on such a short time scale, though even they agree that sooner or later, cool stretches are inevitable.

Underscoring just how little clarity there is on short-term temperature fluctuations, researchers from Britain's climate change office, in a paper published in August, projected ""an end to this period of relative stability,"" with half the years between now and 2015 exceeding the record-setting global temperatures of 1998.

Whatever the next decade may hold, critics of global warming have lost no time in using the current temperature plateau to build their case.

""I think it supports the arguments of those who've said, 'What's the rush for policy on this issue?' "" said Patrick J. Michaels, a climatologist affiliated with George Mason University and the Cato Institute, a group opposing most regulatory solutions to environmental problems.

The recent stability of global temperatures makes regular appearances in blog postings disputing the reality of global warming and is frequently invoked by pundits who oppose the climate bill that passed the House this year and is pending in the Senate.

Advocates of such regulatory measures are equally vehement. In a post last week on his blog, Climate Progress, Joseph Romm, a physicist and energy expert affiliated with the liberal Center for American Progress, wrote that statements by climate skeptics about planetary cooling were ""nonsense.""

""We need all the unmuffled warnings we can get given that humans are not like slowly boiling frogs, we are like slowly boiling brainless frogs,"" he wrote.

The recent spate of relatively cool years is particularly noticeable because it followed a seesawing from unusually cool temperatures to unusually hot ones in the 1990s, said Vicky Pope of Britain's climate agency, called the Met Office.

The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines had a cooling influence, as the volcano threw off veil-like emissions. Then, in 1998, an El Nino episode in the Pacific Ocean set off a record-setting hot spell.

The global average temperature is now only 0.13 degree Fahrenheit higher than it was in 1999, according to the British meteorology office.

A series of unremarkable storm seasons followed the string of destructive storms in 2004 and 2005 that included Hurricane Katrina. And in the Arctic, an extraordinary summer retreat of sea ice in 2007 has been followed by less substantial losses and projections by some researchers of a possible, if temporary, recovery.

Most climate scientists stand firm in their projections of centuries of rising seas and other disruptive effects of a warming planet if humans take no steps to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases.

In an address to world leaders at the climate summit meeting on Tuesday, Rajendra K. Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has advised the world's nations on climate issues for 20 years, described the mounting risk and said, ""Science leaves us no space for inaction now.""

A clearer view of whether the recent temperature plateau undermines arguments for dangerous climate change in the long run should come in a few years, as the predictions made by the British climate researchers are tested. Their paper appeared in a supplement to an August issue of The Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.

While the authors concluded that there was a 1 in 8 chance of having a decade-long pause in warming like the current plateau, even with rising concentrations of greenhouse gases, the odds of a 15-year pause, they wrote, are only 5 in 100. As a result, the next few years of observations could tip the balance toward further concern or greater optimism.

Meanwhile, social scientists who study the way people understand and respond to environmental problems say it is not surprising that the current temperature stability has created confusion and apathy.

Getting people to care about a climate threat that is decades away is hard enough, they say, without adding in the vagaries of natural climate cycles.

At best, said Robert J. Brulle, a sociologist at Drexel University, global warming remains an abstraction for many people.

""It does not have the direct visual or emotive impact of seeing seabirds covered in oil from the Exxon Valdez oil spill,"" he said."
"Business/Financial, Wednesday, September 23, 2009 398 mots, p. B 2",,Utility Quits Alliance Over Climate Change,By KATE GALBRAITH,,"Amid a growing split in the business community over climate policy, Pacific Gas and Electric, a major California utility, is withdrawing from the United States Chamber of Commerce, citing ""fundamental differences"" with the chamber's approach to global warming.

""We find it dismaying that the chamber neglects the indisputable fact that a decisive majority of experts have said the data on global warming are compelling and point to a threat that cannot be ignored,"" Peter A. Darbee, the chairman of PG&E, wrote in a letter to the chamber.

Excerpts of the letter, written last week, were published on PG&E's blog on Tuesday.

The chamber has been sharply critical of President Obama's efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It has recently threatened litigation if the Environmental Protection Agency does not re-examine its findings on the effects of climate change on the public.

""We have over three million members, and we don't comment on the comings and goings of our membership,"" Eric Wohlschlegel, a spokesman for the chamber, said in response to PG&E's announcement.

PG&E is the latest of a string of corporations to pull out of business organizations because of differences over climate policy.

Duke Energy, a large Southern utility that supports action against global warming, pulled out of the National Association of Manufacturers in December; climate was a partial factor, according to Thomas Williams, a spokesman.

In August, Duke left the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, also citing climate policy. ""It was clear that many influential members would never support climate legislation in 2009 or 2010 no matter how it was written,"" Mr. Williams said in an e-mail message. Alcoa, the aluminum company, also pulled out of the coal coalition this summer, with climate policy being one factor, according to a spokesman.

Mr. Williams added, however, that Duke had no plans to leave the national chamber, saying that it dealt with many issues. The chamber's stance against efforts by the administration and Congress to regulate carbon dioxide, the main gas that causes global warming, has been the subject of vigorous debate in the business community.

The chamber supports reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in principle, but rejects any approach that it believes would drive up the price of energy and send American jobs overseas. Many of the businesses critical of the chamber have embraced the approach taken by the administration and many Democrats in Congress, who want to cap carbon emissions and require businesses to buy permits to exceed the caps.

""We strongly disagree with the chamber's position on climate change legislation and particularly reject its recent theatrics"" in calling for a review of the E.P.A.'s findings, Don Brown, a spokesman for PNM Resources, a New Mexico-based utility holding company, said in an e-mail message. Mr. Brown noted that PNM's chief executive recently stepped down from the chamber's board."
Green Economics,By PAUL KRUGMAN,"If you listen toÊclimateÊscientists -- and despite the relentless campaign to discredit their work, you should -- it is long past time to do something about emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If we continue with business as usual, they say, we are facing a rise in global temperatures that will be little short of apocalyptic. And to avoid that apocalypse, we have to wean our economy from the use of fossil fuels, coal above all.",But is it possible to make drastic cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions without destroying our economy?,,"In what follows, I will offer a brief survey of the economics ofÊclimateÊchange or, more precisely, the economics of lesseningÊ . I'll try to lay out the areas of broad agreement as well as those that remain in major dispute. First, though, a primer in the basic economics of environmental protection.
Environmental Econ 101
If there's a single central insight in economics, it's this: There are mutual gains from transactions between consenting adults. If the going price of widgets is $10 and I buy a widget, it must be because that widget is worth more than $10 to me. If you sell a widget at that price, it must be because it costs you less than $10 to make it. So buying and selling in the widget market works to the benefit of both buyers and sellers. More than that, some careful analysis shows that if there is effective competition in the widget market, so that the price ends up matching the number of widgets people want to buy to the number of widgets other people want to sell, the outcome is to maximize the total gains to producers and consumers. Free markets are ""efficient"" -- which, in economics-speak as opposed to plain English, means that nobody can be made better off without making someone else worse off.
Now, efficiency isn't everything. In particular, there is no reason to assume that free markets will deliver an outcome that we consider fair or just. So the case for market efficiency says nothing about whether we should have, say, some form of guaranteed health insurance, aid to the poor and so forth. But the logic of basic economics says that we should try to achieve social goals through ""aftermarket"" interventions. That is, we should let markets do their job, making efficient use of the nation's resources, then utilize taxes and transfers to help those whom the market passes by.
But what if a deal between consenting adults imposes costs on people who are not part of the exchange? What if you manufacture a widget and I buy it, to our mutual benefit, but the process of producing that widget involves dumping toxic sludge into other people's drinking water? When there are ""negative externalities"" -- costs that economic actors impose on others without paying a price for their actions -- any presumption that the market economy, left to its own devices, will do the right thing goes out the window. So what should we do? Environmental economics is all about answering that question.
One way to deal with negative externalities is to make rules that prohibit or at least limit behavior that imposes especially high costs on others. That's what we did in the first major wave of environmental legislation in the early 1970s: cars were required to meet emission standards for the chemicals that cause smog, factories were required to limit the volume of effluent they dumped into waterways and so on. And this approach yielded results; America's air and water became a lot cleaner in the decades that followed.
But while the direct regulation of activities that cause pollution makes sense in some cases, it is seriously defective in others, because it does not offer any scope for flexibility and creativity. Consider the biggest environmental issue of the 1980s -- acid rain. Emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants, it turned out, tend to combine with water downwind and produce flora- and wildlife-destroying sulfuric acid. In 1977, the government made its first stab at confronting the issue, recommending that all new coal-fired plants have scrubbers to remove sulfur dioxide from their emissions. Imposing a tough standard on all plants was problematic, because retrofitting some older plants would have been extremely expensive. By regulating only new plants, however, the government passed up the opportunity to achieve fairly cheap pollution control at plants that were, in fact, easy to retrofit. Short of a de facto federal takeover of the power industry, with federal officials issuing specific instructions to each plant, how was this conundrum to be resolved?
Enter Arthur Cecil Pigou, an early-20th-century British don, whose 1920 book, ""The Economics of Welfare,"" is generally regarded as the ur-text of environmental economics.
Somewhat surprisingly, given his current status as a godfather of economically sophisticated environmentalism, Pigou didn't actually stress the problem of pollution. Rather than focusing on, say, London's famous fog (actually acrid smog, caused by millions of coal fires), he opened his discussion with an example that must have seemed twee even in 1920, a hypothetical case in which ""the game-preserving activities of one occupier involve the overrunning of a neighboring occupier's land by rabbits."" But never mind. What Pigou enunciated was a principle: economic activities that impose unrequited costs on other people should not always be banned, but they should be discouraged. And the right way to curb an activity, in most cases, is to put a price on it. So Pigou proposed that people who generate negative externalities should have to pay a fee reflecting the costs they impose on others -- what has come to be known as a Pigovian tax. The simplest version of a Pigovian tax is an effluent fee: anyone who dumps pollutants into a river, or emits them into the air, must pay a sum proportional to the amount dumped.
Pigou's analysis lay mostly fallow for almost half a century, as economists spent their time grappling with issues that seemed more pressing, like the Great Depression. But with the rise of environmental regulation, economists dusted off Pigou and began pressing for a ""market-based"" approach that gives the private sector an incentive, via prices, to limit pollution, as opposed to a ""command and control"" fix that issues specific instructions in the form of regulations.
The initial reaction by many environmental activists to this idea was hostile, largely on moral grounds. Pollution, they felt, should be treated like a crime rather than something you have the right to do as long as you pay enough money. Moral concerns aside, there was also considerable skepticism about whether market incentives would actually be successful in reducing pollution. Even today, Pigovian taxes as originally envisaged are relatively rare. The most successful example I've been able to find is a Dutch tax on discharges of water containing organic materials.
What has caught on instead is a variant that most economists consider more or less equivalent: a system of tradable emissions permits, a k a cap and trade. In this model, a limited number of licenses to emit a specified pollutant, like sulfur dioxide, are issued. A business that wants to create more pollution than it is licensed for can go out and buy additional licenses from other parties; a firm that has more licenses than it intends to use can sell its surplus. This gives everyone an incentive to reduce pollution, because buyers would not have to acquire as many licenses if they can cut back on their emissions, and sellers can unload more licenses if they do the same. In fact, economically, a cap-and-trade system produces the same incentives to reduce pollution as a Pigovian tax, with the price of licenses effectively serving as a tax on pollution.
In practice there are a couple of important differences between cap and trade and a pollution tax. One is that the two systems produce different types of uncertainty. If the government imposes a pollution tax, polluters know what price they will have to pay, but the government does not know how much pollution they will generate. If the government imposes a cap, it knows the amount of pollution, but polluters do not know what the price of emissions will be. Another important difference has to do with government revenue. A pollution tax is, well, a tax, which imposes costs on the private sector while generating revenue for the government. Cap and trade is a bit more complicated. If the government simply auctions off licenses and collects the revenue, then it is just like a tax. Cap and trade, however, often involves handing out licenses to existing players, so the potential revenue goes to industry instead of the government.
Politically speaking, doling out licenses to industry isn't entirely bad, because it offers a way to partly compensate some of the groups whose interests would suffer if a seriousÊclimate-change policy were adopted. This can make passing legislation more feasible.
These political considerations probably explain why the solution to the acid-rain predicament took the form of cap and trade and why licenses to pollute were distributed free to power companies. It's also worth noting that the Waxman-Markey bill, a cap-and-trade setup for greenhouse gases that starts by giving out many licenses to industry but puts up a growing number for auction in later years, was actually passed by the House of Representatives last year; it's hard to imagine a broad-based emissions tax doing the same for many years.
That's not to say that emission taxes are a complete nonstarter. Some senators have recently floated a proposal for a sort of hybrid solution, with cap and trade for some parts of the economy and carbon taxes for others -- mainly oil and gas. The political logic seems to be that the oil industry thinks consumers won't blame it for higher gas prices if those prices reflect an explicit tax.
In any case, experience suggests that market-based emission controls work. Our recent history with acid rain shows as much. The Clean Air Act of 1990 introduced a cap-and-trade system in which power plants could buy and sell the right to emit sulfur dioxide, leaving it up to individual companies to manage their own business within the new limits. Sure enough, over time sulfur-dioxide emissions from power plants were cut almost in half, at a much lower cost than even optimists expected; electricity prices fell instead of rising. Acid rain did not disappear as a problem, but it was significantly mitigated. The results, it would seem, demonstrated that we can deal with environmental problems when we have to.
So there we have it, right? The emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is a classic negative externality -- the ""biggest market failure the world has ever seen,"" in the words of Nicholas Stern, the author of a report on the subject for the British government. Textbook economics and real-world experience tell us that we should have policies to discourage activities that generate negative externalities and that it is generally best to rely on a market-based approach.
ClimateÊof Doubt?
This is an article onÊclimateÊeconomics, notÊclimateÊscience. But before we get to the economics, it's worth establishing three things about the state of the scientific debate.
The first is that the planet is indeed warming. Weather fluctuates, and as a consequence it's easy enough to point to an unusually warm year in the recent past, note that it's cooler now and claim, ""See, the planet is getting cooler, not warmer!"" But if you look at the evidence the right way -- taking averages over periods long enough to smooth out the fluctuations -- the upward trend is unmistakable: each successive decade since the 1970s has been warmer than the one before.
Second,ÊclimateÊmodels predicted this well in advance, even getting the magnitude of the temperature rise roughly right. While it's relatively easy to cook up an analysis that matches known data, it is much harder to create a model that accurately forecasts the future. So the fact thatÊclimateÊmodelers more than 20 years ago successfully predicted the subsequent global warming gives them enormous credibility.
Yet that's not the conclusion you might draw from the many media reports that have focused on matters like hacked e-mail andÊclimateÊscientists' talking about a ""trick"" to ""hide"" an anomalous decline in one data series or expressing their wish to see papers byÊclimateÊskeptics kept out of research reviews. The truth, however, is that the supposed scandals evaporate on closer examination, revealing only thatÊclimateÊresearchers are human beings, too. Yes, scientists try to make their results stand out, but no data were suppressed. Yes, scientists dislike it when work that they think deliberately obfuscates the issues gets published. What else is new? Nothing suggests that there should not continue to be strong support forÊclimateÊresearch.
And this brings me to my third point: models based on this research indicate that if we continue adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere as we have, we will eventually face drastic changes in theÊclimate. Let's be clear. We're not talking about a few more hot days in the summer and a bit less snow in the winter; we're talking about massively disruptive events, like the transformation of the Southwestern United States into a permanent dust bowl over the next few decades.
Now, despite the high credibility ofÊclimateÊmodelers, there is still tremendous uncertainty in their long-term forecasts. But as we will see shortly, uncertainty makes the case for action stronger, not weaker. SoÊclimateÊchange demands action. Is a cap-and-trade program along the lines of the model used to reduce sulfur dioxide the right way to go?
Serious opposition to cap and trade generally comes in two forms: an argument that more direct action -- in particular, a ban on coal-fired power plants -- would be more effective and an argument that an emissions tax would be better than emissions trading. (Let's leave aside those who dismissÊclimateÊscience altogether and oppose any limits on greenhouse-gas emissions, as well as those who oppose the use of any kind of market-based remedy.) There's something to each of these positions, just not as much as their proponents think.
When it comes to direct action, you can make the case that economists love markets not wisely but too well, that they are too ready to assume that changing people's financial incentives fixes every problem. In particular, you can't put a price on something unless you can measure it accurately, and that can be both difficult and expensive. So sometimes it's better simply to lay down some basic rules about what people can and cannot do.
Consider auto emissions, for example. Could we or should we charge each car owner a fee proportional to the emissions from his or her tailpipe? Surely not. You would have to install expensive monitoring equipment on every car, and you would also have to worry about fraud. It's almost certainly better to do what we actually do, which is impose emissions standards on all cars.
Is there a comparable argument to be made for greenhouse-gas emissions? My initial reaction, which I suspect most economists would share, is that the very scale and complexity of the situation requires a market-based solution, whether cap and trade or an emissions tax. After all, greenhouse gases are a direct or indirect byproduct of almost everything produced in a modern economy, from the houses we live in to the cars we drive. Reducing emissions of those gases will require getting people to change their behavior in many different ways, some of them impossible to identify until we have a much better grasp of green technology. So can we really make meaningful progress by telling people specifically what will or will not be permitted? Econ 101 tells us -- probably correctly -- that the only way to get people to change their behavior appropriately is to put a price on emissions so this cost in turn gets incorporated into everything else in a way that reflects ultimate environmental impacts.
When shoppers go to the grocery store, for example, they will find that fruits and vegetables from farther away have higher prices than local produce, reflecting in part the cost of emission licenses or taxes paid to ship that produce. When businesses decide how much to spend on insulation, they will take into account the costs of heating and air-conditioning that include the price of emissions licenses or taxes for electricity generation. When electric utilities have to choose among energy sources, they will have to take into account the higher license fees or taxes associated with fossil-fuel consumption. And so on down the line. A market-based system would create decentralized incentives to do the right thing, and that's the only way it can be done.
That said, some specific rules may be required. James Hansen, the renownedÊclimateÊscientist who deserves much of the credit for making global warming an issue in the first place, has argued forcefully that most of theÊclimate-change problem comes down to just one thing, burning coal, and that whatever else we do, we have to shut down coal burning over the next couple decades. My economist's reaction is that a stiff license fee would strongly discourage coal use anyway. But a market-based system might turn out to have loopholes -- and their consequences could be dire. So I would advocate supplementing market-based disincentives with direct controls on coal burning.
What about the case for an emissions tax rather than cap and trade? There's no question that a straightforward tax would have many advantages over legislation like Waxman-Markey, which is full of exceptions and special situations. But that's not really a useful comparison: of course an idealized emissions tax looks better than a cap-and-trade system that has already passed the House with all its attendant compromises. The question is whether the emissions tax that could actually be put in place is better than cap and trade. There is no reason to believe that it would be -- indeed, there is no reason to believe that a broad-based emissions tax would make it through Congress.
To be fair, Hansen has made an interesting moral argument against cap and trade, one that's much more sophisticated than the old view that it's wrong to let polluters buy the right to pollute. What Hansen draws attention to is the fact that in a cap-and-trade world, acts of individual virtue do not contribute to social goals. If you choose to drive a hybrid car or buy a house with a small carbon footprint, all you are doing is freeing up emissions permits for someone else, which means that you have done nothing to reduce the threat ofÊclimateÊchange. He has a point. But altruism cannot effectively deal withÊclimateÊchange. Any serious solution must rely mainly on creating a system that gives everyone a self-interested reason to produce fewer emissions. It's a shame, butÊclimatealtruism must take a back seat to the task of getting such a system in place.
The bottom line, then, is that whileÊclimateÊchange may be a vastly bigger problem than acid rain, the logic of how to respond to it is much the same. What we need are market incentives for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions -- along with some direct controls over coal use -- and cap and trade is a reasonable way to create those incentives.
But can we afford to do that? Equally important, can we afford not to?
The Cost of Action
Just as there is a rough consensus amongÊclimateÊmodelers about the likely trajectory of temperatures if we do not act to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases, there is a rough consensus among economic modelers about the costs of action. That general opinion may be summed up as follows: Restricting emissions would slow economic growth -- but not by much. The Congressional Budget Office, relying on a survey of models, has concluded that Waxman-Markey ""would reduce the projected average annual rate of growth of gross domestic product between 2010 and 2050 by 0.03 to 0.09 percentage points."" That is, it would trim average annual growth to 2.31 percent, at worst, from 2.4 percent. Over all, the Budget Office concludes, strongÊclimate-change policy would leave the American economy between 1.1 percent and 3.4 percent smaller in 2050 than it would be otherwise.
And what about the world economy? In general, modelers tend to find thatÊclimate-change policies would lower global output by a somewhat smaller percentage than the comparable figures for the United States. The main reason is that emerging economies like China currently use energy fairly inefficiently, partly as a result of national policies that have kept the prices of fossil fuels very low, and could thus achieve large energy savings at a modest cost. One recent review of the available estimates put the costs of a very strongÊclimateÊpolicy -- substantially more aggressive than contemplated in current legislative proposals -- at between 1 and 3 percent of gross world product.
Such figures typically come from a model that combines all sorts of engineering and marketplace estimates. These will include, for instance, engineers' best calculations of how much it costs to generate electricity in various ways, from coal, gas and nuclear and solar power at given resource prices. Then estimates will be made, based on historical experience, of how much consumers would cut back their electricity consumption if its price rises. The same process is followed for other kinds of energy, like motor fuel. And the model assumes that everyone makes the best choice given the economic environment -- that power generators choose the least expensive means of producing electricity, while consumers conserve energy as long as the money saved by buying less electricity exceeds the cost of using less power in the form either of other spending or loss of convenience. After all this analysis, it's possible to predict how producers and consumers of energy will react to policies that put a price on emissions and how much those reactions will end up costing the economy as a whole.
There are, of course, a number of ways this kind of modeling could be wrong. Many of the underlying estimates are necessarily somewhat speculative; nobody really knows, for instance, what solar power will cost once it finally becomes a large-scale proposition. There is also reason to doubt the assumption that people actually make the right choices: many studies have found that consumers fail to take measures to conserve energy, like improving insulation, even when they could save money by doing so.
But while it's unlikely that these models get everything right, it's a good bet that they overstate rather than understate the economic costs ofÊclimate-change action. That is what the experience from the cap-and-trade program for acid rain suggests: costs came in well below initial predictions. And in general, what the models do not and cannot take into account is creativity; surely, faced with an economy in which there are big monetary payoffs for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, the private sector will come up with ways to limit emissions that are not yet in any model.
What you hear from conservative opponents of aÊclimate-change policy, however, is that any attempt to limit emissions would be economically devastating. The Heritage Foundation, for one, responded to Budget Office estimates on Waxman-Markey with a broadside titled, ""C.B.O. Grossly Underestimates Costs of Cap and Trade."" The real effects, the foundation said, would be ruinous for families and job creation.
This reaction -- this extreme pessimism about the economy's ability to live with cap and trade -- is very much at odds with typical conservative rhetoric. After all, modern conservatives express a deep, almost mystical confidence in the effectiveness of market incentives -- Ronald Reagan liked to talk about the ""magic of the marketplace."" They believe that the capitalist system can deal with all kinds of limitations, that technology, say, can easily overcome any constraints on growth posed by limited reserves of oil or other natural resources. And yet now they submit that this same private sector is utterly incapable of coping with a limit on overall emissions, even though such a cap would, from the private sector's point of view, operate very much like a limited supply of a resource, like land. Why don't they believe that the dynamism of capitalism will spur it to find ways to make do in a world of reduced carbon emissions? Why do they think the marketplace loses its magic as soon as market incentives are invoked in favor of conservation?
Clearly, conservatives abandon all faith in the ability of markets to cope withÊclimate-change policy because they don't want government intervention. Their stated pessimism about the cost ofÊclimateÊpolicy is essentially a political ploy rather than a reasoned economic judgment. The giveaway is the strong tendency of conservative opponents of cap and trade to argue in bad faith. That Heritage Foundation broadside accuses the Congressional Budget Office of making elementary logical errors, but if you actually read the office's report, it's clear that the foundation is willfully misreading it. Conservative politicians have been even more shameless. The National Republican Congressional Committee, for example, issued multiple press releases specifically citing a study from M.I.T. as the basis for a claim that cap and trade would cost $3,100 per household, despite repeated attempts by the study's authors to get out the word that the actual number was only about a quarter as much.
The truth is that there is no credible research suggesting that taking strong action onÊclimateÊchange is beyond the economy's capacity. Even if you do not fully trust the models -- and you shouldn't -- history and logic both suggest that the models are overestimating, not underestimating, the costs ofÊclimateÊaction. We can afford to do something aboutÊclimateÊchange.
But that's not the same as saying we should. Action will have costs, and these must be compared with the costs of not acting. Before I get to that, however, let me touch on an issue that will become central if we actually do get moving onÊclimateÊpolicy: how to get the rest of the world to go along with us.
The China Syndrome
The United States is still the world's largest economy, which makes the country one of the world's largest sources of greenhouse gases. But it's not the largest. China, which burns much more coal per dollar of gross domestic product than the United States does, overtook us by that measure around three years ago. Over all, the advanced countries -- the rich man's club comprising Europe, North America and Japan -- account for only about half of greenhouse emissions, and that's a fraction that will fall over time. In short, there can't be a solution toÊclimateÊchange unless the rest of the world, emerging economies in particular, participates in a major way.
Inevitably those who resist tacklingÊclimateÊchange point to the global nature of emissions as a reason not to act. Emissions limits in America won't accomplish much, they argue, if China and others don't match our effort. And they highlight China's obduracy in the Copenhagen negotiations as evidence that other countries will not cooperate. Indeed, emerging economies feel that they have a right to emit freely without worrying about the consequences -- that's what today's rich countries got to do for two centuries. It's just not possible to get global cooperation onÊclimateÊchange, goes the argument, and that means there is no point in taking any action at all.
For those who think that taking action is essential, the right question is how to persuade China and other emerging nations to participate in emissions limits. Carrots, or positive inducements, are one answer. Imagine setting up cap-and-trade systems in China and the United States -- but allow international trading in permits, so Chinese and American companies can trade emission rights. By setting overall caps at levels designed to ensure that China sells us a substantial number of permits, we would in effect be paying China to cut its emissions. Since the evidence suggests that the cost of cutting emissions would be lower in China than in the United States, this could be a good deal for everyone.
But what if the Chinese (or the Indians or the Brazilians, etc.) do not want to participate in such a system? Then you need sticks as well as carrots. In particular, you need carbon tariffs.
A carbon tariff would be a tax levied on imported goods proportional to the carbon emitted in the manufacture of those goods. Suppose that China refuses to reduce emissions, while the United States adopts policies that set a price of $100 per ton of carbon emissions. If the United States were to impose such a carbon tariff, any shipment to America of Chinese goods whose production involved emitting a ton of carbon would result in a $100 tax over and above any other duties. Such tariffs, if levied by major players -- probably the United States and the European Union -- would give noncooperating countries a strong incentive to reconsider their positions.
To the objection that such a policy would be protectionist, a violation of the principles of free trade, one reply is, So? Keeping world markets open is important, but avoiding planetary catastrophe is a lot more important. In any case, however, you can argue that carbon tariffs are well within the rules of normal trade relations. As long as the tariff imposed on the carbon content of imports is comparable to the cost of domestic carbon licenses, the effect is to charge your own consumers a price that reflects the carbon emitted in what they buy, no matter where it is produced. That should be legal under international-trading rules. In fact, even the World Trade Organization, which is charged with policing trade policies, has published a study suggesting that carbon tariffs would pass muster.
Needless to say, the actual business of getting cooperative, worldwide action onÊclimateÊchange would be much more complicated and tendentious than this discussion suggests. Yet the problem is not as intractable as you often hear. If the United States and Europe decide to move onÊclimateÊpolicy, they almost certainly would be able to cajole and chivvy the rest of the world into joining the effort. We can do this.
The Costs of Inaction
In public discussion, theÊclimate-change skeptics have clearly been gaining ground over the past couple of years, even though the odds have been looking good lately that 2010 could be the warmest year on record. ButÊclimateÊmodelers themselves have grown increasingly pessimistic. What were previously worst-case scenarios have become base-line projections, with a number of organizations doubling their predictions for temperature rise over the course of the 21st century. Underlying this new pessimism is increased concern about feedback effects -- for example, the release of methane, a significant greenhouse gas, from seabeds and tundra as the planet warms.
At this point, the projections ofÊclimateÊchange, assuming we continue business as usual, cluster around an estimate that average temperatures will be about 9 degrees Fahrenheit higher in 2100 than they were in 2000. That's a lot -- equivalent to the difference in average temperatures between New York and central Mississippi. Such a huge change would have to be highly disruptive. And the troubles would not stop there: temperatures would continue to rise.
Furthermore, changes in average temperature will by no means be the whole story. Precipitation patterns will change, with some regions getting much wetter and others much drier. Many modelers also predict more intense storms. Sea levels would rise, with the impact intensified by those storms: coastal flooding, already a major source of natural disasters, would become much more frequent and severe. And there might be drastic changes in theÊclimateÊof some regions as ocean currents shift. It's always worth bearing in mind that London is at the same latitude as Labrador; without the Gulf Stream, Western Europe would be barely habitable.
While there may be some benefits from a warmerÊclimate, it seems almost certain that upheaval on this scale would make the United States, and the world as a whole, poorer than it would be otherwise. How much poorer? If ours were a preindustrial, primarily agricultural society, extremeÊclimateÊchange would be obviously catastrophic. But we have an advanced economy, the kind that has historically shown great ability to adapt to changed circumstances. If this sounds similar to my argument that the costs of emissions limits would be tolerable, it ought to: the same flexibility that should enable us to deal with a much higher carbon prices should also help us cope with a somewhat higher average temperature.
But there are at least two reasons to take sanguine assessments of the consequences ofÊclimateÊchange with a grain of salt. One is that, as I have just pointed out, it's not just a matter of having warmer weather -- many of the costs ofÊclimateÊchange are likely to result from droughts, flooding and severe storms. The other is that while modern economies may be highly adaptable, the same may not be true of ecosystems. The last time the earth experienced warming at anything like the pace we now expect was during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, about 55 million years ago, when temperatures rose by about 11 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of around 20,000 years (which is a much slower rate than the current pace of warming). That increase was associated with mass extinctions, which, to put it mildly, probably would not be good for living standards.
So how can we put a price tag on the effects of global warming? The most widely quoted estimates, like those in the Dynamic Integrated Model ofÊClimateÊand the Economy, known as DICE, used by Yale's William Nordhaus and colleagues, depend upon educated guesswork to place a value on the negative effects of global warming in a number of crucial areas, especially agriculture and coastal protection, then try to make some allowance for other possible repercussions. Nordhaus has argued that a global temperature rise of 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit -- which used to be the consensus projection for 2100 -- would reduce gross world product by a bit less than 2 percent. But what would happen if, as a growing number of models suggest, the actual temperature rise is twice as great? Nobody really knows how to make that extrapolation. For what it's worth, Nordhaus's model puts losses from a rise of 9 degrees at about 5 percent of gross world product. Many critics have argued, however, that the cost might be much higher.
Despite the uncertainty, it's tempting to make a direct comparison between the estimated losses and the estimates of what the mitigation policies will cost:ÊclimateÊchange will lower gross world product by 5 percent, stopping it will cost 2 percent, so let's go ahead. Unfortunately the reckoning is not that simple for at least four reasons.
First, substantial global warming is already ""baked in,"" as a result of past emissions and because even with a strongÊclimate-change policy the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is most likely to continue rising for many years. So even if the nations of the world do manage to take onÊclimateÊchange, we will still have to pay for earlier inaction. As a result, Nordhaus's loss estimates may overstate the gains from action.
Second, the economic costs from emissions limits would start as soon as the policy went into effect and under most proposals would become substantial within around 20 years. If we don't act, meanwhile, the big costs would probably come late this century (although some things, like the transformation of the American Southwest into a dust bowl, might come much sooner). So how you compare those costs depends on how much you value costs in the distant future relative to costs that materialize much sooner.
Third, and cutting in the opposite direction, if we don't take action, global warming won't stop in 2100: temperatures, and losses, will continue to rise. So if you place a significant weight on the really, really distant future, the case for action is stronger than even the 2100 estimates suggest.
Finally and most important is the matter of uncertainty. We're uncertain about the magnitude ofÊclimateÊchange, which is inevitable, because we're talking about reaching levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere not seen in millions of years. The recent doubling of many modelers' predictions for 2100 is itself an illustration of the scope of that uncertainty; who knows what revisions may occur in the years ahead. Beyond that, nobody really knows how much damage would result from temperature rises of the kind now considered likely.
You might think that this uncertainty weakens the case for action, but it actually strengthens it. As Harvard's Martin Weitzman has argued in several influential papers, if there is a significant chance of utter catastrophe, that chance -- rather than what is most likely to happen -- should dominate cost-benefit calculations. And utter catastrophe does look like a realistic possibility, even if it is not the most likely outcome.
Weitzman argues -- and I agree -- that this risk of catastrophe, rather than the details of cost-benefit calculations, makes the most powerful case for strongÊclimateÊpolicy. Current projections of global warming in the absence of action are just too close to the kinds of numbers associated with doomsday scenarios. It would be irresponsible -- it's tempting to say criminally irresponsible -- not to step back from what could all too easily turn out to be the edge of a cliff.
Still that leaves a big debate about the pace of action.
The Ramp Versus the Big Bang
Economists who analyzeÊclimateÊpolicies agree on some key issues. There is a broad consensus that we need to put a price on carbon emissions, that this price must eventually be very high but that the negative economic effects from this policy will be of manageable size. In other words, we can and should act to limitÊclimateÊchange. But there is a ferocious debate among knowledgeable analysts about timing, about how fast carbon prices should rise to significant levels.
On one side are economists who have been working for many years on so-called integrated-assessment models, which combine models ofÊclimateÊchange with models of both the damage from global warming and the costs of cutting emissions. For the most part, the message from these economists is a sort ofÊclimateÊversion of St. Augustine's famous prayer, ""Give me chastity and continence, but not just now."" Thus Nordhaus's DICE model says that the price of carbon emissions should eventually rise to more than $200 a ton, effectively more than quadrupling the cost of coal, but that most of that increase should come late this century, with a much more modest initial fee of around $30 a ton. Nordhaus calls this recommendation for a policy that builds gradually over a long period the ""climate-policy ramp.""
On the other side are some more recent entrants to the field, who work with similar models but come to different conclusions. Most famously, Nicholas Stern, an economist at the London School of Economics, argued in 2006 for quick, aggressive action to limit emissions, which would most likely imply much higher carbon prices. This alternative position doesn't appear to have a standard name, so let me call it the ""climate-policy big bang.""
I find it easiest to make sense of the arguments by thinking of policies to reduce carbon emissions as a sort of public investment project: you pay a price now and derive benefits in the form of a less-damaged planet later. And by later, I mean much later; today's emissions will affect the amount of carbon in the atmosphere decades, and possibly centuries, into the future. So if you want to assess whether a given investment in emissions reduction is worth making, you have to estimate the damage that an additional ton of carbon in the atmosphere will do, not just this year but for a century or more to come; and you also have to decide how much weight to place on harm that will take a very long time to materialize.
The policy-ramp advocates argue that the damage done by an additional ton of carbon in the atmosphere is fairly low at current concentrations; the cost will not get really large until there is a lot more carbon dioxide in the air, and that won't happen until late this century. And they argue that costs that far in the future should not have a large influence on policy today. They point to market rates of return, which indicate that investors place only a small weight on the gains or losses they expect in the distant future, and argue that public policies, includingÊclimateÊpolicies, should do the same.
The big-bang advocates argue that government should take a much longer view than private investors. Stern, in particular, argues that policy makers should give the same weight to future generations' welfare as we give to those now living. Moreover, the proponents of fast action hold that the damage from emissions may be much larger than the policy-ramp analyses suggest, either because global temperatures are more sensitive to greenhouse-gas emissions than previously thought or because the economic damage from a large rise in temperatures is much greater than the guesstimates in theÊclimate-ramp models.
As a professional economist, I find this debate painful. There are smart, well-intentioned people on both sides -- some of them, as it happens, old friends and mentors of mine -- and each side has scored some major points. Unfortunately, we can't just declare it an honorable draw, because there's a decision to be made.
Personally, I lean toward the big-bang view. Stern's moral argument for loving unborn generations as we love ourselves may be too strong, but there's a compelling case to be made that public policy should take a much longer view than private markets. Even more important, the policy-ramp prescriptions seem far too much like conducting a very risky experiment with the whole planet. Nordhaus's preferred policy, for example, would stabilize the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere at a level about twice its preindustrial average. In his model, this would have only modest effects on global welfare; but how confident can we be of that? How sure are we that this kind of change in the environment would not lead to catastrophe? Not sure enough, I'd say, particularly because, as noted above,ÊclimateÊmodelers have sharply raised their estimates of future warming in just the last couple of years.
So what I end up with is basically Martin Weitzman's argument: it's the nonnegligible probability of utter disaster that should dominate our policy analysis. And that argues for aggressive moves to curb emissions, soon.
The Political Atmosphere
As I've mentioned, the House has already passed Waxman-Markey, a fairly strong bill aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. It's not as strong as what the big-bang advocates propose, but it appears to move faster than the policy-ramp proposals. But the vote on Waxman-Markey, which was taken last June, revealed a starkly divided Congress. Only 8 Republicans voted in favor of it, while 44 Democrats voted against. And the odds are that it would not pass if it were brought up for a vote today.
Prospects in the Senate, where it takes 60 votes to get most legislation through, are even worse. A number of Democratic senators, representing energy-producing and agricultural states, have come out against cap and trade (modern American agriculture is strongly energy-intensive). In the past, some Republican senators have supported cap and trade. But with partisanship on the rise, most of them have been changing their tune. The most striking about-face has come from John McCain, who played a leading role in promoting cap and trade, introducing a bill broadly similar to Waxman-Markey in 2003. Today McCain lambastes the whole idea as ""cap and tax,"" to the dismay of former aides.
Oh, and a snowy winter on the East Coast of the U.S. has givenÊclimateÊskeptics a field day, even though globally this has been one of the warmest winters on record.
So the immediate prospects forÊclimateÊaction do not look promising, despite an ongoing effort by three senators -- John Kerry, Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham -- to come up with a compromise proposal. (They plan to introduce legislation later this month.) Yet the issue isn't going away. There's a pretty good chance that the record temperatures the world outside Washington has seen so far this year will continue, deprivingÊclimateÊskeptics of one of their main talking points. And in a more general sense, given the twists and turns of American politics in recent years -- since 2005 the conventional wisdom has gone from permanent Republican domination to permanent Democratic domination to God knows what -- there has to be a real chance that political support for action onÊclimateÊchange will revive.
If it does, the economic analysis will be ready. We know how to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. We have a good sense of the costs -- and they're manageable. All we need now is the political will."
"National, Wednesday, January 27, 2010, p. A 1",Courts Emerging as Battlefield for Fights OverÊClimateÊChange,By JOHN SCHWARTZ,"Tiny Kivalina, Alaska, does not have a hotel, a restaurant or a movie theater. But it has a very big lawsuit that might affect the way the nation deals withÊclimateÊchange.",,"Blocks of sea ice used to protect the town's fragile coast from October on, but ""we don't have buildup right now, and it is January,"" said Janet Mitchell, Kivalina's administrator. ""We live in anxiety during high-winds seasons.""
The village wants the companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell Oil, and many others, to pay the costs of relocating to the mainland, which could amount to as much as $400 million.
The case is one of three major lawsuits filed by environmental groups, private lawyers and state officials around the nation against big producers of heat-trapping gases. And though the village faces a difficult battle, the cases are gathering steam.
In recent months, two federal appeals courts reversed decisions by federal district courts to dismissÊclimate-change lawsuits, allowing the cases to go forward. In Connecticut, environmental lawyers joined forces with attorneys general of eight states and the City of New York seeking a court order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In Mississippi, Gulf Coast property owners claim that industry-produced emissions that contribute toÊclimateÊchange increased the potency of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
And although a federal judge in Oakland, Calif., dismissed the Kivalina suit in October, the village is appealing the decision.
Tracy D. Hester, who has taught a course inÊclimateÊlawsuits at the University of Houston law school, said that with the issues ""very much in play"" in three circuits of the federal court system, ""the game pieces are being set for eventual Supreme Court review.""
The cases need not even get that far to have an impact, said James E. Tierney, the director of the National State Attorneys General program at Columbia Law School. Kivalina alleged in its complaint that the industry conspired ""to suppress the awareness of the link"" between emissions andÊclimateÊchange through ""front groups, fake citizens organizations and bogus scientific bodies.""
That claim echoes those in suits against the tobacco industry that ultimately led to industry settlements and increased government regulation.
If theÊclimate-change cases even get to the discovery stage, and if the energy industry possesses embarrassing e-mail messages and memorandums similar to those that proved devastating to tobacco companies, Mr. Tierney said, ""it's a hammer"" that could drive industries to the negotiating table.
The cases generally rely on the common-law doctrine of nuisance, the same concept that allows neighbors to sue one another over noises, odors and the like that interfere with the use or enjoyment of property. In the context ofÊclimateÊchange, such cases were once derided as frivolous long shots that would be shot down quickly. Scott H. Segal, a lawyer for energy companies, joked in a 2004 article in Grist magazine that the cases brought ""new meaning to the term 'nuisance lawsuit.' ""
No one is laughing now. In a report issued last year, Swiss Re, an insurance giant, compared the suits to those that led dozens of companies in asbestos industries to file for bankruptcy, and predicted that ""climateÊchange-related liability will develop more quickly than asbestos-related claims.""
The pressure from such suits, the report stated, ""could become a significant issue within the next couple of years.""
The American Justice Partnership, a business-oriented group that is critical of the plaintiffs' bar, argued in a 2008 report that the conspiracy accusations made the Kivalina case ""the most dangerous litigation in America.""
The case could stifle debate overÊclimate-change issues, the report stated, and increase ""the threat of being named as a defendant or co-conspirator subject to invasive and costly inquiry.""
President Obama's senior adviser for energy andÊclimateÊchange, Carol M. Browner, underscored the potential for the suits to affect policy in a briefing with reporters in September. Citing the Connecticut case, Ms. Browner warned that ""the courts are starting to take control of this issue,"" and argued that setting environmental standards ""is best done through legislation.""
She suggested that the situation increased the pressure on Congress to pass legislation to curb heat-trapping gases. The Environmental Protection Agency is drafting regulations on such emissions as dangerous pollutants under the Clean Air Act, an authority confirmed by the 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. E.P.A.
A bill to curb such gases that passed the House last year has not advanced in the Senate. And theÊclimateÊtalks last month in Copenhagen produced little.
That sense of inaction has left a situation in which those intent on reducing gas emissions could try to make the courts ""a significant battleground,"" said Harold Kim, an official in the administration of President George W. Bush who is now senior vice president for reform initiatives at the United States Chamber Institute for Legal Reform.
""This is trending into an area that could be explosive -- for better or for worse, depending on how you look at it,"" Mr. Kim said.
Pat D. Hemlepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power, a defendant in the Connecticut case, said that he could not comment directly on the suit, but that ""our view is that litigation is not the appropriate way to addressÊclimateÊconcerns.""
The company, Mr. Hemlepp said, supports the House bill. ""We are not one of those heels-dug-in, just-say-no companies onÊclimateaction,"" he said.
Matthew F. Pawa, the lawyer who helped organize the Connecticut suit and the Kivalina litigation, said the cases were not about affecting public policy.
""I filed these cases because I expect and want to win in court,"" Mr. Pawa said. ""I'm a litigator, and that's what I do.""
Despite the recent victories,ÊclimateÊlawsuits are still at a preliminary stage. Mr. Segal, the lawyer who made the ""nuisance lawsuit"" joke, said issues like provingÊclimateÊchange, its link to the companies and the further link to the damage ""have not been addressed.""
If the cases go to trial, he said, ""these burdens will be particularly tough in theÊclimateÊcontext.""
A lawyer working with Mr. Pawa in the Kivalina suit, Stephen D. Susman, agreed that the road ahead was uphill.
""The legal landscape is horrible,"" said Mr. Susman, of Houston. ""No lawyer can say this is a way to make money.""
He also said he doubted that the cases would prompt large numbers of class-action suits, since courts would not be likely to allow the formation of a class of litigants among people with such diverse experiences.
Michael B. Gerrard, a professor at Columbia University law school and director of its Center forÊClimateÊChange Law, said the first efforts to sue tobacco companies had appeared to be weak as well.
""They lost the first cases; they kept on trying new theories,"" Mr. Gerrard said, ""and eventually won big."""
"Foreign, Sunday, August 15, 2010, p. A 1","In Weather Chaos, a Case for Global Warming",By JUSTIN GILLIS; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting.,"The floods battered New England, then Nashville, then Arkansas, then Oklahoma -- and were followed by a deluge in Pakistan that has upended the lives of 20 million people.",,"Seemingly disconnected, these far-flung disasters are reviving the question of whether global warming is causing more weather extremes.
The collective answer of the scientific community can be boiled down to a single word: probably.
""TheÊclimateÊis changing,"" said Jay Lawrimore, chief ofÊclimateÊanalysis at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. ""Extreme events are occurring with greater frequency, and in many cases with greater intensity.""
He described excessive heat, in particular, as ""consistent with our understanding of how theÊclimateÊresponds to increasing greenhouse gases.""
Theory suggests that a world warming up because of those gases will feature heavier rainstorms in summer, bigger snowstorms in winter, more intense droughts in at least some places and more record-breaking heat waves. Scientists and government reports say the statistical evidence shows that much of this is starting to happen.
But the averages do not necessarily make it easier to link specific weather events, like a given flood or hurricane or heat wave, toÊclimateÊchange. MostÊclimateÊscientists are reluctant to go that far, noting that weather was characterized by remarkable variability long before humans began burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
""If you ask me as a person, do I think the Russian heat wave has to do withÊclimateÊchange, the answer is yes,"" said Gavin Schmidt, aÊclimateÊresearcher with NASA in New York. ""If you ask me as a scientist whether I have proved it, the answer is no -- at least not yet.""
In Russia, that kind of scientific caution might once have been embraced. Russia has long played a reluctant, and sometimes obstructionist, role in global negotiations over limitingÊclimateÊchange, perhaps in part because it expected economic benefits from the warming of its vast Siberian hinterland.
But the extreme heat wave, and accompanying drought and wildfires, in normally cool central Russia seems to be prompting a shift in thinking.
""Everyone is talking aboutÊclimateÊchange now,"" President Dmitri A. Medvedev told the Russian Security Council this month. ""Unfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this globalÊclimateÊchange, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past.""
Thermometer measurements show that the earth has warmed by about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, when humans began pumping enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. For this January through July, average temperatures were the warmest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Friday.
The warming has moved in fits and starts, and the cumulative increase may sound modest. But it is an average over the entire planet, representing an immense amount of added heat, and is only the beginning of a trend that most experts believe will worsen substantially.
If the earth were not warming, random variations in the weather should cause about the same number of record-breaking high temperatures and record-breaking low temperatures over a given period. But climatologists have long theorized that in a warming world, the added heat would cause more record highs and fewer record lows.
The statistics suggest that is exactly what is happening. In the United States these days, about two record highs are being set for every record low, telltale evidence that amid all the random variation of weather, the trend is toward a warmerÊclimate.
Climate-change skeptics dispute such statistical arguments, contending that climatologists do not know enough about long-range patterns to draw definitive links between global warming and weather extremes. They cite events like the heat and drought of the 1930s as evidence that extreme weather is nothing new. Those were indeed dire heat waves, contributing to the Dust Bowl, which dislocated millions of Americans and changed the population structure of the United States.
But most researchers trained inÊclimateÊanalysis, while acknowledging that weather data in parts of the world are not as good as they would like, offer evidence to show that weather extremes are getting worse.
A United States government report published in 2008 noted that ""in recent decades, most of North America has been experiencing more unusually hot days and nights, fewer unusually cold days and nights, and fewer frost days. Heavy downpours have become more frequent and intense.""
The statistics suggest that the Eastern United States may be getting wetter as the arid West dries out further. Places that depend on the runoff from spring snow melt appear particularly vulnerable toÊclimateÊchange, because higher temperatures are making the snow melt earlier, leaving the ground parched by midsummer. That can worsen any drought that develops.
""Global warming, ironically, can actually increase the amount of snow you get,"" said Kevin Trenberth, head ofÊclimateÊanalysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. ""But it also means the snow season is shorter.""
In general, the research suggests that global warming will worsenÊclimateÊextremes across much of the planet. As in the United States, wet areas will get wetter, the scientists say, while dry areas get drier.
But the patterns are not uniform; changes in wind and ocean circulation could cause unexpected effects, with some areas even cooling down in a warmer world. And long-established weather patterns, like the periodic variations in the Pacific Ocean known as El Nino, will still contribute to unusual events, like heavy rains and cool temperatures in normally arid parts of California.
Scientists say they expect stronger storms, in winter and summer, largely because of the physical principle that warmer air can hold more water vapor.
Typically, a storm of the sort that inundated parts of Tennessee in May, dumping as much as 19 inches of rain over two days, draws moisture from an area much larger than the storm itself. With temperatures rising and more water vapor in the air, such storms can pull in more moisture and thus rain or snow more heavily than storms of old.
It will be a year or two beforeÊclimateÊscientists publish definitive analyses of the Russian heat wave and the Pakistani floods, which might shed light on the role ofÊclimateÊchange, if any. Some scientists suspect that they were caused or worsened by an unusual kink in the jet stream, the high-altitude flow of air that helps determine weather patterns, though that itself might be linked toÊ . Certain recent weather events were so extreme that a few scientists are shedding their traditional reluctance to ascribe specific disasters to global warming.
After a heat wave in Europe in 2003 that killed an estimated 50,000 people, the worst such catastrophe for that region in the historical record, scientists published detailed analyses suggesting that it would not have been as severe in aÊclimateÊuninfluenced by greenhouse gases.
And Dr. Trenberth has published work suggesting that Hurricane Katrina dumped at least somewhat more rain on the Gulf Coast because the storm was intensified by global warming.
""It's not the right question to ask if this storm or that storm is due to global warming, or is it natural variability,"" Dr. Trenberth said. ""Nowadays, there's always an element of both."""
"Foreign, Sunday, November 14, 2010, p. A 1",Reading Earth's Future in Glacial Ice,By JUSTIN GILLIS,"TASIILAQ, Greenland -- With a tense pilot gripping the stick, the helicopter hovered above the water, a red speck of machinery lost in a wilderness of rock and ice.",,"Hanging out the sides of the craft, two scientists sent a measuring device plunging into the water, between ice floes. Near the bottom, it reported a temperature of 40 degrees. It was the latest in a string of troubling measurements showing that the water was warm enough to melt glaciers rapidly from below.
""That's the highest we've seen this far up the fjord,"" said one of the scientists, Fiammetta Straneo.
The temperature reading was a new scrap of information in the effort to answer one of the most urgent -- and most widely debated -- questions facing humanity: How fast is the world's ice going to melt?
Scientists long believed that the collapse of the gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica would take thousands of years, with sea level possibly rising as little as seven inches in this century, about the same amount as in the 20th century.
But researchers have recently been startled to see big changes unfold in both Greenland and Antarctica.
As a result of recent calculations that take the changes into account, many scientists now say that sea level is likely to rise perhaps three feet by 2100 -- an increase that, should it come to pass, would pose a threat to coastal regions the world over.
And the calculations suggest that the rise could conceivably exceed six feet, which would put thousands of square miles of the American coastline under water and would probably displace tens of millions of people in Asia.
The scientists say that a rise of even three feet would inundate low-lying lands in many countries, rendering some areas uninhabitable. It would cause coastal flooding of the sort that now happens once or twice a century to occur every few years. It would cause much faster erosion of beaches, barrier islands and marshes. It would contaminate fresh water supplies with salt.
In the United States, parts of the East Coast and Gulf Coast would be hit hard. In New York, coastal flooding could become routine, with large parts of Queens and Brooklyn especially vulnerable. About 15 percent of the urbanized land in the Miami region could be inundated. The ocean could encroach more than a mile inland in parts of North Carolina.
Abroad, some of the world's great cities -- London, Cairo, Bangkok, Venice and Shanghai among them -- would be critically endangered by a three-foot rise in the sea.
ClimateÊscientists readily admit that the three-foot estimate could be wrong. Their understanding of the changes going on in the world's land ice is still primitive. But, they say, it could just as easily be an underestimate as an overestimate. One of the deans of American coastal studies, Orrin H. Pilkey of Duke University, is advising coastal communities to plan for a rise of at least five feet by 2100.
""I think we need immediately to begin thinking about our coastal cities -- how are we going to protect them?"" said John A. Church, an Australian scientist who is a leading expert on sea level. ""We can't afford to protect everything. We will have to abandon some areas.""
Sea-level rise has been a particularly contentious element in the debate over global warming. One published estimate suggested the threat was so dire that sea level could rise as much as 15 feet in this century. Some of the recent work that produced the three-foot projection was carried out specifically to counter more extreme calculations.
Global warming skeptics, on the other hand, contend that any changes occurring in the ice sheets are probably due to naturalÊclimateÊvariability, not to greenhouse gases released by humans.
Such doubts have been a major factor in the American political debate over global warming, stalling efforts by Democrats and the Obama administration to pass legislation that would curb emissions of heat-trapping gases. Similar legislative efforts are likely to receive even less support in the new Congress, with many newly elected legislators openly skeptical aboutÊclimateÊchange.
A large majority ofÊclimateÊscientists argue that heat-trapping gases are almost certainly playing a role in what is happening to the world's land ice. They add that the lack of policies to limit emissions is raising the risk that the ice will go into an irreversible decline before this century is out, a development that would eventually make a three-foot rise in the sea look trivial.
Melting ice is by no means the only sign that the earth is warming. Thermometers on land, in the sea and aboard satellites show warming. Heat waves, flash floods and other extreme weather events are increasing. Plants are blooming earlier, coral reefs are dying and many other changes are afoot that mostÊclimateÊscientists attribute to global warming.
Yet the rise of the sea could turn out to be the single most serious effect. While the United States is among the countries at greatest risk, neither it nor any other wealthy country has made tracking and understanding the changes in the ice a strategic national priority.
The consequence is that researchers lack elementary information. They have been unable even to measure the water temperature near some of the most important ice on the planet, much less to figure out if that water is warming over time. Vital satellites have not been replaced in a timely way, so that American scientists are losing some of their capability to watch the ice from space.
The missing information makes it impossible for scientists to be sure how serious the situation is.
""As a scientist, you have to stick to what you know and what the evidence suggests,"" said Gordon Hamilton, one of the researchers in the helicopter. ""But the things I've seen in Greenland in the last five years are alarming. We see these ice sheets changing literally overnight.""
Dodging Icebergs
In the brilliant sunshine of a late summer day in southeastern Greenland, the pilot at the controls of the red helicopter, Morgan Goransson, dropped low toward the water. He used the downdraft from his rotor to clear ice from the surface of Sermilik Fjord.
The frigid waters were only 30 feet below, so any mechanical problem would have sent the chopper plunging into the sea. ""It is so dangerous,"" Mr. Goransson said later that night, over a fish dinner.
Taking the temperature of waters near the ice sheet is essential if scientists are to make sense of what is happening in Greenland. But it is a complex and risky business.
The two scientists -- Dr. Straneo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and Dr. Hamilton, of the University of Maine -- are part of a larger team that has been traveling here every summer with financing from the National Science Foundation, the federal agency that sponsors much of the nation's most important research. Not only do they remove the doors of helicopters and lean over icy fjords to get their readings, but they dodge huge icebergs in tiny boats and traipse over glaciers scarred by crevasses that could swallow large buildings.
The reading that the scientists obtained a few weeks ago, of 40 degrees near the bottom of the fjord, fit a broader pattern that researchers have been detecting in the past few years.
Water that originated far to the south, in warmer parts of the Atlantic Ocean, is flushing into Greenland's fjords at a brisk pace. Scientists suspect that as it melts the ice from beneath, the warm water is loosening the connection of the glaciers to the ground and to nearby rock.
The effect has been something like popping a Champagne cork, allowing the glaciers to move faster and dump more ice into the ocean. Within the past decade, the flow rate of many of Greenland's biggest glaciers has doubled or tripled. Some of them have eventually slowed back down, but rarely have they returned to their speed of the 1990s.
Two seismologists, Meredith Nettles and Goran Ekstrom of Columbia University, discovered a few years ago that unusual earthquakes were emanating from the Greenland glaciers as they dumped the extra ice into the sea. ""It's remarkable that an iceberg can do this, but when that loss of ice occurs, it does generate a signal that sets up a vibration that you can record all across the globe,"" Dr. Nettles said in an interview in Greenland.
Analyzing past records, they discovered that these quakes had increased severalfold from the level of the early 1990s, a sign of how fast the ice is changing.
Satellite and other measurements suggest that through the 1990s, Greenland was gaining about as much ice through snowfall as it lost to the sea every year. But since then, the warmer water has invaded the fjords, and air temperatures in Greenland have increased markedly. The overall loss of ice seems to be accelerating, an ominous sign given that the island contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 20 feet.
Strictly speaking, scientists have not proved that human-induced global warming is the cause of the changes. They are mindful that theÊclimateÊin the Arctic undergoes big natural variations. In the 1920s and '30s, for instance, a warm spell caused many glaciers to retreat.
John R. Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who is often critical of mainstreamÊclimateÊscience, said he suspected that the changes in Greenland were linked to this natural variability, and added that he doubted that the pace would accelerate as much as his colleagues feared.
For high predictions of sea-level rise to be correct, ""some big chunks of the Greenland ice sheet are going to have to melt, and they're just not melting that way right now,"" Dr. Christy said.
Yet other scientists say that the recent changes in Greenland appear more pervasive than those of the early 20th century, and that they are occurring at the same time that air and ocean temperatures are warming, and ice melt is accelerating, throughout much of the world.
Helheim Glacier, which terminates in Sermilik Fjord, is one of a group of glaciers in southeastern Greenland that have shown especially big changes.
On a recent day, the red helicopter landed on a rocky outcrop above the glacier, a flowing river of ice about 25 miles long and nearly four miles wide. On the side of the canyon, Dr. Hamilton pointed toward a band of light-colored rock.
It was, in essence, a bathtub ring.
Something caused the glacier, one of Greenland's largest, to speed up sharply in the middle of the last decade, and it spit so much ice into the ocean that it thinned by some 300 feet in a few years. A part of the canyon that was once shielded from the sun by ice was thus left exposed.
The glacier has behaved erratically ever since, and with variations, that pattern is being repeated all over Greenland. ""All these changes are happening at a far faster pace than we would have ever predicted from our conventional theories,"" Dr. Hamilton said.
A few days after the helicopter trip, an old Greenlandic freighter nudged its way gingerly up Sermilik Fjord, which was so choked with ice that the boat had to stop well short of its goal. ""You have to be flexible to work out here,"" said the leader of the team that day, Dr. Straneo of Woods Hole.
Soon she was barking orders, and her team swung into motion. A cold, Arctic drizzle fell on the boat and the people. Off the port side in a rickety skiff, David Sutherland, a young scientist at the University of Washington, tossed a floating buoy, carrying a string of instruments, into the water, and an anchor snatched it below the surface. Over the next year, it will measure temperature, currents and other factors in the fjord.
Dr. Sutherland climbed back aboard the freighter with cold, wet feet. As the boat headed back to port, it passed icebergs the size of city blocks, chunks of the Greenland ice sheet bound for the open sea.
An Ocean in Flux
The strongest reason to think that the level of the sea could undergo big changes in the future is that it has done so in the past.
With the waxing and waning of ice ages, driven by wobbles in the earth's orbit, sea level has varied by hundreds of feet, with shorelines moving many miles in either direction. ""We're used to the shoreline being fixed, and it's not,"" said Robin E. Bell, a scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.
But at all times in the past, when the shoreline migrated, humans either had not evolved yet or consisted of primitive bands of hunter-gatherers who could readily move. By the middle of this century, a projected nine billion people will inhabit the planet, with many millions of them living within a few feet of sea level.
To a majority ofÊclimateÊscientists, the question is not whether the earth's land ice will melt in response to the greenhouse gases those people are generating, but whether it will happen too fast for society to adjust.
Recent research suggests that the volume of the ocean may have been stable for thousands of years as human civilization has developed. But it began to rise in the 19th century, around the same time that advanced countries began to burn large amounts of coal and oil.
The sea has risen about eight inches since then, on average. That sounds small, but on a gently sloping shoreline, such an increase is enough to cause substantial erosion unless people intervene. Governments have spent billions in recent decades pumping sand onto disappearing beaches and trying to stave off the loss of coastal wetlands.
Scientists have been struggling for years to figure out if a similar pace of sea-level rise is likely to continue in this century -- or whether it will accelerate. In its last big report, in 2007, the United Nations group that assessesÊclimateÊscience, the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, said that sea level would rise at least seven more inches, and might rise as much as two feet, in the 21st century.
But the group warned that these estimates did not fully incorporate ""ice dynamics,"" the possibility that the world's big ice sheets, as well as its thousands of smaller glaciers and ice caps, would start spitting ice into the ocean at a much faster rate than it could melt on land. Scientific understanding of this prospect was so poor, theÊclimateÊpanel said, that no meaningful upper limit could be put on the potential rise of sea level.
That report prompted fresh attempts by scientists to calculate the effect of ice dynamics, leading to the recent, revised projections of sea-level rise.
Satellite evidence suggests that the rise of the sea accelerated late in the 20th century, so that the level is now increasing a little over an inch per decade, on average -- about a foot per century. Increased melting of land ice appears to be a major factor. Another is that most of the extra heat being trapped by human greenhouse emissions is going not to warm the atmosphere but to warm the ocean, and as it warms, the water expands.
With the study of the world's land ice still in its early stages, scientists have lately been trying crude methods to figure out how much the pace might accelerate in coming decades.
One approach, pioneered by a GermanÊclimateÊresearcher named Stefan Rahmstorf, entails looking at the past relationship between the temperature of the earth and sea level, then making projections. Another, developed by a University of Colorado glaciologist named Tad Pfeffer, involves calculations about how fast the glaciers, if they keep speeding up, might be able to dump ice into the sea.
Those two methods yield approximately the same answer: that sea level could rise by 2 1/2 to 6 1/2 feet between now and 2100. A developing consensus amongÊclimateÊscientists holds that the best estimate is a little over three feet.
Calculations about the effect of a three-foot increase suggest that it would cause shoreline erosion to accelerate markedly. In places that once flooded only in a large hurricane, the higher sea would mean that a routine storm could do the trick. In the United States, an estimated 5,000 square miles of dry land and 15,000 square miles of wetlands would be at risk of permanent inundation, though the actual effect would depend on how much money was spent protecting the shoreline.
The worst effects, however, would probably occur in areas where land is sinking even as the sea rises. Some of the world's major cities, especially those built on soft sediments at the mouths of great rivers, are in that situation. In North America, New Orleans is the premier example, with large parts of the city already sitting several feet below sea level.
Defenses can be built to keep out the sea, of course, like the levees of the New Orleans region and the famed dikes of the Netherlands. But the expense is likely to soar as the ocean rises, and such defenses are not foolproof, as Hurricane Katrina proved.
Storm surges battering the world's coastlines every few years would almost certainly force people to flee inland. But it is hard to see where the displaced would go, especially in Asia, where huge cities -- and even entire countries, notably Bangladesh -- are at risk.
Moreover, scientists point out that if their projections prove accurate, the sea will not stop rising in 2100. By that point, the ice sheets could be undergoing extensive melting.
""Beyond a hundred years out, it starts to look really challenging,"" said Richard B. Alley, aÊclimateÊscientist at Pennsylvania State University. ""You start thinking about every coastal city on the planet hiding behind a wall, with storms coming.""
A Shortage of Satellites
One Saturday morning a few months back, a University of Colorado student named Scott Potter, sitting in a control room on the Boulder campus, typed a word into a computer.
""GO.""
Over the next 40 seconds, indicators in the control room turned red. Alarms rang. Pagers buzzed. High above the earth, a satellite called ICESat, reacting to Mr. Potter's order, prepared itself to die.
The commotion was expected. Mr. Potter, one of several Colorado students who hold part-time jobs as satellite controllers under professional supervision, was doing the bidding of NASA. His command that day formally ended the ICESat mission, which had produced crucial information about the world's ice sheets for seven years.
At the end of August, two weeks after Mr. Potter sent his order, the remains of ICESat plunged into the Barents Sea, off the Russian coast. Its demise was seen by manyÊclimateÊresearchers as a depressing symbol.
After a decade of budget cuts and shifting space priorities in Washington, several satellites vital to monitoring the ice sheets and other aspects of the environment are on their last legs, with no replacements at hand. A replacement for ICESat will not be launched until 2015 at the earliest.
""We are slowly going blind in space,"" said Robert Bindschadler, a polar researcher at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who spent 30 years with NASA studying ice.
Several federal agencies and two presidential administrations, Democratic and Republican, have made decisions that contributed to the problems.
For instance, an attempt by the Clinton and Bush administrations to combine certain military and civilian satellites ate up $5 billion before it was labeled a ""horrendous and costly failure"" by a Congressional committee.
A plan by President George W. Bush to return to the moon without allocating substantial new money squeezed budgets at NASA.
Now, the Obama administration is seeking to chart a new course, abandoning the goal of returning to the moon and seeking a substantial increase in financing for earth sciences. It is also promising an overall strategy for improving the country's environmental observations.
Major elements of the administration's program won support from both parties on Capitol Hill and were signed into law recently, but amid a larger budget impasse, Congress has not allocated the money President Obama requested.
In the meantime, NASA is spending about $15 million a year to fly airplanes over ice sheets and glaciers to gather some information it can no longer get by satellite, and projects are under way in various agencies to plug some of the other information gaps. NASA has begun planning new satellites to replace the ones that are aging.
""The missions that are being designed right now are fantastic,"" said Tom Wagner, who runs NASA's ice programs.
The satellite difficulties are one symptom of a broader problem: because no scientifically advanced country has made a strategic priority of studying land ice, scientists lack elementary information that they need to make sense of what is happening.
They do not know the lay of the land beneath most of the world's glaciers, including many in Greenland, in sufficient detail to calculate how fast the ice might retreat. They have only haphazard readings of the depth and temperature of the ocean near Greenland, needed to figure out why so much warm water seems to be attacking the ice sheet.
The information problems are even more severe in Antarctica. Much of that continent is colder than Greenland, and its ice sheet is believed to be more stable, over all. But in recent years, parts of the ice sheet have started to flow rapidly, raising the possibility that it will destabilize in the same way that much of the world's other ice has.
Certain measurements are so spotty for Antarctica that scientists have not been able to figure out whether the continent is losing or gaining ice. Scientists do not have good measurements of the water temperature beneath the massive, floating ice shelves that are helping to buttress certain parts of the ice sheet in West Antarctica. Since the base of the ice sheet sits below sea level in that region, it has long been thought especially vulnerable to a warming ocean.
But the cavities beneath ice shelves and floating glaciers are difficult to reach, and scientists said that too little money had been spent to develop technologies that could provide continuing measurements.
Figuring out whether Antarctica is losing ice over all is essential, because that ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea level by nearly 200 feet. The parts that appear to be destabilizing contain water sufficient to raise it perhaps 10 feet.
Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and head of that university's Center for the Environment, praised the scientists who do difficult work studying ice, but he added, ""The scale of what they can do, given the resources available, is just completely out of whack with what is required.""
ClimateÊscientists note that while the science of studying ice may be progressing slowly, the world's emissions of heat-trapping gases are not. They worry that the way things are going, extensive melting of land ice may become inevitable before political leaders find a way to limit the gases, and before scientists even realize such a point of no return has been passed.
""The past clearly shows that sea-level rise is getting faster and faster the warmer it gets,"" Dr. Rahmstorf said. ""Why should that process stop? If it gets warmer, ice will melt faster.""
Temperature Rising: Articles in this series will focus on the central arguments in theÊclimateÊdebate and examine the evidence for global warming and its consequences."

THE WEATHER OF THE FUTURE
Heat Waves, Extreme Storms and Other Scenes From aÊClimate-Changed Planet
By Heidi Cullen
329 pages. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers. $25.99.
Even as Democrats abandoned efforts late last month to advance a majorÊclimateÊchange bill through the Senate, books about global warming continue to pour forth. Two of the more interesting ones do not waste time rearguing debates over the science (in 2007 a United Nations panel, synthesizing the work of hundreds of climatologists from around the world, called evidence for global warming ""unequivocal""), but instead take as a starting point the clear and present dangers posed by the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuels.
""TheÊClimateÊWar,"" by Eric Pooley -- deputy editor of Bloomberg BusinessWeek and former managing editor of Fortune -- looks at the hotly contested politics of global warming, especially as it's been played out in Washington over the last three years. ""The Weather of the Future,"" by Heidi Cullen -- a senior research scientist withÊClimateÊCentral, a nonprofit research organization -- offers a scorching vision of what life might be like in the warmer world that is already on its way.
Although ""Weather of the Future"" sounds like an exercise in speculation, Ms. Cullen grounds her harrowing predictions -- extrapolations, really -- in ""the best available science"" derived from an array ofÊclimateÊmodels, environmental data and interviews with scientists. And her forecasts actually turn out to be an armature for discussing the fallout ofÊclimateÊchange (from rising sea levels to more extreme weather) in an accessible, tactile fashion and for examining existing liabilities in various regions and cities, like overstretched infrastructure and dwindling water supplies.
In what will come as little surprise to Americans suffering through this summer's persistent heat waves, Ms. Cullen notes that the average annual temperature in the United States ""has risen more than two degrees F during the past 50 years, and the temperature will continue to rise, depending on the amount of heat-trapping gases we emit globally.""
By 2050, with midrange emissions, she writes, ""a day so hot that it is currently experienced only once every 20 years would occur every three years over much of the continental United States""; and by the end the century, ""such a day would occur every other year, or more often.""
Because a warmerÊclimateÊmeans more evaporation of water from land and oceans, Ms. Cullen observes, it also results ""in longer and more severe droughts in some areas and more flooding in others."" And because a warmer world means the continued melting of glaciers and polar ice, it leads to rising sea levels -- which threaten places prone to flooding, as well as places vulnerable to sea surges during hurricanes.
In the case of New York City, hotter summers lead to a heavier reliance on air-conditioning, which leads to more stress on an already strained electrical grid. Also at risk, says Rae Zimmerman, a member of the New York City Panel onÊClimateÊChange, is much of the city's critical infrastructure, which sits less than 10 feet above sea level, including the New York entrance to the Holland Tunnel (at 9.5 feet above sea level) and La Guardia Airport (at 6.8 feet above sea level).
As for the Central Valley in California, which is the hub of that state's water supply system, providing water for two out of three Californians, it is vulnerable to the catastrophic failure of its canals and levees, whether from an earthquake or the slowly rising sea level -- much the way New Orleans was vulnerable to flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Cullen adds that global warming is also likely to affect the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which is the ""true basis of California's water system,"" just as it is likely to lead to ""hotter wildfires that are harder to control.""
In many parts of the worldÊclimateÊchange will have serious geopolitical fallout as well. Droughts and floods in Bangladesh, Ms. Cullen says, could result in more and moreÊclimateÊrefugees, even as a growing scarcity of groundwater in northern India could further exacerbate tensions between India and Pakistan. National security experts, she writes, seeÊclimateÊchange as a ""threat multiplier,"" leading to increased tensions between rich and poor nations, and amplifying regional political disputes over access to water and food in times of drought (as has happened, for instance, in Darfur).
Although there were hopes that last year's United Nations talks in Copenhagen would lead to an important accord onÊ , the final document to come out of the summit was a statement of intention, not a binding pledge, to begin taking action on global warming. In the view of many scientists and politicians, the disappointing outcome stemmed partly from the failure of the United States Senate to pass legislation intended to cap American emissions before the summit -- which, in turn, meant that China would not agree to an absolute reduction of its emissions.
In ""TheÊClimateÊWar,"" which ends with the Copenhagen summit, Mr. Pooley gives us a detailed, if sometimes longwinded, account of the political battle to get Congress to take legislative action on global warming. It is a depressing account of gridlock in Washington, of efforts by conservative lobbyists to deny the phenomenon altogether (and when that hasn't worked, to delay any sort of action), and of infighting within the environmental left over whether to compromise and try to get the support of centrists and corporate interests, or whether to take a hard-line, ideological stand. It is a story about how the economic meltdown of 2008 and the ensuing recession -- and concerns about job losses and other short-term costs of establishing a clean-energy economy -- affected the debate over global warming and the political arithmetic that members of Congress and the Obama administration have been doing over the viability ofÊclimateÊchange legislation.
Mr. Pooley tells this story by focusing on a couple of key people: most notably, former Vice President Al Gore, the public face of the antiglobal warming crusade; Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, who ""often forged partnerships with industry and pushed for agreements that the left couldn't stand""; and Mr. Krupp's sometime ally Jim Rogers, chief executive of Duke Energy, who joined other business executives and the leaders of several national environmental groups to form the United StatesÊClimateÊAction Partnership, an organization calling for an economywide solution to global warming and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
In these pages Mr. Pooley deftly explicates the political maneuvering surrounding the controversial concept of ""cap and trade"" (a mandatory and declining limit on carbon emissions, combined with a system of tradable emissions permits) and does a suspenseful job of recounting the walk-up to last year's extremely close vote in the House (219 to 212), passing aÊclimateÊchange bill. Because Senate Democrats decided only two weeks ago (long after this book went to press) that they did not have the votes to pass a broad energy bill including a cap on greenhouse gas emissions, Mr. Pooley's book ends on an unfinished, cliffhanger note.
""In their least guarded moments,"" Mr. Pooley writes, ""theÊclimateÊcampaigners would tell you what they had always known in their bones: their work was necessary but not sufficient.ÊClimateÊaction was going to happen sooner or later, but they couldn't make it happen. It might be inevitable -- the true believers still believed it was -- but it would only become real when enough people demanded it and shouted down the lobbyists and the professional deniers and demanded it again. Alexis de Tocqueville long ago said that in the United States, events 'can move from the impossible to the inevitable without ever stopping at the probable.' Was that still true? How bad did things need to get before the moment came? Would the prospect of a clean-energy economy, and the jobs it would bring, mobilize enough people to make a difference? Or would some sort of monstrous, galvanic weather event -- epic heat and drought, Katrina on steroids -- be needed to shake America fully awake?"""
"Foreign, Tuesday, February 9, 2010, p. A 1",U.N.ÊClimateÊPanel and Its Chief Face a Siege on Their Credibility,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,"Just over two years ago, Rajendra K. Pachauri seemed destined for a scientist's version of sainthood: A vegetarian economist-engineer who leads the United Nations'ÊclimateÊchange panel, he accepted the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the panel, sharing the honor with former Vice President Al Gore.",,"Critics, writing in Britain's Sunday Telegraph and elsewhere, have accused Dr. Pachauri of profiting from his work as an adviser to businesses, including Deutsche Bank and Pegasus Capital Advisors, a New York investment firm -- a claim he denies.
They have also unearthed and publicized problems with the intergovernmental panel's landmark 2007 report onÊclimateÊchange, which concluded that the planet was warming and that humans were likely to blame.
The report, they contend, misrepresents the state of scientific knowledge about diverse topics -- including the rate of melting of Himalayan glaciers and the rise in severe storms -- in a way that exaggerates the evidence forÊclimateÊchange.
With a globalÊclimateÊtreaty under negotiation and legislation pending in the United States, theÊclimateÊpanel has found itself in the political cross hairs, its judgments provoking passions normally reserved for issues like abortion and guns. The panel is charged by the United Nations with reviewing research to create periodic reports onÊclimateÊrisks, documents that are often used by governments to guide decisions, and its every conclusion is being dissected under a microscope.
Several of the recent accusations have proved to be half-truths: While Dr. Pachauri does act as a paid consultant and adviser to many companies, he makes no money from these activities, he said. The payments go to the Energy and Resources Institute, the prestigious nonprofit research center based in Delhi that he founded in 1982 and still leads, where the money finances charitable projects like Lighting a Billion Lives, which provides solar lanterns in rural India.
""My conscience is clear,"" Dr. Pachauri said in a lengthy telephone interview.
The panel, in reviewing complaints about possible errors in its report, has so far found that one was justified and another was ""baseless."" The general consensus among mainstream scientists is that the errors are in any case minor and do not undermine the report's conclusions.
Still, the escalating controversy has led even many of them to conclude that the Nobel-winning panel needs improved scientific standards as well as a policy about what kinds of other work its officers may pursue.
""When I look at Dr. Pachauri's case I see obvious and egregious problems,"" said Dr. Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist and professor of environmental science at the University of Colorado. He said that serving as an adviser to financial companies was inappropriate for the chairman of the United Nations' panel, whether Dr. Pachauri received payment directly or not.
Dr. Pachauri bristles at the accusations, which he says are ""lies"" or ""distortions"" promulgated by groups hoping to undermineÊclimateÊlegislation and a treaty.
""These people want to distort the picture for their own ends,"" Dr. Pachauri said, noting that the report was released two years ago and that the criticisms were only now coming into the limelight. ""What we're doing is not only above-board, but laudable,"" he said. ""These guys want me to resign, but I won't.""
Dr. Pachauri, 69, said the only work income he received was a salary from the Energy and Resources Institute: about $49,000, according to his 2009 Indian tax return, which he provided to The New York Times. The return also lists $16,000 in other income, most of it interest on accounts in Indian banks.
Dr. Pachauri acknowledged his role as an adviser and consultant to businesses, but he said that it was his responsibility as the panel's chairman to disseminate its findings to industry.
Nonetheless, Christopher Monckton, a leadingÊclimateÊskeptic, called the panel corrupt, adding: ""The chair is an Indian railroad engineer with very substantial direct and indirect financial vested interests in the matters covered in theÊclimateÊpanel's report. What on earth is he doing there?""
A former adviser to Margaret Thatcher who also assailed Dr. Pachauri in a critique in Copenhagen that has since been widely circulated, Lord Monckton is now the chief policy adviser to the Science and Public Policy Institute, a Washington-based research and education institute that states on its Web site: ""Proved: There is noÊclimateÊcrisis.""
As the accusations have snowballed in the last six weeks, Dr. Pachauri remains widely admired for his work on the intergovernmental panel, which relies on the collaborative work of hundreds of volunteer scientists to sift through current scientific evidence for its reports. He has served in an elected, unpaid position as chairman of the panel, often known by its initials, I.P.C.C., since 2002.
""There is no evidence that outside interests affected Pachauri's leadership of the I.P.C.C. at all,"" said Hal Harvey, chief executive of ClimateWorks, a foundation based in San Francisco that focuses on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The panel's process is so ""robust and transparent"" that it could not be undercut by ""personalities or errors,"" he said.
He added, ""Anyone who is qualified to chair the I.P.C.C. will have interests in academics, science, politics or business; there are thousands of scientists on the I.P.C.C., and you need their expertise and they all have to come from somewhere.""
Many government panels in the United States tolerate overt conflicts of interest in order to get expert advice, Mr. Harvey said, noting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase on its board.
But most scientific agencies have explicit conflict-of-interest policies to ensure that expert advice is impartial. The Food and Drug Administration, for example, asks doctors who serve on drug advisory panels to disclose payments from pharmaceutical companies and can disqualify those whose financial involvement is too great.
Dr. Pielke, the University of Colorado professor, said the United Nations panel, which has no explicit conflict policy, should do the same, adding, ""You need to make sure that advice is advice and not stealth advocacy.""
Some critics have said that the intergovernmental panel's chairman should be employed full time by the United Nations while in office, and should eschew outside commitments.
The accusations of errors in the panel's report -- most originating from two right-leaning British papers, The Sunday Telegraph and The Times of London -- have sullied the group's reputation. They follow a controversy that erupted late last year over e-mail messages and documents released without authorization from aÊclimateÊresearch center in Britain.
In one case, the report included a sentence that said the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. The sentence was based on a decade-old interview with a glaciologist in a popular magazine; the scientist now says he was misquoted. The panel recently expressed ""regret"" for the error.
The panel was also criticized for citing a study about financial losses after extreme weather events that found an increase in such losses of 2 percent a year from 1970 to 2005. That study had not been peer reviewed at the time, although it was later on.
The panel has called the complaint ""baseless,"" noting that the study was cited appropriately and that other scientific data pointed to a recent rise in severe storms.
Lord Monckton said the incidents reflected a pattern of willful misrepresentation by scientists with financial and professional interests that render them unsuitable to give neutral advice.
In response to the recent criticisms, Dr. Pachauri provided an accounting of some of his outside consulting fees paid to the Energy and Resources Institute. Those include about $140,000 from Deutsche Bank, $25,000 from Credit Suisse, $80,000 from Toyota and $48,750 from Yale. He has recently begun work as a strategic adviser for Pegasus, the investment firm, but has not yet attended a meeting, and no money has yet been paid to the Energy and Resources Institute. He has also provided advice free of charge to groups like the ChicagoÊClimateÊExchange.
The energy institute has financial interests in a number of companies. For example, it was awarded stock by the founders of GloriOil, a start-up based in Houston, in exchange for permission to use a method developed at the institute to extract residual oil from older wells.
""We thought about it long and hard, and decided to get involved in this because the U.S. has the largest number of these wells and it is better than drilling offshore or in Alaska,"" Dr. Pachauri said.
The institute also provides paid consulting. For example, engineers at the institute are designing two Indian solar parks for the ClintonÊClimateÊInitiative. Dr. Pachauri added that research institutes in poorer countries like India could not depend on government largess, as those in the United States did. The institute gets its money from a variety of sources, including the European Union, foundations and private companies.
""We have to generate our own resources from our work,"" he said. ""This is an institute that has pulled itself up by its bootstraps.""
But even some academics who accept thatÊclimateÊchange is a problem are concerned about such activities.
""This is not about whether this is a good person or a good cause; it's about the integrity of the scientific process,"" Dr. Pielke said, adding: ""This has become so polarized, it's like you must be in cahoots with the bad guys if you are at all negative about Pachauri."""
"Editorial, Wednesday, February 17, 2010, p. A 23",OP-ED COLUMNIST,Global Weirding Is Here,By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,,"When you see lawmakers like Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina tweeting that ""it is going to keep snowing until Al Gore cries 'uncle,' "" or news that the grandchildren of Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma are building an igloo next to the Capitol with a big sign that says ""Al Gore's New Home,"" you really wonder if we can have a serious discussion about theÊclimate-energy issue anymore.
TheÊclimate-science community is not blameless. It knew it was up against formidable forces -- from the oil and coal companies that finance the studies skeptical ofÊclimateÊchange to conservatives who hate anything that will lead to more government regulations to the Chamber of Commerce that will resist any energy taxes. Therefore,ÊclimateÊexperts can't leave themselves vulnerable by citing non-peer-reviewed research or failing to respond to legitimate questions, some of which happened with both the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange.
Although there remains a mountain of research from multiple institutions about the reality ofÊclimateÊchange, the public has grown uneasy. What's real? In my view, theÊclimate-science community should convene its top experts -- from places like NASA, America's national laboratories, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford, the California Institute of Technology and the U.K. Met Office Hadley Centre -- and produce a simple 50-page report. They could call it ""What We Know,"" summarizing everything we already know aboutÊclimateÊchange in language that a sixth grader could understand, with unimpeachable peer-reviewed footnotes.
At the same time, they should add a summary of all the errors and wild exaggerations made by theÊclimateÊskeptics -- and where they get their funding. It is time theÊclimateÊscientists stopped just playing defense. The physicist Joseph Romm, a leadingÊclimatewriter, is posting on his Web site, climateprogress.org, his own listing of the best scientific papers on every aspect ofÊ  for anyone who wants a quick summary now.
Here are the points I like to stress:
1) Avoid the term ""global warming."" I prefer the term ""global weirding,"" because that is what actually happens as global temperatures rise and theÊclimateÊchanges. The weather gets weird. The hots are expected to get hotter, the wets wetter, the dries drier and the most violent storms more numerous.
The fact that it has snowed like crazy in Washington -- while it has rained at the Winter Olympics in Canada, while Australia is having a record 13-year drought -- is right in line with what every major study onÊclimateÊchange predicts: The weather will get weird; some areas will get more precipitation than ever; others will become drier than ever.
2) Historically, we know that theÊclimateÊhas warmed and cooled slowly, going from Ice Ages to warming periods, driven, in part, by changes in the earth's orbit and hence the amount of sunlight different parts of the earth get. What the current debate is about is whether humans -- by emitting so much carbon and thickening the greenhouse-gas blanket around the earth so that it traps more heat -- are now rapidly exacerbating nature's natural warming cycles to a degree that could lead to dangerous disruptions.
3) Those who favor taking action are saying: ""Because the warming that humans are doing is irreversible and potentially catastrophic, let's buy some insurance -- by investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency and mass transit -- because this insurance will also actually make us richer and more secure."" We will import less oil, invent and export more clean-tech products, send fewer dollars overseas to buy oil and, most importantly, diminish the dollars that are sustaining the worst petro-dictators in the world who indirectly fund terrorists and the schools that nurture them.
4) Even ifÊclimateÊchange proves less catastrophic than some fear, in a world that is forecast to grow from 6.7 billion to 9.2 billion people between now and 2050, more and more of whom will live like Americans, demand for renewable energy and clean water is going to soar. It is obviously going to be the next great global industry.
China, of course, understands that, which is why it is investing heavily in clean-tech, efficiency and high-speed rail. It sees the future trends and is betting on them. Indeed, I suspect China is quietly laughing at us right now. And Iran, Russia, Venezuela and the whole OPEC gang are high-fiving each other. Nothing better serves their interests than to see Americans becoming confused aboutÊclimateÊchange, and, therefore, less inclined to move toward clean-tech and, therefore, more certain to remain addicted to oil. Yes, sir, it is morning in Saudi Arabia.
Maureen Dowd is off today."
"Editorial, Sunday, February 28, 2010, p. WK 11",OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,We Can't Wish AwayÊClimateÊChange,By AL GORE,,"Of course, we would still need to deal with the national security risks of our growing dependence on a global oil market dominated by dwindling reserves in the most unstable region of the world, and the economic risks of sending hundreds of billions of dollars a year overseas in return for that oil. And we would still trail China in the race to develop smart grids, fast trains, solar power, wind, geothermal and other renewable sources of energy -- the most important sources of new jobs in the 21st century.
But what a burden would be lifted! We would no longer have to worry that our grandchildren would one day look back on us as a criminal generation that had selfishly and blithely ignored clear warnings that their fate was in our hands. We could instead celebrate the naysayers who had doggedly persisted in proving that every major National Academy of Sciences report onÊ  had simply made a huge mistake.
I, for one, genuinely wish that theÊclimateÊcrisis were an illusion. But unfortunately, the reality of the danger we are courting has not been changed by the discovery of at least two mistakes in the thousands of pages of careful scientific work over the last 22 years by the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange. In fact, the crisis is still growing because we are continuing to dump 90 million tons of global-warming pollution every 24 hours into the atmosphere -- as if it were an open sewer.
It is true that theÊclimateÊpanel published a flawed overestimate of the melting rate of debris-covered glaciers in the Himalayas, and used information about the Netherlands provided to it by the government, which was later found to be partly inaccurate. In addition, e-mail messages stolen from the University of East Anglia in Britain showed that scientists besieged by an onslaught of hostile, make-work demands fromÊclimateÊskeptics may not have adequately followed the requirements of the British freedom of information law.
But the scientific enterprise will never be completely free of mistakes. What is important is that the overwhelming consensus on global warming remains unchanged. It is also worth noting that the panel's scientists -- acting in good faith on the best information then available to them -- probably underestimated the range of sea-level rise in this century, the speed with which the Arctic ice cap is disappearing and the speed with which some of the large glacial flows in Antarctica and Greenland are melting and racing to the sea.
Because these and other effects of global warming are distributed globally, they are difficult to identify and interpret in any particular location. For example, January was seen as unusually cold in much of the United States. Yet from a global perspective, it was the second-hottest January since surface temperatures were first measured 130 years ago.
Similarly, even thoughÊclimateÊdeniers have speciously argued for several years that there has been no warming in the last decade, scientists confirmed last month that the last 10 years were the hottest decade since modern records have been kept.
The heavy snowfalls this month have been used as fodder for ridicule by those who argue that global warming is a myth, yet scientists have long pointed out that warmer global temperatures have been increasing the rate of evaporation from the oceans, putting significantly more moisture into the atmosphere -- thus causing heavier downfalls of both rain and snow in particular regions, including the Northeastern United States. Just as it's important not to miss the forest for the trees, neither should we miss theÊclimateÊfor the snowstorm.
Here is what scientists have found is happening to ourÊclimate: man-made global-warming pollution traps heat from the sun and increases atmospheric temperatures. These pollutants -- especially carbon dioxide -- have been increasing rapidly with the growth in the burning of coal, oil, natural gas and forests, and temperatures have increased over the same period. Almost all of the ice-covered regions of the Earth are melting -- and seas are rising. Hurricanes are predicted to grow stronger and more destructive, though their number is expected to decrease. Droughts are getting longer and deeper in many mid-continent regions, even as the severity of flooding increases. The seasonal predictability of rainfall and temperatures is being disrupted, posing serious threats to agriculture. The rate of species extinction is accelerating to dangerous levels.
Though there have been impressive efforts by many business leaders, hundreds of millions of individuals and families throughout the world and many national, regional and local governments, our civilization is still failing miserably to slow the rate at which these emissions are increasing -- much less reduce them.
And in spite of President Obama's efforts at the CopenhagenÊclimateÊsummit meeting in December, global leaders failed to muster anything more than a decision to ""take note"" of an intention to act.
Because the world still relies on leadership from the United States, the failure by the Senate to pass legislation intended to cap American emissions before the Copenhagen meeting guaranteed that the outcome would fall far short of even the minimum needed to build momentum toward a meaningful solution.
The political paralysis that is now so painfully evident in Washington has thus far prevented action by the Senate -- not only onÊclimateÊand energy legislation, but also on health care reform, financial regulatory reform and a host of other pressing issues.
This comes with painful costs. China, now the world's largest and fastest-growing source of global-warming pollution, had privately signaled early last year that if the United States passed meaningful legislation, it would join in serious efforts to produce an effective treaty. When the Senate failed to follow the lead of the House of Representatives, forcing the president to go to Copenhagen without a new law in hand, the Chinese balked. With the two largest polluters refusing to act, the world community was paralyzed.
Some analysts attribute the failure to an inherent flaw in the design of the chosen solution -- arguing that a cap-and-trade approach is too unwieldy and difficult to put in place. Moreover, these critics add, the financial crisis that began in 2008 shook the world's confidence in the use of any market-based solution.
But there are two big problems with this critique: First, there is no readily apparent alternative that would be any easier politically. It is difficult to imagine a globally harmonized carbon tax or a coordinated multilateral regulatory effort. The flexibility of a global market-based policy -- supplemented by regulation and revenue-neutral tax policies -- is the option that has by far the best chance of success. The fact that it is extremely difficult does not mean that we should simply give up.
Second, we should have no illusions about the difficulty and the time needed to convince the rest of the world to adopt a completely new approach. The lags in the globalÊclimateÊsystem, including the buildup of heat in the oceans from which itis slowly reintroduced into the atmosphere, means that we can create conditions that make large and destructive consequences inevitable long before their awful manifestations become apparent: the displacement of hundreds of millions ofÊclimateÊrefugees, civil unrest, chaos and the collapse of governance in many developing countries, large-scale crop failures and the spread of deadly diseases.
It's important to point out that the United States is not alone in its inaction. Global political paralysis has thus far stymied work not only onÊclimate, but on trade and other pressing issues that require coordinated international action.
The reasons for this are primarily economic. The globalization of the economy, coupled with the outsourcing of jobs from industrial countries, has simultaneously heightened fears of further job losses in the industrial world and encouraged rising expectations in emerging economies. The result? Heightened opposition, in both the industrial and developing worlds, to any constraints on the use of carbon-based fuels, which remain our principal source of energy.
The decisive victory of democratic capitalism over communism in the 1990s led to a period of philosophical dominance for market economics worldwide and the illusion of a unipolar world. It also led, in the United States, to a hubristic ""bubble"" of market fundamentalism that encouraged opponents of regulatory constraints to mount an aggressive effort to shift the internal boundary between the democracy sphere and the market sphere. Over time, markets would most efficiently solve most problems, they argued. Laws and regulations interfering with the operations of the market carried a faint odor of the discredited statist adversary we had just defeated.
This period of market triumphalism coincided with confirmation by scientists that earlier fears about global warming had been grossly understated. But by then, the political context in which this debate took form was tilted heavily toward the views of market fundamentalists, who fought to weaken existing constraints and scoffed at the possibility that global constraints would be needed to halt the dangerous dumping of global-warming pollution into the atmosphere.
Over the years, as the science has become clearer and clearer, some industries and companies whose business plans are dependent on unrestrained pollution of the atmospheric commons have become ever more entrenched. They are ferociously fighting against the mildest regulation -- just as tobacco companies blocked constraints on the marketing of cigarettes for four decades after science confirmed the link of cigarettes to diseases of the lung and the heart.
Simultaneously, changes in America's political system -- including the replacement of newspapers and magazines by television as the dominant medium of communication -- conferred powerful advantages on wealthy advocates of unrestrained markets and weakened advocates of legal and regulatory reforms. Some news media organizations now present showmen masquerading as political thinkers who package hatred and divisiveness as entertainment. And as in times past, that has proved to be a potent drug in the veins of the body politic. Their most consistent theme is to label as ""socialist"" any proposal to reform exploitive behavior in the marketplace.
From the standpoint of governance, what is at stake is our ability to use the rule of law as an instrument of human redemption. After all has been said and so little done, the truth about theÊclimateÊcrisis -- inconvenient as ever -- must still be faced.
The pathway to success is still open, though it tracks the outer boundary of what we are capable of doing. It begins with a choice by the United States to pass a law establishing a cost for global warming pollution. The House of Representatives has already passed legislation, with some Republican support, to take the first halting steps for pricing greenhouse gas emissions.
Later this week, Senators John Kerry, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman are expected to present for consideration similar cap-and-trade legislation.
I hope that it will place a true cap on carbon emissions and stimulate the rapid development of low-carbon sources of energy.
We have overcome existential threats before. Winston Churchill is widely quoted as having said, ""Sometimes doing your best is not good enough. Sometimes, you must do what is required."" Now is that time. Public officials must rise to this challenge by doing what is required; and the public must demand that they do so -- or must replace them."
"Obituary, Tuesday, July 20, 2010, p. B 16","Stephen H. Schneider, Climatologist, Is Dead at 65",By DOUGLAS MARTIN; Felicity Barringer contributed reporting.,"Stephen H. Schneider, an influential climatologist who used the results of complex scientific models he developed to become a leader in pressing for action to address global warming, died Monday in London. He was 65.",,"Dr. Schneider wrote books on the effects ofÊclimateÊchange on areas as diverse as politics and wildlife. He advised the administration of every president from Richard M. Nixon to Barack Obama and was part of a United Nations panel onÊclimate change that shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore.
In 2001, Dr. Schneider was found to have mantle cell lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and he applied the same sort of analysis to the disease that he used in his scientific work. He wrote a book four years later when the disease was in remission, ""The Patient From Hell.""
""Am I going to apply to my own treatment the principles that I'm advising government and industries to apply to deal withÊclimate-change uncertainties?"" he asked in a 2005 interview with the National Academy of Sciences, of which he was a member. ""Hell, yes.""
In a statement, Mr. Gore called Dr. Schneider ""a prolific researcher and author, co-founder of the journal Climatic Change and a wonderful communicator"" who greatly contributed ""to the advancement ofÊclimateÊscience.""
In an interview on Monday, the biologist and population expert Paul R. Ehrlich said, ""I don't think anybody has worked harder and longer to educate the public onÊclimateÊissues in particular and science issues in general.""
That human beings release warming gases into the atmosphere has been known since the early 19th century. But in recent years, scientists have employed satellites, computers and other technological means to construct complex mathematical models to predict future changes in temperature.
The resulting consensus -- which Dr. Schneider helped form with models that combine interrelated processes like ocean dynamics and cloud changes -- is that temperatures are rising and that potentially disastrousÊclimateÊchanges could result.
Skeptics have questioned both the science and the need for costly expenditures to stop the predicted warming, like cutting coal consumption. But Dr. Schneider fought so tenaciously for a forceful approach to stop the warming that The New Republic last year called him ""a scientific pugilist.""
He rejected hyperbole, readily conceding that uncertainty was unavoidable in something so complicated and long-term. The conference he had attended in Sweden before his death was partly to discuss howÊclimate-change skeptics use that uncertainty to advance their cause.
But because the costs of global warming -- from the melting of icecaps to the flooding of islands -- is so high, Dr. Schneider maintained, not acting is riskier than acting. He demanded action from national, international and corporate leaders.
His case was buttressed by the ""accumulated preponderance of evidence"" scientists had amassed, he said. In an interview with the magazine American Scientist this year, he said his opponents relied on ""the political chicanery of ideologists and special interests.""
His worry, he told the magazine, was that lobbying and advertising by ""greedy"" corporations would obscure this increasingly clear science. He asked, ""Can democracy survive complexity?""
Stephen Henry Schneider was born in New York City in 1945 and grew up on Long Island, where he made a telescope at age 13 and was thrilled to see the rings of Saturn. At Columbia University, he earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering in 1966, and a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and plasma physics in 1971.
Dr. Schneider was elected to serve on a new student-faculty senate that was established at Columbia after a wave of student demonstrations in 1968. He told the National Academy of Sciences that this experience taught him to strive to see both sides of every question.
""Let's discover our differing value systems, and then look for a foundation of shared values where we might find a way to live together,"" he said.
Dr. Schneider said his decision to become aÊclimateÊscientist was ""a marriage of convenience and deep conviction."" The conviction came from his decision on Earth Day 1970 to devote himself to the environment. The convenience was ample opportunity in theÊclimateÊfield.
""My God, all that low-hanging fruit, all the simple discoveries are waiting to be made in this important field,"" he said.
Dr. Schneider began postdoctoral study at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA, then moved to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. He helped found the agency'sÊclimateÊproject and helped start the journal Climatic Change there. He worked on the impact that nuclear war could have on theÊclimate.
In 1992 he joined the Stanford faculty, where he held several positions. That year he was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, in part for his contributions in communicating scientific information.
As a member of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, established by the United Nations in 1988, Dr. Schneider helped write papers that were influential in framing theÊclimate-change discussion. In sharing the Nobel Peace Prize, the group and Mr. Gore were cited ""for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-madeÊclimateÊchange.""
Global warming skeptics liked to point to an article Dr. Schneider wrote that appeared in the journal Science in 1971 to suggest that he vacillated. In it, he predicted that the futureÊclimateÊdanger could be global cooling, not global warming. He later explained that the cooling forces were regional, while the warming ones were global.
In either case, people were thinking aboutÊclimateÊin more dynamic ways. In an interview with The New York Times the next year, Dr. Schneider paraphrased Mark Twain.
""Nowadays,"" he said, ""everybody is doing something about the weather but nobody is talking about it."""
"Foreign, Tuesday, November 30, 2010, p. A 12",GlobalÊClimate-Change Talks Begin in Cancun With More Modest Expectations,By JOHN M. BRODER; Elisabeth Rosenthal contributed reporting from New York.,"WASHINGTON -- Global talks onÊclimateÊchange opened in Cancun, Mexico, on Monday with the toughest issues unresolved and little expectation of a breakthrough on shaping an international treaty to curb emissions of the heat-trapping gases linked to global warming.",,"The United States entered the talks in a weak position because of a lack of action on domesticÊclimateÊand energy legislation and continuing disputes with China and other major developing nations over verification of emissions reductions. The United Nations negotiating process itself is on the line, with many saying that the 190-nation talks cannot survive another debacle like that at Copenhagen last December.
This year's talks come at a low point for globalÊclimateÊdiplomacy. Last year, more than 100 heads of state gathered with hopes of fashioning a binding treaty to address global warming. A year later, midlevel envoys are trickling into a Mexican resort with hopes, at best, of averting disaster.
Last year, President Obama had large majorities in Congress and hopes of passing a comprehensiveÊclimateÊand energy bill. Next year, he faces a new Congress much more dubious about the reality ofÊclimateÊchange and considerably more hostile to international efforts to deal with it.
Still, leaders expressed belief that the United Nations remained the best, if not the only, place to address a problem that will require a global solution.
""We're not going to solve the whole problem this year, but we can lock in bigger and better agreements every year,"" said Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who took over this year as executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange, the body that convenes the talks. ""Multilateral negotiations such as this one involve not just solving an environmental problem but actually involve the transformation of economic patterns and the economic structure we have lived with for decades.""
The annualÊclimateÊchange conference combines the technical complexity of arms control negotiations with the leaden pace of global trade talks. It attracts thousands of journalists, environmental campaigners and corporate executives, each looking for a story or selling a product.
The actual negotiations tend to take place behind closed doors, where progress is measured in verb tenses and punctuation changes. And nothing of significance seems to happen until the 11th hour of the final day.
This year's conference opened with the same set of issues that the participants left on the table when the meeting in Copenhagen broke up a year ago and the same flawed document -- the Copenhagen Accord -- before them.
At the end of the chaotic talks in Copenhagen, participants failed to adopt the accord, a nonbinding statement of good intentions, but only ""took note"" of the three-page document. About half the participating countries have since agreed to ""associate"" themselves with the accord.
But even if all the promised emissions reductions in the accord were achieved, the world would still fall short of the action needed to meet the goal of keeping global average temperatures within two degrees Celsius of preindustrial times.
Despite a year of preliminary meetings, delegates remain far apart on the two biggest questions: how much and how quickly nations will reduce their emissions ofÊclimate-altering gases and what sort of international monitoring can be established to ensure that countries are meeting their targets. No one expects that the gaps on those issues will be significantly closed over the next two weeks in Cancun.
There has, however, been some progress on the other four major points of discussion at the talks. Those involve slowing the destruction of forests, sharing technology to produce energy in less-destructive ways, helping poorer countries adapt to the inevitable changes to theÊclimateÊand building a multibillion-dollar fund to further these goals.
The goal at Cancun, according to negotiators and observers, would be a ""balanced package"" of progress on each of those issues and an agreement by the wealthier countries to make good on their promise to come up with $30 billion in short-term financing to help developing nations adjust to globalÊclimateÊdisruption.
Jonathan Pershing, the deputy United StatesÊclimateÊenvoy, said Monday in Cancun that while preliminary talks this year had been hung up by disputes over substance and procedure, ""We are optimistic we can work through many, if not all of these.""
He also said that the United States and China had made progress on some issues dividing them and that the United States was prepared to contribute $1.7 billion to the short-term adaptation fund, most of it new money appropriated by Congress.
What remains really difficult, and what most likely will not be resolved at Cancun, is the fate of the 13-year-old Kyoto Protocol, the global warming agreement largely set to expire at the end of 2012. The protocol -- never accepted by the United States -- sets different requirements for developed and developing countries. It has been used as a cudgel by large developing countries like China, India and Brazil to demand more emissions reductions by the United States and other advanced economies as a price for their own participation in any globalÊclimateÊregime.
China has passed the United States as the world's largest emitter of greenhouse pollutants and has voluntarily taken large strides toward slowing the growth of its emissions. But it refuses to be bound to an international agreement that does not require larger, verifiable reductions from the United States and other wealthy countries.
The United States is demanding that the protocol's distinctions among countries be scrapped and that all nations move forward together to attack the problem of globalÊclimateÊchange. Until that fundamental dispute is resolved, the prospects for progress are slim.
""Success here will mean finally discarding Kyoto and beginning the process of requiring major developing countries to cut emissions along with developed countries,"" said Paul W. Bledsoe of the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, who is in Cancun and has followedÊclimateÊdeliberations for years. ""Both substantive and political progress demand that the Kyoto stalking horse be let loose."""
"Foreign, Tuesday, August 31, 2010, p. A 6",Overhaul of U.N.ÊClimateÊPanel Is Urged,By NEIL MacFARQUHAR,"UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations needs to revise the way it manages its assessments ofÊclimateÊchange, with the scientists involved more open to alternative views, more transparent about possible conflicts of interest and more careful to avoid making policy prescriptions, an independent review panel said Monday.",,"Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, has been struggling to make the United Nations the main stage for addressingÊclimateÊchange. Errors in the 2007 assessment report, including a prediction that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035, have threatened to overshadow the United Nations' message thatÊclimateÊchange is a significant threat requiring urgent collective action.
""I think the errors made did dent the credibility of the process,"" said Harold T. Shapiro, a former president of Princeton University and professor of economic and public affairs there. Being more open about the process will help the report withstand the public scrutiny it now endures, Mr. Shapiro, the chairman of the review committee, told a news conference.
Although there is widespread scientific consensus that human activity is heating the planet, critics used the mistakes -- which emerged at the same time as the unauthorized release of hundreds of e-mails from aÊclimateÊresearch center in Britain -- to question all the science involved. The e-mails opened prominentÊclimateÊscientists to charges that they had manipulated some data. Numerous investigations have largely cleared the scientists.
The review committee, which did not evaluate the scientific conclusions made by the United Nations panel, said the way the panel went about its work was ""successful over all.""
The review committee's major recommendation is that, after nearly 20 years of periodic reports produced by scientists volunteering their time, the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange should become a more professional organization, paying salaries to its top management. The panel shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore in 2007.
The committee noted that someÊclimateÊpanel leaders had been criticized for public statements perceived as advocating specific policies. ""Straying into advocacy can only hurt I.P.C.C.'s credibility,"" the report said.
It also suggested that the panel revise the way it rates doubts about some of the science, that the process of choosing the scientists who write the report be more open and that the panel require that any possible conflicts of interest be revealed.
Mr. Pachauri himself has been accused by two British newspapers of profiting from his position by accepting large consulting fees. An independent assessment by KPMG auditors released this month showed that he had, as he claimed, turned over all such fees to a nonprofit organization he founded, the Energy and Resources Institute. The Sunday Telegraph has since apologized to him for the allegations.
The review committee suggested that the top eight officials involved in producing the assessments step down every eight years, hinting that Mr. Pachauri, who has served since 2002, should not direct the fifth assessment report, due in 2013-14.
Asked if he would resign, Mr. Pachauri said that he wanted to see through the reforms but that the ultimate decision lay with the member states. Representatives of the 194 such states that control the panel are scheduled to meet in South Korea in October.
Initial reaction from scientists to the review by the InterAcademy Council, a multinational organization of science academies, was positive. ""These are solid recommendations that people would agree with,"" said Andrew Weaver, a climatologist at the University of Victoria and longtime panel author.
In the review process for the 2007 report, some 90,000 comments were submitted. The overwhelming number contributed to the fact that a scientist's offhand remark in an interview about the Himalayan glaciers made it into the final report, Mr. Shapiro said.
Hans von Storch, aÊclimateÊresearcher at the Institute of Meteorology at the University of Hamburg and a frequent critic of theÊclimateÊpanel who has called on Mr. Pachauri to resign, said past mistakes tended to dramatize the effects ofÊclimateÊchange.
Carrying out the recommendations would make theÊclimateÊpanel much less aloof and help theÊclimateÊchange debate, Dr. von Storch said. He added, ""I am pretty optimistic that all this will lead to a much more rational and cooled-down exchange."""
"Foreign, Tuesday, May 25, 2010, p. A 1",ClimateÊFears Turn to Doubts Among Britons,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,"LONDON -- Last month hundreds of environmental activists crammed into an auditorium here to ponder an anguished question: If the scientific consensus onÊclimateÊchange has not changed, why have so many people turned away from the idea that human activity is warming the planet?",,"A survey in February by the BBC found that only 26 percent of Britons believed that ""climateÊchange is happening and is now established as largely manmade,"" down from 41 percent in November 2009. A poll conducted for the German magazine Der Spiegel found that 42 percent of Germans feared global warming, down from 62 percent four years earlier.
And London's Science Museum recently announced that a permanent exhibit scheduled to open later this year would be called theÊClimateÊScience Gallery -- not theÊClimateÊChange Gallery as had previously been planned.
""Before, I thought, 'Oh my God, thisÊclimateÊchange problem is just dreadful,' "" said Jillian Leddra, 50, a musician who was shopping in London on a recent lunch hour. ""But now I have my doubts, and I'm wondering if it's been overhyped.""
Perhaps sensing thatÊclimateÊis now a political nonstarter, David Cameron, Britain's new Conservative prime minister, was ""strangely muted"" on the issue in a recent pre-election debate, as The Daily Telegraph put it, though it had previously been one of his passions.
And a poll in January of the personal priorities of 141 Conservative Party candidates deemed capable of victory in the recent election found that ""reducing Britain's carbon footprint"" was the least important of the 19 issues presented to them.
Politicians and activists say such attitudes will make it harder to pass legislation like a fuel tax increase and to persuade people to make sacrifices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
""Legitimacy has shifted to the side of theÊclimateÊskeptics, and that is a big, big problem,"" Ben Stewart, a spokesman for Greenpeace, said at the meeting of environmentalists here. ""This is happening in the context of overwhelming scientific agreement thatÊclimateÊchange is real and a threat. But the poll figures are going through the floor.""
The lack of fervor aboutÊclimateÊchange is also true of the United States, where action onÊclimateÊand emissions reduction is still very much a work in progress, and concern about global warming was never as strong as in Europe. A March Gallup poll found that 48 percent of Americans believed that the seriousness of global warming was ""generally exaggerated,"" up from 41 percent a year ago.
Here in Britain, the change has been driven by the news media's intensive coverage of a series ofÊclimateÊscience controversies unearthed and highlighted by skeptics since November. These include the unauthorized release of e-mail messages from prominent BritishÊclimateÊscientists at the University of East Anglia that skeptics cited as evidence that researchers were overstating the evidence for global warming and the discovery of errors in a United NationsÊclimateÊreport.
Two independent reviews later found no evidence that the East Anglia researchers had actively distortedÊclimateÊdata, but heavy press coverage had already left an impression that the scientists had schemed to repress data. Then there was the unusually cold winter in Northern Europe and the United States, which may have reinforced a perception that the Earth was not warming. (Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a United States agency, show that globally, this winter was the fifth warmest in history.)
Asked about his views on global warming on a recent evening, Brian George, a 30-year-old builder from southeast London, mused, ""It was extremely cold in January, wasn't it?""
In a telephone interview, Nicholas Stern, a former chief economist at the World Bank and aÊclimateÊchange expert, said that the shift in opinion ""hadn't helped"" efforts to come up with strong policy in a number of countries. But he predicted that it would be overcome, not least because the science was so clear on the warming trend.
""I don't think it will be problematic in the long run,"" he said, adding that in Britain, at least, politicians ""are ahead of the public anyway."" Indeed, once Mr. Cameron became prime minister, he vowed to run ""the greenest government in our history"" and proposed projects like a more efficient national electricity grid.
Scientists have meanwhile awakened to the public's misgivings and are increasingly fighting back. An editorial in the prestigious journal Nature saidÊclimateÊdeniers were using ""every means at their disposal to undermine science and scientists"" and urged scientists to counterattack. Scientists in France, the Netherlands and the United States have signed open letters affirming their trust inÊclimateÊchange evidence, including one published on May 7 in the journal Science.
In March, Simon L. Lewis, an expert on rain forests at the University of Leeds in Britain, filed a 30-page complaint with the nation's Press Complaints Commission against The Times of London, accusing it of publishing ""inaccurate, misleading or distorted information"" aboutÊclimateÊchange, his own research and remarks he had made to a reporter.
""I was most annoyed that there seemed to be a pattern of pushing the idea that there were a number of serious mistakes in the I.P.C.C. report, when most were fairly innocuous, or not mistakes at all,"" said Dr. Lewis, referring to the report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange.
Meanwhile, groups like the wildlife organization WWF have posted articles like ""How to Talk to aÊClimateÊSkeptic,"" providing stock answers to doubting friends and relatives, on their Web sites.
It is unclear whether such actions are enough to win back a segment of the public that has eagerly consumed a series of revelations that were published prominently in right-leaning newspapers like The Times of London and The Telegraph and then repeated around the world.
In January, for example, The Times chastised the United NationsÊclimateÊpanel for an errant and unsupported projection that glaciers in the Himalayas could disappear by 2035. The United Nations ultimately apologized for including the estimate, which was mentioned in passing within a 3,000-page report in 2007.
Then came articles contending that the 2007 report was inaccurate on a host of other issues, including African drought, the portion of the Netherlands below sea level, and the economic impact of severe storms. Officials from theÊclimateÊpanel said the articles' claims either were false or reflected minor errors like faulty citations that in no way diluted the evidence thatÊclimateÊchange is real and caused by human activity.
Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor at the Potsdam Institute forÊClimateÊImpact Research, successfully demanded in February that some German newspapers remove misleading articles from their Web sites. But such reports have become so common that he ""wouldn't bother"" to pursue most cases now, he added.
The public is left to struggle with the salvos between the two sides. ""I'm still concerned aboutÊclimateÊchange, but it's become very confusing,"" said Sandra Lawson, 32, as she ran errands near Hyde Park."
"Editorial, Monday, July 26, 2010, p. A 23",OP-ED COLUMNIST,Who Cooked The Planet?,By PAUL KRUGMAN,,"Of course, you can't infer trends in global temperatures from one year's experience. But ignoring that fact has long been one of the favorite tricks ofÊclimate-change deniers: they point to an unusually warm year in the past, and say ""See, the planet has been cooling, not warming, since 1998!"" Actually, 2005, not 1998, was the warmest year to date -- but the point is that the record-breaking temperatures we're currently experiencing have made a nonsense argument even more nonsensical; at this point it doesn't work even on its own terms.
But will any of the deniers say ""O.K., I guess I was wrong,"" and supportÊclimateÊaction? No. And the planet will continue to cook.
So why didn'tÊclimate-change legislation get through the Senate? Let's talk first about what didn't cause the failure, because there have been many attempts to blame the wrong people.
First of all, we didn't fail to act because of legitimate doubts about the science. Every piece of valid evidence -- long-term temperature averages that smooth out year-to-year fluctuations, Arctic sea ice volume, melting of glaciers, the ratio of record highs to record lows -- points to a continuing, and quite possibly accelerating, rise in global temperatures.
Nor is this evidence tainted by scientific misbehavior. You've probably heard about the accusations leveled againstÊclimateresearchers -- allegations of fabricated data, the supposedly damning e-mail messages of ""Climategate,"" and so on. What you may not have heard, because it has received much less publicity, is that every one of these supposed scandals was eventually unmasked as a fraud concocted by opponents ofÊclimateÊaction, then bought into by many in the news media. You don't believe such things can happen? Think Shirley Sherrod.
Did reasonable concerns about the economic impact ofÊclimateÊlegislation block action? No. It has always been funny, in a gallows humor sort of way, to watch conservatives who laud the limitless power and flexibility of markets turn around and insist that the economy would collapse if we were to put a price on carbon. All serious estimates suggest that we could phase in limits on greenhouse gas emissions with at most a small impact on the economy's growth rate.
So it wasn't the science, the scientists, or the economics that killed action onÊclimateÊchange. What was it?
The answer is, the usual suspects: greed and cowardice.
If you want to understand opposition toÊclimateÊaction, follow the money. The economy as a whole wouldn't be significantly hurt if we put a price on carbon, but certain industries -- above all, the coal and oil industries -- would. And those industries have mounted a huge disinformation campaign to protect their bottom lines.
Look at the scientists who question the consensus onÊclimateÊchange; look at the organizations pushing fake scandals; look at the think tanks claiming that any effort to limit emissions would cripple the economy. Again and again, you'll find that they're on the receiving end of a pipeline of funding that starts with big energy companies, like Exxon Mobil, which has spent tens of millions of dollars promotingÊclimate-change denial, or Koch Industries, which has been sponsoring anti-environmental organizations for two decades.
Or look at the politicians who have been most vociferously opposed toÊclimateÊaction. Where do they get much of their campaign money? You already know the answer.
By itself, however, greed wouldn't have triumphed. It needed the aid of cowardice -- above all, the cowardice of politicians who know how big a threat global warming poses, who supported action in the past, but who deserted their posts at the crucial moment.
There are a number of suchÊclimateÊcowards, but let me single out one in particular: Senator John McCain.
There was a time when Mr. McCain was considered a friend of the environment. Back in 2003 he burnished his maverick image by co-sponsoring legislation that would have created a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions. He reaffirmed support for such a system during his presidential campaign, and things might look very different now if he had continued to backÊclimateÊaction once his opponent was in the White House. But he didn't -- and it's hard to see his switch as anything other than the act of a man willing to sacrifice his principles, and humanity's future, for the sake of a few years added to his political career.
Alas, Mr. McCain wasn't alone; and there will be noÊclimateÊbill. Greed, aided by cowardice, has triumphed. And the whole world will pay the price."

""It's a flat-out lie,"" Mr. Dennison said in an interview after the debate, adding that he had based his view on the preaching of Rush Limbaugh and the teaching of Scripture. ""I read my Bible,"" Mr. Dennison said. ""He made this earth for us to utilize.""
Skepticism and outright denial of global warming are among the articles of faith of the Tea Party movement, here in Indiana and across the country. For some, it is a matter of religious conviction; for others, it is driven by distrust of those they call the elites. And for others still, efforts to addressÊclimateÊchange are seen as a conspiracy to impose world government and a sweeping redistribution of wealth. But all are wary of the Obama administration's plans to regulate carbon dioxide, a ubiquitous gas, which will require the expansion of government authority into nearly every corner of the economy.
""This so-calledÊclimateÊscience is just ridiculous,"" said Kelly Khuri, founder of the Clark County Tea Party Patriots. ""I think it's all cyclical.""
""Carbon regulation, cap and trade, it's all just a money-control avenue,"" Ms. Khuri added. ""Some people say I'm extreme, but they said the John Birch Society was extreme, too.""
Whatever the party composition of the next Congress, cap and trade is likely dead for the foreseeable future. If dozens of new RepublicanÊclimateÊskeptics are swept into Congress, the prospects for assertive federal action to control global warming gases, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, will grow dimmer than they already are.
Those who support the Tea Party movement are considerably more dubious about the existence and effects of global warming than the American public at large, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted this month. The survey found that only 14 percent of Tea Party supporters said that global warming is an environmental problem that is having an effect now, while 49 percent of the rest of the public believes that it is. More than half of Tea Party supporters said that global warming would have no serious effect at any time in the future, while only 15 percent of other Americans share that view, the poll found.
And 8 percent of Tea Party adherents volunteered that they did not believe global warming exists at all, while only 1 percent of other respondents agreed.
Those views in general align with those of the fossil fuel industries, which have for decades waged a concerted campaign to raise doubts about the science of global warming and to undermine policies devised to address it.
They have created and lavishly financed institutes to produce anti-global-warming studies, paid for rallies and Web sites to question the science, and generated scores of economic analyses that purport to show that policies to reduce emissions ofÊclimate-altering gases will have a devastating effect on jobs and the overall economy.
Their views are spread by a number of widely followed conservative opinion leaders, including Mr. Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, George Will and Sarah Palin, who oppose government programs to addressÊclimateÊchange and who question the credibility and motives of the scientists who have raised alarms about it.
Groups that help support Tea Party candidates includeÊclimateÊchange skepticism in their core message. Americans for Prosperity, a group founded and largely financed by oil industry interests, has sponsored what it calls a Regulation Reality Tour to stir up opposition toÊclimateÊchange legislation and federal regulation of carbon emissions. Its Tea Party talking points describe a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions as ""the largest excise tax in history.""
FreedomWorks, another group supported by the oil industry, helps organize Tea Party rallies and distributes fliers urging opposition to federalÊclimateÊpolicy, which it calls a ""power grab.""
""Any effort to make electricity and fuel more expensive or to cap or regulate CO2 will only exacerbate an already critical situation and cause tremendous economic damage,"" FreedomWorks says on its Web site.
The oil, coal and utility industries have collectively spent $500 million just since the beginning of 2009 to lobby against legislation to addressÊclimateÊchange and to defeat candidates, like Mr. Hill, who support it, according to a new analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a left-leaning advocacy group in Washington.
Their message appears to have fallen on receptive ears. Of the 20 Republican Senate candidates in contested races, 19 question the science of global warming and oppose any comprehensive legislation to deal with it, according to a National Journal survey.
The only exception is Mark Steven Kirk, the Republican Senate nominee in Illinois, who was one of only eight Republicans to vote for the House cap-and-trade bill sponsored by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats. (One of the other Republican ""yes"" votes was cast by Representative Michael N. Castle of Delaware, who blames that vote in part for his primary election defeat by Christine O'Donnell, the Tea Party candidate and a global warming skeptic.)
A large majority of Tea Party-supported House candidates also doubt global warming science and oppose energy legislation designed to address it.
Mr. Young, the Indiana Republican nominee trying to unseat Mr. Hill for the Ninth Congressional District seat, strongly opposes cap and trade and other unilateral measures to combat global warming. He says he is uncertain what is causing the observed heating of the planet, adding that it could be caused by sunspots or the normal cycles of nature.
""The science is not settled,"" he said in an interview in his headquarters in Bloomington, Ind. And he said that given the scientific uncertainty, it was not wise to make major changes in the nation's energy economy to reduce carbon emissions.
A third candidate in the Indiana Congressional race, Greg Knott, a libertarian, said he accepted the scientific consensus onÊ  but opposed a nationwide cap-and-trade system as the answer.
Lisa Deaton, a small-business owner in Columbus, Ind., who started We the People Indiana, a Tea Party affiliate, is supporting Mr. Young in part because of his stand againstÊclimateÊchange legislation.
""They're trying to use global warming against the people,"" Ms. Deaton said. ""It takes way our liberty.""
""Being a strong Christian,"" she added, ""I cannot help but believe the Lord placed a lot of minerals in our country and it's not there to destroy us."""
"Foreign, Friday, October 8, 2010, p. A 9",Poor Prospects for NewÊClimateÊMeeting,"By JOHN M. BRODER and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Elisabeth Rosenthal from New York and Lisbon.","WASHINGTON -- With wounds still raw from the chaotic United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen last December, negotiators are making final preparations for next month's meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in a surly mood and with little hope for progress.",,"Delegates in Tianjin, China, at the last formal meeting before the Cancun conference opens Nov. 29, are hung up over the same issues that caused the collapse of the Copenhagen meeting. Even some of the baby steps in the weak agreement that emerged from last year's meeting, a slender document known as the Copenhagen Accord, have been reopened, to the dismay of officials who thought they had been settled.
Agreement on critical issues like short-term financial aid for vulnerable countries and monitoring and reporting of emissions by major economies appears even farther away than it was at the end of the Copenhagen meeting. At Copenhagen, wealthy countries pledged to raise $100 billion over the next decade to help the developing world respond toÊclimateÊchange, with $30 billion in ""fast start"" financing available by 2012. But that money has barely started to flow, and many developing nations are pressing rich countries to raise the ante, an unlikely prospect.
""What is frustrating in these negotiations is to see countries not using that as the basis but relitigating things that we resolved over the course of the Copenhagen negotiations,"" said Jonathan Pershing, the deputy United States envoy forÊclimateÊchange, who is attending the Tianjin meeting.
The conflict is following the familiar lines that led to the crackup in Copenhagen. Wealthy countries are insisting on deep and verifiable cuts in emissions from major developing countries like China and India, while the poorer nations are asking the rich countries to do more to reduce their own pollution and come up with more money to help the rest of the world adapt to the changes wrought by a century of unchecked carbon gases from the industrialized world.
Developing-country negotiators continually chide American officials for the failure of the United States to enact any sort of comprehensiveÊclimateÊand energy legislation.
China's top global warming negotiator, Xie Zhenhua, complained in Tianjin on Wednesday that developed nations were not living up to their own commitments while demanding more from the poorer countries. ""The commitments made so far are far from what we expected,"" The Associated Press quoted him as saying. ""We hope they can make dramatic reductions.""
So, after 16 years of annualÊclimateÊtreaty negotiations, negotiators heading for this meeting, the 16th United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange ""conference of the parties"" or COP-16, are hoping not for progress but merely to avoid going backward.
""What we will be working to secure is that we should not start backsliding,"" said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's minister forÊclimateÊaction.
What is important this year, she said, is to ""secure some momentum"" with agreements on less contentious topics like how to preserve the world's forests and to renew the commitments made in the voluntary Copenhagen Accord.
The mood could hardly be more different than it was just a year ago when more than 100 heads of state rearranged Christmas schedules to attend the Copenhagen conference, where some had anticipated the adoption of an internationalÊclimateÊtreaty that would commit richer countries to reduce their emissions and provide poorer countries with financial and technical help to face the impact ofÊclimateÊchange. Instead, the meetings spectacularly fell apart under the glare of spotlights and with high-profile friction between rich and poor nations.
No such drama is on the program this year.
Todd Stern, the chief AmericanÊclimateÊnegotiator, acknowledged that some countries were trying to pull back from promises made in Copenhagen. He insisted that the Obama administration stood by its international commitment to reduce emissions by 17 percent by 2020 despite the lack of action in Congress. Still, he added, ""What's important is not to have expectations that are not realistic. We are committed to making the U.N.F.C.C.C. process work. But it is a difficult process.""
After the Copenhagen meeting, Mr. Stern and others raised questions about whether the United Nations was the forum for dealing with such issues. They have quietly explored options involving far fewer countries and tackling the difficult pieces of aÊclimateÊdeal separately rather than as one grand package. But no one is quite ready to pull the plug on the global talks -- yet.
Many diplomats who have long been involved in the process talk about Cancun as a meeting needed for ""healing"" and ""reassurance"" to countries that had lost faith in the treaty process.
""It's very important that you get back on the bicycle and get it moving and that it doesn't fall over again,"" said John Ashton, Britain's special representative forÊclimateÊchange. ""We have to make progress on a few fronts without overreaching: we won't be able to get over the finishing line at Cancun. The task there is to rebuild momentum and confidence.""
Still, he and others maintain that some of the principles in the Copenhagen Accord are significant. ""I was disappointed by the utter chaos that surrounded the end of the meeting -- you could write a half dozen Ph.D.'s about what happened there,"" said Yvo DeBoer, the United Nations official who ran the Copenhagen meeting and now works as a business consultant for the consulting firm KPMG. ""But we have $100 million in finance. Major emitters came up with targets. We had 130 heads of states in attendance to show they take this seriously.""
While Obama administration officials are reaffirming the president's 17 percent emissions target, they are not sure how to get there.
""I would have loved to have legislation done now so I'd have something to show,"" Mr. Stern said in an interview. ""There is legislation, regulation, research and development, a whole suite of actions we are taking to reduce emissions. We'll get there. This is the first year of a 10-year effort.""
Mr. Stern said that countries had to understand that the United States was not the only country having trouble finding the political will to act onÊclimateÊchange.
""Add to this reality that here, as in so many areas of public life, it is far easier -- far easier -- to stop something from happening than to get something done,"" he said in a speech this year in Washington, ""and you start to appreciate the degree of difficulty presented byÊclimateÊnegotiations."""
"Foreign, Sunday, December 12, 2010, p. A 16",Modest Deal on Emissions ConcludesÊClimateÊTalks,By JOHN M. BRODER; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting from New York.,"CANCUN, Mexico -- The United NationsÊclimateÊchange conference began with modest aims and ended early Saturday with modest achievements. But while the measures adopted here may have scant near-term impact on the warming of the planet, the international process for dealing with the issue got a significant vote of confidence.",,"The package known as the Cancun Agreements gives the more than 190 countries participating in the conference another year to decide whether to extend the frayed Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 agreement that requires most wealthy nations to trim their emissions while providing assistance to developing countries to pursue a cleaner energy future.
The agreement is not a legally binding treaty, but the success of these talks allows the process to seek a more robust accord at next year'sÊclimateÊconference in Durban, South Africa.
""This is not the end, but it is a new beginning,"" said Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican diplomat who serves as executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange. ""It is not what is ultimately required, but it is the essential foundation on which to build greater, collective ambition.""
The agreement sets up a new fund to help poor countries adapt toÊclimateÊchanges, creates new mechanisms for transfer of clean energy technology, provides compensation for the preservation of tropical forests and strengthens the emissions reductions pledges that came out of the last United NationsÊclimateÊchange meeting in Copenhagen last year.
The conference approved the package over the objections of Bolivia, which condemned the pact as too weak. Bolivia's chiefÊclimateÊnegotiator, Pablo Solon, said that the emissions reductions laid out in the plan would allow global temperatures to rise as much as 4 degrees Celsius over the next half century, twice the stated goal of the agreement and a level that would doom millions in the poorest and most vulnerable nations.
But his protests did not block acceptance of the package. Delegates from island states and the least-developed countries warmly welcomed the pact because it would start the flow of billions of dollars to assist them to adopt cleaner energy systems and adapt to inevitable changes in theÊclimate, like sea rise and drought.
But it left unresolved where the $100 billion in annualÊclimate-related aid that the wealthy nations have promised to provide would come from.
Todd Stern, the AmericanÊclimateÊenvoy, said the package achieved much of what he had hoped, including a more solid commitment by all nations to take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and a more formalized international program of reporting and verification of reductions. It adds needed specifics to the fuzzy promises of last year's Copenhagen Accord, he said.
""This is a significant step forward that builds on the progress made in Copenhagen,"" he said in a news conference after the package was adopted. ""It successfully anchors mitigation pledges of the Copenhagen Accord and builds on the transparency element of the accord with substantial detail and content.""
Mr. Stern had been particularly insistent that the agreement include a consistent formula for countries to disclose their emissions, report on the measures they are taking to reduce them and provide detailed statements of economic assumptions and methodology. Although a number of large developing nations like China, Brazil and South Africa balked at the intrusiveness of the system, Mr. Stern helped devise a compromise they could live with.
Yvo de Boer, who stepped down this year after four years as executive secretary of the United NationsÊclimateÊoffice, said that the success of this year's conference was in large measure attributable to the modesty of its goals.
""This process has never been characterized by leaps and bounds,"" he said in an interview. ""It has been characterized by small steps. And I'd rather see this small step here in Cancun than the international community tripping over itself in an effort to make a large leap.""
In all, the success of the Cancun talks was a shot in the arm for a process that some had likened to a zombie, stumbling aimlessly but refusing to die.
""None of this, of course, is world changing,"" said Michael A. Levi, who followsÊclimateÊissues at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ""The Cancun agreement should be applauded not because it solves everything, but because it chooses not to: it focuses on those areas where the U.N. process has the most potential to be useful, and avoids other areas where the U.N. process is a dead end. The outcome does not change the fact that most of the important work of cutting emissions will be driven outside the U.N. process."""
"National, Tuesday, February 9, 2010, p. A 14",A FederalÊClimateÊService Is Created to Provide Data,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON - The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will create a newÊclimateÊchange office to gather and provide data to governments, industry and academia as part of a broad federal effort to prepare for long-term changes to the planet, officials said Monday.",,"TheÊclimateÊservice is designed to be analogous to the National Weather Service, also part of NOAA, which celebrates its 140th birthday this month. Officials said they hoped the reorganization would shore up the profile of governmentÊclimateÊscience and perhaps drive the creation of new businesses like those that repackage and sell weather and census data.
""By providing critical planning information that our businesses and our communities need, NOAAÊClimateÊService will help tackle head-on the challenges of mitigating and adapting toÊclimateÊchange,"" Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, whose department oversees the atmospheric agency, said in a statement. ""In the process, we'll discover new technologies, build new businesses and create new jobs.""
The agency has also created a Web site,Êwww.climate.gov, to make it easier for people to find governmentÊclimateÊchange data and analysis.
Jane Lubchenco, administrator of NOAA, said there was a growing demand for timely information from the government about variations in the globalÊclimate.
""As the realities ofÊclimateÊchange become more obvious to more people, farmers, businesses, government agencies and public health officials are going to be turning to us for credible, useful and relevant information,"" Dr. Lubchenco said in an interview
She said that planning for the new unit was not related to recent challenges to the credibility of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, a United Nations research unit that has been accused of inaccurate statements on howÊclimateÊchange could affect glaciers and rain forests.
Dr. Lubchenco said her agency was committed to sharing all the information it gathered, including raw data and analytical reports, another area in which the United Nations panel has drawn some criticism.
""We want to help build confidence in the science ofÊclimateÊchange and give people an understanding of what is well established, as well as areas where there is more work to be done,"" she said.
Because the creation of theÊclimateÊservice involves shuffling money within the Commerce Department, approval will be required from Congressional appropriations committees."
"Foreign, Saturday, January 30, 2010, p. A 5",China Insists That Its Steps OnÊClimateÊBe Voluntary,By EDWARD WONG and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.,"BEIJING - As a Sunday target date approaches for countries to submit to the United Nations their plans for fightingÊclimateÊchange, China is banding together with other major developing nations to stress that only the wealthier countries need to make internationally binding commitments.",,"The distinction reflects China's strong desire to castÊclimateÊchange policy as a sovereignty issue in the aftermath of rancorous negotiations last month at the environmental summit meeting in Copenhagen. It says developed nations, which emitted carbon dioxide without restriction over many decades of industrialization, cannot force developing countries to submit to international policies or regulations.
China is standing by targets it announced before Copenhagen, but previousÊclimateÊchange treaties say targets of developing countries are not internationally binding, said Pan Jiahua, an economics professor who advises the Chinese negotiating team. ""On this China will stand firm.""
This position could draw further criticisms from Western politicians who already blame China for weakening the final accord at Copenhagen. In the United States Congress, the chances that lawmakers will passÊclimateÊlegislation this year are slim, in part because some lawmakers say China and India, where carbon emissions are rising the fastest, are giving much higher priority to maintaining economic growth than to fightingÊclimateÊchange.
But even as China sticks to tough diplomatic language, environmental advocates say it is forging ahead with its own plans to become more carbon-efficient.
This week, China unveiled a new agency, the National Energy Commission, headed by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, to coordinate energy policy. In December, China, now considered a leader in developing renewable energy technology, put more pressure on companies connected to the electric grid to hook up to renewable energy sources like wind- and solar-power generators.
The United Nations said that by Jan. 31, countries should approve the Copenhagen Accord and append their own goals for cutting carbon emissions or slowing emissions growth by 2020.
American officials have said that they will inscribe a provisional pledge announced by President Obama last November that the United States will cut carbon emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, pending action by Congress. Other nations demand bolder American cuts.
China, India, Brazil and South Africa said in New Delhi this week that they would present the United Nations with their ""voluntary"" plans onÊclimateÊchange. Voluntary is the operative word; the countries want to stress that only developed nations should have binding responsibilities to fightÊclimateÊchange.
""A very big deal is the extent to which you're doing this voluntarily,"" said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China scholar at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""You've got to make clear this isn't an international obligation, and that you're doing this because you're a good guy.""
To make the divide even clearer, the four countries called for an ""early flow"" of an annual $10 billion promised at Copenhagen to help developing nations combatÊclimateÊchange. Wealthy nations should begin handing over the money, first to small island nations and African countries, as ""proof of their commitment,"" the four major developing nations said in a statement.
China appears to be emphasizing rich nations' obligations on that now partly because Chinese officials felt ambushed at Copenhagen, especially over Western demands that China submit to an international system for monitoring and verifying emissions cuts.
China is also worried about losing the support of smaller developing nations because some of them rejected China's positions at Copenhagen. This month when Yang Jiechi, the Chinese foreign minister, visited Africa, he made China-Africa cooperation onÊclimateÊchange a priority in talks.
""I think that the Chinese definitely feel quite beaten up in Copenhagen,"" said Yang Ailun, theÊclimateÊand energy campaign manager at Greenpeace China, ""and what's quite worrying is that there was a sense among the Chinese officials that, 'Well, maybe we should just come to focus on our own domestic energy and domestic issues.' ""
The government's lead negotiator, Su Wei, said at a Chinese academic forum in December that the United States and European countries had played ""tricks"" in Copenhagen to heap pressure on China, according to a government-run Web site.
At theÊclimateÊtalks, frustration by the Chinese burst into the open when Xie Zhenhua, the top ChineseÊclimateÊofficial, yelled and wagged his finger at Mr. Obama, say conference attendees. Mr. Wen, the prime minister, told the interpreter to ignore Mr. Xie's remarks -- a sign of the discord that attendees said plagued the Chinese ranks.
Chinese officials were ill prepared to offer any concessions. They had gone to Copenhagen thinking that other nations would be satisfied with the announcement that China planned to cut carbon emissions per unit of economic growth, so-called carbon intensity, by 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
China and India have long rejected pledging to cut absolute emissions. Instead, they promise they can slow the growth of emissions while sustaining booming economies. Cutting carbon intensity will not reduce China's emissions; some analysts predict emissions could grow by up to 90 percent from 2005 to 2020.
Chinese officials insist the carbon intensity cut will require ambitious measures. But Michael A. Levi, aÊclimateÊchange expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said China's carbon intensity goal did not deviate greatly from what he called ""business as usual,"" reductions likely to occur under policies already put in place by 2009. The effort is important, he said, but ""does not indicate any new decision to fundamentally change course in the future.""
Some environmentalists have praised China's goal and say China will have to make great efforts to achieve it. Barbara Finamore, who heads the China program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, based in Washington, said the fact that China put in place relatively progressive policies before Copenhagen did not mean those policies should be considered ""business as usual.""
At Copenhagen, China also conceded at the final session to language that would require countries to report their carbon reduction numbers for international analysis. Earlier in December in Beijing, President Hu Jintao trumpeted China's opposition to stringent international monitoring, calling it a ""vital interest"" on which China would not compromise, said an editor at a Communist Party newspaper."
"National, Sunday, June 13, 2010, p. A 23","Oil Spill May Spur Action on Energy, Probably Not onÊClimate",By JOHN M. BRODER,WASHINGTON -- Images of gushing oil and dying pelicans in the Gulf of Mexico have stirred anger and agony in Washington. But are they enough to prod the Senate to act on long-delayed clean energy andÊclimateÊchange legislation?,,"But despite the outrage over the spill, there appears to be limited appetite in the Senate for a broad-based effort to cap greenhouse gas emissions across the board.
Enacting that kind of legislation will require a grand bargain involving greater nuclear plant construction, concessions to the coal and utility industries, exemptions for major manufacturers and more, not less, domestic oil and gas drilling to attract Republican and moderate Democratic support.
A coalition of 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster is not yet in sight. In the words of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a Republican who worked on aÊclimateÊchange bill for months before pronouncing it hopeless, ""There's nowhere near 60 votes to save the polar bear.""
President Obama has said that the time has come to put a price on carbon dioxide pollution and vowed to find the votes for it this year. On Thursday, reacting to the defeat of a Republican plan to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulatingÊclimate-changing emissions, the president again cited the urgent need to pass clean-energy andÊclimateÊlegislation.
Behind the scenes, however, his advisers are working on a more modest package of energy-saving measures that stop well short of an effort to cap carbon emissions across all sectors of the economy.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, has also signaled that he is open to patching together a series of limited energy measures rather than trying to push through a bigÊclimateÊbill like one sponsored by Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.
Mr. Reid has asked top committee leaders for ideas on how to structure a package of energy initiatives to bring to the Senate floor in July, a clear sign that he does not believe that the Kerry-Lieberman bill has a chance to pass on its own. An aide said Mr. Reid would refine his strategy this week after meeting with the entire Senate Democratic caucus. Mr. Kerry is to deliver a plea for his broad measure at that session, aides said.
Mr. Graham said that until the causes of the BP oil spill were identified and addressed, he would not vote for any sweepingÊ- legislation. Instead, he endorsed a bill introduced last week by Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, that sets higher fuel economy standards for cars, provides incentives for the development of alternative fuels and imposes stricter efficiency standards on buildings. The Lugar proposal includes no cap on carbon emissions but would seek to reduce greenhouse gas pollution through energy-saving steps.
""I'm not going to take a vote on the floor without a rational policy because we're in the middle of a major oil spill,"" Mr. Graham said. ""I'm not going to put that on the table until I find out what happened in the gulf and make sure it doesn't happen again.""
Mr. Lieberman said the oil spill made it more urgent to enact comprehensive energy andÊclimateÊchange legislation. He acknowledged, however, that the measure he and Mr. Kerry sponsored lacked the votes it needs and would probably be carved up and served in combination with other bills like Mr. Lugar's.
The oil spill, Mr. Lieberman said, has concentrated the capital's mind on energy policy and the problem of oil imports, but there is still no agreement on how to address it.
""The spill is significant, it is horrific, and it is the result of some negligence by business and government,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it will be used by both sides in the energy andÊclimateÊdebate. But the necessity of doing something in this session stands on its own merits.""
Senate Republican leaders accused Democrats and the White House of trying to exploit the oil spill for political gain. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said last week that the Democrats were using the calamity in the gulf to push what he described as a job-killingÊclimateÊchange bill.
""What I believe most of my members, if not all of them, and a substantial number of Democrats in the United States Senate will not be interested in is seizing on the oil spill in the gulf and using that as a rationale, if you will, for passing a national energy tax referred to down here at the White House as cap and trade,"" Mr. McConnell said on Thursday after meeting with Mr. Obama and top White House advisers.
Environmental advocates who have pushed hard for years forÊclimateÊchange legislation said they believed that the BP leak could tip the scales in favor of action. What form that action takes is still murky.
""The oil spill is a disaster, but I think it increases the likelihood of a bill being enacted this year,"" said Dan Lashof, director the Natural Resources Defense CouncilÊclimateÊcenter. ""There is still a question whether a bill that passes the Senate will be effective in responding both to the immediate needs to tighten drilling regulation as well as the larger issue of actually ending our addiction to oil and getting us on a clean energy path."""
"National, Tuesday, October 19, 2010, p. A 1",Kansans Scoff at Global Warming but Embrace Cleaner Energy,By LESLIE KAUFMAN,"SALINA, Kan. -- Residents of this deeply conservative city do not put much stock in scientific predictions ofÊclimateÊchange.",,"Saving energy, though, is another matter.
Last Halloween, schoolchildren here searched for ""vampire"" electric loads, or appliances that sap energy even when they seem to be off. Energy-efficient LED lights twinkled on the town's Christmas tree. On Valentine's Day, local restaurants left their dining room lights off and served meals by candlelight.
The fever for reducing dependence on fossil fuels has spread beyond this city of red-brick Eisenhower-era buildings to other towns on the Kansas plains. A Lutheran church in nearby Lindsborg was inspired to install geothermal heating. The principal of Mount Hope's elementary school dressed up as an energy bandit at a student assembly on home-energy conservation. Hutchinson won a contract to become home to a $50 million wind turbine factory.
Town managers attribute the new resolve mostly to a yearlong competition sponsored by theÊClimateÊand Energy Project, which set out to extricate energy issues from the charged arena ofÊclimateÊpolitics.
Attempts by the Obama administration to regulate greenhouse gases are highly unpopular here because of opposition to large-scale government intervention. Some are skeptical that humans might fundamentally alter a world that was created by God.
If the heartland is to seriously reduce its dependence on coal and oil, Ms. Jackson and others decided, the issues must be separated. So the project ran an experiment to see if by focusing on thrift, patriotism, spiritual conviction and economic prosperity, it could rally residents of six Kansas towns to take meaningful steps to conserve energy and consider renewable fuels.
Think of it as a green variation on ""What's the Matter with Kansas?"" Ms. Jackson suggested, referring to the 2004 book by Thomas Frank that contended that Republicans had come to dominate the state's elections by exploiting social values.
The project's strategy seems to have worked. In the course of the program, which ended last spring, energy use in the towns declined as much as 5 percent relative to other areas -- a giant step in the world of energy conservation, where a program that yields a 1.5 percent decline is considered successful.
The towns were featured as a case study on changing behavior by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. And theÊClimateÊand Energy Project just received a grant from the Kansas Energy Office to coordinate a competition among 16 Kansas cities to cut energy use in 2011.
The energy experiment started as a kitchen-table challenge three years ago.
Over dinner, Wes Jackson, the president of the Land Institute, which promotes environmentally sustainable agriculture, complained to Ms. Jackson, his daughter-in-law, that even though many local farmers would suffer fromÊclimateÊchange, few believed that it was happening or were willing to take steps to avoid it.
Why did the conversation have to be aboutÊclimateÊchange? Ms. Jackson countered. If the goal was to persuade people to reduce their use of fossil fuels, why not identify issues that motivated them instead of getting stuck on something that did not?
Only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is ""solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,"" a poll conducted in the fall of 2009 by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press showed -- far fewer than in other regions of the country.
The Jacksons already knew firsthand that such skepticism was not just broad, but also deep. Like opposition to abortion or affirmations of religious faith, they felt, it was becoming a cultural marker that helped some Kansans define themselves.
Nevertheless, Ms. Jackson felt so strongly that this opposition could be overcome that she left a job as development director at the University of Kansas in Lawrence to start theÊClimateÊand Energy Project with a one-time grant from the Land Institute. (The project is now independent.)
At the outset she commissioned focus groups of independents and Republicans around Wichita and Kansas City to get a sense of where they stood. Many participants suggested that global warming could be explained mostly by natural earth cycles, and a vocal minority even asserted that it was a cynical hoax perpetrated byÊclimateÊscientists who were greedy for grants.
Yet Ms. Jackson found plenty of openings. Many lamented the nation's dependence on foreign oil. Some articulated an amorphous desire, often based in religious values, to protect the earth. Some even spoke of changes in the natural world -- birds arriving weeks earlier in the spring than they had before -- leading her to wonder whether, deep down, they might suspect thatÊ  was afoot.
Ms. Jackson settled on a three-pronged strategy. Invoking the notion of thrift, she set out to persuade towns to compete with one another to become more energy-efficient. She worked with civic leaders to embrace green jobs as a way of shoring up or rescuing their communities. And she spoke with local ministers about ""creation care,"" the obligation of Christians to act as stewards of the world that God gave them, even creating a sermon bank with talking points they could download.
Relatively little was said aboutÊclimate.
""I don't recall us being recruited under aÊclimateÊchange label at all,"" said Stacy Huff, an executive for the Coronado Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which was enlisted to help the project. Mr. Huff describes himself as ""somewhat skeptical"" about global warming.
Mr. Huff said the project workers emphasized conservation for future generations when they recruited his group. The message resonated, and the scouts went door to door in low-income neighborhoods to deliver and install weatherization kits.
""It is in our DNA to leave a place better than we found it,"" he said.
Elliot Lahn, a community development planner for Merriam, a city that reduced its energy use by 5 percent, said that when public meetings were held on the six-town competition to save energy, some residents offered their view that global warming was a hoax.
But they were very eager to hear about saving money, Mr. Lahn said. ""That's what really motivated them.""
Jerry Clasen, a grain farmer in Reno County, south of Salina, said he largely discounted global warming. ""I believe we are going through a cycle and it is not a big deal,"" he said. But his ears pricked up when project workers came to town to talk about harnessing wind power. ""There is no sense in our dependency on foreign oil,"" he said, ""especially since we have got this resource here.""
Mr. Clasen helped organize a group of local leaders to lobby the electronics and energy giant Siemens to build a wind turbine factory in the area. When the company signed a deal in 2009 promising to create as many as 400 local jobs, it stirred a wave of excitement about the future of wind power.
Now, farmers expect to lease some of their land for turbines and rely on wind power as a stable source of income, he said, and land prices are rising as result.
""Whether or not the earth is getting warmer,"" he said, ""it feels good to be part of something that works for Kansas and for the nation.""
Beyond Fossil Fuels: Articles in this series examine innovative attempts to reduce the world's dependence on coal, oil and other carbon-intensive fuels, and the challenges faced."
"Editorial, Monday, July 26, 2010, p. A 23",OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,Four Ways to Kill aÊClimateÊBill,By LEE WASSERMAN,,"It's true that passing legislation to rebuild our fossil fuel-based economy was always going to be a momentous challenge. Senators and representatives feel in their bones (and campaign accounts) the interests of utilities and the coal and oil industries. Even well-intentioned members of Congress struggle to balance the competing needs of energy-intensive industries, coal workers and American families.
But withÊclimateÊchange a stated priority for President Obama and Congress, how did they fall so short? By weaving four coordinated threads into a shroud of inaction. This began long before President Obama took office, but rather than rip up the old pattern -- as he advocated during the campaign -- the president quickly took his place at the loom.
Thread No. 1:ClimateÊis out; green jobs are in. DespiteÊclimateÊchange being the greatest challenge of our time, with millions of people facing inundation, starvation and conflicts over scarce resources, the White House directed advocates not to discuss it. At a meeting in April 2009 led by Carol Browner, the White House coordinator of energy andÊclimateÊpolicy, administration message mavens toldÊclimateÊbill advocates that, given the polling, they should avoid talking aboutÊclimateÊchange and focus on green jobs and energy independence.
Had Lyndon Johnson likewise relied on polling, he would have told the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to talk only about the expanded industry and jobs that Southerners would realize after passage of a federal civil rights act. I could imagine Dr. King's response.
The urge to avoid the topic ofÊclimateÊchange is not new. While Bill Clinton and Al Gore have done noble work onÊclimateÊsince leaving office, when they had the presidential megaphone they did little to educate the public about the wolf at our door. President Obama has followed suit, and our national comprehension ofÊclimateÊchange continues to stagnate. Virtually the only public officials working to shape opinion on this over the past two years have been those committed to misrepresenting the science.
Thread No. 2: Devising a bill for historic polluters, not the American people. Remember the president's campaign pledge to represent the people, not the lobbyists? That's not what he's done on this issue.
For several years the Beltway wisdom has been that it is impossible to pass a bill without the approval of historic polluters, particularly the utilities, which run coal-burning power plants, the nation's single largest source ofÊclimate-changing pollution. The administration and Congress did their best to get the industry's permission for new regulations. They proposed handing power companies hundreds of billions of dollars worth of allowances to pollute, additional billions to subsidize the development of technology to sequester carbon from coal-fired plants, and evisceration of federal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon. Peter Orszag, the budget director, said giving away pollution permits would be ""the largest corporate welfare program that has ever been enacted in the history of the United States."" But no matter -- it wasn't enough.
Thread No. 3: A Rube Goldberg-policy construction. Because Congress built a policy machine designed for special interests, most proposals were chockablock with policy contraptions impossible to even explain, much less put into effect. Provisions included pollution allowances for favored corporations, carbon credit-default swaps, complicated worldwide offset provisions to enable avoidance of actual pollution reductions at home and loopholes to extend the life of the dirtiest coal plants. By the end of the process, even Campbell Soup demanded a special deal for the carbon-intensive job of making chicken noodle soup.
This rush to the trough was inevitable once President Obama ditched his plan to push a simple market-based bill that would have required polluters, rather than citizens, to pay for switching from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy.
Thread No. 4: The public sits it out. American history has few examples of presidents or Congresses upending entrenched interests without public pressure forcing their hand. Teddy Roosevelt is on Mount Rushmore for a reason.
Citizens wouldn't support an approach they couldn't understand to solve a problem our leaders refused to acknowledge. Even the earth's flagging ability to support life as we know it couldn't stir a public outcry. The loudest voices insisted that leaders in Washington do nothing.
They obliged."
"Editorial, Wednesday, June 9, 2010, p. A 25",OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,TheÊClimateÊMajority,By JON A. KROSNICK,,"ON Thursday, the Senate will vote on a resolution proposed by Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, that would scuttle the Environmental Protection Agency's plans to limit emissions of greenhouse gases by American businesses.
Passing the resolution might seem to be exactly what Americans want. After all, national surveys released during the last eight months have been interpreted as showing that fewer and fewer Americans believe thatÊclimateÊchange is real, human-caused and threatening to people.
But a closer look at these polls and a new survey by my Political Psychology Research Group show just the opposite: huge majorities of Americans still believe the earth has been gradually warming as the result of human activity and want the government to institute regulations to stop it.
In our survey, which was financed by a grant to Stanford from the National Science Foundation, 1,000 randomly selected American adults were interviewed by phone between June 1 and Monday. When respondents were asked if they thought that the earth's temperature probably had been heating up over the last 100 years, 74 percent answered affirmatively. And 75 percent of respondents said that human behavior was substantially responsible for any warming that has occurred.
For many issues, any such consensus about the existence of a problem quickly falls apart when the conversation turns to carrying out specific solutions that will be costly. But not so here.
Fully 86 percent of our respondents said they wanted the federal government to limit the amount of air pollution that businesses emit, and 76 percent favored government limiting business's emissions of greenhouse gases in particular. Not a majority of 55 or 60 percent -- but 76 percent.
Large majorities opposed taxes on electricity (78 percent) and gasoline (72 percent) to reduce consumption. But 84 percent favored the federal government offering tax breaks to encourage utilities to make more electricity from water, wind and solar power.
And huge majorities favored government requiring, or offering tax breaks to encourage, each of the following: manufacturing cars that use less gasoline (81 percent); manufacturing appliances that use less electricity (80 percent); and building homes and office buildings that require less energy to heat and cool (80 percent).
Thus, there is plenty of agreement about what people do and do not want government to do.
Our poll also indicated that some of the principal arguments against remedial efforts have been failing to take hold. Only 18 percent of respondents said they thought that policies to reduce global warming would increase unemployment and only 20 percent said they thought such initiatives would hurt the nation's economy. Furthermore, just 14 percent said the United States should not take action to combat global warming unless other major industrial countries like China and India do so as well.
Our findings might seem implausible in light of recent polls that purport to show that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the very existence ofÊclimateÊchange. But in fact, those polls did not produce conflicting evidence at all.
Consider, for example, the most publicized question from a 2009 Pew Research Center poll: ""From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"" This question measured perceptions of scientific evidence that the respondent has read or heard about, not the respondents' personal opinions about whether the earth has been warming. Someone who has had no exposure to scientific evidence or who perceives the evidence to be equivocal may nonetheless be convinced that the earth has been heating up by, say, the early blossoming of plants in his garden.
Or consider a widely publicized Gallup question: ""Thinking about what is said in the news, in your view, is the seriousness of global warming generally exaggerated, generally correct or is it generally underestimated?"" This question asked about respondents' perceptions of the news, not the respondents' perception of warming. A person who believesÊclimateÊchange has been happening might also feel that news media coverage of it has been exaggerated.
Questions in other polls that sought to tap respondents' personal beliefs about the existence and causes of warming violated two of the cardinal rules of good survey question design: ask about only one thing at a time, and choose language that makes it easy for respondents to understand and answer each question.
Imagine being asked this, from a poll by CNN: ""Which of the following statements comes closest to your view of global warming: Global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities like power plants and factories; global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by natural changes that have nothing to do with emissions from cars and industrial facilities; or, global warming is a theory that has not yet been proven.""
Notice that the question didn't even offer the opportunity for respondents to say they believe global warming is definitely not happening -- not the sort of question that will provide the most valid measurements.
When surveys other than ours have asked simple and direct questions, they have produced results similar to ours. For example, in November, an ABC News/Washington Post survey found that 72 percent of respondents said the earth has been heating up, and a December poll by Ipsos/McClatchy found this proportion to be 70 percent.
Our surveys did reveal a small recent decline in the proportion of people who believe global warming has been happening, from 84 percent in 2007 to 80 percent in 2008 to 74 percent today. Statistical analysis of our data revealed that this decline is attributable to perceptions of recent weather changes by the minority of Americans who have been skeptical aboutÊclimateÊscientists.
In terms of average earth temperature, 2008 was the coldest year since 2000. Scientists say that such year-to-year fluctuations are uninformative, and people who trust scientists therefore ignore this information when forming opinions about global warming's existence. Citizens who do not trustÊclimateÊscientists, however, base their conclusions on their personal observations of nature. These low-trust individuals were especially aware of the recent decline in average world temperatures; they were the ones in our survey whose doubts about global warming have increased since 2007.
This explanation is especially significant, because it suggests that the small recent decline in the proportion of people who believe in global warming is likely to be temporary. If the earth's temperature begins to rise again, these individuals may reverse course and rejoin the large majority who still think warming is real.
Growing public skepticism has, in recent months, been attributed to news reports about e-mail messages hacked from the computer system at the University of East Anglia in Britain (characterized as showingÊclimateÊscientists colluding to silence unconvinced colleagues) and by the discoveries of alleged flaws in reports by the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange.
Our new survey discredited this claim in multiple ways. First, we found no decline in Americans' trust in environmental scientists: 71 percent of respondents said they trust these scientists a moderate amount, a lot or completely, a figure that was 68 percent in 2008 and 70 percent in 2009. Only 9 percent said they knew about the East Anglia e-mail messages and believed they indicated thatÊclimateÊscientists should not be trusted, and only 13 percent of respondents said so about the I.P.C.C. reports' alleged flaws.
Interestingly, Americans are not alone in having their views portrayed inaccurately. A February BBC News survey asked Britons, ""From what you know and have heard, do you think that the earth'sÊclimateÊis changing and global warming is taking place?"" Seventy-five percent of respondents answered affirmatively, down a somewhat improbable eight percentage points from 83 percent in November. A BBC headline blared, ""ClimateÊSkepticism on the Rise,"" when it should have proclaimed that a huge majority of Britons still share common ground with one another and with Americans on this issue.
GLOBAL warming has attracted what political scientists dub an ""issue public"": millions of Americans who are passionate about this subject and put pressure on government to follow their wishes. For over a decade, this group has been of typical issue-public size, about 15 percent of American adults.
Although issue publics usually divide about equally on opposing sides -- think of abortion or immigration -- 88 percent of theÊ- issue public in our survey believed that global warming has been happening; 88 percent attributed responsibility for it to human action; 92 percent wanted the federal government to limit the amount of greenhouse gases that businesses can emit. Put simply, the people whose votes are most powerfully shaped by this issue are sending a nearly unanimous signal to their elected representatives.
All this makes global warming a singular issue in American politics. Even as we are told that Americans are about equally divided into red and blue, a huge majority shares a common vision ofÊclimateÊchange. This creates a unique opportunity for elected representatives to satisfy a lot of voters.
When senators vote on emissions limits on Thursday, there is one other number they might want to keep in mind: 72 percent of Americans think that most business leaders do not want the federal government to take steps to stop global warming. A vote to eliminate greenhouse gas regulation is likely to be perceived by the nation as a vote for industry, and against the will of the people."
"Foreign, Wednesday, March 3, 2010, p. A 11",Scientists Becoming Active In DefendingÊClimateÊData,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON -- For months,ÊclimateÊscientists have taken a vicious beating in the media and on the Internet, accused of hiding data, covering up errors and suppressing alternate views. Their response until now has been largely to assert the legitimacy of the vast body ofÊclimateÊscience and to mock their critics as cranks and know-nothings.",,"The unauthorized release last fall of hundreds of e-mail messages from a majorÊclimateÊresearch center in England, and more recent revelations of a handful of errors in a supposedly authoritative United Nations report onÊclimateÊchange, have created what a number of top scientists say is a major breach of faith in their research. They say the uproar threatens to undermine decades of work and has badly damaged public trust in the scientific enterprise.
The e-mail episode, called ""climategate"" by critics, revealed arrogance and what one topÊclimateÊresearcher called ""tribalism"" among some scientists. The correspondence appears to show efforts to limit publication of contrary opinion and to evade Freedom of Information Act requests. The content of the messages opened some well-known scientists to charges of concealing temperature data from rival researchers and manipulating results to conform to precooked conclusions.
""I have obviously written some very awful e-mails,"" Phil Jones, the BritishÊclimateÊscientist at the center of the controversy, confessed to a special committee of Parliament on Monday. But he sharply disputed charges that he had hidden data or faked results.
Some of the most serious allegations against Dr. Jones, director of theÊclimateÊresearch unit at the University of East Anglia, and other researchers have been debunked, while several investigations are still under way to determine whether others hold up.
But serious damage has already been done. A survey conducted in late December by Yale University and George Mason University found that the number of Americans who believed thatÊclimateÊchange was a hoax or scientific conspiracy had more than doubled since 2008, to 16 percent of the population from 7 percent. An additional 13 percent of Americans said they thought that even if the planet was warming, it was a result solely of natural factors and was not a significant concern.
ClimateÊscientists have been shaken by the criticism and are beginning to look for ways to recover their reputation. They are learning a little humility and trying to make sure they avoid crossing a line into policy advocacy.
""It's clear that theÊclimateÊscience community was just not prepared for the scale and ferocity of the attacks and they simply have not responded swiftly and appropriately,"" said Peter C. Frumhoff, an ecologist and chief scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""We need to acknowledge the errors and help turn attention from what's happening in the blogosphere to what's happening in the atmosphere.""
A number of institutions are beginning efforts to improve the quality of their science and to make their work more transparent. The official BritishÊclimateÊagency is undertaking a complete review of its temperature data and will make its records and analysis fully public for the first time, allowing outside scrutiny of methods and conclusions. The United Nations panel onÊclimateÊchange will accept external oversight of its research practices, also for the first time.
Two universities are investigating the work of topÊclimateÊscientists to determine whether they have violated academic standards and undermined faith in science. The National Academy of Sciences is preparing to publish a nontechnical paper outlining what is known -- and not known -- about changes to the globalÊclimate. And a vigorous debate is under way amongÊclimateÊscientists on how to make their work more transparent and regain public confidence.
Some critics think these are merely cosmetic efforts that do not address the real problem, however.
""I'll let you in on a very dark, ugly secret -- I don't want trust inÊclimateÊscience to be restored,"" Willis Eschenbach, an engineer andÊclimateÊcontrarian who posts frequently onÊclimateÊskeptic blogs, wrote in response to oneÊclimateÊscientist's proposal to share more research. ""I don't want you learning better ways to propagandize for shoddy science. I don't want you to figure out how to inspire trust by camouflaging your unethical practices in new and innovative ways.""
""The solution,"" he concluded, ""is for you to stop trying to pass off garbage as science.""
Ralph J. Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences, the most prestigious scientific body in the United States, said that there was a danger that the distrust ofÊclimateÊscience could mushroom into doubts about scientific inquiry more broadly. He said that scientists must do a better job of policing themselves and trying to be heard over the loudest voices on cable news, talk radio and the Internet.
""This is a pursuit that scientists have not had much experience in,"" said Dr. Cicerone, a specialist in atmospheric chemistry.
The battle is asymmetric, in the sense that scientists feel compelled to support their findings with careful observation and replicable analysis, while their critics are free to make sweeping statements condemning their work as fraudulent.
""We have to do a better job of explaining that there is always more to learn, always uncertainties to be addressed,"" said John P. Holdren, an environmental scientist and the White House science adviser. ""But we also need to remind people that the occasions where a large consensus is overturned by a scientific heretic are very, very rare.""
No scientific body is under more hostile scrutiny than the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, which compiles theÊclimateÊresearch of hundreds of scientists around the globe into periodic reports intended to be the definitive statement of the science and a guide for policy makers. Critics, citing several relatively minor errors in its most recent report and charges of conflict of interest against its leader, Rajendra K. Pachauri, are calling for the I.P.C.C. to be disbanded or radically reformed.
On Saturday, after weeks of refusing to engage critics, the I.P.C.C. announced that it was asking for the creation of an independent panel to review its research procedures to try to eliminate bias and errors from future reports. But even while allowing for some external oversight, Dr. Pachauri insisted that the panel stood behind its previous work.
""Scientists must continually earn the public's trust or we risk descending into a new Dark Age where ideology trumps reason,"" Dr. Pachauri said in an e-mail message.
But some scientists said that responding toÊclimateÊchange skeptics was a fool's errand.
""ClimateÊscientists are paid to doÊclimateÊscience,"" said Gavin A. Schmidt, a senior climatologist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute of Space Studies. ""Their job is not persuading the public.""
He said that the recent flurry of hostility toÊclimateÊscience had been driven as much by the cold winter as by any real or perceived scientific sins.
""There have always been people accusing us of being fraudulent criminals, of the I.P.C.C. being corrupt,"" Dr. Schmidt said. ""What is new is this paranoia combined with a spell of cold weather in the United States and the 'climategate' release. It's a perfect storm that has allowed the nutters to control the agenda.""
The answer is simple, he said.
""Good science,"" he said, ""is the best revenge."""
"Foreign, Wednesday, March 10, 2010, p. A 9",ClimateÊGoal Is Supported By China And India,By JOHN M. BRODER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.,"WASHINGTON -- China and India formally agreed Tuesday to join the internationalÊclimateÊchange agreement reached in December in Copenhagen, the last two major economies to sign up.",,"China and India join nearly 200 countries that have signed up under the accord, which calls for limiting the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond pre-industrial levels.
The agreement also calls for spending as much as $100 billion a year to help emerging countries adapt toÊclimateÊchange and develop low-carbon energy systems, to bring energy technology more quickly to the developing world and to take steps to protect tropical forests from destruction.
The 192 nations gathered at the CopenhagenÊclimateÊmeeting did not formally adopt the accord, but merely voted to ""take note"" of it. The inclusion of China and India has only a minor practical effect but will provide a boost for the agreement's credibility.
""After careful consideration, India has agreed to such a listing,"" Reuters quoted India's environment minister, Jairam Ramesh, as telling Parliament on Tuesday. ""We believe that our decision to be listed reflects the role India played in giving shape to the Copenhagen Accord. This will strengthen our negotiating position onÊclimateÊchange.""
Mr. Ramesh confirmed India's action in an e-mail message.
India sent a letter on Monday to the United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange, the body responsible for internationalÊclimateÊnegotiations, stating its intent to join the Copenhagen Accord.
China's chiefÊclimateÊchange negotiator, Su Wei, submitted a single-sentence letter saying that the United Nations ""can proceed to include China in the list of parties"" signed up under the accord.
Todd Stern, who leads the AmericanÊclimateÊchange negotiating team, said he was pleased to see China and India sign on. ""The accord is a significant step forward, including important provisions on mitigation, funding, transparency, technology, forests and adaptation,"" Mr. Stern said by e-mail.
Analysts who have studied the pledges find that they fall short of the overall goal of the agreement, but would make a substantial dent in the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet.
China has said it will try to voluntarily reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide per unit of economic growth -- a measure known as ""carbon intensity"" -- by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels. India set a domestic emissions intensity reduction target of 20 to 25 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels, excluding its agricultural sector.
The United States pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent by 2020 compared with 2005, contingent on Congress's enactingÊclimateÊchange and energy legislation.
Negotiators are trying to write an enforceable globalÊclimateÊchange treaty, but there is little expectation that such an agreement will be reached this year.
The European Union'sÊclimateÊcommissioner, Connie Hedegaard of Denmark, said Tuesday that nations should now aim to reach an agreement in 2011 at a United Nations conference in South Africa, rather than this year in Mexico."
"National, Thursday, April 8, 2010, p. A 21",Texas Oil Firms Oppose CaliforniaÊClimateÊLaw,"By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.",WASHINGTON -- Several Texas oil companies are bankrolling a petition drive to suspend California's path-breakingÊclimateÊchange law in a move that may prove a bellwether for national efforts to address global warming.,,"The California law, the first of its kind in the nation, is intended to reduce emissions ofÊclimate-altering gases by 15 percent below current levels by 2020 through a variety of means, including a regional cap-and-trade system. The bill also calls for greater efficiencies in buildings and transportation, more use of renewable sources of energy and greater reliance on clean-burning fuels. These are all major elements ofÊclimateÊchange proposals now being discussed in Washington.
The fine points of the California plan, including the critical questions of how emissions permits would be allocated and how any revenues would be distributed, are still being worked out.
The ballot initiative would prevent the law's taking effect until unemployment in California falls to 5.5 percent or lower for four consecutive quarters. The state's current unemployment rate is 12.5 percent. The average statewide unemployment rate in 2006 was 4.9 percent.
Mr. Schwarzenegger has said he considers theÊclimateÊchange law one of the signal achievements of his administration and wants to see it put in place. He said recently he believed the petition drive was fueled by the ""greed"" of out-of-state energy companies.
""I think that the California people are outraged about the fact that Texas oil companies, Texas oil companies, are coming to California and trying to change laws and policies in California,"" he said at a green technology exhibition in Sacramento last month. ""I mean, it's outrageous.""
But the governor has also expressed concern that the new law, scheduled to take effect in 2012, not harm the state's crippled economy and cause additional job losses.
The California Jobs Initiative, the group collecting petition signatures to upend the California law, has raised just under $1 million, according to a spokeswoman for the group. Most of the money came from oil companies, but the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, founded by the father of California's antitax movement, contributed $100,000.
A Valero spokesman, Bill Day, said costs would rise at the company's two large refineries in California under the new emissions law because refineries use a lot of electricity and natural gas to heat and refine crude oil. Electricity prices would go up under the law, he said, and the consumption of natural gas produces carbon emissions that would be penalized under the legislation.
""Like the national cap-and-trade legislation, it does nothing at all to alleviate the problem ofÊclimateÊchange, but it would have tremendously bad impacts on the California economy,"" Mr. Day said. ""This is exactly the wrong time to be implementing a cap and trade program that will further hurt consumers and cause more job loses. We are supporting a measure that would give California voters the chance to express their opinion on whether this legislation should be implemented now.""
Valero has also been active in opposing federal cap-and-trade regulations. In response to theÊclimateÊbill passed by the House last June, Valero organized a ""Voices for Energy"" campaign against the bill and placed signs at its gas stations around the country depicting Uncle Sam warning drivers that the legislation would increase gasoline prices.
Steven Maviglio, spokesman for Californians for Clean Energy & Jobs, an alliance supporting theÊclimateÊbill, said he had little doubt the organizers of the initiative would collect the required 434,000 signatures by mid-April to win a spot on the November ballot. He said his organization, representing technology firms, environmental advocates and public health groups, had raised nearly $1 million to defend the law. But he said both sides in the fight would probably raise tens of millions of dollars for what he called an environmental ""battle royal"" in the fall.
""Valero has been very outspoken on the national level againstÊclimateÊchange regulation,"" said Mr. Maviglio, who served as spokesman for Gray Davis, the Democratic governor whom Mr. Schwarzenegger succeeded in a lively recall election in 2003. ""This is a strategic effort by the oil companies to try to unravel this law before it spreads throughout the country. The theory is if they can kill it here, they can kill it everywhere.""
There are already signs of economic and political unease in state capitals aboutÊclimateÊchange legislation. Arizona announced this year that it was pulling out of an embryonic regional greenhouse gas emissions trading group, and more than a dozen state attorneys general have challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's plans to regulate global warming gases."
"Money and Business/Financial, Sunday, July 18, 2010, p. BU 5",OFF THE SHELF,To the Mat On Global Warming,By HARRY HURT III,,"""America is still debating whether and how to reduce carbon emissions, and a loud minority continues to insist that global warming isn't real or caused by man,"" writes Eric Pooley in ""TheÊClimateÊWar: True Believers, Power Brokers, and the Fight to Save the Earth"" (Hyperion, $27.99), an illuminating if often ponderous book.
""TheÊClimateÊWar"" focuses mainly on the economic and political aspects of the global-warming issue. That is in keeping with Mr. Pooley's areas of journalistic expertise. He is the deputy editor of Bloomberg BusinessWeek, a former managing editor of Fortune and a former national editor, chief political correspondent and White House correspondent for Time.
Mr. Pooley calls his account ""an epic without an ending,"" saying that the American political system gives a ""natural advantage to the opponents ofÊclimateÊaction"" and that Congress has ""become so distorted by special-interest dollars and partisan bile"" that it seems ""to block progress of any kind, no matter how urgent.""
If statements like that suggest that Mr. Pooley favors Mr. Gore's position, the book nevertheless allows corporate opponents ofÊclimateÊlegislation and disparate environmental groups with conflicting agendas to state their case.
Along with Mr. Gore, the main characters in ""TheÊClimateÊWar"" include Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund; James E. Rogers, chief executive of the coal-burning utility Duke Energy; the climatologist James Hansen, who called public attention to global warming in the 1980s; and the coal lobbyists Steve Miller and Joe Lucas. And there is also Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a leader of what Mr. Pooley calls ""the professional denial-and-delay movement,"" a k a the ""Denialosphere.""
The book opens with a recounting of Mr. Gore flying from the Nobel ceremony in December 2007 to aÊclimateÊconference in Bali, where he unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Bush administration to commit to a drastic reduction in America's carbon emissions.
From there, the global-warming fight rages downhill, uphill and sideways, depending on the perspectives of the various combatants. Mr. Krupp provoked the ire of other environmental groups by working with Mr. Rogers of Duke Energy in the hope of getting Congress to pass a form of cap-and-trade legislation.
Their aim was to put a mandatory limit on carbon emissions by coal-fired plants. At the same time, they sought to keep the coal industry from immediate bankruptcy by allowing companies to trade -- that is, buy and sell -- pollution permits.
Mr. Pooley casts Mr. Krupp's predilection for market-based solutions like cap-and-trade as a triumph of enlightened pragmatism over ineffective idealism. ""Altruism wasn't going to save the planet, he figured, but the profit motive might, if it could be properly harnessed,"" Mr. Pooley writes.
Mr. Rogers's support for the Environmental Defense Fund's global-warming initiative attracted backing from Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric and other corporate chiefs. But in the spring of 2008, as the language in the initiative became more and more specific, Mr. Rogers dispatched an army of lobbyists to Capitol Hill with a study that contended the economy would shrivel if Congress enacted cap-and-trade legislation that was under consideration.
""For someone who gave speeches all over America calling forÊclimateÊaction, Jim Rogers was doing a great job of killing theÊclimatebill,"" Mr. Pooley writes.
Mr. Pooley also describes how coal interests, led by the likes of Mr. Miller and Mr. Lucas, started multimillion-dollar public relations and advertising campaigns designed to encourage doubt about the very idea of global warming caused by humans.
MR. GORE, meanwhile, suffered further frustration in his attempts to enlist the full-throated support of President Obama for what came to be known as the Waxman-MarkeyÊclimateÊbill. According to Mr. Pooley, the White House ""was not arming its warheads.""
""It was working behind the scenes,"" Mr. Pooley adds, ""and that was all.""
The bill passed the House 219-212 in June 2009, but the closeness of the vote foreboded doom for a Senate version. (Last week, it was reported that President Obama and Senate Democrats would soon push forward with a scaled-back energy bill -- one that would limit carbon pollution by power plants but not by other industries.)
""TheÊClimateÊWar"" is impressively documented with more than 20 pages of source notes and citations, but it is not easy reading. Although the author mercifully spares the reader a lengthy recitation of the scientific evidence supporting global warming, his blow-by-blow account of the public and private maneuverings of environmentalists, corporate executives, lobbyists, politicians, news commentators and Congressional committee staff members is often tedious, especially because so many of their efforts lead down rabbit trails.
Still, the book shows just how arduous theÊclimateÊfight has been -- and will likely continue to be -- for years, if not generations, to come."
"Foreign, Tuesday, November 9, 2010, p. A 9",Support Grows for WiderÊClimateÊTreaty,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON -- With energy legislation shelved in the United States and little hope for a globalÊclimateÊchange agreement this year, some policy experts are proposing a novel approach to curbing global warming: including greenhouse gases under an existing and highly successful international treaty ratified more than 20 years ago.",,"But as the signers of the protocol convened the 22nd annual meeting in Bangkok on Monday, negotiators are considering a proposed expansion in the ozone treaty to phase out the production and use of the industrial chemicals known as hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs The chemicals have thousands of times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas.
HFCs are used as refrigerants in air-conditioners and cooling systems. They are manufactured mostly in China and India, but appliances containing the substance are in use in every corner of the world. HFCs replaced even more dangerous ozone-depleting chemicals known as HCFCs, themselves a substitute for the chlorofluorocarbons that were the first big target of the Montreal process.
""Eliminating HFCs under the Montreal Protocol is the single biggest chunk ofÊclimateÊprotection we can get in the next few years,"" said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, a nongovernment organization based in Washington. He noted that the ozone protection effort had begun under former President Ronald Reagan and continues to enjoy bipartisan support.
The United States has thrown its support behind the proposal and negotiators said there was a strong current of support for the move at the meeting on Monday. All the signatories to the Montreal Protocol would have to agree to the expansion, but no further approval from Congress would be needed. So far, there has been no Congressional or industry opposition to the idea.
But the plan is not expected to be adopted this year. Large developing countries, including China, India and Brazil, object that the timetable is too rapid and that payments for eliminating the refrigerant are not high enough.
One advantage to using the Montreal protocol as a vehicle, supporters say, is that negotiations over the treaty have been utterly unlike the contentious United NationsÊclimateÊtalks that foundered in Copenhagen last year. Negotiators say that without legislative action on curbing greenhouse gases by the United States, little progress will be made when countries gather in Cancun, Mexico, late this month for another round ofÊclimateÊtalks.
In a post-election news conference, President Obama noted that it was doubtful that Congress would do anything to address global warming ""this year or next year or the year after.""
Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, the Montreal treaty has been signed by all nations. They conduct their business with little drama and with broad scientific and technical input from governments and industry. The financing mechanisms, while occasionally contentious, are generally quickly resolved and seen as equitable.
The ozone treaty was unanimously ratified in 1988 by the United States Senate, which a decade later unanimously voted against adopting the Kyoto Protocol to addressÊclimateÊchange. Montreal's pollution reduction targets are mandatory, universally accepted and readily measurable. None of that is true of theÊclimateÊprocess.
The Montreal Protocol has phased out nearly 97 percent of 100 ozone-depleting chemicals, some of which are also potentÊclimate-altering gases. The net effect has been the elimination of the equivalent of more than 200 billion metric tons of global-warming gases, five years' worth of total global emissions, far more than has been accomplished by the Kyoto process.
It has been, according to the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan, ""perhaps the most successful international agreement to date.""
The proposal to eliminate HFCs was advanced several years ago by the tiny island nation of Micronesia, one of the places on Earth most vulnerable to sea-level rise and other global warming effects.
The United States quickly signed on. Along with Mexico and Canada, the Obama administration has proposed a rapid series of steps to reduce HFC production, with rich countries meeting a faster timetable than developing nations and helping to pay the poorer countries to find substitutes. But the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that adopting the HFC proposal could eliminate the equivalent of 88 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050, and slow global warming by a decade.
Daniel A. Reifsnyder, the deputy assistant secretary of state for environment and the nation's chief Montreal Protocol negotiator, said that it might take several years to persuade the ozone treaty countries to back the plan.
In addition to pace and cost issues, some countries say that HFCs have little impact on the ozone layer and thus should be handled under the United NationsÊclimateÊchange talks. Mr. Reifsnyder dismissed that as a legalistic argument and said that the ozone treaty could and should be used to achieve broader environmental objectives.
""What we've found is that the Montreal Protocol has been a very effective instrument for addressing global environmental problems,"" Mr. Reifsnyder said in an interview. ""It was created to deal with the ozone layer, but it also has tremendous ability to solve theÊclimateÊproblem if people are willing to use it that way.""
Mario Molina, the Mexican scientist who shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his groundbreaking work in identifying the role of chlorofluorocarbon gases in the breach of the stratospheric ozone layer, said that it might take two or three years for other countries to see the virtues of the HFC reduction.
""My hope is that everybody will agree with this proposal from the United States and Mexico and a few other countries because the Montreal Protocol has been so successful at controlling these industrial chemicals,"" he said in an interview from his institute in Mexico City.
Dr. Molina said that extending the protocol to include HFCs could reduce the threat ofÊclimateÊchange by several times what the Kyoto Protocol proposes. He noted that theÊclimateÊtreaty had fallen far short of its goals, and that there was no agreement on what should replace it when its major provisions expired in 2012.
""We understand it's a stretch to use an international agreement designed for another purpose,"" he said. ""But dealing with these chemicals and using this treaty to protect the planet makes a lot of sense."""
"National, Wednesday, January 27, 2010, p. A 4",Advocates ofÊClimateÊBill Scale Down Their Goals,"By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.","WASHINGTON - As they watch President Obama's ambitious health care plan crumble, the advocates of a comprehensive bill to combat global warming are turning their sights to a more modest package ofÊclimateÊand energy measures that they believe has a better chance of clearing Congress this year.",,"Republicans, industry executives and some Democrats have already written cap and trade's obituary, at least for this year. And even some of the system's most ardent supporters now say they must scale back their ambitions and focus on job-creating energy projects and energy efficiency measures if they are to have any hope of dealing withÊclimateÊchange in this Congress.
""Realistically, the cap-and-trade bills in the House and the Senate are going nowhere,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is trying to fashion a bipartisan package ofÊclimateÊand energy measures. ""They're not business-friendly enough, and they don't lead to meaningful energy independence.""
Mr. Graham said the public was demanding that any energy legislation from Washington focus on creating jobs, whether by drilling for offshore oil or building wind turbines.
""What is dead is some massive cap-and-trade system that regulates carbon in a fashion that drives up energy costs,"" he said.
Mr. Graham's opinion matters because he has been the only Republican willing to work with Democratic senators on some form ofÊclimateÊchange legislation. He said that the price of attracting Republican and business support was to use the legislation to provide incentives for building nuclear power plants, stepped-up domestic oil and gas exploration and subsidies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal.
White House officials continue to insist on a broad approach toÊclimateÊand energy, including a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that encompasses the entire economy. They are also pressing forward with Environmental Protection Agency regulation of emissions of heat-trapping gases over the virtually unanimous opposition of Republicans in the House and Senate.
""There continues to be very strong support among a range of legislators for comprehensiveÊclimateÊlegislation that includes cap and trade,"" Gary Guzy, the deputy director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said at a conference last week.
Another White House official, who insisted on anonymity to avoid overshadowing the State of the Union address, said President Obama would restate his commitment to a bill that addresses global warming along with measures to increase energy efficiency and clean-energy technology.
The official said the White House would support legislation that provided incentives for oil and gas drilling and for construction of nuclear plants, as well as provisions that helped industries that use a lot of energy and were vulnerable to foreign competitors.
But the president will also insist that any legislation also contain some form of cap on emissions of heat-trapping gases to make good on his pledge to reduce global warming pollution by 17 percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
""At the end of the day, any and all ideas are on the table because the clock is ticking,"" the official said.
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is working with Mr. Graham and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, to try to knit together a global warming and energy measure, said this week that the politicalÊclimateÊin Washington was already harsh and had worsened with the special election in his home state. Mr. Kerry said he had held talks with the White House, business leaders and fellow senators in hopes of finding an approach toÊclimateÊand energy issues that can win enough votes for passage.
""I can't tell you whether it will happen this year or not,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""But it's going to happen. It is inevitable that the United States will deal withÊclimateÊand energy. The sooner you do it, the cheaper it is.""
Some leaders in the energy industry were almost gleeful in pronouncing cap and trade dead for the year. They see an opportunity to win support from Congress for their businesses and to delay indefinitely the costs of reducing pollution from heat-trapping gases.
""Reality is hitting, and the reality is the American people are interested in jobs, not extreme legislation,"" said Larry Nichols, chief executive of Devon Energy and chairman of the American Petroleum Institute. ""Because of the shift in raw political power, there now has to be compromise.""
A bill that has the support of Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, and some senior Congressional Republicans, would offer tax incentives to bus and truck fleets to switch to natural gas, a fuel that emits less carbon dioxide than diesel. Some energy industry leaders are also looking for additional money for so-called clean-coal research and energy efficiency measures for buildings.
Two senators, Maria Cantwell of Washington, a Democrat, and Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican, have proposed a system known as ""cap and dividend"" under which power plants, steel mills, refineries and other major carbon emitters would have to pay for permits to pollute, with all of the money being rebated to consumers to cover the higher costs of energy and manufactured goods.
Another option, but one largely opposed by most businesses, is regulation by the E.P.A. Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that he would much prefer a market-based cap-and-trade system to top-down mandates from the E.P.A.
The partisan gridlock that hobbled health care overhaul could be repeated if the administration and Democratic leaders try to ram through a sweeping measure to rein in carbon emissions and remake the nation's energy economy, said Paul Bledsoe of the National Commission on Energy Policy, a bipartisan advisory group.
""If cap and trade becomes a political anathema,"" Mr. Bledsoe said, ""the consequences are very broad. If it is seen as divisive or politically suicidal, it could be discredited as the vehicle for dealing withÊclimateÊchange for the foreseeable future."""
"Metropolitan, Thursday, October 28, 2010, p. A 24",OUR TOWNS,Ignoring The Planet Won't Fix It,By PETER APPLEBOME,,"And, political year or not, there's only so much news value in any projection of what might happen inÊclimateÊscience. Still, you don't need a Ph.D. to ponder the potential ramifications of the study, by Aiguo Dai, who works with the center'sÊClimateÊand Global Dynamics Division.
It concluded that, over the next 30 years, warming temperatures associated withÊclimateÊchange were likely to create increasingly dry conditions in the United States and droughts around the globe on levels seldom seen before. Previous studies by Dr. Dai have indicated thatÊclimateÊchange may already be producing drier conditions. A 2004 study found that the percentage of the world's land area facing serious drought more than doubled from the 1970s to the early 2000s.
The recent study concluded that most of the western two-thirds of the United States will be significantly drier by the 2030s, and that large parts of the nation may face an increasing risk of extreme drought. This is not about melting ice caps; it's about Dust Bowl-style drought within two decades.
""If the projections in this study come even close to being realized, the consequences for society worldwide will be enormous,"" Dr. Dai said.
As my fellow columnist Clyde Haberman noted the other day, two words were absent in the New York Senate debate on Sunday: Iraq and Afghanistan. Actually, despite all the noise in politics this year, there are many others. Heard much about the urban poor? And here are two others that have fallen off the table:ÊclimateÊchange.
When Barack Obama won the nomination, he said his election to the presidency would be historic on two issues: health care andÊclimateÊchange, a point when ""the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.""
Two years later, you can barely find the phrase ""climateÊchange"" on the Web sites of Democrats running for office, and for Republicans it has become an item of faith to be a skeptic on the science and a critic of cap-and-trade legislation meant to limit carbon emissions.
Despite debate, informed and less so, the scientific consensus has not changed. In May, the National Academies of Science reported to Congress that ""the U.S. should act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and develop a national strategy to adapt to the inevitable impacts ofÊclimateÊchange,"" because global warming is ""caused largely by human activities, and poses significant risks for -- and in many cases is already affecting -- a broad range of human and natural systems.""
But the politics have changed, recast as a Republican wedge issue based around opposition to cap-and-trade.
It's not hard to understand why. It's the economy, stupid, as never before. It's a Republican year, and this isn't a Republican issue.ÊClimateÊchange has never been a front-burner issue, and it's the ultimate nightmare to communicate: you don't see carbon in the air the way you see smokestack emissions. It's global, not local. The effects evolve over the long, long run. We can tune in 50 years from now and find out who was right, at which point it will be too late.
Anything portrayed as a tax is a loser this year, hence the fate of cap-and-trade, originally envisioned in the Reagan years as a business-friendly, market-based environmental approach.
And you can make the case that in some waysÊclimateÊawareness has gone mainstream. No one talks aboutÊclimateÊchange, but even Republicans voice support for clean energy and green jobs. So maybe there's progress toward what's being called a postpartisanÊclimateÊapproach that focuses on stimulating nonpolluting energy technology through incentives, innovation, direct investment and procurement policies.
""Given the economy, it's no surprise that people aren't rolling out of bed focused on rising seas and polar bears,"" said Cathy Duvall, national political director of the Sierra Club. ""But they are thinking about what it takes to create jobs for the future and how to make America a leader in the global economy and clean energy.""
Or maybe that's how we flatter ourselves as we focus on immediate disasters. There is plenty of concern about the economic future we're leaving for our children. As for urgency about the planet we're leaving them, that can slide until a more convenient time."
"Foreign, Thursday, January 21, 2010, p. A 8",U.N. Official SaysÊClimateÊDeal Is at Risk,"By JOHN M. BRODER and ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Elisabeth Rosenthal from New York.","WASHINGTON - Just a month after world leaders fashioned a tentative and nonbinding agreement at theÊclimateÊchange summit meeting in Copenhagen, the deal already appears at risk of coming undone, the top United NationsÊclimateÊofficial warned on Wednesday.",,"Fewer than two dozen countries have even submitted letters saying they agree to the terms of the three-page accord. And there has been virtually no progress on spelling out the terms of nearly $30 billion in short-term financial assistance promised to those countries expected to be hardest hit byÊclimateÊchange. Still unresolved are such basic questions as who will donate how much, where the money will go and who will oversee the spending.
After a contentious two-week conference in the Danish capital last month, representatives of more than 190 nations issued a skeletal document, known as the Copenhagen Accord, that setsÊclimate-related goals for developed and developing countries, but without enforceable targets or timetables. The participants failed to agree to even the minimum expectation of the meeting: setting a firm deadline for negotiating a binding internationalÊclimateÊchange treaty.
In his first news conference and interview since the conference, Mr. de Boer said he remained hopeful that the near-failure at Copenhagen would produce meaningful results as the year progressed and the parties resumed negotiations.
After a month during which many participants expressed disappointment at the outcome and ascribed blame to various actors, Mr. de Boer described the next several weeks as a ""cooling-off period that gives countries useful time to work with each other.""
Next week, for example, the major developing countries that helped fashion the agreement -- China, India, Brazil and South Africa -- will meet in New Delhi to review the Copenhagen agreement and plan for the next phase of talks. None of them have yet inscribed their plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the Copenhagen document, Mr. de Boer said. Without a commitment to such plans, a major accomplishment at Copenhagen -- pledges by large polluters in the developing world to cut emissions -- will have been thwarted.
Mr. de Boer said several officials from those countries had told him that they negotiated the accord with the understanding that it would be formally adopted by all the nations at the conference. But in a raucous conclusion to the meeting in the early hours of Dec. 19, the conference agreed only to ""take note"" of the accord, not to endorse it. And five nations dissented even from that.
Mr. de Boer said he expected a number of countries to miss the Jan. 31 deadline, and he would not predict that they would ultimately submit their plans.
""Whether those countries do in fact decide to associate with it remains to be seen,"" he said.
Connie Hedegaard, the former Danish environment minister who is soon to become the European Union's commissioner forÊclimateaction, said it was critical for the United States and the large emerging economies to formally inscribe their pollution-reduction targets in the accord.
""I think much will depend on how countries treat that deadline,"" she said. ""If only Europe and Japan come up with plans, then you have a very different situation than if the U.S. and major emerging economies all step up.""
Todd Stern, the chief AmericanÊclimateÊnegotiator, said the United States fully intended to enshrine in the accord its declared target of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2020. He, too, said it was ""incredibly important"" for all the other major emitters to submit their public pledges for inclusion.
But he also said that success of the accord hinged on the creation of a rigorous and enforceable system of monitoring and verifying emissions-reduction programs. The accord calls for such a system, but does not provide details.
The nations of the world, Mr. de Boer said, are counting on President Obama to follow through on the emissions-reduction pledge he made at Copenhagen, despite Congress's reluctance to pass an ambitiousÊclimateÊbill. ""Any self-respecting person,"" he said, ""would well like to deliver on what we promise."""
"National, Thursday, March 4, 2010, p. A 1",Darwin Foes Add Warming To Target List,By LESLIE KAUFMAN,"Critics of the teaching of evolution in the nation's classrooms are gaining ground in some states by linking the issue to global warming, arguing that dissenting views on both scientific subjects should be taught in public schools.",,"The bill, which has yet to be voted on, is patterned on even more aggressive efforts in other states to fuse such issues. In Louisiana, a law passed in 2008 says the state board of education may assist teachers in promoting ""critical thinking"" on all of those subjects.
Last year, the Texas Board of Education adopted language requiring that teachers present all sides of the evidence on evolution and global warming.
Oklahoma introduced a bill with similar goals in 2009, although it was not enacted.
The linkage of evolution and global warming is partly a legal strategy: courts have found that singling out evolution for criticism in public schools is a violation of the separation of church and state. By insisting that global warming also be debated, deniers of evolution can argue that they are simply championing academic freedom in general.
Yet they are also capitalizing on rising public resistance in some quarters to accepting the science of global warming, particularly among political conservatives who oppose efforts to rein in emissions of greenhouse gases.
In South Dakota, a resolution calling for the ""balanced teaching of global warming in public schools"" passed the Legislature this week.
""Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant,"" the resolution said, ""but rather a highly beneficial ingredient for all plant life.""
The measure made no mention of evolution, but opponents of efforts to dilute the teaching of evolution noted that the language was similar to that of bills in other states that had included both. The vote split almost entirely along partisan lines in both houses, with Republican voting for it and Democrats voting against.
For mainstream scientists, there is no credible challenge to evolutionary theory. They oppose the teaching of alternative views like intelligent design, the proposition that life is so complex that it must be the design of an intelligent being. And there is wide agreement among scientists that global warming is occurring and that human activities are probably driving it. Yet many conservative evangelical Christians assert that both are examples of scientists' overstepping their bounds.
John G. West, a senior fellow with the Discovery Institute in Seattle, a group that advocates intelligent design and has led the campaign for teaching critiques of evolution in the schools, said that the institute was not specifically promoting opposition to accepted science onÊclimateÊchange. Still, Mr. West said, he is sympathetic to that cause.
""There is a lot of similar dogmatism on this issue,"" he said, ""with scientists being persecuted for findings that are not in keeping with the orthodoxy. We think analyzing and evaluating scientific evidence is a good thing, whether that is about global warming or evolution.""
Lawrence M. Krauss, a physicist who directs the Origins Initiative at Arizona State University and has spoken against efforts to water down the teaching of evolution to school boards in Texas and Ohio, described the move towardÊclimate-change skepticism as a predictable offshoot of creationism.
""Wherever there is a battle over evolution now,"" he said, ""there is a secondary battle to diminish other hot-button issues like Big Bang and, increasingly,ÊclimateÊchange. It is all about casting doubt on the veracity of science -- to say it is just one view of the world, just another story, no better or more valid than fundamentalism.""
Not all evangelical Christians reject the notion ofÊclimateÊchange, of course. There is a budding green evangelical movement in the country driven partly by a belief that because God created the earth, humans are obligated to care for it.
Yet there is little doubt that the skepticism about global warming resonates more strongly among conservatives, and Christian conservatives in particular. A survey published in October by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that white evangelical Protestants were among those least likely to believe that there was ""solid evidence"" that the Earth was warming because of human activity.
Only 23 percent of those surveyed accepted that idea, compared with 36 percent of the American population as a whole.
The Rev. Jim Ball, senior director forÊclimateÊprograms at the Evangelical Environmental Network, a group with members who accept the science of global warming, said that many of the deniers feel that ""it is hubris to think that human beings could disrupt something that God created.""
""This group already feels like scientists are attacking their faith and calling them idiots,"" he said, ""so they are likely to be skeptical"" about global warming.
State Representative Tim Moore, a Republican who introduced the bill in the Kentucky Legislature, said he was motivated not by religion but by what he saw as a distortion of scientific knowledge.
""Our kids are being presented theories as though they are facts,"" he said. ""And with global warming especially, there has become a politically correct viewpoint among educational elites that is very different from sound science.""
The evolution curriculum has developed far more than instruction onÊclimateÊchange. It is almost universally required in biology classes, while the science of global warming, a newer topic, is taught more sporadically, depending on the interest of teachers and school planners.
But interest in makingÊclimateÊchange a standard part of school curriculum is growing. Under President Obama, for example, theÊClimateÊEducation Interagency Working Group, which represents more than a dozen federal agencies, is making a strong push toward ""climateÊliteracy"" for teachers and students.
State Representative Don Kopp, a Republican who was the main sponsor of the South Dakota resolution, said he acted in part because ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" a documentary film on global warming starring Al Gore, was being shown in some public schools without a counterweight.
The legal incentive to pair global warming with evolution in curriculum battles stems in part from a 2005 ruling by a United States District Court judge in Atlanta that the Cobb County Board of Education, which had placed stickers on certain textbooks encouraging students to view evolution as only a theory, had violated First Amendment strictures on the separation of church and state.
Although the sticker was not overtly religious, the judge said, its use was unconstitutional because evolution alone was the target, which indicated that it was a religious issue.
After that, said Joshua Rosenau, a project director for the National Center for Science Education, he began noticing that attacks onÊclimateÊchange science were being packaged with criticism of evolution in curriculum initiatives.
He fears that even a few state-level victories could have an effect on what gets taught across the nation.
James D. Marston, director of the Texas regional office of the Environmental Defense Fund, said he worried that, given Texas' size and centralized approval process, its decision on textbooks could have an outsize influence on how publishers prepare science content for the national market.
""If a textbook does not give enough deference to critics ofÊclimateÊchange -- or does not say that there is real scientific debate, when in fact there is little to none -- they will have a basis for turning it down,"" Mr. Marston said of the Texas board. ""And that is scary for what our children will learn everywhere."""
"Foreign, Saturday, November 6, 2010, p. A 6",Panel Offers Ways to Raise Cash to Cope WithÊClimate,By NEIL MacFARQUHAR,"UNITED NATIONS -- After grappling with a fundamental deadlock between rich and poor nations overÊclimateÊchange, a high-level United Nations panel on Friday proposed a smorgasbord of ways to raise $100 billion annually to help developing countries cope with global warming.",,"The solutions face considerable hurdles, not least the United States' resistance to putting a market price on carbon emissions, a cornerstone of the panel's report.
""We have narrowed down the different options,"" Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg of Norway, co-chairman of the panel, said in an interview. ""We have not made a blueprint where we solve all issues related toÊclimateÊfinancing.""
International leaders agreed at the contentious meeting in Copenhagen in December that the developed world would come up with $100 billion a year by 2020 to help alleviate the affects ofÊclimateÊchange in the developing world. But there was little consensus on where the money would come from, particularly during an economic crisis.
The attitude of the developing nations was that the industrialized world caused the pollution, so the richer states should cut a check for reparations and another check to help pursue clean development. The richer nations balked at the prospect.
Some of those differences remain in the report: the developing world thinks the financing should come in the form of public aid, whereas the developed world wants to rely heavily on private investment, for example. The differences were indeed on display during the release of the report.
""As Africans, we've contributed virtually nothing to the environmental mess our planet is in,"" said Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, the other co-chairman, addressing a news conference by video link from his country. ""The prospects for sanity and justice do not appear good, but I refuse to give up.""
Among other things, the money would be needed to improve irrigation and other agriculture methods affected by changingÊclimate, to bolster coastlines threatened by rising seas or to preserve forests that help absorb greenhouse gases.
Mr. Stoltenberg said that he did not expect the panel's recommendations to be endorsed wholesale at theÊclimateÊchange talks next month in Mexico, but that they should help move the process forward and perhaps lay the foundation for an international fund for potential revenues.
Environmental advocates endorsed the findings as a sign that the deadlock over financing could be resolved, if not immediately. ""It shows that you can raise the money,"" said Steve Howard, the founder of theÊClimateÊGroup, an organization pushing for aÊ- agreement. ""It shows thatÊclimateÊfinances are firmly on the table.""
The 21-member United Nations panel included Lawrence H. Summers, the White House's departing national economics adviser; the billionaire financier George Soros; Ernesto Cordero Arroyo, the finance minister of Mexico; and Christine Lagarde, the French economic minister.
Both the panel leaders and the advocates say the next challenge will be generating the political will to follow suggestions like levies on international transportation that airlines and shipping companies of richer nations would have to pay
But not every nation has to agree on every suggestion, Mr. Stoltenberg said, and advocates praised the panel for at least producing ideas. ""They have laid out a menu,"" said David Waskow, a senior adviser onÊclimateÊchange for Oxfam. ""What governments and political leaders need to do now is to take items off that menu and create a meal."""
"Foreign, Saturday, December 11, 2010, p. A 12",Negotiators at GlobalÊClimateÊTalks Continue Past the Deadline for an Agreement,By JOHN M. BRODER; John Collins Rudolf contributed reporting from New York.,"CANCUN, Mexico -- Negotiators blew past a self-imposed deadline for reaching an agreement at the United Nations conference onÊclimateÊchange here on Friday, working into the night to try to piece together a package acceptable to the nearly 200 participating countries.",,"TheÊclimateÊconference was concluding on the same day that NASA announced that the past 12 months had produced the highest land and ocean temperatures ever recorded. The data mean that 2010 is likely to pass 2005 as the warmest year since detailed records have been kept.
In this seaside resort, the complex texts produced by negotiators over the past two weeks still needed the approval of the delegates, a process expected to prolong the conference deep into the night. There was no certainty that they would win the consensus that the United Nations process requires.
As debate opened late Friday, Todd Stern, the AmericanÊclimateÊenvoy, urged delegates to adopt the proposal, calling it a balanced package that lays the groundwork for future progress. ""So let's get this deal done and put the world on a path for a low-emissions and more sustainable future,"" he said.
Patricia Espinosa, the foreign secretary of Mexico and the chairwoman of the talks, had hoped to wrap up the negotiations by 6 p.m. But that deadline passed as the negotiators weighed new language that most of them did not see until late in the afternoon.
At stake was not just the success or failure of this conference, the 16th annual meeting under the United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange. Many delegates and analysts warned that failure to reach some sort of accord, even a modest, face-saving deal that pushes the tough questions off into the future, could doom the entire process.
""If we do not get things done here in Cancun, it's very difficult to see how you get from A to B,"" said Connie Hedegaard, the European Union's topÊclimateÊnegotiator. ""If we leave Cancun without getting anything out of this, I think multilateralism has a problem.""
China and the United States, the world's largest emitters of heat-trapping gases, appeared to have agreed Friday night on a formula for ensuring that all nations were adhering to their pledges to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. The accord sets standards for reporting actions each country is taking to cut its emissions, with requirements for detailed statements of data, economic assumptions and methodology. That seemed to satisfy American concerns that countries could manipulate the emissions and economic data they submitted for international review.
As technical experts worked on details and diplomatic language, many of the participants were asking broader questions about the future of the talks, which have yet to produce an effective and binding agreement.
""ClimateÊchange is a long-term problem that won't be addressed in one meeting or one agreement,"" said Robert N. Stavins, director of the environmental economics program at Harvard University and a longtime observer of the United Nations process. ""Countries are already taking actions on their own and moving toward international cooperation on these issues. That may be a more productive course than a single, stand-alone, top-down agreement.""
TheÊclimateÊitself was not waiting for the outcome of the talks. An analysis of average global temperatures released Friday by NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies shows that 2010 has so far been the warmest year in its 130-yearÊclimateÊrecord. The record-breaking temperatures appeared due to a combination of man-madeÊclimateÊchange and a natural warming pattern in the tropical Pacific Ocean earlier this year caused by El Nino, according to Kevin Trenberth, head ofÊclimateÊanalysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
The year was marked by extreme weather events, from a record-breaking heat wave in Russia in July to the dramatic floods in Pakistan. High sea temperatures were also blamed for a global bleaching of coral reefs.
A cold snap under way in Britain and northern Europe was unusual, but would do little to alter global average temperatures for the year, said James Hansen, director of the Goddard Institute. ""This regional cold spell has caused widespread commentary that global warming has ended,"" Dr. Hansen said. ""That is hardly the case."""

A 1",Consensus onÊClimateÊChange Ends at the TV Weather Desk,By LESLIE KAUFMAN,"The debate over global warming has created predictable adversaries, pitting environmentalists against industry and coal-state Democrats against coastal liberals.",,"Climatologists, who study weather patterns over time, almost universally endorse the view that the earth is warming and that humans have contributed toÊclimateÊchange. There is less of a consensus among meteorologists, who predict short-term weather patterns.
Joe Bastardi, for example, a senior forecaster and meteorologist with AccuWeather, maintains that it is more likely that the planet is cooling, and he distrusts the data put forward byÊclimateÊscientists as evidence for rising global temperatures.
""There is a great deal of consternation among a lot of us over the readjustment of data that is going on and some of the portrayals that we are seeing,"" Mr. Bastardi said in a video segment posted recently on AccuWeather's Web site.
Such skepticism appears to be widespread among TV forecasters, about half of whom have a degree in meteorology. A study released on Monday by researchers at George Mason University and the University of Texas at Austin found that only about half of the 571 television weathercasters surveyed believed that global warming was occurring and fewer than a third believed thatÊ  was ""caused mostly by human activities.""
More than a quarter of the weathercasters in the survey agreed with the statement ""Global warming is a scam,"" the researchers found.
The split betweenÊclimateÊscientists and meteorologists is gaining attention in political and academic circles because polls show that public skepticism about global warming is increasing, and weather forecasters -- especially those on television -- dominate communications channels to the public. A study released this year by researchers at Yale and George Mason found that 56 percent of Americans trusted weathercasters to tell them about global warming far more than they trusted other news media or public figures like former Vice President Al Gore or Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential candidate.
The George Mason-Texas survey found that about half of the weathercasters said they had discussed global warming on their broadcasts during chats with anchors, and nearly 90 percent said they had talked aboutÊclimateÊchange at live appearances at Kiwanis Club-type events.
Several well-known forecasters -- including John Coleman in San Diego and Anthony Watts, a retired Chico, Calif., weatherman who now has a popular blog -- have been vociferous in their critiques of global warming.
The dissent has been heightened by recent challenges toÊclimateÊscience, including the discovery of errors in the 2007 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange and the unauthorized release of e-mail messages from a BritishÊclimateÊresearch center last fall that skeptics say show thatÊclimateÊscientists had tried to suppress data.
""In a sense the question is who owns the atmosphere: the people who predict it every day or the people who predict it for the next 50 years?"" said Bob Henson, a science writer for the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, who trained as a meteorologist and has followed the divide between the two groups.
Mr. Henson added, ""And the level of tension has really spiked in recent months.""
The reasons behind the divergence in views are complex. The American Meteorological Society, which confers its coveted seal of approval on qualified weather forecasters, has affirmed the conclusion of the United Nations'ÊclimateÊpanel that warming is occurring and that human activities are very likely the cause. In a statement sent to Congress in 2009, the meteorological society warned that the buildup of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to ""major negative consequences.""
Yet,ÊclimateÊscientists use very different scientific methods from the meteorologists. Heidi Cullen, a climatologist who straddled the two worlds when she worked at the Weather Channel, noted that meteorologists used models that were intensely sensitive to small changes in the atmosphere but had little accuracy more than seven days out. Dr. Cullen said meteorologists are often dubious about the work ofÊclimateÊscientists, who use complex models to estimate the effects ofÊclimateÊtrends decades in the future.
But the cynicism, said Dr. Cullen, who now works forÊClimateÊCentral, a nonprofit group that works to bring the science ofÊ  to the public, is in her opinion unwarranted.
""They are not trying to predict the weather for 2050, just generally say that it will be hotter,"" Dr. Cullen said of climatologists. ""And just like I can predict August will be warmer than January, I can predict that.""
Three years ago, Dr. Cullen found herself in a dispute with meteorologists after she posted a note on the Weather Channel's Web site suggesting that meteorologists should perhaps not receive certification from the meteorological society if they ""can't speak to the fundamental science ofÊclimateÊchange.""
Resentment may also play a role in the divide. Climatologists are almost always affiliated with universities or research institutions where a doctoral degree is required. Most meteorologists, however, can get jobs as weather forecasters with a college degree.
""There is a little bit of elitist-versus-populist tensions,"" Mr. Henson said. ""There are meteorologists who feel, 'Just because I have a bachelor's degree doesn't mean I don't know what's going on.' ""
Whatever the reasons, meteorologists are far more likely to question the underlying science ofÊclimateÊchange. A study published in the January 2009 newsletter of the American Geophysical Union, the professional association of earth scientists, found that while nearly 90 percent of some 3,000 climatologists who responded agreed that there was evidence of human-drivenÊclimateÊchange, 80 percent of all earth scientists and 64 percent of meteorologists agreed with the statement. Only economic geologists who specialized in industrial uses of materials like oil and coal were more skeptical.
Seeing danger in the divide betweenÊclimateÊscientists and meteorologists, a variety of groups concerned with educating the public onÊclimateÊchange -- including the National Environmental Education Foundation, a federally financed nonprofit, and Yale -- are working to close the gap with research and educational forums. In 2008, Yale began holding seminars with weathercasters who are unsure about theÊclimateÊissue and scientists who are leading experts in the field. The Columbia Journalism Review explored the reasons for the split in an article this year.
Conversely, the Heartland Institute, a free-market research organization skeptical about the causes and severity ofÊclimateÊchange, is also making efforts to reach out. At its annual conference to be held in May in Chicago, the institute tried without success to put on a special session for the weather predictors.
""What we've recognized is that the everyday person doesn't come across climatologists, but they do come across meteorologists,"" said Melanie Fitzpatrick, aÊclimateÊscientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Meteorologists do need to understand more aboutÊclimateÊbecause the public confuses this so much. That is why you see efforts in this turning up."""
"National, Thursday, May 20, 2010, p. A 19",U.S. Science Body Urges Action on Climate,By JOHN M. BRODER; Leslie Kaufman contributed reporting from New York.,"WASHINGTON -- In its most comprehensive study so far, the nation's leading scientific body declared on Wednesday that   is a reality and is driven mostly by human activity, chiefly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.",,"Congress requested the reports in 2008. This is the first time the academy has issued specific recommendations on how to mitigate or adapt to climate change.
One of the reports, ""Limiting the Magnitude of Future Climate Change,"" urges the United States to set a greenhouse gas emissions ""budget"" that restricts overall emissions and provides a measurable goal for policy makers and for industry. It does not recommend a specific target but says the range put forward by the Obama administration and Congress is a ""reasonable goal.""
Legislation pending in Congress calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020.
The report says the most efficient way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to set a predictable and rising price. It does not explicitly recommend a cap-and-trade system, but says that such a system of tradable emissions permits would give industry more flexibility in meeting an emissions target or budget.
Another report, ""Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change,"" suggests that the United States and other nations begin planning for effects like rising sea levels and more severe storms and droughts. Increasing preparedness can be viewed as ""an insurance policy against an uncertain future,"" the report said, while inaction could impose large costs on future generations.
""These reports show that the state of climate-change science is strong,"" Ralph J. Cicerone, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a statement accompanying the reports. ""But the nation also needs the scientific community to expand upon its understanding of why climate change is happening and focus also on when and where the most severe impacts will occur and what we can do to respond.""
John P. Holdren, the science adviser to the Obama administration, was briefed on the report Tuesday night, researchers said.
The academy recommends that an interagency group be given the authority and the resources to coordinate national research and response. It notes that previous efforts have fallen short of providing the kind of action-oriented research that policy makers need.
Predictably, advocates of climate and energy legislation embraced the reports.
""These studies clearly demonstrate the urgency for Senate action,"" said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of a climate bill introduced in the Senate this month.
Peter Frumhoff, director of science and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists said: ""This report should light a fire under Congress. Lawmakers should stop dragging their feet, pay attention to the science and pass a bill this session."""
"Editorial, Monday, October 18, 2010, p. A 34",EDITORIAL,"In Climate Denial, Again","Former Vice President Dick Cheney has to be smiling. With one exception, none of the Republicans running for the Senate -- including the 20 or so with a serious chance of winning -- accept the scientific consensus that humans are largely responsible for global warming.",,"Some candidates are emphatic in their denial, like the Nevada Republican Sharron Angle, who flatly rejects ""the man-caused climate change mantra of the left."" Others are merely wiggly, like California's Carly Fiorina, who says, ""I'm not sure."" Yet, over all (the exception being Mark Kirk in Illinois), the Republicans are huddled around an amazingly dismissive view of climate change.
A few may genuinely believe global warming is a left-wing plot. Others may be singing the tune of corporate benefactors. And many Republicans have seized on the cap-and-trade climate bill as another way to paint Democrats as out-of-control taxers.
In one way or another, though, all are custodians of a strategy whose guiding principle has been to avoid debate about solutions to climate change by denying its existence -- or at least by diminishing its importance. The strategy worked, destroying hopes for Congressional action while further confusing ordinary citizens for whom global warming was already a remote and complex matter. It was also remarkably heavy-handed.
According to Congressional inquiries, White House officials, encouraged by Mr. Cheney's office, forced the Environmental Protection Agency to remove sections on climate change from separate reports in 2002 and 2003. (Christine Todd Whitman, then the E.P.A. administrator, has since described the process as ""brutal."")
The administration also sought to control or censor Congressional testimony by federal employees and tampered with other reports in order to inject uncertainty into the climate debate and minimize threats to the environment.
Nothing, it seemed, could crack the administration's denial -- not Tony Blair of Britain and other leaders who took climate change seriously; not Mrs. Whitman (who eventually quit after being undercut by Mr. Cheney, who worked for the energy company Halliburton before he became vice president and received annual checks while in office); and certainly not the scientists.
In 2007, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued its most definitive statement on the human contribution to climate change, Mr. Cheney insisted that there was not enough evidence to just ""sort of run out and try to slap together some policy that's going to try to solve the problem."" To which Mrs. Whitman, by then in private life, said: ""I don't see how he can say that with a straight face anymore.""
Nowadays, it is almost impossible to recall that in 2000, George W. Bush promised to cap carbon dioxide, encouraging some to believe that he would break through the partisan divide on global warming. Until the end of the 1990s, Republicans could be counted on to join bipartisan solutions to environmental problems. Now they've disappeared in a fog of disinformation, an entire political party parroting the Cheney line."
"Foreign, Saturday, February 27, 2010, p. A 6",Independent Board to Review Work of Top Climate Panel,By REUTERS,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia - An independent board of scientists will be appointed to review the workings of the world's top climatescience panel, which has faced recriminations over inaccuracies in a 2007 report, a United Nations environmental spokesman said Friday.",,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been under fire since it was pointed out that the 2007 report included a prediction that Himalayan glaciers would vanish by 2035, although there is no scientific consensus to that effect.
That brief citation -- drawn from a magazine interview with a glaciologist who says he was misquoted -- and sporadic criticism of the panel's leader have fueled skepticism in some quarters about the science underlying climate change. The climate panel's assessments are a crucial source of guidance for policy makers addressing global warming.
But mainstream scientists and the United Nations have said repeatedly that the evidence that human activity is a major factor in global warming remains unshaken.
Mr. Nuttall said the review body would be made up of ""senior scientific figures"" who could perhaps produce a report by late summer for consideration at a meeting of the climate panel in October in South Korea.
He said that several countries had made clear at the meeting here in Bali that they would prefer that the review panel be appointed by an independent group of scientists rather than the climate panel. He said that plans for assembling the panel would be announced next week.
""I think we are bringing some level of closure to this issue,"" Mr. Nuttall said.
One area to be examined is whether the panel should incorporate so-called gray literature, a term to describe nonpeer-reviewed science, in its reports.
Many scientists say that such material, ranging from reports by government agencies to respected research not published in scientific journals, is crucial to seeking a complete picture of the state of climate science.
Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, told reporters here this week that he did not support a ban on the use of gray literature and that the news media had overblown the climate panel's missteps.
The 2007 report on climate change cites more than 10,000 scientific papers and is more than 3,000 pages long."
"Foreign, Tuesday, February 2, 2010, p. A 10",Most Countries Submit Emission Reduction Targets by Deadline,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON - The climate change accord reached at Copenhagen in December passed its first test on Monday after countries responsible for the bulk of climate-altering pollution formally submitted their emission reduction plans, meeting the agreement's Jan. 31 deadline.",,"In all, 55 developed and developing countries submitted emission reduction plans to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body overseeing global negotiations. Two major nations -- Mexico and Russia -- had not submitted plans as of Monday evening.
United Nations officials said that the countries that have already filed plans account for 78 percent of greenhouse gas emissions globally.
The so-called Copenhagen Accord was pasted together in the final hours of the United Nations-sponsored climate summit meeting that ended Dec. 19. The skeletal agreement was not formally adopted by the conference, is not binding on the parties and sets no deadline for reaching a formal international climate change treaty.
Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations' climate change office, said that the submissions showed that the commitment to confront climate change on the part of the world's nations was ""beyond doubt,"" but he urged countries to do more.
""Greater ambition is required to meet the scale of the challenge,"" he said.
Analysts said that even if all nations met their promises, the world would still be on a path to exceed the Copenhagen agreement's central goal of limiting global warming to less than 3.6 degrees above the pre-industrial era.
""The pledges put on the table to date do not put us on track to meet that goal and will make it very difficult for us politically and technically beyond 2020 to meet that target,"" said Alden Meyer, director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Other aspects of the accord remain unresolved, including the question of financial aid for developing nations to adapt to climatechanges and develop sustainable growth plans. The wealthy nations pledged nearly $30 billion in short-term support, but there is no mechanism in place to collect or distribute the money. Longer-term aid pledges remain just a concept.
Nonetheless, it was the first time that major developing nations, whose emissions are growing more quickly than the rest of the world's, put on paper their plans for slowing production of carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to a warming planet.
China said it would reduce its carbon intensity -- the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic activity -- by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with 2005 levels.
India said its carbon intensity would fall by 20 to 25 percent over the same period.
South Korea set an intensity target of 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.
Raekwon Chung, the South Korean ambassador for climate change, said that his nation's target was set into law in December and that the government was preparing plans to carry it out.
He said South Korea planned to invest 2 percent of its gross domestic product, about $86 billion a year, in green growth programs, including low-carbon energy production, new transportation systems and higher-efficiency building codes.
The major industrialized powers also repeated earlier pledges. The European Union said its 27 members would cut emissions by 20 to 30 percent over 1990 levels by 2020. Japan's target is 25 percent over the same period.
The United States, in a submission last Thursday, repeated President Obama's promise to cut emissions ""in the range of"" 17 percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels -- but only if Congress enacts legislation that meets that goal, a far-from-certain prospect.
Jennifer Morgan, director of the World Resources Institute's climate and energy program, urged Congress to act quickly on - legislation, or risk seeing the United States fall further behind in the competition to develop new low-carbon sources of energy.
""The pledges made by countries like Japan, China, Europe and India show a commitment to collective, transparent action on a scale never seen before,"" she said in a statement. ""The United States should have no doubt that these countries plan to build their economies with clean energy."""
"Business/Financial, Thursday, January 28, 2010, p. B 1",S.E.C. Adds Risk Related to Climate To Disclosure List,By JOHN M. BRODER,WASHINGTON - The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday for the first time that public companies should warn investors of any serious risks that global warming might pose to their businesses.,,"The S.E.C., on a party-line 3-2 vote, issued ""interpretive guidance"" to help companies decide when and whether to disclose matters related to climate change. The commission said that companies could be helped or hurt by climate-related lawsuits, business opportunities or legislation and should promptly disclose such potential impacts. Banks or insurance companies that invest in coastal property that could be affected by storms or rising seas, for example, should disclose such risks, the agency said.
Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, who was appointed by President Obama, said that the commission was not creating new legal requirements for companies, nor did it intend to endorse any particular scientific or policy view of global warming. She said that including climate risks among other disclosures was a logical step.
""It is neither surprising nor especially remarkable for us to conclude that of course a company must consider whether potential legislation -- whether that legislation concerns climate change or new licensing requirements -- is likely to occur,"" Ms. Schapiro said in her opening statement before Wednesday's vote. ""Similarly, a company must disclose the significant risks that it faces, whether those risks are due to increased competition or severe weather. These principles of materiality form the bedrock of our disclosure framework.""
The agency took the action in response to petitions from environmental and investor groups that wanted specific recognition of climate change as an important factor in the present and future business environment.
""We're glad the S.E.C. is stepping up to the plate to protect investors,"" said Anne Stausboll, chief executive of the California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund and one of the parties that petitioned for the guidance. ""Ensuring that investors are getting timely, material information on climate-related impacts, including regulatory and physical impacts, is absolutely essential. Investors have a fundamental right to know which companies are well positioned for the future and which are not.""
According to an S.E.C. staff paper, the new guidance urges companies to consider, for example, whether any new law or international treaty limiting carbon dioxide emissions might increase operating costs and prompt a disclosure requirement. A company might also be well positioned to take advantage of a new law mandating increased production of renewable electricity, again requiring disclosure.
The two Republicans on the commission voted against the proposal, while all three Democrats voted for it. Commissioner Kathleen L. Casey, a Republican appointed by former President George W. Bush, called the new guidance unnecessary because the agency already required extensive disclosure of environmental factors. She also said the decision was driven by the political motives of advocacy groups.
""I can only conclude that the purpose of this release is to place the imprimatur of the commission on the agenda of the social and environmental policy lobby, an agenda that falls outside of our expertise and beyond our fundamental mission of investor protection,"" she said.
Ms. Casey said it made little sense to issue such guidance ""at a time when the state of the science, law and policy relating to climate change appear to be increasingly in flux.""
Ms. Schapiro and the commission staff were careful to avoid expressing an opinion on the issue of global warming itself. Ms. Schapiro emphasized that ""we are not opining on whether the world's climate is changing; at what pace it might be changing; or due to what causes. Nothing that the commission does today should be construed as weighing in on those topics."""
"Science, Tuesday, June 29, 2010, p. D 2",BOOKS ON SCIENCE,When the Day After Tomorrow Has Come,By CORNELIA DEAN,,"The crisis, your adviser tells you, is now.
What can you do?
Quite a bit, to hear some researchers tell it. They say it should be possible to ""geoengineer"" the planet to cool its increasingly raging greenhouse fever. But they say these possibilities must be tested now, so that when the world needs to act, the scientific community can offer responsible advice. Their ideas are the subject of a new book, ""Hack the Planet,"" by Eli Kintisch, a reporter for the journal Science.
Mr. Kintisch begins by describing a two-day meeting organized to discuss the ideas, held in 2007 in Cambridge, Mass. The meeting, under the auspices of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Harvard University, brought together researchers who have been thinking about these ideas for years -- some with enthusiasm, some with alarm.
Geoengineering is generally defined as the application of engineering techniques to alter the planet as a whole. As far as climate is concerned proposals fall into two groups.
The first involves removing carbon from the atmosphere by, say, fertilizing oceans with iron, to encourage the growth of plankton or algae. In theory, the plankton would absorb the carbon and, when they die, take it with them as they sink to the ocean floor. (As Mr. Kintisch relates, private groups have already experimented with this technique, in hopes of eventually selling credits to buyers eager to offset carbon emissions.)
The second approach involves reflecting solar radiation back into space by, say, spraying sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere to make the Earth, in effect, shinier.
But, as Mr. Kintisch relates, these remedies are not necessarily simple and even their easy-to-envision consequences can be alarming. For example, encouraging plankton growth would encourage the growth of the creatures that feed on plankton, potentially disrupting the ocean food web. Sulfates in the atmosphere might disrupt rainfall in some areas, causing droughts.
And then, of course, there are the ""unknown unknowns,"" things we won't even know we need to worry about until it is too late.
Plus, once some of these remedies are in place, they must be maintained indefinitely. Injecting sulfates into the atmosphere won't stop carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from accumulating there. So if the project is abandoned, Earth won't revert to its earlier temperatures. Instead, the intervening accumulation of atmospheric carbon could cause temperatures to zoom calamitously, virtually at once.
Also, of course, there is more to climate change than heat -- and engineering Earth's temperature will do nothing to reduce problems like changing chemistry in the oceans, which are acidifying as their carbon dioxide levels rise.
For some, the most worrisome thing about geoengineering is the idea that, once people know about it, they will think of it as a technological quick fix that makes it unnecessary to control emissions of greenhouse gases, an effort everyone takes pains to point out is by far the most important step to be taken now.
Still, if geoengineering is not yet an idea whose time has come, it is definitely gaining traction. It is discussed in two other new books, ""Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control,"" by James Rodger Fleming, a professor of science, technology and society at Colby College, and ""Coming Climate Crisis? Consider the Past, Beware the Big Fix,"" by Claire L. Parkinson, a NASA scientist whose specialty is polar sea ice and a forthcoming book, ""The Climate Fix,"" by Roger Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado.
For Dr. Fleming, whose book is a scholarly look at the history of weather modification and similar efforts, geoengineering proposals are ""untested, untestable and dangerous beyond belief."" He fits them neatly into what he calls ""a long tradition of imaginative and speculative literature involving the 'control' of nature."" But, as he notes, the ideas have drawn favor especially among conservatives and libertarians who look for technological rather than regulatory solutions for climate change.
Dr. Parkinson, whose book deals largely with the evidence that human actions are altering climates, notes that ""good intentions do not necessarily lead to good results."" So far, she writes, humanity's record of environmental manipulation does not inspire confidence.
In his discussion of geoengineering in ""The Climate Fix,"" Dr. Pielke argues that research into geoengineering techniques could advance scientists' understanding of the action of Earth's climate. But if the techniques are put into effect, ""unintended consequences are certain,"" he writes, adding ""there is no practice planet earth on which such technologies can be implemented, evaluated, and improved.""
His book will be published in the fall.
Mr. Kintisch makes the same point, in a way, beginning many of his chapters with tales of well-meaning efforts gone awry (species brought in to control pests that themselves become pests, irrigation projects that end up poisoning the soil and so on).
In March many of the participants in the Cambridge meeting joined other researchers at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, Calif., famed as the site of a 1975 meeting where biologists and others struck by the emerging power of DNA technology began work that eventually led to regulation of the work.
But if participants in this year's meeting hoped to do the same for geoengineering, they must be disappointed. Perhaps it is too soon to expect results especially since, in their own way, the technical issues surrounding geoengineering are at least as complex than those surrounding DNA. And the stakes are at least as high.
Meanwhile, there has been relatively little discussion so far about who would make geoengineering decisions -- would the world accept an American president in charge of the decision to go ahead? Assuming we could tune the Earth to a desirable temperature, who would say what that temperature would be? What side effects would be acceptable? Who would be compensated for suffering them. And so on.
I attended the Cambridge meeting Mr. Kintisch describes at the beginning of his book. Afterward, I talked to participants about what it would take to devise and implement any geoengineering plan the world's wildly diverse people and governments might buy into. And who would regulate it or police any ""rogue state,"" nonprofit or commercial venture ready to act on its own?
Participants I spoke with were at a loss. ""World government,"" one of them, finally, offered. The answer does not inspire confidence either.
All the while, humanity is already engaged in a gigantic geoengineering experiment, one that has been under way, however inadvertently, since people started large-scale burning of fossil fuels 150 years ago. So far, the world's efforts to act together on the problem have been, to be charitable, unimpressive.
The lesson, as all three authors put it, might therefore lie not in figuring out how to ""hack the planet"" but rather to change things so that planetary hacking will not be needed at all."
"Editorial, Sunday, November 28, 2010, p. WK 9",OP-ED CONTRIBUTORS,"To Fight Climate Change, Clear the Air",By VEERABHADRAN RAMANATHAN and DAVID G. VICTOR,,"Yet it is still possible to make significant progress. To give these talks their best chance for success, the delegates in Cancun should move beyond their focus on long-term efforts to stop warming and take a few immediate, practical actions that could have a tangible effect on the climate in the coming decades.
The opportunity to make progress arises from the fact that global warming is caused by two separate types of pollution. One is the long-term buildup of carbon dioxide, which can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. Diplomacy has understandably focused on this problem because, without deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, there can be no permanent solution to warming.
The carbon dioxide problem is hard to fix, however, because it comes mainly from the burning of fossil fuels, which is so essential to modern life and commerce. It will take decades and trillions of dollars to convert all the world's fossil-fuel-based energy systems to cleaner systems like nuclear, solar and wind power. In the meantime, a fast-action plan is needed.
But carbon dioxide is not the only kind of pollution that contributes to global warming. Other potent warming agents include three short-lived gases -- methane, some hydrofluorocarbons and lower atmospheric ozone -- and dark soot particles. The warming effect of these pollutants, which stay in the atmosphere for several days to about a decade, is already about 80 percent of the amount that carbon dioxide causes. The world could easily and quickly reduce these pollutants; the technology and regulatory systems needed to do so are already in place.
Take methane, for example, which is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in causing warming. It is emitted by coal mines, landfills, rice paddies and livestock. And because it is the main ingredient in natural gas, it leaks from many older natural-gas pipelines. With relatively minor changes -- for example, replacing old gas pipelines, better managing the water used in rice cultivation (so that less of the rice rots) and collecting the methane emitted by landfills -- it would be possible to lower methane emissions by 40 percent. Since saved methane is a valuable fuel, some of this effort could pay for itself.
Unfortunately, the accounting systems used in climate diplomacy are cumbersome and offer relatively few incentives for countries to make much effort to control methane.
Big cuts are also possible in hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, many of which are used as refrigerants in air-conditioners and other cooling systems. The most troubling of the short-lived HFCs were invented to replace chlorofluorocarbons, refrigerants that were thinning the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, and were also a major warming agent. Chlorofluorocarbons were regulated under the Montreal Protocol starting in 1987.
The warming effect of these HFCs is at least 1,000 times that of carbon dioxide. Unless they are regulated as chlorofluorocarbons have been, their warming effect will increase substantially in the coming decades.
Shifting from HFCs to substitutes that are 100 times less potent as climate warmers could offset nearly a decade's increase in warming that is expected from rising emissions of carbon dioxide. The delegates in Cancun would need only to ask that the Montreal Protocol take on the further authority to regulate HFCs.
From a political point of view, the most appealing greenhouse emissions to reduce are ozone and soot, because they contribute so much to local air pollution. After all, people everywhere care about the quality of the air they breathe and see -- even if most of them are not yet very worried about global warming. A desire to clean up the air is a rare point of commonality between developing and industrialized nations.
Ozone, which is formed in the lower atmosphere from carbon monoxide, methane and other gases emitted by human activity, is a particularly hazardous component of urban smog. And every year it causes tens of billions of dollars in damage to crops worldwide. So pollution restrictions that reduce ozone levels, especially in the rapidly growing polluted cities of Asia, could both clear the air and slow warming.
Soot likewise offers an opportunity to marry local interests with the global good. A leading cause of respiratory diseases, soot is responsible for some 1.9 million deaths a year. It also melts ice and snow packs. Thus, sooty emissions from Asia, Europe and North America are helping to thin the Arctic ice. And soot from India, China and a few other countries threatens water supplies fed by the Himalayan-Tibetan glaciers.
New air pollution regulations could help reduce soot. Such laws in California have cut diesel-soot emissions in that state by half. In China and India, a program to improve power generation, filter soot from diesel engines, reduce emissions from brick-making kilns and provide more efficient cookstoves could cut the levels of soot in those regions by about two-thirds -- and benefit countries downwind as well.
Reducing soot and the other short-lived pollutants would not stop global warming, but it would buy time, perhaps a few decades, for the world to put in place more costly efforts to regulate carbon dioxide. And it would help the major economies demonstrate credibility on climate change, which has been in short supply in the diplomatic talks so far.
The impasse that was evident in Copenhagen last year and is likely to reappear in Cancun arises in part from the inability of China, India, Europe and the United States to show that they are adopting practical measures to slow climate change. Agreeing on a shared strategy to curtail short-lived pollutants would be a good way for all of them to start.
Credibility is especially important for the United States. It can already offer the world much of the technology and regulatory expertise that will be needed to reduce short-lived pollutants, particularly ozone and soot. Some American efforts are under way to share these technologies, including a program to help provide better cookstoves for people in developing countries. By making such programs more visible and demonstrating that they deliver tangible results, and by establishing a realistic plan for cutting its own emissions at home, the United States could show that it is serious about addressing climate change.
For too long, overly ambitious global climate talks have focused on the aspects of global warming that are hardest to solve. A few more modest steps, with quick and measurable effects, are a better way to proceed."
"Foreign, Thursday, February 4, 2010, p. A 10",Researcher On Climate Is Cleared In Inquiry,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON - An academic board of inquiry has largely cleared a noted Pennsylvania State University climatologist of scientific misconduct, but a second panel will convene to determine whether his behavior undermined public faith in the science of  , the university said Wednesday.",,"While the Pennsylvania State inquiry, conducted by three senior faculty members and administrators, absolved Dr. Mann of the most serious charges against him, it is not likely to silence the controversy over climate science. New questions about the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, to which Dr. Mann was a significant contributor, have arisen since the hacked e-mail messages surfaced last November.
That faculty board did not look into the science of climate change itself, the university said in announcing its results. That, it said, is ""a matter more appropriately left to the profession.""
Dr. Mann was named in 377 of the e-mail messages, including several that critics took to suggest that he had manipulated or destroyed data to strengthen his case that human activity was changing the global climate.
In the best-known message, he refers to a ""trick"" in a graph he produced a decade ago showing 1,000 years of essentially steady global surface temperatures followed by a sharp upward spike in the 20th century, seemingly corresponding to increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The so-called hockey stick graph has become an icon for environmentalists. It was prominently displayed in a 2001 United Nations report concluding that greenhouse gases from human activities had probably caused most of the warming measured since 1950.
In some of the e-mail messages, Dr. Mann refers to his assembly of data from a number of different sources, including ancient tree rings and earth core samples, as a ""trick."" Critics pounced on the term and said it was evidence that Dr. Mann and other scientists had manipulated temperature data to support their conclusions. But the Pennsylvania State inquiry board said the term ""trick"" was used by scientists and mathematicians to refer to an insight that solves a problem. ""The so-called trick was nothing more than a statistical method used to bring two or more different kinds of data sets together in a legitimate fashion by a technique that has been reviewed by a broad array of peers in the field,"" the panel said.
The e-mail messages also contained suggestions that Dr. Mann had hidden or destroyed e-mail messages and other information relating to a United Nations climate change report to prevent other scientists from reviewing them. Dr. Mann produced the material in question, and the Pennsylvania State board cleared him of the charge.
There were also questions about whether Dr. Mann misused confidential data and engaged in a conspiracy with like-minded scientists to withhold information from competing scholars. The board found nothing to support the charge.
Dr. Mann, in an e-mail response to a request for comment, said he was pleased that the panel had found ""no evidence of any of the allegations against me.""
""Three of the four allegations have been dismissed completely,"" he wrote. ""Even though no evidence to substantiate the fourth allegation was found, the University administrators thought it best to convene a separate committee of distinguished scientists to resolve any remaining questions about academic procedures. This is very much the vindication I expected since I am confident I have done nothing wrong.""
Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, a skeptic of climate change called for an independent investigation. ""We need to reassure the American people that their tax dollars are supporting objective scientific research rather than political agendas,"" he said."
"Foreign, Friday, May 28, 2010",Indonesia Agrees to Curb Commercial Deforestation,By AUBREY BELFORD,Indonesia has declared a two-year moratorium on clearing natural forests as part of a billion-dollar deal aimed at reviving efforts to fight climate change after the collapse of global talks in Copenhagen last year.,,"REDD projects are widely seen as among the most promising avenues for fighting climate change ever since nations failed to reach an agreement on climate change in Copenhagen last December. Indonesia's part in this deal involves banning new permits for the conversion of virgin forest and carbon-rich peat lands, though analysts say any new laws limiting commercial clearing could prove difficult to enforce.
The clearing of forests for commercial uses has helped make Indonesia the world's third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, behind the United States and China, according to some estimates. The country has major timber and paper industries and is the world's leading producer of palm oil.
""Indonesia understands the necessity of doing its part to face the urgent global challenge of combating climate change,"" said Indonesia's president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
""As a developing country, and an archipelago of 17,000 islands, our people face the brunt of impact of climate change,"" he said.
Mr. Yudhoyono has staked some of his international prestige on fighting climate change, most recently by pledging to cut emissions at least 26 percent by 2020.
But such pledges have often been met with skepticism, given Indonesia's high levels of corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency. The government has also been accused of sending out mixed signals. For example, it recently announced plans for a 4-million-acre agricultural development in the heavily forested eastern province of Papua.
""It will not be easy to enforce this,"" said Krystof Obidzinski, an expert at the Center for International Forestry Research, a nonprofit group in Indonesia.
The deal is a model for action pending a more comprehensive global climate agreement, Mr. Obidzinski said, but it could be hobbled by such basic challenges as confusion over what land can be considered virgin forest.
The deal, starting with pilot projects, would provide capital for projects that would help deter deforestation by increasing yields on existing cropland or by steering development to ""degraded"" land. But Mr. Obidzinski cautioned that much of the degraded land was still covered in forest.
Agus Purnomo, an adviser to Mr. Yudhoyono in at the conference, said the amount of forest land saved under the deal ""still needs to be calculated.""
Licenses already granted to clear peat land or virgin forest would be honored, Mr. Purnomo said. He said the deal included cooperative measures with Norway to root through corruption.
""It is not something we are sweeping under the carpet,"" Mr. Purnomo said. ""No, we are entering it with open eyes and we will go one-by-one, systematically addressing the issues. It will not happen within a year or two, it will take several years to come to a meaningful impact.""
Mr. Purnomo said Indonesia hoped to extend the moratorium beyond two years, but this would depend on increased international cooperation.
""We are not putting our local development as a sacrifice to the world. The world will also need to share the burden of finding alternatives of local development,"" he said."
"Editorial, Sunday, November 28, 2010, p. WK 9",OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,"On Global Warming, Start Small",By BRUCE USHER,,"Climate change is global, as emissions from one country enter the atmosphere and affect every other country. It is created by every form of economic activity, but its effects will not become critical for another generation. Today, it is practically impossible for more than 190 countries to negotiate -- and ultimately ratify -- an agreement that would affect all facets of their economies in order to deal with a problem so far in the future.
But there is an alternative to this top-down approach to climate change: a bottom-up strategy that stands a much better chance of working. Rather than count on international negotiations to produce an effective strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the United States should build upon the innovative clean-energy developments already under way in individual states. (Disclosure: I invest in clean energy in America and abroad.)
Texas alone produces more electricity through wind power than all but five countries. In California and Arizona, solar energy will soon provide electricity for three million homes. Geothermal energy plants are being built in Nevada. Michigan is making electric cars. And these are only the leaders. Iowa, Oregon and Illinois are also building wind power generators; New Jersey and Florida are investing in solar, and Maine in biomass.
These state-level efforts are already having national impact. Last year, renewable energy accounted for more than half of all the new power generation plants nationwide. Another 40 percent was from natural gas, which emits only half as much carbon dioxide as coal.
Clean energy has strong bipartisan support in the states. Of the 31 that already have laws requiring increased production of renewable energy, 11 are states that vote largely Republican, including Arizona, Kansas, Montana and Texas.
The United States still has a very long way to go to curtail emissions, but the states are heading in the right direction, and national energy policy must build on their efforts. Congress should extend federal financing, tax credits and loan guarantees for renewable energy projects and for upgrading transmission lines. It should also develop clear environmental standards for extracting natural gas from shale. The American desire for energy security and for new jobs creates an opportunity to pass an energy bill in the next Congressional session.
With such a national energy plan in place, the United States could negotiate a bilateral climate agreement with China. Together these two countries account for 42 percent of global emissions of carbon dioxide. By focusing on our shared interests -- innovation in clean energy technology, for example, and the need to develop ways to capture and store carbon dioxide from coal-burning utilities -- our two countries could agree to mutually reduce emissions.
Then, with a strong renewable energy industry at home and a climate agreement with China in hand, the United States would be in a good position to re-engage with the broader international community to negotiate a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions. And given such a sturdy foundation, any agreement coming out of those talks would have a good chance of ratification by Congress.
After more than a decade of international negotiations, it might seem as if working our way through these steps from the bottom up would be like starting over. But it makes no sense to pin all our hopes for averting climate change on a diplomatic process that is difficult to negotiate and impossible to ratify. An approach that begins with changes in domestic policy is far more realistic.
The United Nations would still have a critical role to play, because 65 percent of the needed reductions in emissions will have to be made in the developing world. The United Nations must help developing countries institute the policies that will enable them to finance and deploy low-carbon technologies.
During the two weeks of climate talks in Cancun, more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide will be released into the atmosphere worldwide, adding to the nearly 30 billion tons emitted since last year's failed meeting in Copenhagen. This top-down approach is not effective. A plan that works from the bottom up could achieve the goal of capping global emissions. Before more time runs out, let's start building on the local American success stories already in progress."
"Foreign, Thursday, July 8, 2010, p. A 9","Panel, in Report, Clears Scientists of RiggingÊClimateÊChange Data",By JUSTIN GILLIS,A British panel on Wednesday exonerated the scientists caught up in the controversy known as Climategate of charges that they had manipulated their research to support preconceived ideas about global warming.,,"The new report is the last in a series of investigations of leading British and AmericanÊclimateÊresearchers, prompted by the release of a cache of e-mail messages that cast doubt on their conduct and raised fresh public controversy over the science of global warming.
All five investigations have come down largely on the side of theÊclimateÊresearchers, rejecting a number of criticisms raised by global-warming skeptics. Still, mainstreamÊclimateÊscience has not emerged from the turmoil unscathed.
Some polls suggest that the recent controversy has eroded public support for action onÊclimateÊchange, complicating the politics of that issue in Washington and other world capitals. And leadingÊclimateÊresearchers have come in for criticism of their deportment, of their episodic reluctance to share data withÊclimateÊskeptics, and for not always responding well to critical analysis of their work.
""The e-mails don't at all change the fundamental tenets of the science,"" said Roger Pielke Jr., a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado. ""But they changed the notion that people could blindly trust one authoritative group, when it turns out they're just like everybody else.""
The researcher at the center of the controversy was Phil Jones, a leading climatologist who had headed the Climatic Research Unit of a British university, the University of East Anglia. He had stepped down temporarily pending results of the inquiry, but was reinstated on Wednesday to a job resembling his old one.
The university solicited and paid for the new report, whichÊclimateÊskeptics assailed. ""This is another example of the establishment circling the wagons and defending their position,"" said Myron Ebell, director of energy andÊclimateÊchange policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.
The Climatic Research Unit, often referred to as C.R.U., has played a leading role in efforts to understand the earth's pastÊclimate. Embarrassing e-mail messages sent by Dr. Jones and other scientists were purloined from a computer at the university in November and posted to the Internet, prompting a round of accusations.
Some of the scientists were forced to admit to poor behavior, such as chortling about the death of oneÊclimateÊskeptic. But were the researchers guilty of any scientific misconduct?
""On the specific allegations made against the behavior of C.R.U. scientists, we find that their rigor and honesty as scientists are not in doubt,"" said the new report, led by Muir Russell, a retired British civil servant and educator.
The University of East Anglia welcomed the findings on Wednesday, declaring that an unjust attack on its scientists had been found spurious. Dr. Jones -- who had said he considered suicide after the e-mail messages emerged -- issued a more muted statement, saying he needed time to reflect. ""We have maintained all along that our science is honest and sound, and this has been vindicated now by three different independent external bodies,"" Dr. Jones said.
Last week, the second of two reviews at Pennsylvania State Universityexonerated Michael Mann, a scientist there who was also a focus of the controversy.
The latest report was by no means a complete vindication. Echoing the findings of an earlier report by a parliamentary committee in London, the reviewers criticized the scientists at the Climatic Research Unit for consistently ""failing to display the proper degree of openness"" in responding to demands for backup data and other information under Britain's public-record laws.
On one of the most serious issues raised by the e-mail messages, the Russell panel did find some cause for complaint, but it did not issue the robust condemnation sought byÊclimateÊskeptics.
The issue involved a graphic for a 1999 United Nations report, comparing recent temperatures with those of the past. Dr. Jones wrote an e-mail message saying he had used a ""trick"" to ""hide"" a problem in the data. After the e-mail messages came out, Dr. Jones said he had meant ""trick"" only in the sense of a clever maneuver.
The Russell panel concluded that the data procedure he used was acceptable in principle, but should have been described more fully, and his failure to do so had produced a ""misleading"" graphic.
The issue involved an effort to reconstruct theÊclimateÊhistory of the past several thousand years using indirect indicators like the size of tree rings and the growth rate of corals. The C.R.U. researchers, leaders in that type of work, were trying in 1999 to produce a long-term temperature chart that could be used in a United Nations publication.
But they were dogged by a problem: Since around 1960, for mysterious reasons, trees have stopped responding to temperature increases in the same way they apparently did in previous centuries. If plotted on a chart, tree rings from 1960 forward appear to show declining temperatures, something that scientists know from thermometer readings is not accurate.
Most scientific papers have dealt with this problem by ending their charts in 1960 or by grafting modern thermometer measurements onto the historical reconstructions.
In the 1999 chart, the C.R.U. researchers chose the latter course for one especially significant line on their graph. This technique was what Dr. Jones characterized as a ""trick.""
The recent season of controversy included close scrutiny of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange, the United Nations body that produces a major review ofÊclimateÊscience every few years.
The Russell panel found little reason to question the advice that the British scientists had given to theÊclimateÊpanel, or the conclusions of that body. The panel declared in 2007 that the earth was warming and that human activity was the major reason.
However, small errors in the 2007 report keep coming to light. A review issued earlier this week by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found several, including a case in which the panel overstated the potential impact of global warming on fish catches.
The Netherlands agency also found that theÊclimateÊchange panel had tended to emphasize the negative effects of global warming while playing down positive ones, like greater tree growth in northern climates. It recommended better balance and a greater emphasis on fact-checking.
""The idea that these things could be perfect is a fallacy,"" said Gavin Schmidt, aÊclimateÊresearcher at Columbia University. Christopher B. Field, an ecologist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and a leader in the United NationsÊclimateÊbody, said he foresaw an opportunity ""to really do a better job in characterizing what we know and what we don't know"" in the group's next report, due in 2014.
Yet another evaluation of the panel's work is under way, with results due in August.
Dr. Pielke, who is largely persuaded by the mainstream consensus onÊclimateÊchange, has criticized bothÊclimateÊskeptics and the scientific community for the tone of their debate.
""It has been dominated for a number of years by people at the poles -- the most activist scientists emphasizing alarm, versus the most ardent skeptics saying we don't have to do anything,"" Dr. Pielke said. ""This recent controversy has opened the eyes of a lot of people to a much richer tapestry of views onÊclimateÊpolicy that are out there, which I think is a good thing."""
"Editorial, Monday, February 22, 2010, p. A 18",EDITORIAL,Climate Change,Yvo de Boer's resignation on Thursday after nearly four tumultuous years as chief steward of the United Nations' climate change negotiations has deepened a sense of pessimism about whether the world can ever get its act together on global warming. Mr. de Boer was plainly exhausted by endless bickering among nations and frustrated by the failure of December's talks in Copenhagen to deliver the prize he had worked so hard for: a legally binding treaty committing nations to mandatory reductions in greenhouse gases.,,"Yet his departure is hardly the death knell for international negotiations. It is not proof that such talks are of no value or that the U.N. negotiating framework in place since 1992 should be abandoned. Even Copenhagen, messy as it was, brought rich and poor nations closer together than they had been. And more than 90 countries representing 83 percent of the world's greenhouse gases promised, at least notionally, to reduce their emissions.
But his resignation does remind us that the U.N. process is tiring, cumbersome and slow. It reinforces the notion that some parallel negotiating track will be necessary if the world is to have any hope of achieving the reductions scientists believe are necessary to avert the worst consequences of climate change.
The Copenhagen pledges, even if all of them are met, will merely stabilize global emissions by 2020. What really matters is what happens after 2020, whether the world can achieve reductions of at least 50 percent by midcentury. That won't happen without big cuts by big emitters like the United States, the European Union, China, India and Brazil.
Even before Copenhagen, global leaders were exploring parallel tracks. Former President George W. Bush brought together some of the big emitters, and President Obama has expanded on this idea with the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, a group of 17 countries that plans to meet regularly. The Group of 20 has put climate change high on its agenda, and bilateral efforts -- technology exchanges between China and the United States, for instance -- are under discussion.
The underlying thought is that the ultimate goal is a safe planet, and that absent a top-down global treaty, that goal is probably best achieved by aggressive, bottom-up national strategies to reduce emissions. Not that these are a sure thing; the United States, embarrassingly, has no national strategy. Until it gets one, it can hardly lecture anyone else. Nor will the world stand a ghost of a chance of bringing emissions under control."
"Business/Financial, Thursday, November 4, 2010, p. B 5",Obama to Face New Foes In Global Warming Fight,By JOHN M. BRODER,WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and the new Congress appear headed for early confrontations over the reach of environmental regulation and federal subsidies for fossil fuel development.,,"Those initiatives have already generated bipartisan objections in both houses of Congress, and the numbers in opposition grew with Tuesday's voting. Many of the newly elected members have expressed skepticism about the existence of global warming and say they strongly oppose government action to combat it.
The presumptive new Republican speaker of the House, John A. Boehner of Ohio, has dismissed the idea that carbon dioxide is affecting the climate and has characterized cap and trade and other proposed solutions to global warming as job-killing energy taxes.
He and other Republican leaders in both houses, along with many Democrats and a number of state attorneys general, support measures to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, as it plans to do starting in January.
They will find fervent and well-financed support from business interests that fear the effect of such regulation on their cost of doing business. John Engler, the former Republican governor of Michigan and now president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said on Wednesday that the new Congress should assert stronger control over E.P.A., which, as he put it, ""is getting way outside its authority in trying to regulate that which cannot pass in the legislative process.""
Mr. Obama has clearly narrowed his ambitions on environmental and energy policy, scrapping any hope of enacting comprehensive legislation to deal with climate change and the nation's dependence on imported oil. He said he was not seeking confrontation with Congress over regulation of greenhouse gases.
""Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way"" Mr. Obama said in his press conference Wednesday. ""And I'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem. And I think the E.P.A. wants help from the legislature on this. I don't think that, you know, the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here. I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue's being dealt with.""
Instead of seeking a broad approach to energy and climate change, Mr. Obama said, he would look for smaller policy bites that could attract Republican support. He said he hoped to generate wide support in the new Congress for further development of electric vehicles, for converting some of the nation's heavy truck fleet to run on natural gas, for incentives for energy efficiency in buildings and appliances, and for more emphasis on renewable energy and nuclear power. He said such programs lead to innovation and can create thousands of jobs.
Tuesday's voting offered a brutal verdict for many of those members of the House who had voted for the cap-and-trade approach that Mr. Obama has now abandoned. Some three dozen House Democrats who supported the 2009 climate bill were turned out of office.
Supporters of the measure, sponsored by Democratic Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, noted that more than half of the 43 Democrats who voted against the measure also lost their seats, meaning that for most voters the election was not simply a referendum on the climate bill.
Even as voters in many states were issuing a rebuke to lawmakers who supported climate change legislation in Washington, the people of California, as is their custom, were moving in a different direction. They soundly defeated Proposition 23, an oil-industry-sponsored measure to gut the state's landmark global warming law that will set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions and create a trading system for pollution permits.
California voters also re-elected the Democrat Barbara Boxer to the Senate and returned a Democrat, Jerry Brown, to the governor's office -- both strong supporters of state and federal action on climate change.
A coalition of unions, environmental groups, Silicon Valley investors and people in the clean energy industry raised $25 million to defeat Proposition 23, which was written and financed by out-of-state oil companies.
Thomas F. Steyer, a San Francisco hedge fund billionaire who served as co-chairman of the group that campaigned against the proposition, said the nation would follow California's lead.
""When it comes to huge, significant change, the history of the United States is that it does not come from Washington, D.C.,"" Mr. Steyer said. ""It comes from people outside the capital, people much closer to the real world, who force change gradually, bit by bit. A change in this nation's energy economy is inevitable. The question is, how soon?"""
"National, Thursday, February 18, 2010, p. A 18",Environmentalists Cooling on Obama,By JOHN M. BRODER,WASHINGTON - There has been no more reliable cheerleader for President Obama's energy and climate change policies than Daniel J. Weiss of the left-leaning Center for American Progress.,,"The president's embrace of nuclear power was disappointing, and the wrong way to go about winning Republican votes, he said, adding that Mr. Obama should not be endorsing such a costly and potentially catastrophic energy alternative ""as bait just to get talks started with pro-nuke senators.""
The early optimism of environmental advocates that the policies of former President George W. Bush would be quickly swept away and replaced by a bright green future under Mr. Obama is for many environmentalists giving way to resignation, and in some cases, anger.
Mr. Obama moved quickly in his first months in office, producing a landmark deal on automobile emissions, an Environmental Protection Agency finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, a virtual moratorium on oil drilling on public lands and House passage of a cap-and-trade bill.
Since then, in part because of the intense focus on the health care debate last year, action on environmental issues has slowed. The Senate has not yet begun debate on a comprehensive global warming bill, the Interior Department is writing new rules to open some public lands and waters to oil drilling and the E.P.A. is moving cautiously to apply the endangerment finding.
Environmental advocates largely remained silent late last year as Mr. Obama all but abandoned his quest for sweeping - legislation and began to reach out to Republicans to enact less ambitious clean energy measures.
But the grumbling of the greens has grown louder in recent weeks as Mr. Obama has embraced nuclear power, offshore oil drilling and ""clean coal"" as keystones of his energy policy. And some environmentalists have expressed concern that the president may be sacrificing too much to placate Republicans and the well-financed energy lobbies.
Erich Pica, president of Friends of the Earth, whose political arm endorsed Mr. Obama's candidacy for president, said that Mr. Obama's recent policy emphasis amounted to ""unilateral disarmament.""
""We were hopeful last year; he was saying all the right things,"" Mr. Pica said. ""But now he has become a full-blown nuclear power proponent, a startling change over the last few months.""
Mr. Obama said in his remarks on the nuclear project this week that he knew his policies were alienating some environmentalists.
""Now, there will be those that welcome this announcement, those who think it's been long overdue,"" Mr. Obama said of the new nuclear loan guarantee. ""But there are also going to be those who strongly disagree with this announcement. The same has been true in other areas of our energy debate, from offshore drilling to putting a price on carbon pollution. But what I want to emphasize is this: Even when we have differences, we cannot allow those differences to prevent us from making progress.""
Mr. Obama has long supported nuclear power, as a senator and as a candidate for president. Employees of the Exelon Corporation, the Chicago-based utility that is the largest operator of nuclear plants in the United States, have been among Mr. Obama's biggest campaign donors, giving more than $330,000 over his career, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
In response to criticism of some of its energy policies, the White House points to its clean energy investments, including $80 billion in stimulus spending on energy-related projects, and its continuing support for comprehensive climate and energy legislation. But critics in the green movement say they wish the president would play a more active role in the climate debate.
""I think we all had higher hopes,"" said Bill Snape, senior counsel for the Center for Biological Diversity. ""We expected a lot in the first year, and everyone agrees they didn't quite live up to it. But there is recognition that he and the whole administration will get another stab at it.""
Mr. Snape said his group was particularly disappointed that the administration did not designate the polar bear as endangered by global warming and that it could not push a climate change bill through Congress.
""You can't get anything right,"" he said, ""unless you get the polar bear right.""
Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the administration's most stalwart supporters up to now, also expressed disappointment in the president's new focus on nuclear power and his mention in the State of the Union address of ""clean coal technologies.""
Mr. Obama was referring to the prospect of capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, an as-yet-unproven technology. He was sending a signal to members of Congress from states that are dependent on mining coal or that burn it for electricity that any legislation he supported would accommodate their concerns.
""N.R.D.C. knows there is no such thing as 'clean coal,' "" Ms. Beinecke wrote in a blog post after the State of the Union address. ""Every single step in the coal power cycle is dirty, from the profoundly destructive mountaintop removal mining to the smokestack emissions, which are responsible for 24,000 deaths a year.""
Eric Haxthausen, the United States climate policy director for the Nature Conservancy, has generally supported the administration's goals and actions on energy and environment, although he said they fell short of what was needed to address global warming.
He said that Mr. Obama's pledge at the United Nations conference in Copenhagen on climate change to reduce American emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared with 2005 levels had raised the stakes. The United States government is now on record promising the world that it will take major steps to reduce greenhouse gas pollution, Mr. Haxthausen said.
""What's needed to give this process life is a binding agent,"" he said, ""some force to bring these things together, and the White House has to be intimately involved. The reality is there's a bit of a bully pulpit role that's needed, and the question is, will the administration deliver."""
"Foreign, Thursday, March 11, 2010, p. A 11",Top Scientists to Review Findings of U.N. Climate Change Panel,By JOHN M. BRODER,"A group of top scientists from around the world will review the research and management practices of the United Nationsclimate change panel so that it can try to avoid the kinds of errors that have brought its work into question in recent months, officials said Wednesday.",,"The panel has come under sharp attack after revelations of several mistakes in its most recent report, published in 2007, including a poorly sourced and exaggerated account of how quickly the Himalayan glaciers are melting.
Scientists and officials say that the panel's finding that the earth is warming -- probably as a result of human activity -- remains indisputable. But critics have used the errors to raise doubts about the credibility of the entire 3,000-page study.
At a news conference at the United Nations, Mr. Ban said he was requesting an independent review of the panel to ensure that future reports are comprehensive and free of errors.
""Let me be clear,"" he said. ""The threat of climate change is real."" But he said it was critical that policy makers and the public received complete and impartial scientific evidence to inform any policies for addressing it.
The chairman of the climate change panel, Rajendra K. Pachauri, has also faced accusations of conflict of interest for serving as a paid board member of several profit-making energy and financial concerns. The payments go to a nonprofit research center he runs in New Delhi.
In an interview, Mr. Pachauri said that he and the hundreds of scientists who contributed to the panel's reports had been taken aback by the volume and intensity of criticism in recent months.
""We've been through a very critical period,"" he said. ""We've learned, we've listened and we've decided to do something about it. It is important for the public and scientific community to know that we're sensitive to what happened.""
He acknowledged that he and other climate scientists had done a ""lousy job"" of communicating what is known and not known about the behavior of the earth's climate and that they had not responded adequately to critics of their work.
The review will be led by Robbert H. Dijkgraaf, a Dutch physicist and mathematician who is co-chairman of the InterAcademy Council. The study group will be financed by the United Nations but will operate wholly independently, Mr. Dijkgraaf said at a briefing at the United Nations.
He said he was not certain how many members would serve in the group, but said they would represent a variety of scientific disciplines. He expects to complete the review by the end of August, before the I.P.C.C. officially begins work on its next scientific assessment report, which is to be completed in 2014.
He said that the group intended to look forward rather than backward and would make recommendations on how to assure the accuracy of the next assessment and on setting standards for the types of publications that can properly be cited.
But he also said that the review would include a look at the management of the climate change panel, including Dr. Pachauri's leadership.
""Our job is to ensure quality of I.P.C.C. reports in the future,"" Dr. Dijkgraaf said. ""We enter this process with no preconceived conclusions."""
"Editorial, Sunday, September 19, 2010, p. WK 9",OP-ED COLUMNIST,Aren't We Clever?,By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,,"What a contrast. In a year that's on track to be our planet's hottest on record, America turned ""climate change"" into a four-letter word that many U.S. politicians won't even dare utter in public. If this were just some parlor game, it wouldn't matter. But the totally bogus ""discrediting"" of climate science has had serious implications. For starters, it helped scuttle Senate passage of the energy-climate bill needed to scale U.S.-made clean technologies, leaving America at a distinct disadvantage in the next great global industry. And that brings me to the contrast: While American Republicans were turning climate change into a wedge issue, the Chinese Communists were turning it into a work issue.
""There is really no debate about climate change in China,"" said Peggy Liu, chairwoman of the Joint U.S.-China Collaboration on Clean Energy, a nonprofit group working to accelerate the greening of China. ""China's leaders are mostly engineers and scientists, so they don't waste time questioning scientific data."" The push for green in China, she added, ""is a practical discussion on health and wealth. There is no need to emphasize future consequences when people already see, eat and breathe pollution every day.""
And because runaway pollution in China means wasted lives, air, water, ecosystems and money -- and wasted money means fewer jobs and more political instability -- China's leaders would never go a year (like we will) without energy legislation mandating new ways to do more with less. It's a three-for-one shot for them. By becoming more energy efficient per unit of G.D.P., China saves money, takes the lead in the next great global industry and earns credit with the world for mitigating climate change.
So while America's Republicans turned ""climate change"" into a four-letter word -- J-O-K-E -- China's Communists also turned it into a four-letter word -- J-O-B-S.
""China is changing from the factory of the world to the clean-tech laboratory of the world,"" said Liu. ""It has the unique ability to pit low-cost capital with large-scale experiments to find models that work."" China has designated and invested in pilot cities for electric vehicles, smart grids, LED lighting, rural biomass and low-carbon communities. ""They're able to quickly throw spaghetti on the wall to see what clean-tech models stick, and then have the political will to scale them quickly across the country,"" Liu added. ""This allows China to create jobs and learn quickly.""
But China's capability limitations require that it reach out for partners. This is a great opportunity for U.S. clean-tech firms -- if we nurture them. ""While the U.S. is known for radical innovation, China is better at tweak-ovation."" said Liu. Chinese companies are good at making a billion widgets at a penny each but not good at complex system integration or customer service.
We (sort of) have those capabilities. At the World Economic Forum meeting here, I met Mike Biddle, founder of MBA Polymers, which has invented processes for separating plastic from piles of junked computers, appliances and cars and then recycling it into pellets to make new plastic using less than 10 percent of the energy required to make virgin plastic from crude oil. Biddle calls it ""above-ground mining."" In the last three years, his company has mined 100 million pounds of new plastic from old plastic.
Biddle's seed money was provided mostly by U.S. taxpayers through federal research grants, yet today only his tiny headquarters are in the U.S. His factories are in Austria, China and Britain. ""I employ 25 people in California and 250 overseas,"" he says. His dream is to have a factory in America that would repay all those research grants, but that would require a smart U.S. energy bill. Why?
Americans recycle about 25 percent of their plastic bottles. Most of the rest ends up in landfills or gets shipped to China to be recycled here. Getting people to recycle regularly is a hassle. To overcome that, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -- and next year, China -- have enacted producer-responsibility laws requiring that anything with a cord or battery -- from an electric toothbrush to a laptop to a washing machine -- has to be collected and recycled at the manufacturers' cost. That gives Biddle the assured source of raw material he needs at a reasonable price. (Because recyclers now compete in these countries for junk, the cost to the manufacturers for collecting it is steadily falling.)
""I am in the E.U. and China because the above-ground plastic mines are there or are being created there,"" said Biddle, who just won The Economist magazine's 2010 Innovation Award for energy/environment. ""I am not in the U.S. because there aren't sufficient mines.""
Biddle had enough money to hire one lobbyist to try to persuade the U.S. Congress to copy the recycling regulations of Europe, Japan and China in our energy bill, but, in the end, there was no bill. So we educated him, we paid for his tech breakthroughs -- and now Chinese and European workers will harvest his fruit. Aren't we clever?"
"National, Wednesday, November 24, 2010",China Sets Tough Line in Climate Talks,By IAN JOHNSON,"BEIJING -- Senior Chinese officials said on Tuesday that next week's climate talks in Cancun, Mexico, would succeed only if the West agreed to transfer technology to developing countries like China and to take the lead in cutting emissions.",,"Western countries pledged to set up such a fund but details have yet to be worked out. Mr. Xie said it would be the key to securing a deal to the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which is due to expire in 2012.
The positions reflect a long-standing view by developing countries, led by China, that they are largely not responsible for   -- which they say was caused by decades of western pollution -- and thus should not play a leading role in reversing it. Stated forcefully by China's chief climate officials, the comments reemphasized the challenge facing negotiators in Cancun as they try to reconcile the positions of the two camps.
""Developed countries need to take the lead in massively cutting their green house gas emission in order to give further development space to developing countries,"" Mr. Xie said. ""Developing countries in particular should be concerned about achieving tangible results with regard to funding and technology transfer issues.""
The United States, by contrast, wants developing countries to curb emissions and agree to international verification.
Mr. Xie called on developed countries to cut emissions by up to 40 percent and emphasized that China has already made huge strides in cutting pollution, even though its 30-year program of economic reforms have vaulted it to the forefront of industrialized nations. ""No single country or single block of countries has achieved that in history,"" Mr. Xie said. ""This is our big contribution to the international community.""
Despite China's growth, Mr. Xie said it remains a developing country and couldn't be treated like the United States or European countries with respect to climate change. ""We will never accept anything beyond our condition as a developing country,"" he said.
Mr. Xie noted that China had made pollution cuts such a priority that some local governments had made last-ditch efforts to meet pollution-reduction targets. This year some factories closed as officials tried to meet targets for reducing China's ""energy intensity"" -- the amount of power consumer per unit of economic output."
"Foreign, Tuesday, January 19, 2010, p. A 8",U.N. Panel's Glacier Warning Is Criticized as Exaggerated,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,A much-publicized estimate from a United Nations panel about the rapid melting of Himalayan glaciers from climate change is coming under fire as a gross exaggeration.,,"That date has been much quoted and a cause for enormous consternation, since hundreds of millions of people in Asia rely on ice and snow melt from these glaciers for their water supply.
The panel, the United Nations' scientific advisory body on climate change, ranks its conclusions using a probability scale in which ""very likely"" means there is greater than 90 percent chance that an event will occur.
But it now appears that the estimate about Himalayan glacial melt was based on a decade-old interview of one climate scientist in a science magazine, The New Scientist, and that hard scientific evidence to support that figure is lacking. The scientist, Dr. Syed Hasnain, a glacier specialist with the government of the Indian state of Sikkim and currently a fellow at the TERI research institute in Delhi, said in an e-mail message that he was ""misquoted"" about the 2035 estimate in The New Scientist article. He has more recently said that his research suggests that only small glaciers could disappear entirely.
The panel, which relies on contributions from hundreds of scientists, is considering whether to amend the estimate or remove it.
""The I.P.C.C. considers this a very serious issue and we're working very hard to set the record straight as soon as we can,"" said Christopher Field, co-chairman of the panel's section that was responsible for the report, which deals with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.
He noted that the potentially erroneous figure in question had appeared only in the panel's full report of more than 1,000 pages and had been omitted in later summary documents that the panel produced to guide policy. The summaries said only that the Himalayan glaciers ""could decay at very rapid rates"" if warming continued. Such documents are produced after panel members review a full-length report, although if a figure in the report is deemed to be in error, it is supposed to be removed.
Still, the revelation is the latest in a string of events that climate change skeptics have seized on to support their contention that fears about warming are unfounded, or at least overblown. Late last year, hackers obtained private e-mail messages from leading researchers at the University of East Anglia in England suggesting they were altering the presentation of some data in a way that emphasized the human influence on climate change.
The flawed estimate raises more questions about the panel's vetting procedures than it does about the melting of Himalayan glaciers, which most scientists believe is a major problem. But the panel's reports are the basis for global policy and their conclusions are widely heeded.
""The Himalayan glaciers will not disappear by 2035 -- that is an overstatement,"" said Dr. Bodo Bookhagen, an assistant professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara who studies the effect of climate change at high altitudes. ""That number somehow got incorporated into the I.P.C.C. report, and that probably shouldn't have happened.""
Still, he added: ""It is very clear that there is glacier retreat and that it has devastating impact.""
There is mounting proof that accelerating glacial melt is occurring, although the specifics are poorly defined, in part because these glaciers are remote and poorly studied.
At an international conference last year on Asia's glaciers, held at the University of California, San Diego, Yao Tandong, a Chinese glaciologist who specializes in the Tibetan Plateau, said, ""Studies indicate that by 2030 another 30 percent will disappear; by 2050, 40 percent; and by the end of the century 70 percent."" He added: ""Actually we don't know much about process and impacts of the disappearance. That's why we need an international effort."""
"Week in Review, Sunday, August 1, 2010, p. WK 4",Is It Hot in Here? Must Be Global Warming.,By TOM ZELLER Jr.,"In any debate over climate change, conventional wisdom holds that there is no reflex more absurd than invoking the local weather.",,"""Within psychology, it's called motivated reasoning, or the confirmation bias,"" explained Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Project on Climate Change Communication at Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ""People are looking for evidence of any kind that validates or reinforces or justifies what they already believe.""
Last February, for example, as a freak winter storm paralyzed much of the East Coast, relatives of Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who is a skeptic of climate change, came to Washington and erected an igloo.
They topped it with a cheeky sign asking passers-by to ""Honk if you global warming."" Another sign, added later, christened the ice dome ""Al Gore's new home.""
Environmentalists roundly criticized the stunt for relying on a fact as lonely as a snowstorm. ""Weather is our day-to-day experience, while climate is more static, describing a region's typical weather conditions as established over periods of time,"" explained Adrianna Quintero, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a blog post scolding the deniers.
Now, with record heat searing much of the planet from Minnesota to Moscow, people long concerned with global warming seem to be pointing out the window themselves.
""As Washington, D.C., wilts in the global heat wave gripping the planet, the Democratic leadership in the Senate has abandoned the effort to cap global warming pollution for the foreseeable future,"" wrote Brad Johnson at the progressive Wonk Room blog, part of the Center for American Progress.
Of course, it's probably not surprising that outspoken partisans sometimes use the weather as a rhetorical tool, but researchers are also learning that many less certain people unwittingly take note of temperatures, too.
Mr. Leiserowitz has identified what he and fellow researchers call ""Global Warming's Six Americas"" -- from people who are ""alarmed,"" ""concerned"" or merely ""cautious"" on climate change, to those who are ""disengaged,"" ""doubtful"" or wholly ""dismissive.""
For people at either extreme -- that is, those alarmed by or dismissive of climate change -- the local weather isn't going to have much influence, although they may use it conveniently to drive home a point.
But for those in the mushy middle -- about a third of the overall population -- the local weather, rightly or wrongly, influences their thoughts on the topic, often subconsciously.
That idea is reinforced by another study under review at the journal Psychological Science. Researchers at Columbia University found a high correlation between a participant's stance on global warming and how he perceived the outdoor temperature on the day he was asked about it. Study subjects were also more likely to say they would donate to a global warming charity on days they perceived to be unusually warm.
For Eric J. Johnson, the director of the Center for Decision Sciences at Columbia Business School and a co-author of the study, the findings highlight the pitfalls of policymaking by poll, given that opinions on such a complex issue appear susceptible to highly impertinent data.
""It's like assessing how the economy is doing by looking at the change in your pocket,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""It's relevant, but not that relevant.""
There is a not-insignificant caveat: Those pointing to hot weather as evidence of global warming are, in the broadest sense, more likely to be right. Scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado demonstrated last year that record high temperatures have occurred twice as often as record lows over the last decade.
That's in keeping with most models of global warming, which predict not a steady climb in temperature, but higher average readings over time -- and more record-breaking peaks than valleys.
Whether that makes it fair to consciously lean on the weather when it's convenient is an open question -- though it appears hard for either side to resist.
In 1988, James Hansen, a NASA climate scientist, spoke at a Senate hearing and famously thrust the issue of global warming on the national stage.
But he apparently had some help in making his point.
We ""went in the night before and opened all the windows, I will admit, right? So that the air-conditioning wasn't working inside the room,"" recalled Timothy Wirth, the former Democratic senator from Colorado, in an interview with ""Frontline"" in 2007.
Mr. Hansen was ""wiping his brow at the witness table,"" Mr. Wirth said, ""and giving this remarkable testimony."""
"Money and Business/Financial, Sunday, February 21, 2010, p. BU 6",ECONOMIC VIEW,A Small Price For a Large Benefit,By ROBERT H. FRANK,,"Organizers of the recent climate conference in Copenhagen sought, unsuccessfully, to forge agreements to limit global warming to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. But even an increase that small would cause deadly harm. And far greater damage is likely if we do nothing.
The numbers -- and there are many to choose from -- paint a grim picture. According to recent estimates from the Integrated Global Systems Model at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the median forecast is for a climb of 9 degrees Fahrenheit by century's end, in the absence of effective countermeasures.
That forecast, however, may underestimate the increase. According to the same M.I.T. model, there is a 10 percent chance that the average global temperature will rise more than 12.4 degrees by 2100, and a 3 percent chance it will climb more than 14.4 degrees. Warming on that scale would be truly catastrophic.
Scientists say that even the 3.6-degree increase would spell widespread loss of life, so it's hardly alarmist to view the risk of inaction as frightening.
In contrast, the risk of taking action should frighten no one. Essentially, the risk is that if current estimates turn out to be wildly pessimistic, the money spent to curb greenhouse gases wouldn't have been needed to save the planet. And yet that money would still have prevented substantial damage. (The M.I.T. model estimates a zero probability of the temperature rising by less than 3.6 degrees by 2100.)
Moreover, taking action won't cost much. According to estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a tax of $80 a metric ton on carbon dioxide -- or a cap-and-trade system with similar charges -- would stabilize temperatures by midcentury.
This figure was determined, however, before the arrival of more pessimistic estimates on the pace of global warming. So let's assume a tax of $300 a ton, just to be safe.
Under such a tax, the prices of goods would rise in proportion to their carbon footprints -- in the case of gasoline, for example, by roughly $2.60 a gallon.
A sudden price increase of that magnitude could indeed be painful. But if phased in, it would cause much less harm. Facing steadily increasing fuel prices, for example, manufacturers would scramble to develop more efficient vehicles.
Even from the existing menu of vehicles, a family could trade in its Ford Explorer, getting 15 miles per gallon, for a 32-m.p.g. Ford Focus wagon, thereby escaping the effect of higher gasoline prices. Europeans, many of whom already pay $4 a gallon more than Americans do for gasoline, have adapted to their higher prices with little difficulty.
In short, the cost of preventing catastrophic climate change is astonishingly small, and it involves just a few simple changes in behavior.
The real problem with the estimates is that the outcome may be worse than expected. And that's the strongest possible argument for taking action. In a rational world, that should be an easy choice, but in this case we appear to be headed in the wrong direction.
This strange state of affairs may be rooted in human psychology. As the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert put it in a 2006 op-ed article in The Los Angeles Times, ""Global warming is bad, but it doesn't make us feel nauseated or angry or disgraced, and thus we don't feel compelled to rail against it as we do against other momentous threats to our species, such as flag burning.""
People tend to have strong emotions about topics like food and sex, and to create their own moral rules around these emotions, he says. ""Moral emotions are the brain's call to action,"" he wrote. ""If climate change were caused by gay sex, or by the practice of eating kittens, millions of protesters would be massing in the streets.""
But the human brain is remarkably flexible. Emotions matter, but so does logic. Even though we did not evolve under conditions that predisposed us to become indignant about climate change, we can learn to take such risks more seriously. But that won't happen without better political leadership.
Senator James Inhofe, a Republican from Oklahoma, has said that ""the claim that global warming is caused by man-made emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science."" On compelling evidence, he's wrong. . Yet he and his colleagues have the power to block legislation on greenhouse gases.
WE don't know how much hotter the planet will become by 2100. But the fact that we face ""only"" a 10 percent chance of a catastrophic 12-degree climb surely does not argue for inaction. It calls for immediate, decisive steps.
Most people would pay a substantial share of their wealth -- much more, certainly, than the modest cost of a carbon tax -- to avoid having someone pull the trigger on a gun pointed at their head with one bullet and nine empty chambers. Yet that's the kind of risk that some people think we should take."
"National, Friday, March 26, 2010, p. A 13",'Cap and Trade' Loses Its Standing as Energy Policy of Choice,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON -- Less than a year ago, cap and trade was the policy of choice for tackling climate change.",,"Today, the concept is in wide disrepute, with opponents effectively branding it ""cap and tax,"" and Tea Party followers using it as a symbol of much of what they say is wrong with Washington.
Mr. Obama dropped all mention of cap and trade from his current budget. And the sponsors of a Senate climate bill likely to be introduced in April, now that Congress is moving past health care, dare not speak its name.
""I don't know what 'cap and trade' means,"" Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said last fall in introducing his original climate change plan.
Mr. Kerry's partner in promoting global warming legislation, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, pronounced economywide cap and trade dead last month and has since been working with Mr. Kerry to try to patch together a bill that satisfies the diverse economic, regional and ideological interests of the Senate.
That plan, still being written, will include a cap on greenhouse gas emissions only for utilities, at least at first, with other industries phased in perhaps years later. It is also said to include a modest tax on gasoline, diesel fuel and aviation fuel, accompanied by new incentives for oil and gas drilling, nuclear power plant construction, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy sources like wind and solar.
Why did cap and trade die? The short answer is that it was done in by the weak economy, the Wall Street meltdown, determined industry opposition and its own complexity.
The idea began as a middle-of-the-road Republican plan to unleash the market to reduce power plant pollution and spur innovation. But when lawmakers tried to apply the concept to the far more pervasive problem of carbon dioxide emissions, it ran into gale-force opposition from the oil industry, conservative groups that portrayed it as an economy-killing tax and lawmakers terrified that it would become a bonanza for Wall Street traders and Enron-style manipulators.
""Economywide cap and trade died of what amounts to natural causes in Washington,"" said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, who has been promoting the idea for more than two decades. ""The term itself became too polarizing and too paralyzing in the effort to win over conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans to try to do something about   and our oil dependency.""
Cap and trade was first tried on a significant scale 20 years ago under the first Bush administration as a way to address the problem of airborne sulfur dioxide pollution -- widely known as acid rain -- from coal-burning power plants in the Eastern United States. A limit was imposed on emissions from the plants, and utilities were allowed to buy and sell permits to comply. Today it is considered one of the most effective environmental initiatives.
Environmentalists and industries resurrected the idea in recent years as a centerpiece of measures to address global warming and growing oil imports. Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, built their climate change bill last year in large measure around it.
But in trying to assemble a majority to pass it, Mr. Waxman and Mr. Markey dished out a cornucopia of concessions and exemptions to coal companies, utilities, refiners, heavy industry and agribusinesses. The original simplicity was lost, replaced by a bazaar in which those with the most muscle got the best deals.
Opponents labeled it a tax-and-redistribution scheme.
""We turned it into 'cap and tax,' and we turned that into an epithet,"" said Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market research organization supported by conservative individuals and corporations. ""We also did a good job of showing that a bunch of big companies -- Goldman Sachs, the oil companies, the big utilities -- would get windfall profits because they'd been given free ration coupons.""
C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel in the first Bush administration and a strong advocate of the acid rain cap-and-trade program, said that opponents were largely correct in labeling the Waxman-Markey plan a tax, because so many of the pollution allowances were given away to industry rather than allocated based on past emissions.
""This is potentially a $3 trillion tax,"" Mr. Gray said, ""which is pretty steep in the best of times, and poison in the worst of times.""
The House narrowly passed the bill last June, but the Senate has moved slowly to take it up. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Graham, along with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, have been trying to find support for a comprehensive measure.
They, too, have been forced to seek compromise, offering incentives to oil drillers, nuclear power advocates, antitax groups, coal companies and utilities.
Two senators, Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, have proposed an alternative that they call cap and dividend, under which licenses to pollute would be auctioned to producers and wholesalers of fossil fuels, with three-quarters of the revenue returned to consumers in monthly checks to cover their higher energy costs.
Ms. Cantwell said that cap and trade had been discredited by the Wall Street crisis, the Enron scandal and the rocky start to a carbon credits trading system in Europe that has been subject to dizzying price fluctuations and widespread fraud.
She said her bill would require every pollution permit to be auctioned rather than given away and was 39 pages long, compared with Waxman-Markey, which weighs in at some 1,400 pages.
The Cantwell-Collins plan is almost exactly what Mr. Obama proposed in the campaign and after first taking office -- a 100 percent auction of permits and a large tax rebate to the public.
""He called our bill 'very elegant,' "" Ms. Cantwell said. ""Simplicity and having something people can understand is important."""
"Foreign, Friday, February 19, 2010, p. A 12","U.N.ÊClimateÊChief Quits, Deepening Sense of Disarray","By NEIL MacFARQUHAR and JOHN M. BRODER; Neil MacFarquhar reported from the United Nations, and John M. Broder from Washington.","UNITED NATIONS - The sense of disarray in the global effort to addressÊclimateÊchange deepened Thursday with the resignation of Yvo de Boer, the stolid Dutch bureaucrat who led the internationalÊclimateÊchange negotiations over four tumultuous years.",,"Mr. de Boer did not directly link his decision to step down to the chaos at Copenhagen. But he was known to be frustrated and exhausted by the meeting's failures. His resignation was seen by some as a further sign that the United Nations framework, which for almost two decades has been viewed as the best approach to tackling global warming, may have outlived its usefulness. And it raised questions about whether any significant progress toward a global treaty would be made by December, when the next United NationsÊclimateÊtalks are to be held in Cancun, Mexico.
""If Yvo de Boer thought that there would be a legally binding treaty at the end of this year, I suspect he would be sticking around to take some of the credit for it,"" said Michael A. Levi, an expert onÊclimateÊchange at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""He has put in a lot of time toward a very well-defined end.""
The internationalÊclimateÊeffort has been hampered by tensions between the world's two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the United States and China, over how to measure and report emissions. The United States, which had promised to lead globalÊclimatetalks, appears nowhere near passing legislation to control its ownÊclimate-altering pollution, and China, now the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, seems determined to go its own way.
At the same time, the scientific underpinnings of the global effort to addressÊclimateÊchange have been under steady attack in recent months. Those who are skeptical of global warming science have been invigorated by a small number of errors in the landmark 2007 report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange. The head of that panel, Rajendra K. Pachauri, is facing criticism for those mistakes as well as accusations of conflicts of interest for taking consulting fees from business interests. (Dr. Pachauri has said that he donates all such fees to the nonprofit research institute in New Delhi that he runs.)
""We have seen a situation where the politics ofÊclimateÊchange are really, really difficult among a number of key actors, and nobody, not even Mr. de Boer, was able to cut through that,"" said Kim Carstensen, the director of the GlobalÊClimateÊInitiative of the World Wildlife Fund.
Janos Pasztor, the topÊclimateÊchange adviser for the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said that Mr. de Boer called Mr. Ban two days ago to inform him of the decision. Mr. Pasztor rejected the idea that Mr. de Boer's resignation was linked either to the lack of an outcome at Copenhagen or to the controversy over the intergovernmental panel. But others noted that, although the international system might have been at fault for Copenhagen's failures, some rancor was inevitably directed at Mr. de Boer, as the United Nations' central representative, and it probably speeded his departure.
""It is probably the right time to get a fresh face in. It has been a pretty grueling two years from Bali to Copenhagen,"" said Mark Kenber, the policy director for theÊClimateÊGroup, an international organization pushing for aÊclimateÊchange agreement. ""A fresh face would respark the whole process.""
Some critics said that the United Nations should have moved faster to find areas where agreement among the more than 190 nations gathered at Copenhagen could be reached -- rainforest preservation, for example -- and designated a smaller, more manageable forum to negotiate more intractable issues blocking the talks. And Mr. de Boer, some said, was perceived as too confrontational by some nations, and some saw him as too enthusiastic in raising expectations for an international treaty, even after it became obvious that no such treaty would be forthcoming.
""His role as much as anything else was to be a cheerleader,"" Mr. Kenber said. ""It was probably the right thing to do; maybe he was too effusive.""
The renewed debate over the science may have also contributed to the pressures on Mr. de Boer, other critics noted.
In a statement announcing his departure, Mr. de Boer expressed disappointment about the Copenhagen talks and said that while governments could provide a framework for action onÊclimate, the solutions must come from the businesses that produce and consume the fuels that add to global warming.
""Copenhagen did not provide us with a clear agreement in legal terms, but the political commitment and sense of direction toward a low-emissions world are overwhelming,"" said Mr. de Boer, whose formal title is executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention onÊClimateÊChange.
Even before the Copenhagen meltdown -- the AmericanÊclimateÊnegotiator Todd Stern called it a ""snarling, aggravated, chaotic event"" -- global leaders were exploring other avenues for addressing theÊclimateÊproblem.
The United States last year assembled a group of 17 nations called the Major Economies Forum, which took upÊclimateÊas one of its major issues and which will continue discussions in parallel to the United Nations process. The Group of 20 also putÊ  on its agenda. France, Mexico, Norway and others are looking for ways to address discrete aspects of the issue, including financing for low-carbon development projects. And many nations, including the United States and China, are embarking on bilateral energy projects, wholly independent of the United Nations, with the goal of reducing emissions and developing nonpolluting alternatives.
""The U.N. system has significant weaknesses and it is probably important to develop ways to have dialogues in other, more narrow forums where we don't have 180 people around the table at the same time,"" Mr. Carstensen said.
No one was more frustrated with the Copenhagen talks than Mr. de Boer, who had traveled incessantly for four years trying to prod nations to produce a treaty on global warming by the end of 2009. In a statement, the United Nations said Mr. de Boer was joining KPMG, an international consulting group, as global adviser onÊclimateÊand sustainability.
In an interview in Amsterdam on Thursday with The Associated Press, he said that the high point of his tenure at the United Nations was the agreement in Bali at the end of 2007 under which nations agreed to a December 2009 deadline to produce a worldwide treaty. That treaty was to have been signed at Copenhagen, which produced instead a much weaker political agreement after nearly two weeks of bitter and largely fruitless argument. Participants refused to ratify the three-page Copenhagen Accord that emerged from the meeting, agreeing only to ""take note"" of it."
"National, Friday, June 11, 2010, p. A 22",Senate Rejects Republican Effort to Thwart Carbon Limits,By CARL HULSE,WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Thursday defeated a Republican-led effort to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from curbing greenhouse gases as lawmakers road-tested arguments for a future fight over climate change legislation.,,"Ms. Murkowski and others, including six Democrats, contended that the E.P.A. was engaging in a bureaucratic power grab and usurping Congressional authority with regulations that would stifle the economy and kill jobs.
""The sweeping powers being pursued by the E.P.A. are the worst possible option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Ms. Murkowski, who tried to thwart the agency's action using a rarely employed procedure called a resolution of disapproval.
The resolution of disapproval, created in a 1996 law, is a vehicle to allow Congress to overturn an executive branch action and is not subject to filibuster in the Senate. It is seldom used, however, due to the likelihood of a veto.
Democratic opponents of the Murkowski proposal said its backers were protecting oil companies and other industrial interests at the expense of public welfare and were ignoring science that substantiated the hazards of greenhouse gas emissions. They said Ms. Murkowski and her allies wanted to prevent the E.P.A. from taking action while simultaneously stalling Congressional action, essentially protecting the status quo.
""This is about delay in changes in our energy policy,"" said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, who said many of Ms. Murkowski's allies ""want nothing to do with comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation. What they want is the E.P.A. to go away.""
The fight was mainly symbolic because the prospects for the resolution were bleak even had the Senate passed it. It would have then required a majority vote in the House and the approval of President Obama, who has already threatened to veto it.
But it provided a showcase for a Senate fight over global warming as well as an indicator of where lawmakers could be expected to come down on legislation aimed at carbon emissions. The near-even division among lawmakers showed that a 60-vote supermajority on climate change legislation remains elusive.
Senate leaders and the White House are continuing to explore whether to push energy legislation on the Senate floor before the midterm elections this November. Senator Harry Reid, the Nevada Democrat and majority leader, was meeting Thursday afternoon with the chairmen of the committees with jurisdiction over energy issues to plot strategy.
Leading Democrats see the threat of E.P.A. action as an effective way to keep pressure on Congress to consider energy legislation and as a ready alternative if the House and Senate are not able to come to terms on an energy measure.
Supporters of the plan to block the E.P.A. said they were trying to stop a backdoor attempt by the Obama administration to regulate carbon emissions without waiting for Congress to weigh in. They said the E.P.A. approach would produce little environmental reward while putting the United States at a severe disadvantage to nations that were not imposing such controls on their own industries.
""It would be stupid for us to do this now when the rest of the world is not coming along at all,"" said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma. ""Even if it is the right thing to do, now is not the time to do it.""
Though Mr. Coburn said the case for global warming is not settled science, several other Republicans said they accepted the scientific assessment that climate change is occurring. They said their main reason for trying to rein in the E.P.A. was concern over handing such far-reaching regulatory power on emissions to an executive agency.
Given that several backers of Ms. Murkowski's plan said they believed climate change was a reality, senators advocating a broad energy approach that would try to address global warming said defeat of the plan to strip the E.P.A. of regulatory authority over greenhouse gases should provide momentum to their legislative efforts.
""Climate change is happening,"" said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who is a sponsoring a main climate change bill with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. ""The science is convincing and the current pattern of energy consumption is just making a bad problem worse."""
"Foreign, Wednesday, December 8, 2010, p. A 15",U.S. and China Narrow Differences at Climate Conference,By JOHN M. BRODER,"CANCUN, Mexico -- The United States and China have significantly narrowed their differences on the verification of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, officials said, providing hope that a United Nations conference here on climate change can achieve some modest success.",,"The reduced friction between the two nations has greatly improved the mood here, and envoys from both expressed guarded optimism that a deal could be reached by the end of the conference on Friday.
""I do think there is an agreement to be had,"" Todd Stern, the chief American climate change negotiator, said Tuesday, although he added, ""At the same time there are a lot of difficulties, so we'll have to see.""
Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate envoy, also signaled a willingness to sign an accord here, as long as it met Chinese objectives on financial aid to developing countries, transfer of clean energy technology to poor nations and a continuing of discussions under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Speaking to the press on Monday, he pointedly did not raise verification or transparency issues as a barrier to the negotiations.
The overall talks are grinding on slowly, and there is some concern that with only three full negotiating days ahead, there will not be enough time to resolve differences on remaining issues like money, technology, adaptation, emissions reductions and forestry programs, the basic agenda of the climate negotiations.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, under whose auspices these annual talks are held, operates on the principle of consensus, meaning that any of the more than 190 participating nations can hold up an agreement.
Last December, a group of nations led by Bolivia, Venezuela, Cuba and Sudan played the role of spoiler in Copenhagen. This year, Bolivia in particular has raised objections on a number of matters, including plans to compensate landowners for preserving forests. The Bolivian leader, Evo Morales, says this threatens the livelihoods of landless peasants, and he plans to address the conference on this issue.
There is some talk in the corridors of breaking off the forestry issue and negotiating a separate deal that would save millions of acres of forestland while increasing compensation to countries like Brazil and Indonesia where forests are fast disappearing.
Another issue is the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, whose emissions targets expire at the end of 2012. Most developing nations are insisting that new targets be set and that money continue to flow to them for projects that reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming.
Japan startled the conference last week by announcing that it would not accept any new targets under the Kyoto Protocol, and Russia, Canada and some other parties to the protocol have also signaled a reluctance to assume new commitments. The issue could scuttle the conference. Some countries, including the United States, which never accepted the Kyoto treaty, hope to find a way to finesse the issue so it can be dealt with in the future.
Despite these disputes, the overall atmosphere of the talks is vastly improved from a year ago in Copenhagen, in large part because the United States and China are not at each other's throats. Contributing to that more relaxed mood, the delegates are not awaiting the arrival of 140 heads of state, who flew into Copenhagen for the final hours of negotiations and raised the temperature beyond the boiling point.
""There is more camaraderie here, more dialogue, more intensive engagement and less shadow boxing than in Copenhagen, because China has moved on the transparency issue,"" Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister, said in an interview. ""That is very important.""
Mr. Ramesh proposed a plan for bridging the gap between the United States and China on verification, by establishing a voluntary program known as international consultation and analysis. Under the plan, also known as I.C.A., countries would declare their emissions reduction targets and provide regular reports on how they were meeting them and gauging their own progress.
There would be no international monitors or inspectors, and no penalties for failing to reach stated targets. Smaller countries would have less frequent and less detailed reporting requirements than major emitters.
Mr. Ramesh's concept has been broadly accepted here, but there are still disputes over how detailed the agreement should be and how soon the reporting requirements would take effect.
Mr. Stern said he wanted these matters addressed explicitly and not, as he put it, ""at the 50,000-foot level."" Other major emitters, including Brazil and South Africa, are balking at providing the kind of detailed reports that the United States is demanding. China's position is unclear, but Mr. Ramesh said that he spent four hours with the Chinese delegation on Sunday and that he was confident that China would not stand in the way of a deal because of the verification issue.
He noted that China had recently leapfrogged over the United States to become the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. ""They know the world's radar is on them,"" he said. ""If transparency becomes the stumbling block, China doesn't want to be blamed. If China is the only party holding out, they won't collapse the negotiations."""
"National, Wednesday, April 28, 2010, p. A 16",Oil Rig Blast Complicates Push for Energy and Climate Bill,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON -- The loss of life and the looming ecological catastrophe from the oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico have piled political complications onto the push for energy and climate change legislation here, officials and interest groups say.",,"The energy initiative is already in trouble because a crucial sponsor, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has walked away from negotiations as a result of a dispute with the White House and Senate Democratic leaders over immigration policy.
The oil spill may have added to its distress. Several senators said they were troubled by the accident and might not support broad climate and energy legislation if it contains expanding drilling without adequate safeguards.
Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said he had many concerns about the energy bill that appears to be taking shape, chief among them the aggressive pursuit of offshore oil.
""I have been an advocate of climate change legislation, but I'm going to have a real problem if we have drilling as I've heard it,"" Mr. Menendez said in an interview. ""Unless there is the ability for neighboring states to have some type of veto in the process, unless there's some serious environmental consideration before any drilling takes place, unless there are very significant buffer zones, I'm going to have a hard time at the end of the day supporting this legislation.""
Several other coastal-state senators whose votes could be crucial to passage of climate legislation have expressed concerns about the safety and environmental impacts of offshore drilling. They include Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island; Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey; Benjamin L. Cardin and Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrats of Maryland; Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia; Kay Hagan, Democrat of North Carolina; and George LeMieux, Republican of Florida.
Last month, President Obamaproposed a significant expansion of offshore drilling, including new areas along the Eastern Seaboard from Delaware to Florida, a section of the eastern Gulf of Mexico and parts of the Arctic coast of Alaska.
The proposal was part of a deal to attract Republican support for the climate change bill. The proposal drew strong criticism from environmental groups and some coastal-state governors and representatives.
The White House said Tuesday in a statement that Mr. Obama was sticking with his drilling plan despite the accident. It said that the proposal was based on careful scientific and environmental reviews and that before any drilling was permitted, there would be ""a careful examination of the potential risks and spill response capabilities in the area involved.""
But the administration also sought to contain the environmental and political damage with an announcement that the Departments of Interior and Homeland Security would conduct a broad investigation of the accident and the response to it.
The spill has also scrambled politics in Florida, where beaches may be fouled by the growing oil slick oozing from beneath the Deepwater Horizon rig off Louisiana.
Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, a Republican who is facing a tough campaign for the Senate and has supported expanded drilling off the state's coastlines, said Tuesday that he was rethinking his position in light of the accident.
""If this doesn't give somebody pause, there's something wrong,"" Mr. Crist told reporters before heading out on a helicopter to view the spreading slick.
""This is, as I understand it, a pretty new rig with modern technology. As I've always said, it would need to be far enough, clean enough and safe enough. I'm not sure this was far enough. I'm pretty sure it was not clean enough. And it doesn't sound like it was safe enough. It's not a great situation.""
Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, called for a thorough investigation of the industry's safety practices. Mr. Nelson pressured the Obama administration to extend the coastal buffer zone off Florida to 125 miles from 75. Now he said he was not certain that even that was enough margin for safety.
""The tragedy off the coast of Louisiana shows we need to be asking a lot more tough questions of Big Oil,"" Mr. Nelson said. ""I think we need to look back over 10 years or so to see if the record denies the industry's claims about safety and technology."""
"Business/Financial, Tuesday, January 19, 2010, p. B 3",A Pacific Island Challenge To European Air Pollution,By JAMES KANTER,"BRUSSELS - A Pacific island nation has challenged plans by the Czech Republic to refit a coal-fired power station, in an appeal that environmental advocates on Monday described as the first of its kind.",,"""Climate change is real and it is happening on our shores,"" Andrew Yatilman, the director of Micronesia's office of environment and emergency management, told Reuters. ""It's a matter of survival for us. If you look at the map of the Pacific, we're just dots in the middle of the ocean.""
Micronesia submitted its arguments to the Czech Ministry of Environment on Jan. 4.
Greenpeace, which is supporting the action by Micronesia, demanded last month that the Czech Republic decommission the plant by 2016.
The Czech authorities were scheduled to take Micronesia's complaint into account this week in deciding whether the plant was environmentally acceptable, said Jan Rovensky, an energy and climate campaigner with Greenpeace Czech Republic.
Attempts to reach the ministry on Monday were not successful. But Eva Novakova, a press officer for the CEZ Group, said the project already had ""obtained positive opinions"" from the Czech environmental authorities.
Ms. Novakova said that the refit and a closure of one unit would cut emissions of carbon dioxide from the plant by 31 percent.
Pressure has increased against coal-fired power, putting obstacles in the way of new plants in the United States and Europe.
The failure of nations at the Copenhagen conference to agree to a timetable for a binding agreement on curbing climate change or to agree on a target for reducing emissions by midcentury appears to have lent new urgency to anti-coal campaigns.
Greenpeace said the Czech case put governments and companies ""on notice that states vulnerable to climate change are keen to explore new avenues to challenge decisions on projects that contribute to climate change.""
Prunerov is among the largest coal-fired plants in the European Union and the largest single source of carbon dioxide emissions in the Czech Republic.
Without the refit, the plant would close in 2020, but with the refit the station would keep operating until about 2035, said Ms. Novakova.
Leaders of Micronesia, which consists of more than 600 islands grouped into four states, say they are especially vulnerable to phenomena linked to climate change, including a rising sea level, increasingly powerful storms and ocean acidification."
"Foreign, Thursday, September 30, 2010, p. A 11",MEMO FROM THE UNITED NATIONS,Trying to Lace Together a Consensus on Biodiversity Across a Global Landscape,By NEIL MacFARQUHAR,,"Using the holy induction ceremony customarily reserved for Buddhist monks, Mr. Bun Saluth ordained individual trees and eventually huge swaths of woodland, lending a sacred aura to thousands of acres in northwest Cambodia. He inspired villagers and ultimately the government to protect them from rampant logging, thereby regenerating a depleted forest.
In doing so, Mr. Bun Saluth accomplished something that has eluded dozens of world leaders who gather regularly at the United Nations, including the annual general debate that ended Wednesday. Despite about two decades of conferences, conventions and commitments, the earth's biological diversity -- or biodiversity for short -- steadily erodes as ecosystems suffer and species die out.
Consensus that something needs to happen has been relatively easy. But the fight over what to do -- and who pays for it -- has dragged on for years.
As global issues go, biodiversity exists in the shadow of climate change, facing similar problems but attracting a fraction of the attention despite concerted efforts. (In case you had not noticed, the United Nations declared 2010 the Year of Biodiversity.)
Almost every United Nations member state is party to the 1992 Convention on Biodiversity, the holdouts being the United States, Andorra and the Vatican, United Nations officials said.
But like climate change, efforts to move forward have jammed along the well-worn fault line separating developed from developing nations.
The three pillars of the convention are conservation, sustainable development and fair use of resources. But the argument over patenting and paying royalties for those resources, among other issues, has fueled a protracted fight. It will play out next in late October at a conference in Nagoya, Japan.
The debate is so entrenched that a group of 17 nations, including heavyweights like Brazil, India and China, have formed an alliance with an unwieldy name, the Group of Like-Minded Megadiverse Countries, to combat what they call ""biopiracy.""
""Countries like Brazil and India are victims of biopiracy over many decades, and we have to protect our bioresources, we have to protect our traditional knowledge,"" said Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister.
Bringing much of the developing world along, the Megadiverse accuse richer nations and their corporations of colonial practices -- pillaging natural resources and indigenous knowledge for medicine, cosmetics and the like without paying royalties. Rather than signing off on a universal protocol governing access and sharing the benefits, some Western nations have said agreements should be negotiated piecemeal.
The problem, according to United Nations officials and scientists, is that in the absence of a global agreement, nations are gradually passing one restrictive national law after another, to the point that a plant or insect that might help combat a scourge on a different continent can no longer be obtained. When Kenya wanted to combat an Asian fruit fly in recent years, for example, Sri Lanka blocked the export of the natural predator, said Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.
Beyond that, scientists say, possibly lifesaving medicines or knowledge might disappear forever. Such losses are likely to worsen because the factors driving them -- changing habitat, pollution, overexploitation, invasive alien species and climate change -- are intensifying or at least not diminishing, scientists say.
About 1.9 million species have been identified, out of what scientists estimate is a total of around 15 million species on earth. (Microbes account for the anonymous bulk.) There is a spectrum of opinion about the broad risks facing species. Under the natural order of things, some scientists argue, 15 species would go extinct annually. Instead, they are disappearing at a rate estimated at 100 to 1,000 times that. Scientists dub the current loss the Sixth Great Extinction Event. No. 5 was 65 million years ago, when the dinosaurs perished.
But the loss often suffers from an out-of-sight, out-of-mind quality, so scientists try to draw attention to the possible fate of highly visible creatures like the polar bear.
Dr. Eric Chivian of Harvard Medical School points out that polar bears can sleep for months without losing bone mass or even urinating. Studying them might reveal secrets that help humans cope with osteoporosis or kidney failure. But if they die out because their once frozen environment melts, he says, all that could be lost.
It is just one example of how biodiversity and climate change are intertwined, scientists say.
""Every degree centigrade the planet warms will lead automatically to a 10 percent loss in known species,"" said Ahmed Djoghlaf, the executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity. Even if the United Nations climate change agreement seeks to limit the temperature rise to two degrees, he said, ""It is a death sentence for 20 percent of known species.""
But as with climate change, officials and biodiversity advocates are losing faith in obtaining a ""big bang"" agreement that wraps all global efforts into one package.
Instead they hope piecemeal efforts by individual countries will eventually reach a critical mass. The United Nations and its allies try to spur that trend in various ways -- one is a series of studies assigning an economic value to efforts like forest preservation.
But developing countries are demanding that richer nations underwrite their conservation efforts. ""It seems that the standing forest and the wealth of Suriname's biodiversity are being taken for granted by the global community as there are no structures in place to provide incentives to continue on the path of sustainability,"" Desire Delano Bouterse, the president of Suriname, warned the General Assembly last week.
Poor people who depend on nature for sustenance are likely to suffer the most from the loss of biodiversity, officials say, so they are often the most invested in preserving it. Officials hope that by singling out local projects -- Mr. Bun Saluth's Monks Community Forest in Cambodia, a women's cooperative in Senegal that has helped bring back species of shellfish and a Vietnamese village that is preserving bamboo were all recognized at an awards ceremony in New York last week -- the grass roots will inspire politicians to act.
""The people who best know how to shape and drive development are still the people listened to least,"" said Mr. Steiner of the United Nations. ""We are erasing the hard disk of life before we have even begun to understand the value it represents."""
"National, Friday, December 31, 2010, p. A 1","Clashes Loom, With E.P.A. Set To Limit Gases",By JOHN M. BRODER; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.,CORRECTION APPENDED,,"While only the first phase of regulation takes effect on Sunday, the administration is on notice that if it moves too far and too fast in trying to curtail the ubiquitous gases that are heating the planet it risks a Congressional backlash that could set back the effort for years.
But the newly muscular Republicans in Congress could also stumble by moving too aggressively to handcuff the Environmental Protection Agency, provoking a popular outcry that they are endangering public health in the service of their well-heeled patrons in industry.
""These are hand grenades, and the pins have been pulled,"" said William K. Reilly, administrator of the environmental agency under the first President George Bush.
He said that the agency was wedged between a hostile Congress and the mandates of the law, with little room to maneuver. But he also said that anti-E.P.A. zealots in Congress should realize that the agency was acting on laws that Congress itself passed, many of them by overwhelming bipartisan margins.
President Obama vowed as a candidate that he would put the United States on a path to addressing climate change by reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas pollutants. He offered Congress wide latitude to pass climate change legislation, but held in reserve the threat of E.P.A. regulation if it failed to act. The deeply polarized Senate's refusal to enact - legislation essentially called his bluff.
With Mr. Obama's hand forced by the mandates of the Clean Air Act and a 2007 Supreme Court decision, his E.P.A. will impose the first regulation of major stationary sources of greenhouse gases starting Jan. 2.
For now, administration officials are treading lightly, fearful of inflaming an already charged atmosphere on the issue and mindful that its stated priorities are job creation and economic recovery. Officials are not seeking a major confrontation over carbon regulation, which offers formidable challenges even in a less stressed economic and political climate.
""If the administration gets it wrong, we're looking at years of litigation, legislation and public and business outcry,"" said a senior administration official who asked not to be identified so as not to provide an easy target for the incoming Republicans. ""If we get it right, we're facing the same thing.""
""Can we get it right?"" this official continued. ""Or is this just too big a challenge, too complex a legal, scientific, political and regulatory puzzle?""
The immediate effect on utilities, refiners and major manufacturers will be small, with the new rules applying only to those planning to build large new facilities or make major modifications to existing plants. The environmental agency estimates that only 400 such facilities will be affected in each of the first few years of the program. Over the next decade, however, the agency plans to regulate virtually all sources of greenhouse gases, imposing efficiency and emissions requirements on nearly every industry and every region.
Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the E.P.A., has promised to pursue a measured and moderate course. The agency announced last week that it would not even begin issuing standards for compliance until the middle of 2011, and when it did so the rules would not impose unreasonable costs on industry.
But the reaction in Congress and industry has been outsized, with some likening the E.P.A. to terrorists and others vowing to choke off the agency's financing for all air-quality regulation. A dozen states have filed suit to halt the new greenhouse gas rules, with one, Texas, flatly refusing to comply with any new orders from Washington.
Two federal courts, including one this week in Louisiana, have refused to issue restraining orders halting the implementation of the new rules. But late Thursday, a federal appeals court in Washington temporarily blocked the the E.P.A. from enforcing its rules in Texas while the courts consider whether the federal agency has the right to take over the Texas program. The courts have not yet ruled on the legality of the broader federal program.
Representative Fred Upton, the Michigan Republican who is set to become chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he was not convinced that greenhouse gases needed to be controlled or that the E.P.A. had the authority to do so.
""This move represents an unconstitutional power grab that will kill millions of jobs -- unless Congress steps in,"" Mr. Upton wrote this week in a Wall Street Journal opinion essay.
His co-author was Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group financed by Koch Industries and other oil companies that has spread skepticism about global warming and supported many of the Tea Party candidates who will join the new Congress.
Mr. Upton has proposed a moratorium on all global warming regulation until the courts have ruled definitively on the legality of federal action on the issue, decisions that are probably years away.
Others in Congress, including Senator John D. Rockefeller IV and Representative Nick J. Rahall II, both Democrats from West Virginia, have proposed a two-year delay in regulation by the E.P.A. while Congress comes up with its own rules. Virtually no one expects action on climate change legislation in the next Congressional session.
White House officials have said that they will recommend that Mr. Obama veto any measure that restricts the administration's power to enforce clean air laws.
So the stalemate continues.
Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are already falling faster than any current legislative or regulatory proposal envisions, because of the recession-driven drop in demand for electricity. Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector, by far the largest source of total emissions, fell to about 5.4 billion metric tons in 2009, down from 5.8 billion metric tons the year before, and they are likely to fall even further this year. Demand for electricity in 2009 fell by the largest amount in six decades and is almost certain to slip further in 2010.
When demand for power begins to rebound with the economy, emissions are expected to rise more slowly than in the past, in part because utilities are using fuel more efficiently and switching to cleaner-burning natural gas for part of their electricity generation. But such moves will not take the place of the across-the-board reductions in emissions that will be required to meet the administration's target of a 17 percent reduction in emissions over 2005 levels by 2020.
And it is that broader mandate that has set off such intense opposition from industry and its allies in Congress.
""Early next year we're going to have a very serious debate on whether the E.P.A. should be allowed to unilaterally go forward and restructure the American economy,"" Jack Gerard, the president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in an interview.
""As the president looks to 2012, his message has to be job creation, and this kind of regulation is inconsistent with that,"" he said. ""The public has a long memory. Anything viewed as hurting the opportunity to create jobs will not be well received.""
Correction: January 4, 2011, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about political tensions over the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions by the federal Environmental Protection Agency misstated the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the nation's energy sector in 2008 and 2009. It was about 5.8 billion metric tons in 2008, not 5,800 metric tons, and it was about 5.4 billion metric tons in 2009, not 5,400 metric tons. The article also misidentified the state in which a federal court declined last week to issue a restraining order blocking the enforcement of new federal emission rules in Texas. The court is in Louisiana, not Texas. And a picture caption misidentified the state in which the Allen S. King power plant is located. It is in Minnesota, in Oak Park Heights -- not in Wisconsin."
"Foreign, Friday, July 2, 2010, p. A 1",Britain Curbing Airport Growth To Aid Climate,By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL,"In a bold if lonely environmental stand, Britain's coalition government has set out to curb the growth of what has been called ""binge flying"" by refusing to build new runways around London to accommodate more planes.",,"The government decided that enabling more flying was incompatible with Britain's oft-stated goal of curbing emissions. Britons have become accustomed to easy, frequent flying -- jetting off to weekend homes in Spain and bachelor parties in Prague -- as England has become a hub for low-cost airlines. The country's 2008 Climate Change Act requires it to reduce emissions by at least 34 percent by 2020 from levels reached in 1990.
""The emissions were a significant factor"" in the decision to cancel the runway-building plans, Teresa Villiers, Britain's minister of state for transport, said in an interview. ""The 220,000 or so flights that might well come with a third runway would make it difficult to meet the targets we'd set for ourselves."" She said that local environmental concerns like noise and pollution around Heathrow also weighed into the decision.
Britain is bucking a global trend. Across North America, Asia and Europe, cities are building new runways or expanding terminals to handle projected growth in air travel and air freight in the hope of remaining competitive.
That growth in traffic has been damped but not halted by hard economic times, and in the current global recession, business concerns have generally prevailed over worries about climate change. In the United States, Chicago-O'Hare, Seattle-Tacoma and Washington-Dulles all opened new runways in 2008.
On Tuesday, Kennedy International Airport in New York reopened its Bay Runway -- one of four, and the airport's longest -- after a four-month, $376 million renovation that included the creation of two new taxiways to speed plane movements between runways and terminals.
Airport expansion plans have sometimes been modified or canceled because of concerns about noise or ground-level pollution. But Peder Jensen, a transportation specialist at the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen, said that as far as he knew, Britain ""is the only country that had made a conscious decision based on climate considerations.""
Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports and a major connection point for destinations in Europe, South Asia and the Middle East, is already notorious for its flight delays and endless lines. It is the only airport of its size with just two runways; Paris-Charles de Gaulle has four and O'Hare has seven.
So even though the Conservative Party had been expressing growing reservations about the planned expansion since 2008, many businessmen were shocked when Mr. Cameron canceled the plan after coming to power in a coalition with Liberal Democrats.
""This is a new government that claimed to be business friendly, but their first move was to eliminate one of the best growth opportunities for London and the U.K. and British companies,"" said Steve Lott, a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association. ""We've run into a shortsighted political decision that will have terrible economic consequences.""
The British government counters that the economic effects of scrapping the third runway are ""unclear"" while the environmental costs of adding one are unacceptably high. Ms. Villiers said that a high-speed rail network intended to replace short-haul flights would be a better way to address the airport's congestion than adding a runway.
""We recognized that just putting more flights and more passengers into the skies over southeast England wasn't worth the environmental costs we're paying,"" she said. ""We decided to make Heathrow better rather than bigger.""
Although it is often said that emissions from air travel account for 2 to 3 percent of global emissions, the proportion is higher in many developed countries: emissions from aviation are growing faster there than those from nearly any other sector.
The British government has calculated that aviation emissions accounted for just 6 percent of the country's carbon dioxide emissions in 2006. But it concluded in a report that aviation could contribute up to a quarter of those emissions by 2030.
In the United States, the number of general aviation hours is forecast to grow an average of 1.8 percent a year, and to be 60 percent greater by 2025 than it is now, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. While airlines have worked hard to improve airplane efficiency, those efforts are dwarfed by the upward trend in flying.
Citizens' groups in communities near Heathrow fought hard for nearly a decade against the airport's runway expansion, complaining about noise and nitrous oxide pollution. As climate change became a more potent political issue in Britain several years ago, environmental groups with broader concerns jumped into the fray, camping out at Heathrow and occupying runways at smaller airports, shutting them down for hours.
""If you were a politician, how you felt about the third runway became a test of your commitment to dealing with climate change,"" said Ben Stewart, communications director for Greenpeace U.K.
The temptation to expand airports is great for cities in search of new business and tourism. Airports in Europe are now mostly run by private companies, and for them, the more traffic, the more profit.
Some critics say the British government's principled stand is pointless because airlines and travelers will respond not by forgoing air travel but by flying through a different airport. Instead of emissions being reduced, the critics say, they will simply be transferred to places like Barajas Airport in Madrid or Frankfurt International Airport, which have recently been expanded.
""My personal opinion is that the decision concerning Heathrow's third runway was highly politicized and outpaced the science of what that runway might or might not do in terms of emissions,"" said Christopher Oswald, a vice president of Airports Council International, an industry group. He suggested that a third runway might actually reduce emissions above Heathrow, because with less congestion, planes would spend less time idling on runways or circling in holding patterns.
But Dr. Jensen of the European Environment Agency said that building roads or runways generated more traffic in the long term because greater convenience draws people to a route.
Leo Murray, a spokesman for Plane Stupid, an environmental group that has fought new runways, called the British government's decision ""a turning point for aviation"" although he added, ""It is uncomfortable to have the coup de grace delivered by the Conservative government."""
"Editorial, Sunday, November 14, 2010, p. WK 8",OP-ED COLUMNIST,I Believe I Can Fly,By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN,,"Where to begin? Well, first there's Israel's prime minister, Bibi Netanyahu, who has been telling everyone how committed he is to peace with the Palestinians while refusing to halt settlement building as a prerequisite for negotiations. At a time when Israel already has 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, Bibi says he can't possibly take another pause in building to test whether the Palestinian government of President Mahmoud Abbas -- a man Israelis say is the best Palestinian security partner Israel has ever had -- can forge a safe two-state deal for Israel. The U.S. is now basically trying to bribe Bibi to reverse his position. Maybe he will, but it's unseemly to watch and doesn't bode well. Rather than take the initiative and say to Arabs and Palestinians, ""You want a settlement freeze? Here it is, now let's see what you're ready to agree to,"" Netanyahu toys with President Obama, makes Israel look like it wants land more than peace and risks never forging a West Bank deal -- thereby permanently absorbing its 2.5 million Palestinians and eventually no longer having a Jewish majority. That's the sudden stop at the end -- unless the next war comes first. But, for now, Bibi seems to think he can fly.
Closer to home, America's climate-deniers mounted an effective disinformation campaign that made ""climate change"" a four-letter word in the Republican Party. This undermined efforts to get a clean energy bill -- the sort that might break our addiction to oil and take money away from the people our soldiers are fighting in the Middle East. And all of this happened in 2010, which is on track to be the Earth's hottest year on record. So here's the math: 98 climate scientists out of 100 will tell you that man's continued carbon emissions pose the risk of disruptive climate change this century. Two out of 100 will tell you it doesn't. And ""conservatives"" today tell you to bet on the two. If the climate-deniers are right -- but we combat climate change anyway -- we'll have slightly higher energy prices but cleaner air, more renewable energy, a stronger dollar, more innovative industries and enemies with less money. If the deniers are wrong and we do nothing, your kids will meet the sudden stop at the end.
Many of the same people working against clean energy are working to scuttle Senate ratification of the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty that Mr. Obama signed with Russian President Dmitri Medvedev. This treaty is right in line with the previous three U.S.-Russia arms reduction deals, all negotiated by G.O.P. administrations. It leaves America secure, a world and a Russia with fewer nukes and it promotes better ties with the Kremlin. Scuttling the treaty, just to deny Mr. Obama a success, which is what some Republican senators are up to, will not only ensure that U.S.-Russian relations sour, it will also make it much less likely that the Russians -- whose pressure on Iran and willingness to deny it surface-to-air missiles have been critical in slowing Iran's nuclear program -- will continue to cooperate with us on that front. But, hey, who cares about weakening Iran or U.S.-Russian ties if you can weaken your own president? We can fly.
Finally, there is something deeply wrong about Mitch McConnell, the Senate G.O.P. leader, saying that ""the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president."" McConnell explained that that was not because Republicans simply crave power (heaven forbid), but because this is the only way Republicans can achieve their goals of repealing the health care bill, ending bailouts, cutting spending and shrinking government.
Where do I start? We know that these were not the Republican goals because they had eight years under George W. Bush to pursue them and did just the opposite. And even if we assume that this time they really mean it, they've never explained what programs they would cut and how doing that now won't make our recession worse. But even if they did, these are the wrong priorities. Our priorities now are to mitigate the recession that was set in motion under Bush and to put the country on a path to sustainable economic growth. That will require vastly improving the education and skills of our work force and enabling them with 21st-century infrastructure so they will be smarter and more productive. We know that tax cuts alone won't do that; we just had that test, too, under Bush. It requires a complex strategy for American renewal -- raising some taxes, like on energy, while lowering others, like on workers and corporations; and investing in new infrastructure, schools and research, while cutting other services.
I don't mind if Republicans win with fresh new ideas -- but not with a grab bag of tired cliches. That's just begging for a sudden stop at the end."
"National, Sunday, April 25, 2010, p. A 19",Graham Pulls Support For Senate Climate Bill,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON -- In a move that may derail a comprehensive climate change and energy bill in the Senate, one of the measure's central architects, Senator Lindsey Graham, has issued an angry protest over what he says are Democratic plans to give priority to a debate over immigration policy.",,"In his letter to his two colleagues, Mr. Graham said that he was troubled by reports that the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and the White House were planning to take up an immigration measure before the energy bill. Mr. Graham has worked with Democrats in the past on immigration matters and was expected to be an important bridge to Republicans on that issue, as well as on energy.
Mr. Graham said that any Senate debate on the highly charged subject of illegal immigration would make it impossible to deal with the difficult issues involved in national energy and global warming policy.
He said in his letter that energy must come first and that Democrats appeared to be rushing to take up immigration because of rising anti-immigrant sentiment, including a harsh new measure signed into law in Arizona on Friday.
""Moving forward on immigration -- in this hurried, panicked manner -- is nothing more than a cynical political ploy,"" Mr. Graham said. ""I know from my own personal experience the tremendous amounts of time, energy and effort that must be devoted to this issue to make even limited progress.""
Hours after Mr. Graham released his letter, Mr. Kerry said in a statement that Mr. Graham's actions had scuttled plans for an elaborate announcement of the proposal, whose passage is a major priority for the Obama administration.
""We all believe that this year is our best and perhaps last chance for Congress to pass a comprehensive approach,"" Mr. Kerry said. ""We believe that we had reached such an agreement and were excited to announce it on Monday, but regrettably external issues have arisen that force us to postpone only temporarily.""
Mr. Kerry said that he was prepared to resume work on the climate measure when Mr. Graham rejoined the discussion. But he said he was uncertain when that would be.
""We will continue to work, and we will do everything necessary to be ready when the moment presents itself,"" Mr. Kerry said.
Progress on an energy and climate bill in the Senate has relied heavily on Mr. Graham's active participation and support. He is the only Republican to have formally endorsed a broad approach to dealing with global warming and energy issues and is needed to try to bring in support from other Republicans.
Carol M. Browner, the White House coordinator for energy and climate policy, said that the administration would work to secure bipartisan agreement on both energy and immigration measures this year.
She praised Mr. Graham for his efforts to build a coalition of business and environmental organizations in favor of comprehensive energy legislation. ""We're determined to see it happen this year,"" Ms. Browner said, ""and we encourage the senators to continue their important work on behalf of the country and not walk away from the progress they've already made.""
Mr. Reid has spoken of the importance of dealing with immigration but has not definitively said that it would take precedence over energy and climate legislation. But he has said that the current system is broken and must be reformed.
Mr. Graham wrote that Mr. Reid's refusal to state explicitly that energy would come first ""has destroyed my confidence that there will be a serious commitment and focus to move energy legislation this year.""
He said that reducing the nation's dependence on imported oil and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases were such contentious issues that they required the full commitment of the Senate and the White House. ""All of the key players, particularly the Senate leadership, have to want this debate as much as we do,"" Mr. Graham wrote. ""This is clearly not the case.""
Mr. Reid said in a statement that he intended to work on both issues in this session of Congress. ""As I have said, I am committed to trying to enact comprehensive clean energy legislation this session of Congress,"" he said. ""Doing so will require strong bipartisan support and energy could be next if it's ready.""
He said that revising immigration law will also require bipartisan support and noted that significant committee work had not yet begun on the issue.
Mr. Reid said that Mr. Graham was under ""tremendous pressure"" from fellow Republicans not to cooperate with Democrats on either energy or immigration. In a swipe, he added, ""But I will not allow him to play one issue off of another, and neither will the American people. They expect us to do both, and they will not accept the notion that trying to act on one is an excuse for not acting on the other."""
"National, Friday, July 2, 2010, p. A 14",Penn State Panel Clears Scientist Over 'Climategate',By JUSTIN GILLIS,"An American scientist accused of manipulating research findings on climate science was cleared of that charge by his university on Thursday, the latest in a string of reports to find little substance in the allegations known as Climategate.",,"Dr. Mann said he was gratified by the findings, the second report from Penn State to clear him. An earlier report had exonerated him of related charges that he suppressed or falsified data, destroyed e-mail and misused confidential information.
The new report did criticize him on a minor point, saying that he had occasionally forwarded to colleagues copies of unpublished manuscripts without the explicit permission of their authors.
The allegations arose after private e-mail messages between Dr. Mann and other scientists were purloined from a computer at the University of East Anglia, in Britain, and posted on the Internet. In one, a British researcher called a data-adjustment procedure Dr. Mann used a ""trick.""
The e-mail messages led climate-change skeptics to accuse mainstream researchers, including Dr. Mann, of deliberately manipulating the findings of climate science in order to strengthen their case that human activity is causing the earth to warm up.
""I'm aware, and many researchers now are keenly aware, of the depths to which the climate-change disinformation movement is willing to sink, to the point where they're willing to criminally break into a university server and steal people's personal e-mail messages,"" Dr. Mann said in an interview.
Like the earlier report from Penn State, the new one was assailed Thursday by advocacy groups skeptical of the case for human-induced climate change.
""It's no surprise that it's a whitewash of Dr. Mann's misconduct, because it was designed to be a whitewash,"" said Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington advocacy group. He accused the panel of failing to interview important witnesses.
The panel did not try to vet the accuracy of the science published by Dr. Mann, including a famous finding that the temperature of the earth had jumped recently, compared with past climate inferred from indicators like tree rings. Instead, it examined his methodology -- his analytical techniques, his willingness to share data with those skeptical of his findings and the like. The panel unanimously found his approach ""well within the range of accepted practices.""
Two inquiries in Britain have largely exonerated the scientists there who were caught up in Climategate, though one report did offer minor criticism of statistical techniques.
Dr. Mann remains under investigation by the attorney general of Virginia for research he did at the University of Virginia."
"National, Thursday, February 11, 2010, p. A 1",ClimateÊFight Is Heating Up In Deep Freeze,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON - As millions of people along the East Coast hole up in their snowbound homes, the two sides in theÊclimate-change debate are seizing on the mounting drifts to bolster their arguments.",,"MostÊclimateÊscientists respond that the ferocious storms are consistent with forecasts that a heating planet will produce more frequent and more intense weather events.
But some independentÊclimateÊexperts say the blizzards in the Northeast no more prove that the planet is cooling than the lack of snow in Vancouver or the downpours in Southern California prove that it is warming.
As an illustration of their point of view, the family of Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, a leadingÊclimateÊskeptic in Congress, built a six-foot-tall igloo on Capitol Hill and put a cardboard sign on top that read ""Al Gore's New Home.""
The extreme weather, Mr. Inhofe said by e-mail, reinforced doubts about scientists' conclusion that global warming was ""unequivocal"" and most likely caused by human activity.
Nonsense, responded Joseph Romm, aÊclimate-change expert and former Energy Department official who writes aboutÊclimateissues at the liberal Center for American Progress.
""Ideologues in the Senate keep pushing the anti-scientific disinformation that big snowstorms are evidence against human-caused global warming,"" Mr. Romm wrote on Wednesday.
It is perhaps not coincidental that the snowstorm scuffle is playing out against a background of recentÊclimateÊcontroversies: In recent months, global-warming critics have assailed a 2007 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel onÊ  and have claimed that e-mail messages and documents plucked from a server at aÊclimateÊresearch center in Britain raise doubts about the academic integrity of someÊclimateÊscientists. Earlier this week, Rush Limbaugh and other conservative commentators made light of the fact that the announcement of the creation of a new federalÊclimateÊservice on Monday had to be conducted by conference call, rather than news conference, because the federal government was shuttered by the storm.
Matt Drudge, who delights in tweakingÊclimate-change enthusiasts, noted on his Web sitethat a Senate hearing on global warming this week was canceled because of the weather.
As the first blizzard howled last weekend, the Virginia Republican Party put up an advertisement on the Web -- titled ""12 Inches of Global Warming"" -- criticizing two Virginia Democrats, Representatives Rick Boucher and Tom Perriello, who voted for the federal cap-and-trade legislation last year. The advertisement urges voters to call Mr. Boucher and Mr. Perriello to ask if they will help with the shoveling.
Speculating on the meaning of severe weather events is not new. Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and a deadly heat wave in Europe in the summer of 2003 incited similar arguments about what such extremes might -- or might not -- say about the planet'sÊclimate.
ButÊclimateÊscientists say that no single episode of severe weather can be blamed for globalÊclimateÊtrends while noting evidence that such events will probably become more frequent as global temperatures rise.
Jeff Masters, a meteorologist who writes on the Weather Underground blog, said that the recent snows do not, by themselves, demonstrate anything about the long-term trajectory of the planet.ÊClimateÊis, by definition, a measure of decades and centuries, not months or years.
But Dr. Masters also said that government and academic studies had consistently predicted an increasing frequency of just these kinds of record-setting storms because warmer air carries more moisture.
""Of course,"" he wrote on his blog Wednesday as new snows produced white-out conditions in much of the Eastern half of the country, ""bothÊclimate-change contrarians andÊclimate-change scientists agree that no single weather event can be blamed onÊclimateÊchange.
""However,"" he continued, ""one can 'load the dice' in favor of events that used to be rare -- or unheard of -- if theÊclimateÊis changing to a new state.""
A federal government report issued last year, intended to be the authoritative statement of knownÊclimateÊtrends in the United States, pointed to the likelihood of more frequent snowstorms in the Northeast and less frequent snow in the South and Southeast as a result of long-term temperature and precipitation patterns. TheÊClimateÊImpacts report, from the multiagency United States Global Change Research Program, also projected more intense drought in the Southwest and more powerful Gulf Coast hurricanes because of warming.
In other words, if the government scientists are correct, look for more snow."
"National, Tuesday, February 23, 2010, p. A 19",E.P.A. Plans To Phase In Regulation Of Emissions,By JOHN M. BRODER,"WASHINGTON - Facing wide criticism over their recent finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public welfare, top Environmental Protection Agency officials said Monday that any regulation of such gases would be phased in gradually and would not impose expensive new rules on most American businesses.",,"""I share your goals of ensuring economic recovery at this critical time and of addressing greenhouse gas emissions in sensible ways that are consistent with the call for comprehensive energy and climate legislation,"" Ms. Jackson wrote.
The eight Democratic senators, led by John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, said hugely significant decisions about energy, the economy and the environment should be made by elected representatives, not by federal bureaucrats.
The senators, who earlier questioned broad cap-and-trade legislation pushed by the Obama administration, join a number of Republican lawmakers, industry groups and officials from Texas, Alabama and Virginia in challenging the proposed E.P.A. regulations of industrial sources. Senate Republicans are going a step further, seeking to prevent the agency from taking any action to limit greenhouse gases, which are tied to global warming.
Ms. Jackson warned that if the Republicans thwarted the agency's efforts to address climate change, it would kill the deal negotiated last year to limit carbon pollution from cars and light trucks and would have a chilling effect on the government's scientific studies of global warming.
""It also would be viewed by many as a vote to move the United States to a position behind that of China on the issue of  , and more in line with the position of Saudi Arabia,"" Ms. Jackson wrote.
The group led by Mr. Rockefeller asked Ms. Jackson to suspend any E.P.A. regulations of stationary sources -- including coal-burning power plants and large industrial facilities -- while Congress considers comprehensive energy and climate change legislation. The House passed a major climate and energy bill last summer that would have overridden some of the agency's regulatory authority. The Senate, however, has not acted on the issue and there is considerable doubt that it will do so this year.
""E.P.A. actions in this area would have enormous implications, and these issues need to be handled carefully and appropriately dealt with by the Congress, not in isolation by a federal environmental agency,"" Mr. Rockefeller said.
The Democrats who joined Mr. Rockefeller are Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Mark Begich of Alaska, Carl Levin of Michigan, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Max Baucus of Montana.
Manufacturers, oil companies and business coalitions also filed petitions objecting to the proposed rules.
Environmental advocates said the E.P.A. was justified in declaring carbon dioxide and gases that contribute to global warming to be dangerous pollutants under the Clean Air Act and was moving cautiously to regulate them.
""These answers from Lisa Jackson hopefully will reassure the authors of the letter that the E.P.A. is proceeding in a very measured way and doing what is achievable and affordable to curb global warming pollution and focusing as they should on the biggest sources like power plants and not small businesses,"" said David Doniger, climate policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council."
"National, Wednesday, December 22, 2010, p. A 1",TEMPERATURE RISING,"A Scientist, His Work and aÊClimateÊReckoning",By JUSTIN GILLIS,,"They make no noise. But once an hour, they spit out a number, and for decades, it has been rising relentlessly.
The first machine of this type was installed on Mauna Loa in the 1950s at the behest of Charles David Keeling, a scientist from San Diego. His resulting discovery, of the increasing level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, transformed the scientific understanding of humanity's relationship with the earth. A graph of his findings is inscribed on a wall in Washington as one of the great achievements of modern science.
Yet, five years after Dr. Keeling's death, his discovery is a focus not of celebration but of conflict. It has become the touchstone of a worldwide political debate over global warming.
When Dr. Keeling, as a young researcher, became the first person in the world to develop an accurate technique for measuring carbon dioxide in the air, the amount he discovered was 310 parts per million. That means every million pints of air, for example, contained 310 pints of carbon dioxide.
By 2005, the year he died, the number had risen to 380 parts per million. Sometime in the next few years it is expected to pass 400. Without stronger action to limit emissions, the number could pass 560 before the end of the century, double what it was before the Industrial Revolution.
The greatest question inÊclimateÊscience is: What will that do to the temperature of the earth?
Scientists have long known that carbon dioxide traps heat at the surface of the planet. They cite growing evidence that the inexorable rise of the gas is altering theÊclimateÊin ways that threaten human welfare.
Fossil fuel emissions, they say, are like a runaway train, hurtling the world's citizens toward a stone wall -- a carbon dioxide level that, over time, will cause profound changes.
The risks include melting ice sheets, rising seas, more droughts and heat waves, more flash floods, worse storms, extinction of many plants and animals, depletion of sea life and -- perhaps most important -- difficulty in producing an adequate supply of food. Many of these changes are taking place at a modest level already, the scientists say, but are expected to intensify.
Reacting to such warnings, President George Bush committed the United States in 1992 to limiting its emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. Scores of other nations made the same pledge, in a treaty that was long on promises and short on specifics.
But in 1998, when it came time to commit to details in a document known as the Kyoto Protocol, Congress balked. Many countries did ratify the protocol, but it had only a limited effect, and the past decade has seen little additional progress in controlling emissions.
Many countries are reluctant to commit themselves to tough emission limits, fearing that doing so will hurt economic growth. InternationalÊclimateÊtalks in Cancun, Mexico, this month ended with only modest progress. The Obama administration, which came into office pledging to limit emissions in the United States, scaled back its ambitions afterÊclimateÊand energy legislation died in the Senate this year.
Challengers have mounted a vigorous assault on the science ofÊclimateÊchange. Polls indicate that the public has grown more doubtful about that science. Some of the Republicans who will take control of the House of Representatives in January have promised to subjectÊclimateÊresearchers to a season of new scrutiny.
One of them is Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California. In a recent Congressional hearing on global warming, he said, ""The CO2 levels in the atmosphere are rather undramatic.""
But most scientists trained in the physics of the atmosphere have a different reaction to the increase.
""I find it shocking,"" said Pieter P. Tans, who runs the government monitoring program of which the Mauna Loa Observatory is a part. ""We really are in a predicament here, and it's getting worse every year.""
As the political debate drags on, the mute gray boxes atop Mauna Loa keep spitting out their numbers, providing a reality check: not only is the carbon dioxide level rising relentlessly, but the pace of that rise is accelerating over time.
""Nature doesn't care how hard we tried,"" Jeffrey D. Sachs, the Columbia University economist, said at a recent seminar. ""Nature cares how high the parts per million mount. This is running away.""
A Passion for Precision
Perhaps the biggest reason the world learned of the risk of global warming was the unusual personality of a single American scientist.
Charles David Keeling's son Ralph remembers that when he was a child, his family bought a new home in Del Mar, Calif., north of San Diego. His father assigned him the task of edging the lawn. Dr. Keeling insisted that Ralph copy the habits of the previous owner, an Englishman who had taken pride in his garden, cutting a precise two-inch strip between the sidewalk and the grass.
""It took a lot of work to maintain this attractive gap,"" Ralph Keeling recalled, but he said his father believed ""that was just the right way to do it, and if you didn't do that, you were cutting corners. It was a moral breach.""
Dr. Keeling was a punctilious man. It was by no means his defining trait -- relatives and colleagues described a man who played a brilliant piano, loved hiking mountains and might settle a friendly argument at dinner by pulling an etymological dictionary off the shelf.
But the essence of his scientific legacy was his passion for doing things in a meticulous way. It explains why, even as challengers try to pick apart every other aspect ofÊclimateÊscience, his half-century record of carbon dioxide measurements stands unchallenged.
By the 1950s, when Dr. Keeling was completing his scientific training, scientists had been observing the increasing use of fossil fuels and wondering whether carbon dioxide in the air was rising as a result. But nobody had been able to take accurate measurements of the gas.
As a young researcher, Dr. Keeling built instruments and developed techniques that allowed him to achieve great precision in making such measurements. Then he spent the rest of his life applying his approach.
In his earliest measurements of the air, taken in California and other parts of the West in the mid-1950s, he found that the background level for carbon dioxide was about 310 parts per million.
That discovery drew attention in Washington, and Dr. Keeling soon found himself enjoying government backing for his research. He joined the staff of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in the La Jolla section of San Diego, under the guidance of an esteemed scientist named Roger Revelle, and began laying plans to measure carbon dioxide around the world.
Some of the most important data came from an analyzer he placed in a government geophysical observatory that had been set up a few years earlier in a remote location: near the top of Mauna Loa, one of the volcanoes that loom over the Big Island of Hawaii.
He quickly made profound discoveries. One was that carbon dioxide oscillated slightly according to the seasons. Dr. Keeling realized the reason: most of the world's land is in the Northern Hemisphere, and plants there were taking up carbon dioxide as they sprouted leaves and grew over the summer, then shedding it as the leaves died and decayed in the winter.
He had discovered that the earth itself was breathing.
A more ominous finding was that each year, the peak level was a little higher than the year before. Carbon dioxide was indeed rising, and quickly. That finding electrified the small community of scientists who understood its implications. Later chemical tests, by Dr. Keeling and others, proved that the increase was due to the combustion of fossil fuels.
The graph showing rising carbon dioxide levels came to be known as the Keeling Curve. Many Americans have never heard of it, but to climatologists, it is the most recognizable emblem of their science, engraved in bronze on a building at Mauna Loa and carved into a wall at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington.
By the late 1960s, a decade after Dr. Keeling began his measurements, the trend of rising carbon dioxide was undeniable, and scientists began to warn of the potential for a big increase in the temperature of the earth.
Dr. Keeling's mentor, Dr. Revelle, moved to Harvard, where he lectured about the problem. Among the students in the 1960s who first saw the Keeling Curve displayed in Dr. Revelle's classroom was a senator's son from Tennessee named Albert Arnold Gore Jr., who marveled at what it could mean for the future of the planet.
Throughout much of his career, Dr. Keeling was cautious about interpreting his own measurements. He left that to other people while he concentrated on creating a record that would withstand scrutiny.
John Chin, a retired technician in Hawaii who worked closely with Dr. Keeling, recently described the painstaking steps he took, at Dr. Keeling's behest, to ensure accuracy. Many hours were required every week just to be certain that the instruments atop Mauna Loa had not drifted out of kilter.
The golden rule was ""no hanky-panky,"" Mr. Chin recalled in an interview in Hilo, Hawaii. Dr. Keeling and his aides scrutinized the records closely, and if workers in Hawaii fell down on the job, Mr. Chin said, they were likely to get a call or letter: ""What did you do? What happened that day?""
In later years, as the scientific evidence aboutÊclimateÊchange grew, Dr. Keeling's interpretations became bolder, and he began to issue warnings. In an essay in 1998, he replied to claims that global warming was a myth, declaring that the real myth was that ""natural resources and the ability of the earth's habitable regions to absorb the impacts of human activities are limitless.""
Still, by the time he died, global warming had not become a major political issue. That changed in 2006, when Mr. Gore's movie and book, both titled ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" brought the issue to wider public attention. The Keeling Curve was featured in both.
In 2007, a body appointed by the United Nations declared that the scientific evidence that the earth was warming had become unequivocal, and it added that humans were almost certainly the main cause. Mr. Gore and the panel jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize.
But as action began to seem more likely, the political debate intensified, with fossil-fuel industries mobilizing to fight emission-curbing measures.ÊClimate-change contrarians increased their attack on the science, taking advantage of the Internet to distribute their views outside the usual scientific channels.
In an interview in La Jolla, Dr. Keeling's widow, Louise, said that if her husband had lived to see the hardening of the political battle lines overÊclimateÊchange, he would have been dismayed.
""He was a registered Republican,"" she said. ""He just didn't think of it as a political issue at all.""
The Numbers
Not long ago, standing on a black volcanic plain two miles above the Pacific Ocean, the director of the Mauna Loa Observatory, John E. Barnes, pointed toward a high metal tower.
Samples are taken by hoses that snake to the top of the tower to ensure that only clean air is analyzed, he explained. He described other measures intended to guarantee an accurate record. Then Dr. Barnes, who works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, displayed the hourly calculation from one of the analyzers.
It showed the amount of carbon dioxide that morning as 388 parts per million.
After Dr. Keeling had established the importance of carbon dioxide measurements, the government began making its own, in the early 1970s. Today, a NOAA monitoring program and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography program operate in parallel at Mauna Loa and other sites, with each record of measurements serving as a quality check on the other.
The Scripps program is now run by Ralph Keeling, who grew up to become a renowned atmospheric scientist in his own right and then joined the Scripps faculty. He took control of the measurement program after his father's sudden death from a heart attack.
In an interview on the Scripps campus in La Jolla, Ralph Keeling calculated that the carbon dioxide level at Mauna Loa was likely to surpass 400 by May 2014, a sort of odometer moment in mankind's alteration of the atmosphere.
""We're going to race through 400 like we didn't see it go by,"" Dr. Keeling said.
What do these numbers mean?
The basic physics of the atmosphere, worked out more than a century ago, show that carbon dioxide plays a powerful role in maintaining the earth'sÊclimate. Even though the amount in the air is tiny, the gas is so potent at trapping the sun's heat that it effectively works as a one-way blanket, letting visible light in but stopping much of the resulting heat from escaping back to space.
Without any of the gas, the earth would most likely be a frozen wasteland -- according to a recent study, its average temperature would be colder by roughly 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But scientists say humanity is now polluting the atmosphere with too much of a good thing.
In recent years, researchers have been able to put the Keeling measurements into a broader context. Bubbles of ancient air trapped by glaciers and ice sheets have been tested, and they show that over the past 800,000 years, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air oscillated between roughly 200 and 300 parts per million. Just before the Industrial Revolution, the level was about 280 parts per million and had been there for several thousand years.
That amount of the gas, in other words, produced the equableÊclimateÊin which human civilization flourished.
Other studies, covering many millions of years, show a close association between carbon dioxide and the temperature of the earth. The gas seemingly played a major role in amplifying the effects of the ice ages, which were caused by wobbles in the earth's orbit.
The geologic record suggests that as the earth began cooling, the amount of carbon dioxide fell, probably because much of it got locked up in the ocean, and that fall amplified the initial cooling. Conversely, when the orbital wobble caused the earth to begin warming, a great deal of carbon dioxide escaped from the ocean, amplifying the warming.
Richard B. Alley, aÊclimateÊscientist at Pennsylvania State University, refers to carbon dioxide as the master control knob of the earth'sÊclimate. He said that because the wobbles in the earth's orbit were not, by themselves, big enough to cause the large changes of the ice ages, the situation made sense only when the amplification from carbon dioxide was factored in.
""What the ice ages tell us is that our physical understanding of CO2 explains what happened and nothing else does,"" Dr. Alley said. ""The ice ages are a very strong test of whether we've got it right.""
When people began burning substantial amounts of coal and oil in the 19th century, the carbon dioxide level began to rise. It is now about 40 percent higher than before the Industrial Revolution, and humans have put half the extra gas into the air since just the late 1970s. Emissions are rising so rapidly that some experts fear that the amount of the gas could double or triple before emissions are brought under control.
The earth's history offers no exact parallel to the human combustion of fossil fuels, so scientists have struggled to calculate the effect.
Their best estimate is that if the amount of carbon dioxide doubles, the temperature of the earth will rise about five or six degrees Fahrenheit. While that may sound small given the daily and seasonal variations in the weather, the number represents an annual global average, and therefore an immense addition of heat to the planet.
The warming would be higher over land, and it would be greatly amplified at the poles, where a considerable amount of ice might melt, raising sea levels. The deep ocean would also absorb a tremendous amount of heat.
Moreover, scientists say that an increase of five or six degrees is a mildly optimistic outlook. They cannot rule out an increase as high as 18 degrees Fahrenheit, which would transform the planet.
Climate-change contrarians do not accept these numbers.
The Internet has given rise to a vocal cadre of challengers who question every aspect of the science -- even the physics, worked out in the 19th century, that shows that carbon dioxide traps heat. That is a point so elementary and well-established that demonstrations of it are routinely carried out by high school students.
However, the contrarians who have most influenced Congress are a handful of men trained in atmospheric physics. They generally accept the rising carbon dioxide numbers, they recognize that the increase is caused by human activity, and they acknowledge that the earth is warming in response.
But they doubt that it will warm nearly as much as mainstream scientists say, arguing that the increase is likely to be less than two degrees Fahrenheit, a change they characterize as manageable.
Among the most prominent of these contrarians is Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who contends that as the earth initially warms, cloud patterns will shift in a way that should help to limit the heat buildup. MostÊclimateÊscientists contend that little evidence supports this view, but Dr. Lindzen is regularly consulted on Capitol Hill.
""I am quite willing to state,"" Dr. Lindzen said in a speech this year, ""that unprecedentedÊclimateÊcatastrophes are not on the horizon, though in several thousand years we may return to an ice age.""
The Fuel of Civilization
While the world's governments have largely accepted the science ofÊclimateÊchange, their efforts to bring emissions under control are lagging.
The simple reason is that modern civilization is built on burning fossil fuels. Cars, trucks, power plants, steel mills, farms, planes, cement factories, home furnaces -- virtually all of them spew carbon dioxide or lesser heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
Developed countries, especially the United States, are largely responsible for the buildup that has taken place since the Industrial Revolution. They have begun to make some headway on the problem, reducing the energy they use to produce a given amount of economic output, with some countries even managing to lower their total emissions.
But these modest efforts are being swamped by rising energy use in developing countries like China, India and Brazil. In those lands, economic growth is not simply desirable -- it is a moral imperative, to lift more than a third of the human race out of poverty. A recent scientific paper referred to China's surge as ""the biggest transformation of human well-being the earth has ever seen.""
China's citizens, on average, still use less than a third of the energy per person as Americans. But with 1.3 billion people, four times as many as the United States, China is so large and is growing so quickly that it has surpassed the United States to become the world's largest overall user of energy.
Barring some big breakthrough in clean-energy technology, this rapid growth in developing countries threatens to make the emissions problem unsolvable.
Emissions dropped sharply in Western nations in 2009, during the recession that followed the financial crisis, but that decrease was largely offset by continued growth in the East. And for 2010, global emissions are projected to return to the rapid growth of the past decade, rising more than 3 percent a year.
Many countries have, in principle, embraced the idea of trying to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, feeling that any greater warming would pose unacceptable risks. As best scientists can calculate, that means about one trillion tons of carbon can be burned and the gases released into the atmosphere before emissions need to fall to nearly zero.
""It took 250 years to burn the first half-trillion tons,"" Myles R. Allen, a leading BritishÊclimateÊscientist, said in a briefing. ""On current trends, we'll burn the next half-trillion in less than 40.""
Unless more serious efforts to convert to a new energy system begin soon, scientists argue, it will be impossible to hit the 3.6-degree target, and the risk will increase that global warming could spiral out of control by century's end.
""We are quickly running out of time,"" said Josep G. Canadell, an Australian scientist who tracks emissions
In many countries, the United States and China among them, a conversion of the energy system has begun, with wind turbines and solar panels sprouting across the landscape. But they generate only a tiny fraction of all power, with much of the world's electricity still coming from the combustion of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.
With the exception of European countries, few nations have been willing to raise the cost of fossil fuels or set emissions caps as a way to speed the transformation. In the United States, a particular fear has been that a carbon policy will hurt the country's industries as they compete with companies abroad whose governments have adopted no such policy.
As he watches these difficulties, Ralph Keeling contemplates the unbending math of carbon dioxide emissions first documented by his father more than a half-century ago and wonders about the future effects of that increase.
""When I go see things with my children, I let them know they might not be around when they're older,"" he said. "" 'Go enjoy these beautiful forests before they disappear. Go enjoy the glaciers in these parks because they won't be around.' It's basically taking note of what we have, and appreciating it, and saying goodbye to it.""
On Dec. 11, another round of internationalÊclimateÊnegotiations, sponsored by the United Nations, concluded in Cancun. As they have for 18 years running, the gathered nations pledged renewed efforts. But they failed to agree on any binding emission targets.
Late at night, as the delegates were wrapping up in Mexico, the machines atop the volcano in the middle of the Pacific Ocean issued their own silent verdict on the world's efforts.
At midnight Mauna Loa time, the carbon dioxide level hit 390 -- and rising.

"Editorial, Monday, August 23, 2010, p. A 23",OP-ED CONTRIBUTOR,Disaster at The Top of The World,By THOMAS HOMER-DIXON,,"STANDING on the deck of this floating laboratory for Arctic science, which is part of Canada's Coast Guard fleet and one of the world's most powerful icebreakers, I can see vivid evidence ofÊclimateÊchange. Channels through the Canadian Arctic archipelago that were choked with ice at this time of year two decades ago are now expanses of open water or vast patchworks of tiny islands of melting ice.
In 1994, the ""Louie,"" as the crew calls the ship, and a United States Coast Guard icebreaker, the Polar Sea, smashed their way to the North Pole through thousands of miles of pack ice six- to nine-feet thick. ""The sea conditions in the Arctic Ocean were rarely an issue for us in those days, because the thick continuous ice kept waves from forming,"" Marc Rothwell, the Louie's captain, told me. ""Now, there's so much open water that we have to account for heavy swells that undulate through the sea ice. It's almost like a dream: the swells move in slow motion, like nothing I've seen elsewhere.""
The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and this summer its sea ice is melting at a near-record pace. The sun is heating the newly open water, so it will take longer to refreeze this winter, and the resulting thinner ice will melt more easily next summer.
At the same time, warm Pacific Ocean water is pulsing through the Bering Strait into the Arctic basin, helping melt a large area of sea ice between Alaska and eastern Siberia. Scientists are just beginning to learn how this exposed water has changed the movement of heat energy and major air currents across the Arctic basin, in turn producing winds that push remaining sea ice down the coasts of Greenland into the Atlantic.
Globally, 2010 is on track to be the warmest year on record. In regions around the world, indications abound that earth'sÊclimateÊis quickly changing, like the devastating mudslides in China and weeks of searing heat in Russia. But in the world's capitals, movement onÊclimateÊpolicy has nearly stopped.
Democrats in the Senate decided last month that they wouldn't push for approval of aÊclimateÊbill. In Canada, Australia, Japan and countries across Europe, the global economic crisis and other near-term concerns have pushedÊclimateÊissues to the back burner. For China and India, economic growth and energy security are more vital priorities.
ClimateÊpolicy is gridlocked, and there's virtually no chance of a breakthrough. Many factors have conspired to produce this situation. Human beings are notoriously poor at responding to problems that develop incrementally. And most of us aren't eager to change our lifestyles by sharply reducing our energy consumption.
But social scientists have identified another major reason:ÊClimateÊchange has become an ideologically polarizing issue. It taps into deep personal identities and causes what Dan Kahan of Yale calls ""protective cognition"" -- we judge things in part on whether we see ourselves as rugged individualists mastering nature or as members of interconnected societies who live in harmony with the environment. Powerful special interests like the coal and oil industries have learned how to halt movement onÊclimateÊpolicy by exploiting the fear people feel when their identities are threatened.
Given this reality, we'll almost certainly need some kind of devastatingÊclimateÊshock to get effectiveÊclimateÊpolicy. That's the key lesson of the recent financial crisis: when powerful special interests have convinced much of the public that what they're doing isn't dangerous, only a disaster that discredits those interests will provide an opportunity for comprehensive policy change like the Dodd-Frank financial regulations.
It is possible that the changes I'm seeing from the ship deck are the beginning of theÊclimateÊshock that will awaken us to the danger we face. Scientists aren't sure what will happen when a significant portion of the Arctic Ocean changes from white, sunlight-reflecting ice to dark, sunlight-absorbing open water. But most aren't sanguine.
These experts are especially concerned that new patterns of air movement in the Arctic could disrupt the Northern Hemisphere's jet streams -- which are apparently weakening and moving northward. This could alter storm tracks, rainfall patterns and food production far to the south.
The limited slack in the world's food system, particularly its grain production, can amplify the effects of disruptions. Remember that two years ago, when higher oil prices encouraged farmers to shift enormous tracts of cropland from grain to biofuel production, grain prices quickly doubled or tripled. Violence erupted in dozens of countries. ShouldÊclimateÊchange cause crop failures in major food-producing regions of Europe, North America and East Asia, the consequences would likely be far more severe.
Policy makers need to accept that societies won't make drastic changes to addressÊclimateÊchange until such a crisis hits. But that doesn't mean there's nothing for them to do in the meantime. When a crisis does occur, the societies with response plans on the shelf will be far better off than those that are blindsided. The task for national and regional leaders, then, is to develop a set of contingency plans for possibleÊclimateÊshocks -- what we might call, collectively, Plan Z.
Some work of this kind is under way at intelligence agencies and research institutions in the United States and Europe. Harvard's Kennedy School of Government has produced one of the best studies, ""Responding to Threat ofÊClimateÊChange Mega-Catastrophes."" But for the most part these initiatives are preliminary and uncoordinated.
We need a much more deliberate Plan Z, with detailed scenarios of plausibleÊclimateÊshocks; close analyses of options for emergency response by governments, corporations and nongovernmental groups; and clear specifics about what resources -- financial, technological and organizational -- we will need to cope with different types of crises.
In the most likely scenarios,ÊclimateÊchange would cause some kind of regional or continental disruption, like a major crop failure; this disruption would cascade through the world's tightly connected economic and political systems to produce a global effect. Severe floods dislocating millions of people in a key poor country -- as we're seeing right now in Pakistan -- could allow radicals to seize power and tip a geopolitically vital region into war. Or drought could cause an economically critical region like the North China plain to exhaust its water reserves, forcing people to leave en masse and precipitating a crisis that reverberates through the world economy.
AÊclimateÊshock in North America is easy to imagine. Say a prolonged drought causes major cities in the American Southeast or Southwest to run out of water; both regions have large urban populations pushing against upper limits of water supply. The news clips of cars streaming out of Atlanta or Phoenix might finally push our leaders to do something serious aboutÊclimateÊchange.
If so, a Plan Z for this particular scenario would help us make the most of the opportunity. It would provide guidelines for regional and local leaders on how to respond to the crisis. We would decide in advance where supplies of water would be found and who would get priority allocations; local law enforcement and emergency responders would already have worked out lines of authority with federal agencies and the military.
Then there are the broader steps to mitigateÊclimateÊchange in general. Here, Plan Z would address many critical questions: How fast could carbon emissions from automobiles and energy production be ramped down, and what would be the economic, political and social consequences of different rates of reduction? Where would we find the vast amounts of money needed to overhaul existing energy systems? How quickly could different economic sectors and social groups adapt to different kinds ofÊclimateimpacts? And if geoengineering to alter earth'sÊclimateÊ-- for example, injecting sulfates into the high atmosphere -- is to be an option, who would make the decision and undertake the operation?
Looking over the endless, empty horizon of the Arctic, I find it hard to imagine this spot being of any importance to global affairs. But it is just one of many places now considered marginal that could be the starting point for aÊclimateÊshock that plays a central role in the evolution of human civilization. We need to be ready."
"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Thursday, July 22, 2010",PROFESSOR STEPHEN SCHNEIDER,"PROFESSOR STEPHEN SCHNEIDER, who died on Monday aged 65, made his name in the 1970s by predicting a ""new ice age"", but went on to become one of the best-known proponents of the idea of global warming caused by human activities.",,"Schneider was a pioneer in the development of computer models that combine processes like ocean dynamics and cloud changes to study and predict climate change. He also carried out research into the impact of climate change on the distribution of plant and animal species and studied the damage greenhouse gases cause to the ozone layer.
In recent years he had become involved in working with economists on the likely costs of stabilising the world's climate, developing policy options for mitigating and adapting to climate change and researching whether it is possible to identify a ""tipping point"" that could announce more rapid climate change.
Schneider had the rare gift of being able to explain the complexities of climate science to the public in simple terms and, as befits the author of Science as a Contact Sport (2007), was combative in challenging the climate sceptics. While he willingly conceded that climate science is fraught with uncertainty (it was not ""either/or"", he said, but ""a bell curve of possibilities""), he was withering about those who exploit that uncertainty to undermine public faith in a scientific consensus based on the ""accumulated preponderance of evidence"".
His vigour in public debate attracted vitriol. An FBI investigation found his name on a neo-Nazi ""death list"", and a constant stream of abusive emails reached a peak earlier this year after he published a paper showing that 97-98 per cent of climate scientists agree that mankind's carbon emissions are causing global temperatures to increase.
But his anger over the purposeful distortion of the environmental debate was equally directed at what he called the ""almost religious fervour of the emotive enviros"", which he regarded as nearly as damaging as the manipulations of the deniers. Interest groups of both extremes, he argued, ""select information out of context to protect their interests while clear exposition and balanced assessment sinks even lower on the priority list of advocatedriven debates"".
Ironically, perhaps, Schneider himself was credited with providing the sceptics with one of the best quotations in their armoury during a 1988 interview with Discover magazine in which he explained how scientists were having to think of vivid ways of getting their message across. As widely reproduced, the quotation read: ""Scientists should consider stretching the truth to get some broad-base support, to capture the public's imagination. That, of course, entails getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention about any doubts we might have.""
In fact, the phrase ""stretching the truth"" was not in the original interview, but was added later by critics who invariably omitted Schneider's vital qualification: ""This 'double ethical bind' we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.""
In Science as a Contact Sport, Schneider ventured the opinion that the ""battle"" over climate change looked ""more winnable these days"". Yet after the failure of the Copenhagen summit, he struck a more pessimistic note, observing that the uncertainty of the science was being exploited to blunt the political will to act. ""Can democracy survive complexity?"" he wondered.
Stephen Henry Schneider was born in New York City on February 11 1945 and grew up on Long Island. After taking a degree in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, he went on to take a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering and Plasma Physics in 1971.
The same year Schneider co-wrote an article in the journal Science about atmospheric aerosols -- floating particles of soil dust, volcanic ash and human-made pollutants. His research suggested that industrial aerosols could block sunlight and reduce global temperatures enough to overcome the effects of greenhouse gases, a suggestion which brought national headlines warning of an imminent ice age.
But he soon realised that he had overestimated the amount of aerosols in the air. When he recalculated with more accurate data in 1974, he concluded that the warming effect of CO2 would be greater than the cooling caused by aerosols. His apparent change of heart gave his critics much ammunition over the years, and the experience led Schneider to emphasise the vital importance of data checking and of accumulated evidence, which was not available in the early 1970s when climate science was a new field.
After a period of postdoctoral study at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Nasa, Schneider moved to the National Center for Atmospheric Research at Boulder, Colorado, where, among other things, he carried out research on the likely climatic impact of nuclear war, concluding that the widely predicted ""nuclear winter"" was more likely to be a ""nuclear autumn"".
In 1992 he moved to Stanford University, where he held chairs in Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Biological Sciences, as well as an honorary chair in Civil and Environmental Engineering. He served as a member of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from its inception in 1988 until his death.
In 2001 Schneider was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, a rare and highly lethal cancer. Determined to fight the disease, he used probability models he had developed for climate research to push his doctors to try treatments they either dismissed or had not considered. Four years later, when the disease was in remission, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled The Patient From Hell.
Stephen Schneider died of a heart attack while flying to London from a science meeting in Stockholm. He is survived by his wife, Terry Root, a fellow scientist at Stanford, and by a son and daughter from a previous marriage"
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Saturday, May 29, 2010",ROYAL SOCIETY BOWS TO CLIMATE CHANGE SCEPTICS,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"The national academy of sciences has decided to act after a number of its Fellows complained that doubts over climate change were not being communicated to the public.
The society has published a number of papers on global warming, but will now issue a new guide to summarise the arguments.
Lord Rees of Ludlow, the society's president, accepted that the case for man-made global warming had been exaggerated in the past.
He emphasised that the basic science remained sound but had agreed to issue new official guidance to reflect uncertainties. ""Climate change is a hugely important issue but the public debate has all too often been clouded by exaggeration and misleading information,"" he said.
""We aim to provide the public with a clear indication of what is known about the climate system, what we think we know about it and, just as importantly, the aspects we still do not understand very well.""
In recent months the debate about global warming has been marred by scandal. Emails stolen from the University of East Anglia appeared to show that scientists were willing to manipulate data to exaggerate warming. The individuals involved were cleared of wrongdoing but the ""climategate"" disclosures knocked public confidence.
At the same time, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which advises the United Nations, was criticised after wrongly claiming that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035.
Complaints were made by 43 Royal Society Fellows that its guidance did not reflect uncertainty among some in the scientific community.
They were said to be particularly unhappy with one document, Climate Change Consensus, which defended mainstream science from the arguments of the sceptics.
Lord Rees said the new guide had been planned for some time but was given ""added impetus by concerns raised by a small group of fellows"".
""Nothing in recent developments has changed or weakened the underpinning science of climate change,"" he said. ""In the current environment we believe this new guide will be very timely. Lots of people are asking questions.
Indeed, even within the Fellowship of the Society there are differing views. Our guide will be based on expert views backed up by sound scientific evidence.""
He denied accusations that the national academy of sciences had ever stifled debate or that the case for man-made global warming was in doubt.
Benny Peiser, the director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think-tank, said it was time the sceptics were taken more seriously.
""I think it is a very significant development in that it is no longer one or two eccentrics but a wide group of Fellows so it is taken more seriously, as it should be,"" he said.

"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Wednesday, August 11, 2010",DISASTERS 'PROVE THAT GLOBAL WARMING IS HAPPENING',Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"They said the ""extreme weather events"" of recent months were all ""unprecedented"" and that such disasters, taken together, were proof of climate change.
Scientists also warned that widespread and devastating flooding would become more frequent and could be considered normal by the middle of the century.
Almost 14million people have been affected by the torrential rains in Pakistan, and 1,600 have died, making it a greater humanitarian disaster than the South Asian tsunami and recent earthquakes in Kashmir and Haiti combined, the United Nations said.
In Russia, firefighters and soldiers were yesterday battling to stop wildfires from engulfing key nuclear sites, while Prime Minister Vladimir Putin took to the air in a waterbombing plane to join the effort. Morgues in Moscow are overflowing as officials estimate 5,000 people have died in the worst heat wave in 130 years.
Flooding in China has killed more than 1,100 people this year and caused tens of billions of dollars in damage across 28 provinces. Flash floods in France and Eastern Europe have killed more than 30 people over the summer.
Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body set up by the UN to monitor global warming, said the ""dramatic"" weather patterns were consistent with changes in the climate caused by mankind.
""These are events which reproduce and intensify in a climate disturbed by greenhouse gas pollution,"" he said. ""Extreme events are one of the ways in which climatic changes become dramatically visible.""
Meteorologists said the disasters in Russia, Pakistan and China had all been driven by a ""supercharged jet stream"". The jet stream, a vast ring of high-speed winds, had split in two with one section heading north over Russia and the other going south over the Himalayas into Pakistan. In Russia, the stream was inhaling the heat and spreading it quickly, causing fires. However, in Pakistan it was ""supercharging"" the monsoon. Dr Peter Stott, head of climate monitoring at the Met Office, said there was ""clear evidence"" of a rise in the frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change.
""The odds of such extreme events are rapidly shortening, and they could become considered the norm by the middle of this century,"" he said. Prof Andrew Watson, of the University of East Anglia, said the extreme events were ""fairly consistent with the IPCC reports and what 99 per cent of the scientists believe to be happening"".

More than 1,600 have been killed, while almost 14million have been affected and need aid.

Addressing hundreds of business leaders at St James's Palace yesterday, he said: ""It has been profoundly depressing to witness the way the socalled climatesceptics are, apparently, able to intimidate all sorts of people from adopting the precautionary measures necessary to avert environmental collapse.
""For too long we have treated the planet like a perpetual cash machine which doles out money without there ever being any need to check the bank balance.
""But now, finally, the money is running out.""
Recent incidents have damaged the reputation of climate science. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was forced to apologise after mistakenly claiming that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. Scientists at the University of East Anglia were also accused of exaggerating the extent of global temperature rises. Although the British researchers were cleared of dishonesty, the so-called ""climategate"" saga coupled with the coldest winter in Britain for 30 years led to a fall in the number of Britons who believe global warming is caused by humans. A recent survey showed 70 per cent of people in Britain believed climate change was man-made compared with 90 per cent five years ago. The Prince said scepticism was ""on the rise"" and called on the private sector to use the power of their brands to persuade the public to take global warming seriously. -Climate change is having a dramatic impact on the seas and wildlife around the British Isles with some fish migrating up to 250 miles to the north, a wide-ranging government report claims. According to the annual report by almost 100 scientists from 40 leading British organisations, ocean levels and temperatures are rising, resulting in fish and breeding seabirds abandoning the coasts."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Wednesday, August 25, 2010",CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVISTS 'SHOULD PAY POLICE BILL',Auslan Cramb,,"Councillor Iain Whyte, convenor of the Lothian and Borders Police Board, said the final bill for policing the fiveday Climate Camp outside the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) could be even higher.
He also claimed that meeting the cost of the event against a backdrop of reduced public sector funding could result in service cuts.
Cllr Whyte added: ""There have been a lot of police officers involved and that will have included a lot of overtime and additional costs to bring in support from surrounding forces.""
Police arrested a total of 18 protesters during the camp, including 12 detained in a day of ""mass action"" at different sites in Edinburgh on Monday.
Several incidents caused disruption to motorists and bank customers.
The protesters, who labelled the RBS group a ""climate criminal"" over its funding of fossil fuel companies, targeted two main roads, RBS branches and two energy firms.
Some of the 500 activists at the camp also clashed with police following a tense standoff on Monday night.
Cllr Whyte said: ""Where there are options to go to the people who have put on the event, where they've not co-operated with the police, where they've deliberately gone out of their way to be disruptive, and to do damage to property in the city, then we should be seeking to recover costs if that's at all possible.
""I don't see why the people of Edinburgh, and the wider Lothian and Borders, should have their policing service reduced in future years because some protesters come here and choose to take illegal action.""
Cllr Whyte said it looked likely that the board would have to foot the bill using reserves meant for unforeseen emergencies.
He added that, at a time when public sector budgets were being cut by 25 per cent over the next four years, any added cost was a strain on the board's resources.
However, a spokesman for the climate camp said the ""cost of climate change"" would far exceed the cost of any policing operation, adding: ""That's the cost I think most people are worried about.""
Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, said that in a democratic society peaceful protest was a right.
He added: ""Everyone has the right to express their views in the right way and certainly on climate issues we are more than cognisant of those issues, of the transitions being made in the whole world economy towards more sustainable economic development in all ways.""
Five climate change protesters were granted bail yesterday after pleading not guilty to charges at Edinburgh sheriff court. They were released on condition that they left Edinburgh by 7pm last night and did not enter the city unless attending court or meeting their solicitor.

"Telegraph (London, UK)","Saturday, October 23, 2010",WILL THE LIGHTS GO OUT?,Gordon MacKerron,,"Energy policy decisions are complex and difficult Objectives are wide-ranging - security, efficiency, affordability, environmental protection (including climate change) - and they are not always mutually consistent Among these objectives, security especially worries politicians. The last Prime Minister declared in 2008 that security was an ""imperative"", a core state responsibility that the present government endorses. Among security issues, the threat that the lights might (literally) go out especially haunts policy makers.
The starting point is a comb ination of unrelated circumstances due to bite in the middle of this decade. The first is that all our nuclear stations but one will need to close before 2020, a non-negotiable position because of safety concerns.
Second, a new and more stringent EU Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) on emissions from generating plant comes into effect in 2015 and this will, if implemented fully, cause the closedown of 8,000 megawatts of otherwise serviceable coal-fired plant. Some easing of the problem might be expected to come from reductions in electricity demand. After all, the Government is pursuing a Green New Deal designed to cut domestic energy use. But even if this new deal is rapidly and widely implemented, this will not help much.
As argued by the authoritative Committee on Climate Change, there is a powerful policy need for a large growth in electricity use, for example in transport and in heating, even while total energy demand is expected to fall. This need for rapid growth in electricity use is a consequence of the UK's ambitious commitments to climate change targets, which can best be kick-started through major expansion in low-carbon electricity generation (renewable energy and nuclear power). Needs for growth in electricity capacity and to shut down large quantities of plant leaves a large apparent ""gap"" from 2015 onwards.
So how might we fill this gap? Renewable energy and nuclear power are being pursued vigorously but they cannot collectively fill the gap by 2015. Renewables are growing fast but from a very low base, and there will be no power from the first new nuclear station until 2018. Hence the fear of the lights going out sounds serious.
In reality, the gap is unlikely to materialise. There is a large stock of gas-fired power projects waiting, ready to go at short notice, and each capable of being built in two years. Fears around further gas import dependence are also exaggerated given the diversity of gas sources and the recent expansion of US supplies from shale.
There is also a willingness in the policy system to contemplate major reform to the wholesale electricity market and this could be adapted to incentivise building of gas-fired capacity, should market signals prove insufficiently strong. And if all these mechanisms are not enough and a gap really did loom, then we can rely on the European Commission to allow postponement of the application of the LCPD. So the lights can and almost certainly will stay on, but there is a further twist and a real policy dilemma.
The likely need for a large quantity of new gas-fired plant from mid-decade, with a lifetime of 30 years, means that the rate at which our electricity system can be decarbonised will be reduced, impacting on climate change strategy. The pat answer to this is to say mat new gasfired capacity will have carbon capture and storage technology fitted later. But there are two snags here. Carbon capture and storage is yet to be demonstrated at full scale; and business may be hesitant to bring forward its pipeline of gas-fired projects if it fears that their later profitability might be jeopardised by a retrospective need to fit carbon capture. So there is a potentially stark choice for the Coalition: guarantee security by allowing new, gas-fired power, or stick to climate change strategy and take more risks with security. When Gordon Brown said security was an ""imperative"", he labelled climate change strategy as a ""challenge"". Governments can afford to fail on challenges but they cannot fail to deliver on imperatives.
The big issue about security is therefore not whether or not the lights can be kept on; it is whether, in keeping the lights on, the UK finds creative ways to maintain the climate change commitments that the Coalition seems serious about meeting. Gas for low-carbon electricity Natural gas can be an affordable source of low-cost, low-carbon electricity for the UK in both the short- and long-term. In the next 10 vital years the cheapest, fastest, most significant way to reduce COz emissions is for new gas-fired power stations to replace old coal-fired plants.
Longer term, combining natural gas and carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) offers a low-cost way to secure, low-carbon electricity. This has been demonstrated in a recent cost comparison study. For natural gas and CCS to realise their full potential, we need government support for CCS demonstration, a carbon price and effective carbon markets. So, in the UK a substantial gas capacity with CCS can take its place alongside nuclear and new wind in a well diversified future energy supply mix. James Smith Chairman, Shell UK

Around 500 protesters occupied fields overlooking the RBS building in Gogarburn over the weekend before launching their day of ""mass action"" in the Scottish capital.
Spokesmen for the climate camp claimed their protests would be peaceful but officers said they had seen activists wielding hammers and throwing missiles. Many of the 3,300 staff at the Gogarburn site were encouraged to work from home.
Supt Lesley Clark said police plans to facilitate peaceful protest had failed, adding: ""There seems to be an element determined to wreak havoc. We will be working to protect the public and maintain order. ""We have drafted in officers from most Scottish forces and there is a substantial police presence on site. ""What we were hoping to achieve was to continue to work with the protesters and allow them to protest.
""However, the rules of engagement have now changed and we need to think about a more robust policing response which we always did envisage maybe being the case."" The latest direct action involved rooftop protests, buildings being daubed with graffiti, roads being blocked, people chaining themselves to doors and others supergluing themselves together.
Police said they were particularly concerned by one incident yesterday in which an oil-like substance was spread on the A720 ring road and the westbound A8 outside the city. A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said it was a ""reckless and dangerous"" act that could have placed many members of the public at risk.
He added: ""It is a worrying trend and disturbing escalation in the activities of the protesters."" Seven activists were said to have super- glued themselves to the executive car park of RBS offices at the Gyle shopping centre, another seven targeted the Forth Energy building and activists created an ""oil slick"" with molasses outside the Cairn Energy offices. Bank branches in Nicolson Street, North Bridge and Hunter Square were also targeted.
Cairn Energy develops oil and gas reserves around the world while Forth Energy was formed by Scottish and Southern Energy and Forth Ports plc to develop renewable energy projects.
Scottish and Southern is the UK's largest renewable energy generator and Forth Ports plc owns and operates seven commercial ports. Activists said they were targeting the company because of its plans to build four ""environmentally destructive"" biomass -- wood-burning -- power stations in Scotland.
A spokesman from the climate camp added: ""Biomass is exacerbating climate change, destroying precious forests and pulling money away from real, sustainable solutions, like energy efficiency measures, wind, solar and tidal power."" The Edinburgh Book Festival, sponsored by RBS, also found itself disrupted when a talk by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz was interrupted.
Stiglitz has been a critic of modern banking and globalisation, leaving organisers wondering why he was targeted. The climatecamp was set up last Thursday to object to the bank's investment in oil industry developments around the world.
Activists described RBS, which is 84 per cent owned by the taxpayer, as a ""climate criminal"" and said it was financing developments which could be dangerous for the environment.
Annette, a protester from France, said: ""We're not trying to antagonise anyone or stop them doing their business. ""We're just trying to raise awareness and maybe get things to change.""
RBS said it had been one of the most active banks in the world in providing funding for renewable energy projects in recent years.
Protesters are expected to start leaving the camp today."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Saturday, December 11, 2010",ACTION SPEAKS LOUDER THAN HOT AIR,Geoffrey Lean,,"Four hundred leading companies - including Tesco, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Kraft, Walmart, Procter and Gamble and L'Oreal - said they would be switching refrigerants within the next five years. Important to them, you might think, but not the sort of thing to stir the blood unless you're the type of person that finds coolants really cool.
But bear with me. The chemicals, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are greenhouse gases. Yet even that is not the point. What makes the announcement exceptional is that they are among a handful of overlooked pollutants whose reduction would reduce global warming far quicker, and with much less fuss, than trying to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the object of the climate negotiations which have ground on, with little success, for two decades.
For despite the virtually exclusive attention paid to it, carbon dioxide is only half the problem. These other pollutants - black carbon, ozone, and methane, as well as HFCs - contribute about the same amount to climate change.
Black carbon, which gives soot its colour, is the biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide. Mainly emitted from inefficient stoves in developing countries and the exhausts of diesel vehicles, it absorbs solar radiation when airborne, helping to heat the globe. And when it falls out on to snow or ice, it darkens them, making them absorb less sunlight and melt faster: it has played a major part in shrinking Himalayan glaciers.
We should be on its case even if global warming were not taking place, for it is a mass murderer. At least 1.6million people, mainly women and children in the Third World, perish every year from breathing it in from smoke generated by their stoves. And people in Britain are twice as likely to die from respiratory disease when heavily exposed to its emission from exhausts.
Similarly, ozone (when near ground level, rather than in the life-saving layer in the atmosphere) is a nasty component of smog, contributing to the asthma epidemic which affects one in seven British children - besides causing tens of billions of dollars worth of damage to crops worldwide.
It is also much easier to tackle these pollutants than carbon dioxide. None is defended by such powerful, and often unscrupulous, interests as the oil and coal industries. They can largely be addressed by local and national authorities using existing laws, without having to wait for an international treaty. And most of the solutions are known, with technologies in place.
California, for example, has halved its emissions of black carbon from diesel engines over the past two decades, and non-polluting stoves are increasingly being developed. Cutting ozone levels is a part of air pollution programmes worldwide, even if we have an atrocious record of doing it in Britain. Relatively simple measures could slash methane emissions by 40 per cent. The business initiative will do much to reduce HFC use. And so on.
All this can be done far faster than negotiating, ratifying and implementing a new treaty on carbon dioxide, which will take years, at least. And it would also have a much faster effect. While CO2 remains in the atmosphere, warming it for centuries, even millennia, these other pollutants disappear in less than a decade, sometimes in days, making it possible to have an immediate effect on slowing climate change. Studies show that a vigorous programme to tackle them would buy decades of desperately needed time in which to cut carbon dioxide emissions, offering much the best chance of bringing global warming under control.
But even though most of this was established a quarter of a century ago, these forgotten causes of global warming were again almost totally ignored in the Cancun talks. The pressure groups were equally silent; only a handful take any interest amid the thousands campaigning over CO2.
Why? One reason is that the groups find it easier to raise funds when railing against a powerful enemy, like the oil companies. Another is ideologicial - for some environmentalists, CO2 is a handy stick for beating capitalism. A third lies in the myopia of scientists who can't see beyond the main cause of global warming.
The battle to cut carbon dioxide must continue unabated; there will be no permanent solution until it is drastically reduced. But in the meantime it is crazy, as the industries showed, to ignore the simple, immediate measures that could make saving the climatepossible."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Monday, December 6, 2010",RISING SEA -LEVEL THREAT DOWNGRADED,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent in Cancun,,"Previously scientists had said oceans could rise by up to 13ft (4m), threatening cities such as Shanghai, London and New York by 2100.
But it has been revised so that now the worse case scenario is just over 6ft 6in (2m). This is still unlikely, but would mean the Maldives in the Indian Ocean and Tuvalu in the Pacific could be lost forever. The most plausible sea level rise this century remains between 8in and 23in (20-60cm), causing devastation in small island states and low-lying countries such as Bangladesh.
The new report also found that the Atlantic ""conveyer belt"" is not slowing down as much as previously thought. The circulation of currents, also known as the Gulf Stream, keeps Britain warm and it is feared that if it slows down suddenly it could cause a ""second ice age"".
The scenario was presented in the film The Day After Tomorrow and has even been blamed for the recent cold snaps, but it appears it is unlikely to affect Britain this century. The revisions will be pounced upon by sceptics as evidence that the Met Office has exaggerated climate change.
However Vicky Pope, head of climate change advice, said that, overall, the new report concluded that most global warming predictions were the same or worse than previously thought. ""The evidence of the dangerous impacts of climate change is now clearer than ever,"" she said.
The report analysed all the recent peer-reviewed papers on climate change, on behalf of the British Government, to reassess the threats since the last major study on global warming was carried out by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in 2007. It found that the melting of the Arctic was occurring faster than predicted, with icefree summers expected by the middle of this century. Deforestation could also speed up as droughts in the Amazon cause forest fires.
The report was launched at the UN Cancun Climate Change summit, which remains deadlocked over whether to introduce a legally binding carbon emissions treaty.
Chris Huhne, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, is flying to Cancun to try to resolve the impasse. He insisted the talks were on track to achieve the goal of a new treaty."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Monday, September 27, 2010",WORLD'S POOR ARE OVERLOOKED VICTIMS OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS,Jonathan Sibun,,"It's a list brimming with challenges, short and long-term. But it's not just a business list. It's also a rundown of the biggest challenges facing Oxfam, as disclosed in the charity's annual report this month.
To many people, charity and business and the challenges facing the two are divorced. Not so, says Dame Barbara Stocking, Oxfam's chief executive.
""It's all interconnected,"" she says. ""Some 50m people have been driven into poverty globally because of the financial crisis.""
Despite that, Stocking is fresh from unveiling the strongest results in Oxfam's 68-year history, with GBP318m raised from donors and shops in the year to March. And while the charity's work is focused on wiping out famine and poverty in the developing world, it is in developed countries where the solutions to many of those problems will be found.
The effect of the financial crisis on the UK housing market, City banks and business borrowing is well known, but its role in the lives of the poor has largely been overlooked, an oversight that clearly irks the chatty, down-to-earth 59-year-old.
""It's incredibly frustrating. Poor people are closely connected to the trading world because so many of them are producers and traders,"" she says, before variously describing the effect on food prices of climate change, eating habits and commodity speculation.
""We're certainly worried about speculation,"" Stocking says, in the wake of huge rises in the price of grain, cotton and other commodities. ""There need to be controls, but how on earth do you do that? For poor people it's not just the price, but the fluctuation that affects them. It's frightening.""
Following a week when Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, has lambasted bankers as ""spivs and gamblers"", will Stocking also be taking up the bank-bashing? ""We're not chucking stones. We haven't been going after the capitalist system nor bankers in any major way, partly because in order to engage in that whole regulation question you have to be very thorough and Oxfam is very careful that it doesn't speak about what it doesn't know. That said, we are concerned about how the system works.""
With that in mind, Oxfam has been one of the leading backers of a Robin Hood tax - a levy on transactions by financial institutions, the proceeds of which would be used to combat climate change and poverty.
The idea, first proposed by Gordon Brown, appears to have been given relatively short shrift by the Tories, although the Liberal Democrats, and perhaps more tellingly France and Spain, back the proposal.
Recognising that any tax move would have to be unilateral, Stocking says: ""Obama has said there has to be a system for bailing out the banks without the taxpayer simply paying. Clearly we'd agree with that, but we'd go further into ways to get money to fight climate change and poverty, given how what the banks do in those areas has affected poor people so badly.""
But is Oxfam campaigning on this in vain? There's a lot of scepticism about whether a Robin Hood tax will ever come about.
""Give it time, give it time,"" the mother of two says with a smile.
""Given the debate is raging in so many countries, it suggests there is a real chance of pushing something like this through. There is this idea of people getting very rich from speculation while causing problems elsewhere in the world - there should be some payback for that.""
Oxfam has been involved in catastrophes from the Haiti earthquake, to the conflict in Sri Lanka and flooding in Pakistan in recent times, helping 17m people in 62 countries last year alone, so Stocking has seen the effects of climate change up close.
The former NHS executive admits that against that backdrop, the lack of political progress on the issue is ""a big disappointment"".
""It's not going to go away - there's no choice here. As every year goes by, it gets more worrying,"" she says. ""I have to be careful what I say here, but this year, in terms of humanitarian crises, is absolutely dramatic. I mustn't and I won't claim that any of those are directly climate change. All I know is that the volumes of things we're expected to do are increasing dramatically and research shows that the number of extreme weather events has doubled since the 1990s.""
The Oxfam chief is launching a campaign in April based on ""food justice in a resource-constrained world"", and she expects business to get behind her.
""It's clear that the private sector is realistic about climate change and knows there will have to be big changes ahead. But what companies want is the parameters - so, is it about a cap in trade, is it about carbon taxing? They want to know what to do.""
All of that campaigning will take funding. But Stocking says that is one of the positives of the UK recession.
""The British people continue to be extremely generous. Last year our regular givers increased the amount they gave. And it's not a trivial number, it's 450,000 supporters,"" she says. ""Even in the big crises, people will say to me, 'where does the money come from?' I'll say about half of it comes from the British public and they're absolutely staggered. They're staggered that people care.""
The other 50pc comes from governments, agencies and other institutions, a funding source Stocking is more concerned about.
""We are worried about institutions cutting back - the other governments - but it just means we have to go out and try harder. Very early on we thought about how we could make sure the money held up, how we could diversify. I'm doing a lot of travelling to the Gulf now to get money in.""
The organisation - named after its base in Oxford - had tightened its belt ahead of the downturn in a bid to maintain its output, she says.
""We were already planning for it before Lehman Brothers went down. [In the shops] what we knew from history was that people buy from us in a recession but don't give to us,"" Stocking says, detailing the innovations her commercial team came up with to battle those trends, whether a clothes exchange at Marks & Spencer or a collection bin at J Sainsbury.
""But also we pruned early on - in a recession especially, donors want to know that as much money as possible is going out to poor countries - and administrative costs fell 16pc last year. We laid off 70 posts in Oxfam House. And we closed programmes in some countries.""
Balancing those commercial realities with keeping staff motivated at Oxfam is, Stocking admits, a fine balance.
""We have to do things as professionally as we can as far as the money is concerned, but on the other hand it is a very different organisation to manage. It's an organisation where people are there because they believe in the cause. So if there is any sign as a leader that you don't believe in the cause, you're done for.""
With Oxfam and its big three challenges, that would seem to be the least of Stocking's problems."

"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Monday, November 29, 2010",'LAST CHANCE' IN THE SNAKEPIT,Geoffrey Lean,,"For this Mexican resort has an unrivalled record in consigning such talks to the compost heap of history. In 1981 it was here, at one of Ronald Reagan's first summits, that global negotiations on tackling world poverty went off the rails, even if it was the intransigence of developing countries rather than the old ham himself that was to blame. Beside these same azure seas 20 years later, the current round of world trade talks went awry and have yet to recover.
A sense of foreboding is one of the few points of general agreement among the 15,000 participants congregating for the next two weeks on this long thin strip of land, marooned between a wide lagoon and the Caribbean Sea. Jairem Ramesh, the Indian environment minister, sees it as the ""last chance"" for climate change talks to succeed; Connie Hedegaard, the EU's climate chief, believes a disappointing outcome would ""put the whole process in danger""; and American and Canadian politicians are thinking of moving negotiations to other, more selective, meeting places. No wonder Chris Huhne, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, says that Britain's main goal over the next two weeks will be ""keeping the show on the road"".
In truth, this resort is fittingly named to host the giant climate conferences that take place at the end of each year. They do indeed resemble snakepits - the mutual hissing of competing camps laced with a fair amount of poison. Last year's in Copenhagen was the worst of them all: in addition to the snakes, there was a liberal sprinkling of tarantulas and serpent-headed Gorgons that turn living things to stone. So high were the expectations for that summit in the Danish capital that its failure and the disappointments it engendered have petrified the process.
Twelve months ago, world leaders turned up expecting a triumph, only to have to scramble to prevent complete breakdown. It was a traumatic experience - so much so that dealing with global warming has slumped sharply and alarmingly down the international agenda.
Public support - long arrogantly taken for granted by environmental activists - has also eroded on both sides of the Atlantic. The hacked emails from the University of East Anglia may have had something to do with it, though - despite all the hype from climatesceptics - they did nothing to dent the science that underpins global warming. Nor, for that matter, did the occasional, inexcusable, errors over the predicted effects of climate change unearthed soon afterwards from the 3,000-page report produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Further damage was inflicted by the blustering and bombastic responses from the panel's chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, who still clings obstinately to office despite a broad hint from the official investigation into the affair that he should go. But the main cuplrit, according to opinion polls, was the cold winter in Britain and much of North America: that did more than any of the ""climategate"" furores to sow doubt in the public mind that the world was heating up.
This is why some sceptics - who rightly denounce anyone who claims that a temporary heatwave is a confirmation of global warming - will doubtless soon be claiming that the present cold snap denies it, however inconsistent and opportunistic such an assertion would be. As it happens, there was unusual warmth last winter in places ranging from Alaska to North Africa, East Asia to much of continental Europe. Worldwide, 2010 is set to be either the warmest or second warmest year on record.
Individual hot or cold spells prove nothing. What counts is the overall temperature trend over many years and, though this appears to have increased more slowly over the past decade, it remains remorselessly upwards. Indeed, a Met Office report published last week concluded that, even as public and political resolve to tackle global warming has waned since Copenhagen, the evidence that humanity is heating up the planet has become ""even stronger"".
Earlier this month, Karl Rove, the American political strategist, exulted that ""climate is gone"", meaning that it was no longer the potent issue it once was. Most scientists might agree with his comment - but not in the way Rove meant it. What they fear is that the benign conditions under which humanity has grown and prospered over the past 11,000 years are rapidly disappearing. Already, the people at the sharp end - principally the Third World rural poor who depend intimately on nature - are struggling to cope with the shifting seasons. An Oxfam report, published today, concludes that 21,000 people died as a consequence of weather-related disasters such as floods and droughts in the first nine months of this year.
Far worse is to come, scientists believe. The Royal Society is publishing a set of papers today that paint a bleak picture of a world that has warmed by an average four degrees centigrade - double what most scientists agree would trigger disastrous effects. The reports conclude that, if policies do not change, then this grim future will be upon us far faster then we realise - by the 2070s, within the lifetimes of our children.
Yet this is not inevitable. It can still be stopped. If progress is made at Cancun, the rise in global temperature could be kept to beneath the critical two-degree threshold. As the United Nations Environment Programme has recently pointed out, the Copenhagen summit may have failed to live up to expectations, but it did stimulate some 80 countries, those jointly responsible for 80 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, to announce targets for bringing them under control.
Taken together, these could get the world nearly two thirds of the way to limiting global warming to just two degrees. The gap could then be filled by additional measures, such as reducing the enormous subsidies pumped into fossil fuels, cutting emissions from shipping and aircraft, which are uncontrolled, and addressing other causes of climate change, such as the black carbon puffed out by diesel engines and Third World cooking stoves, and HFCs, widely used as ozone-friendly refrigerants.
But there is a catch. Many countries are pledged only to achieve their most ambitious targets if other nations do the same. Ever since Copenhagen, they have been playing a game of climatic ""after you, Claude'', waiting for others to go first. Above all, they have been waiting for the United States, and they are likely to do so for a long time yet. The big Republican gains in the mid-term elections have put paid to the already slim prospects of US climate legislation for the foreseeable future.
That is one reason why no one expects a breakthrough at Cancun. Another is a long legacy of mistrust between rich and poor countries, aggravated by last year's carry-on at Copenhagen. With that in mind, the conference's Mexican hosts, who are much more competent than the dire Danes whose appalling leadership contributed to the failure 12 months ago, are lowering their sights. They are concentrating on trying to achieve accord on subsidiary issues, such as an agreement to reward countries for not felling their forests and setting up a big fund to help poor nations cope with the effects of global warming. In this way they hope to build trust and lay the foundations of an eventual agreement.
But, while breakthough is highly unlikely, a breakdown remains very much on the cards. Some old hands here - such as Yvo de Boer, the UN's chief negotiator at Copenhagen - can glimpse similar tell-tale clouds gathering over the sea. If they are right and the storm breaks, this may well turn out to be the last set of serious UN climate negotiations for many years. The snakepit will have claimed another victim.

"Telegraph (London, UK)","Wednesday, October 13, 2010",BBC TOLD TO ENSURE BALANCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE,Neil Midgley,,"The BBC has been accused of bias repeatedly in its reporting of climate change issues. Last year, one of its journalists, Paul Hudson, was criticised for not reporting on some of the controversial ""Climategate"" leaked emails from the University of East Anglia, even though he had been in possession of them for some time.
Climate change sceptics have also accused the BBC of not adequately reporting the discrediting of a study from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which said that glaciers would melt by 2035.
The BBC's editorial guidelines, published yesterday after a consultation that considered more than 1,600 submissions from the public, expressly say for the first time that scientific issues fall within the corporation's obligation to be impartial.
""The BBC must be inclusive, consider the broad perspective, and ensure that the existence of a range of views is appropriately reflected,"" said Alison Hastings, a BBC trustee. ""The new guideline extends the definition of 'controversial' subjects beyond those of public policy and political or industrial controversy to include controversy within religion, science, finance, culture, ethics and other matters.""
James Delingpole, a prominent climate change sceptic and Telegraph columnist, said yesterday: ""It's highly unlikely that they'll be more balanced in their coverage.
""It's a whole cultural thing at the BBC -- that people who don't believe are just 'flat earthers',"" he claimed. ""Whenever they invite dissenters like me on to debates, they surround us with 'warmists'. On Any Questions, for example, Jonathan Dimbleby does his best to be impartial, but this is a man with a wind turbine in his garden.""
In 2007, a BBC Trust report called Safeguarding Impartiality in the 21st Century said: ""Climate change is another subject where dissenters can be unpopular ... the BBC has held a high-level seminar with some of the best scientific experts, and has come to the view that the weight of evidence no longer justifies equal space being given to the opponents of the consensus. ""But these dissenters (or even sceptics) will still be heard, as they should, because it is not the BBC's role to close down this debate.""
The BBC Trust is currently conducting a separate review, led by Prof Steve Jones from University College London, into impartiality in the corporation's science coverage. He will report next spring.
Another new guideline, on religious coverage, stipulates that ""content dealing with matters of religion and likely to cause offence to those with religious views and beliefs must be editorially justified"".
Terry Sanderson, the president of the National Secular Society, said this would put ""severe restrictions on comedians, documentary makers, satirists and commentators who want to be critical of religion.
Almost anything that isn't wholly reverential towards religious beliefs can be perceived as offensive by some believers.""
A spokesman for the BBC Trust said: ""Editorial decisions about who to feature on BBC output are a matter for the BBC Executive. However, the new editorial guidelines make clear that the requirements for due impartiality do not necessarily require equal time to be given to the range of opinions on a given subject."""
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, March 24, 2010",CLIMATEÊCHANGE 'WILL SEE BANANA PLANTS TAKE OVER LAWNS',Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"The trust said temperature rise could result in gardens more like those in Portugal with date palms, olive trees and even banana plants by the end of the century.
Water shortages will mean the end of immaculately mown lawns, while flooding and extreme weather could kill ancient trees.
The Met Office has warned that if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, global temperatures could rise by 2C (3.6F), making southern England'sÊclimateÊsimilar to south-west France, while a 4C (7.2F) rise could expose gardens to conditions more like south-west Portugal.
Paintings commissioned by the National Trust show what the temperature rise would do to a typical British garden. Even a 2C rise could see lawns drying out and moisture-loving perennials like delphiniums being replaced by hardy Mediterranean plants like rock rose, while wetter winters could threaten spring bulbs such as tulips and hyacinths.
If the temperature goes up by 4C or more, the picture shows gravel replacing the lawn surrounded by citrus plants, passion flowers and cacti. Orchards would be replaced by nectarines, oranges and banana plants. On the nearby parkland, goats graze the pasture rather than cattle and cork or olive trees are seen instead of species such as beech or chestnut.
Mike Calnan, of the National Trust, said people were aware of the impact ofÊclimateÊchange on polar bears and ice caps but not on their gardens.
He said: ""The illustrations really help set out what the future might look like for a garden in southern England by the end of the century, if not before, if we do not tackle the carbon emissions issue.""
The paintings will be shown at National Trust gardens this summer. The touring exhibition, A Flower in Time, will display paper flowers made by Joe Swift, the presenter of Gardeners' World, and Alan Titchmarsh, the TV presenter and gardener, to publicise the risk ofÊclimateÊchange.
The National Trust is undertaking an inventory of plants at 80 of its gardens to see which ones are most under threat fromÊ  and propagating species which will survive better.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, May 1, 2010",COULD AÊCLIMATEÊDEAL FALL VICTIM TO THIS OIL SLICK?,Geoffrey Lean,,"Surely an economic and ecological disaster, caused by exploiting the fossil fuels that emit all that carbon dioxide, should make the world keener to tackle global warming by moving to cleaner sources of energy? But that would be in a rational universe - one where agreement did not depend on two increasingly dysfunctional institutions: the UNÊclimateÊtreaty negotiations and the US Congress.
In the real world, there is no possibility of a new treaty unless Congress first passes legislation to reduce emissions from the United States. And, until the oil started gushing from the well beneath BP's Deepwater Horizon rig, the best chance of getting this through was for Capitol Hill, and the whole of the United States, to stop worrying about slicks and learn to love offshore oil drilling.
The story starts 41 years ago, with a blowout at an oil platform some six miles offshore from Santa Barbara, California. Over 11 days, 200,000 gallons of crude oil bubbled to the surface, killing birds and dolphins, and polluting some 35 miles of coastline. It was by no means the worst oil spill, but it was possibly the most important one, because it helped kickstart the US environmental movement, which then rapidly spread worldwide.
Richard Nixon, just days into his first presidential term, said that the spill had touched his conscience (which must have taken some doing), though the president of Union Oil, which operated the platform, objected: ""I am amazed at the publicity for the loss of a few birds.""
The result was that oil drilling became unacceptable off the West Coast. Twenty years later the prohibition extended nationwide, after the much more serious spill from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska. The taboo started to dissolve as oil prices rose, and vanished when they peaked before the financial collapse. ""Drill, baby, drill"" became Sarah Palin's war cry, while Republican commentators opined that offshore oil was ""extraordinarily safe and environmentally friendly"" because none had been spilled during Hurricane Katrina.
Barack Obama also took up the new article of faith, promising in his election campaign to restart the drilling. And just a month ago he opened up vast areas off the East Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico to oil companies (the Santa Barbara effect still lingers in the West).
This was a trade-off to try to get Republican and conservative Democrat senators to back a newÊclimateÊbill.
So far it hasn't worked: indeed the bill is already in trouble because one of its sponsors, the Republican Lindsay Graham, withdrew after the Senate leadership scheduled immigration legislation ahead of it. But now it faces a new danger: that previously supportive Democrats from coastal states rebel. One, Robert Menendez from New Jersey, says: ""I have let the administration know that if they do not protect New Jersey from the effects of coastal drilling in theÊclimate-change bill, then my vote is in question.""
By chance - even as the black tide approached Louisiana this week - the Obama administration approved another controversial energy development off a sensitive shore - a giant windfarm in Nantucket Sound, off Massachusetts. Environmentalists have fought the plans, the first US offshore wind project, for a decade, but the disaster in the Gulf may boost its chances. It's an ill wind, as they say, but theÊclimateÊtreaty may well be blown away, none the less."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Wednesday, December 8, 2010","BROWN DOOMED CLIMATE TALKS BY TRYING TO FORCE DEAL, SAYS PRESCOTT",Louise Gray Environment Correspondent in Cancun,,"The former deputy prime minister said the world needed more time to agree on a global deal to cut emissions and Mr Brown made a ""wrong judgment"" trying to push for a legally binding deal last year.
""His attempt to get Europe to go from 20 to 30 per cent [in emissions cuts by 2020], to get $100 billion from the Americans [for climate aid] on the basis he could force the Chinese into a legal agreement -- there was no chance of doing that, especially in four days. That was why everybody was shouting at each other,"" Lord Prescott said. ""I said to Gordon Brown, 'you cannot bloody get it. You are putting yourself on the line'.""
A single legally binding deal failed to materialise in Copenhagen, and only a weak voluntary accord in which countries offered to curb emissions was achieved.
Speaking in his role as special envoy on climate change for the European Council, Lord Prescott said the latest round of talks in Cancun, Mexico, were also likely to be unsuccessful.
He said the world should be working towards a voluntary agreement, including money to help poor countries adapt and carbon targets, until all nations were ready to sign up to a treaty.
More than 190 countries are gathered in Cancun to discuss issues on the best way to stop global warming.
Chris Huhne, the Climate Change Secretary, said that a successful outcome was going to depend on countries compromising.
Conference's carbon footprint equal to 4,500 homes for a year
The Cancun Climate Conference is using as much energy as a village in England for a whole year.
More than 190 countries are meeting in the resort for two weeks to discuss the best way to bring down global carbon emissions.
The total carbon footprint of the conference, according to the Mexican government, is 25,000 tons -- equivalent to 4,500 British households for a year. The carbon footprint of the conference is five times as much as the last meeting in Copenhagen, even though fewer people are attending the conference.
There are about 15,000 delegates this year compared with about 45,000 people from governments, media and nongovernmental organisations who attended the Copenhagen conference."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Thursday, April 15, 2010",CLIMATE SCIENTISTS WERE NAIVE BUT DIDN'T FIX FIGURES,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"The University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit triggered an international row over climate change science after a series of emails between its scientists emerged, which appeared to cast doubt on their objectivity.
In one of the emails, which were posted online, Prof Phil Jones, the head of the unit at the time, mentioned how he used a ""trick"" to ""hide"" data which did not appear to conform to global warming theory.
In another, one of the scientists at the unit disclosed his opposition to agreeing to Freedom of Information requests about their climate change data, arguing that discussions with colleagues were ""private"".
Climate sceptics leapt on the emails as evidence that the scientists were pursuing an agenda to prove that global warming was happening.
An independent inquiry into the row yesterday concluded that there was no evidence of any ""deliberate scientific malpractice"" at the unit. But it criticised the experts for being ""disorganised"" and ""naive"".
Lord Oxburgh, an academic and the former head of Shell who conducted the inquiry, reviewed 20 years of research. He said: ""Whatever was said in the emails, the basic science seems to have been done honestly and fairly.""
Speaking of the scientists at the unit, he said: ""We found a small group of dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers who were ill-prepared for being the focus of public attention.""
The email row cast a shadow over the United Nations' meeting in Copenhagen to try to agree a deal to stop global warming. The controversy spread when it emerged that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had allowed into its report unsubstantiated claims that the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035.
The latest inquiry into the behaviour of CRU scientists found that there was ""absolutely no evidence of any impropriety whatsoever"".
Prof David Hand, a member of the review panel, said the scientists ""did not use the most advanced statistical tools"" but they had brought to light the uncertainties over the extent of global warming.
The panel said any exaggeration of the extent of global warming was made by other organisations - including the IPCC, public bodies and governments - which took the data produced by academics but failed to inform the public about the uncertainties.
Supporters of the researchers said the inquiry upheld the science behind global warming. Edward Acton, the vice-chancellor of UEA, said the report was a relief to the individuals involved and that the university's integrity remained ""firmly intact""."
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Tuesday, October 5, 2010",EUROPE UNVEILS ACTION PLANS,John Prosser,,"The EU countries are global leaders in the development and application of renewable energy, vital for both reducing the EU's dependence on external energy imports, and in meeting targets to combat adverse global climate change. While Germany and the United Kingdom may currently be the only members of the EU on track to achieve the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, the recent delivery by the majority of the EU nations of their renewable energy action plans, under the Renewable Energy Directive, is at least another step in the right direction.
The directive required each European member state to provide a national renewable energy action plan by 30 June 2010. Only two plans had arrived on the European Commission's desk by noon on deadline day, though most of the 27 members have now submitted their plans. So far, all the documents published highlight plans for significant increases in renewable energy capacity, primarily but not exclusively built around the rapid expansion of onshore and offshore wind farms.
Germany is forecast to increase its onshore wind capacity by 30 per cent over the next decade, while onshore wind capacity will grow by 130 per cent in Ireland, 230 per cent in Italy and 74 per cent in Spain. Offshore wind capacity is expected to grow from close to zero to around 10,OOOMW for Germany, 2,300MW for Ireland, 1,OOOMW for Italy and 3,OOOMW for Spain. Solar power is also expected to rise almost 3,000 per cent in Spain and a massive 500 per cent in Italy with Eastern European states such as Poland and Bulgaria reported to be planning a significant increase in biomass.
The European Renewable Energy Council (EREC) has welcomed the plans, saying that the 20 per cent target was technically feasible and would provide a significant boost to the European economy in terms of revenue and job creation. ""EREC is convinced that member states recognise the benefits of ambitious renewables policies, enabling a fast-growing industry to make the necessary investments to maintain the EU's global leadership and create new jobs,"" said
EREC policy advisor Lucie Tesniere. ""EREC firmly believes that the EU 27 can reach at least 20 per cent by 2020 - domestic action will bring domestic benefits for European companies, citizens and society at large."" The UK's Coalition Government has published its submission to the European Commission setting out how the UK plans to meet its 15 per cent renewable energy target.
But while it says it is confident it can meet its target for 2020 with a threepoint framework of action, it admits it has to ""radically increase"" its use of renewable energy as it describes climate change as ""one of the gravest threats we face"". The 'lead scenario' set out in the UK plan indicates that it is possible to achieve the 15 per cent target and provides one technological combination for 2020.
But this scenario does not represent a target for any particular sector or technology and is not seen as an upper limit to the UK's ambition for renewables deployment. The action plan re-affirmed the UK's current position with renewable energy, saying, ""the UK has been blessed with a wealth of energy resources. Until now we have relied on the use of our coal, oil and gas supplies to supply our homes; support our businesses; and power our transport. As we look forward, we need to ensure that we also make the most of our renewable resources to provide a secure basis for the UK's future energy needs.
"" The report says that the total renewable capacity of the UK will be 38.21GW, made up of the clean technology applications and highlights three key areas as the basis for UK renewables policy: _ financial support for renewables _ unblocking barriers to delivery _ developing emerging technologies The report adds: ""Offshore wind is a key area for development. We will work to develop an offshore electricity grid to support our continuing commitment to being world leaders in this technology. This credit: JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images new generation of offshore wind power will play a key role in meeting our 2020 target."" The report also includes plans for a Green Investment Bank, an extended feed-in tariff scheme for renewable electricity, and reforms to the planning system. But Gaynor Hartnell, CEO of the Renewable Energy
Association, highlighted a number of questions, saying: ""There are still many questions hanging hi the air - can new power projects move ahead in confidence that their revenue streams won't be undermined by a move to feed in tariffs? Can businesses start planning for the introduction of a renewable heat policy next April? Will new homes have to be zero carbon by 2016? The industry needs to know, and soon."" And there are economic, political and administrative constraints.
Adam Brown, senior energy analyst at the International Energy Agency, says the world is spending just half of the money necessary to meet climate goals. Global investments to achieve the climate goal should be $239 billion per annum to 2030. But current spending is around $110 billion. Dow Coming's Eric Peeters argues that a major obstacle to the development of photovoltaic power lies hi administrative barriers with the acquisition of permits causing delay in certain areas. Nevertheless, in spite of the questions, there is evidence of optimism that real progress can now be made. This, at least, is a breath of fresh air.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, October 23, 2010",HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY BEFORE THE BIGGER FUEL BILLS START TO BITE,Charles Moore,,"In the past few days, I have spoken to several people from America and Australia who are studying it with forensic interest. In France, where the modest suggestion that people should retire at 62 rather than 60 seems to have caused national paralysis, those who worry about deficits look enviously at our apparent readiness to take our medicine.
What these observers admire is not so much the precise policy as the honesty. In their own countries, they feel starved of leaders who will truthfully set out the problem. In the United States, much of the inchoate rage in the mid-term elections is to do with the sense that neither political party will confront the dire state of the national finances.
To reach this condition of truth-telling, the Conservatives have had to move fast. Only a little more than two years ago, they were endorsing Gordon Brown's figures and speaking of ""sharing the proceeds of growth"". But ""the truth"", as we are taught, ""shall set you free"". By eventually accepting it, the Tories had the strength to convert their Liberal Democrat partners. This is another thing that impresses the outside world: two out of the three parties in the state are making the cuts. It would not make a great political slogan to say, ""Almost two thirds of us are in this together"", but, in peacetime politics, that is about as good as it gets.
I should like to suggest that there is another, ahem, ""inconvenient truth"" which the Government must confront.
Again, because of its earlier political positioning and the Coalition demands, it will not want to do so, but it will do well when it does.
In the carnage of the cuts, the Department of Energy andÊClimateÊChange does not feature prominently. True, the Severn barrage plan, a massive potential environmental disaster, was stopped. True, too - see the reduction of future payment levels to renewable energy in households through the Feed-In Tariff - that green largesse will not be quite what it was. But essentially, like a wind turbine on a still day, the Government's energy policy is lying idle. Soon will come the storm.
It will come because of cost. Thanks to Gordon Brown's profligacy, the public is about to have to pay more tax for fewer services. But the cost of green policies does not feature much in the latest debates, because most of it comes not through taxes, but through electricity bills. It is programmed to rise. This year, the total levy adds GBP6 billion to our household and business bills. In 2015, it will be GBP10 billion; in 2020, GBP16 billion (which equals 4 pence on the basic rate of income tax today).
For the Government, and the generators, this is a beautiful way of doing things, because they get their money effortlessly. So it is ugly for you and me. We pay for the renewable obligation subsidies, we fund the Feed-in Tariff. We pay more and more for sources of energy which will not reward us with cost reductions for at least a generation. For years, governments have gone on about the wickedness of ""fuel poverty"". Today, 4.6 million households are officially defined as living in it. The prevailing policies make it inevitable that fuel poverty will rise for as far as the eye can see. By 2020, our energy prices will be between 30 and 40 per cent higher than they would have been without them.
At least two things result. One is that prosperity is impaired. Cheap energy is the prerequisite of industrial success. The figures for carbon production in the West are now mildly declining, but that is not true of our carbon consumption. All that is happening is that we are, in effect, exporting the production to China, proving, by doing so, that being green and clean does not pay. Global carbon production grows. The only important country where both the production and consumption of carbon slumped was Russia. That was because, in the 1990s, it suffered economic collapse. Economic collapse is, indeed, the answer to too much carbon, but in the same way that bubonic plague is the answer to the common cold.
The other result is that people get angry. They have been conscripted by their governments into an unwinnable war without end. The bills will rise, but the emissions will not fall. The country will not get cleaner, but its people will get poorer. There will come a point - provoked by power cuts, or by the bill for a cold winter - when we will be utterly sick of being ordered to save the planet, and we shall mutiny.
Politicians who want to stay in office should realise this, and take evasive action. Hard times provide the moment. In Spain the other day, the government realised that it was spending so much on price guarantees to solar power ""entrepreneurs"" that it decided to cut back. The same will have to happen with wind power here. It would be so much better, and cheaper, if it came before turbines have stalked their way across every lonely and lovely place in these islands.
The obvious objection to what I am saying is that we must save the planet. Of course we must, if it needs saving. But the great rows about the emails at the Climatic Research Unit, the evidence used by the working group of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange and so on, have forced a retreat from the favourite claim that ""the science is settled"". The Royal Society has long been alarmist aboutÊclimateÊchange, but its latest publication,ÊClimateÊChange: A Summary of the Science, produced because of criticism about bias, is careful. It sets out areas where there is ""wide agreement"", areas of ""continuing debate and discussion"" and ""aspects that are not understood very well"". Although the authors clearly believe thatÊclimateÊchange is real and risky, and is aggravated by human activity, they also emphasise uncertainties - about cause, effect, timing, modelling and the accuracy of data. In my admittedly untutored reading, it looks as if, by the Society's own account, only about a third of the science is settled.
It seems a small proportion on which to erect the next halfcentury of policy, nearly GBP1trillion of costs and the claim that the end of the world is nigh. In this country and the whole of the West, a strange thing has happened. A fascinating scientific theory about a controversial subject has been falsely magicked by its supporters into a hard fact. I know this Government dislikes spending money on logos, but the next time ""The Department of Energy andÊClimateÊChange"" orders new stationery, it should delete those last three contentious words which Gordon Brown added to the masthead."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, August 24, 2010",'USEFUL IDIOTS' OF THEÊCLIMATEÊBATTLE,Alan Cochrane Commentary,,"Supporting a malign cause in the mistaken belief that it is a force for good when common sense should suggest the opposite is a common feature of the deluded in our midst and nowhere is this better demonstrated than when the words ""climateÊchange"" are mentioned. Simply uttering them apparently justifies any action, no matter how daft or how violent.
Yesterday saw some nutters - although they prefer the term ""activists"" - superglue themselves to the car park at Royal Bank of Scotland offices, whilst others climbed onto the roof of Forth Energy's HQ, and two chained themselves to the front of the building. Windows had been previously smashed at RBS's head office at Gogarburn, which has seen aÊClimateÊCamp - so-called - installed outside for several days now.
An ""oil slick"", using molasses, was created outside Cairn Energy's office in Lothian Road and similar, but much more dangerous, slicks were also poured onto the main A720 and A8 roads. And a Clydesdale Bank branch was spray-painted.
Whilst superglue was also used to stick protesters together on a bridge over the A8, at the Port of Leith and at other RBS premises near the Gyle Shopping Centre, the mystery to me was why the police bothered to remove them. The nights are fair drawing in and I'm sure our committed friends would have been happy to stick it out as the winds of autumn arrive.
What all of this is about is the claim that each of the companies targeted is involved in investing directly or in bankrolling, through loans, what one Sunday newspaper called ""dirty oil.""
The oil they were talking about, however, is the same oil that we all use in our cars and, presumably, the same oil that is used to deliver that newspaper.
And the particular sin in the case of RBS is that it is lending money to household names like BP, Shell and the like, when it is 84 per cent owned by the taxpayer. It doesn't appear to matter that it is only by making successful investments that RBS will ever be able to redeem the damage done by ""Fred the Shred"" and pay back the taxpayer.
No mention is made by the protesters of the thousands of people employed around the world by these companies as a result of these loans or of the pension funds of millions of people that benefit from any profits made.
Instead, we've been treated to a quite hilarious account by one of the principal ""useful idiots"" of life in theÊClimateÊCamp, complete with a detailed account of how well ordered everything is by these ""earnest, clean-shaven and fresh-faced twentysomethings,"" including lots of stuff you didn't need to know about their sanitary arrangements.
In their arrogant desire to justify anything and everything connected with this sort of protest, these apologists for illegality ignore the fact that it is taxpayerfunded policemen who are caught in the middle, trying to allow peaceful demonstrations but vilified if they act against law-breakers.
The greater the current economic downturn, the less we hear aboutÊclimateÊchange or other so-called ""green"" concerns; it was ever thus, which is why this lot have to resort to a high-profile attack that's concentrated in the main against an outfit like RBS, which is not the UK's most popular concern at the moment.
By their activities in the recent past, banks such as RBS have not exactly been innocent in helping to deepen this country's economic gloom but they and concerns like Forth Energy, Cairn Energy, Clydesdale Bank and others being targeted in Edinburgh are engaged in decent, lawful and worthwhile activities. They are doing nothing of which they should be ashamed.
It is those who, through idiotic public backing of people who perpetrate criminal damage in pursuit of dubious objectives, who have most cause to hang their heads in shame."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, October 16, 2010","GOODBYE, CFCS. HELLO, HFCS",Geoffrey Lean,,"The cholorofluorocarbons, to give them their full name, are long gone from our lives. They have been banned from industrialised countries by international treaty since the mid-1990s, and developing countries have followed suit. But because they are particularly long-lived substances, they have stuck around at dangerous levels in the atmosphere, continuing to do their worst.
Now, finally, they have begun to decline. The world's most authoritative survey - the fouryearly Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion, compiled by 300 senior scientists - reported this autumn that levels of CFC 12, one of the most common types, have fallen for the first time. Partly as a result, the report confirms, the ozone layer over most of the earth will be back to normal by the middle of the century (the exception, for complicated reasons, is the hole that opens up over Antarctica each southern spring, which will take a lot longer to mend).
This is good news not just for human health, but for the battle against global warming, and offers a way forward despite the stalled internationalÊclimateÊnegotiations.
Ozone - a blue-tinged and pungent form of oxygen - forms a fragile shield, strangely insubstantial but remarkably effective. Scattered so thinly through the 21-mile deep stratosphere that if it were all gathered together it would form a girdle around the earth no thicker than the sole of a shoe, it screens out almost all the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the sun.
No other known planet has anything like it and, if it had not developed here, the earth would probably be inhabited by no more than the most primitive underwater life. Indeed, the little radiation that does get through is the main cause of skin cancer and also induces cataracts.
In the 1970s and 1980s, research showed that CFCs and other ozonedepleting chemicals were beginning to weaken the shield and - led by Ronald Reagan's United States - governments agreed a treaty to get rid of them. The resulting 1987 Montreal Protocol has proved to be the world's most effective environmental agreement, phasing out almost 100 damaging substances.
Without it, reckons Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, the thinning of the ozone layer could have led to ""up to 20 million more cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts, not to speak of damage to human immune systems, wildlife and agriculture"".
But that's not all. As a by-product, the treaty has also proved to be the most effective measure governments have ever taken to combatÊclimateÊchange, since CFCs are also powerful greenhouse gases. Indeed, as the new Scientific Assessment reports, it has been five times as effective in reducing global warming than the Kyoto Protocol, the mainÊclimateÊtreaty, would be even if it were fully implemented. Prof Mario Molina, who won a Nobel Prize for his pioneering research on CFCs, has estimated that it has delayed warming by 12 years and may have kept the world from ""passing the 'tipping point' for abrupt and irreversibleÊ "".
And there lies a threat, and an opportunity. The substances being used to replace CFCs - HCFCs and HFCs - though much better for the ozone layer, also contribute to global warming. The use of HCFCs is accelerating, though they are to be phased out by 2030 - 10 years earlier than originally intended, thanks to an agreement partially brokered by George W Bush. But emissions of HFCs are sky-rocketing, with no end in sight: the new assessment reckons that, if uncontrolled, they could undo all the good done for theÊclimateÊby the banning of CFCs in the first place.
The danger is imminent because China and India are beginning to invest heavily in HFC production, even though safe substitutes are available.
But this also presents an opportunity to make progress while theÊclimateÊnegotiations are becalmed in the wake of last year's disappointing Copenhagen summit. Countries as diverse as the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia, Canada and Mexico now all want to amend the Montreal Protocol to phase out HFCs, too.
Unsurprisingly, India and China are resisting. But getting rid of existing HFCs would buy more time for the essential, if difficult and controversial, task of curbing carbon dioxide emissions - while stopping their rapid growth could prevent disaster.
It's time for them to follow the CFCs into the bin."
"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Saturday, November 20, 2010",LEF'S MAKE CANCUN A STEP FORWARD,Greg Barker,,"With just days to go, few seasoned followers of these talks believe Cancun is the place where the world will agree the comprehensive, legally binding global agreement to tackle climate change we need. Vital though these talks are, we must change the culture of environmentalism from an over-reliance on ""grand summitry"" to supporting the practical day-to-day changes which will actually deliver the goals.
But they'd be wrong to think that this new realism represents a lack of ambition or commitment on behalf of the UK Government Far from it. The UK can't afford for Cancun to be another missed opportunity. A global climate change agreement is still without doubt firmly in the UK's national interest and we need one as soon as possible.
Yes, the UK accounts for only 2 per cent of global emissions, but it's our future prosperity, as well as our energy and environmental security, that will be threatened if international action on climate change is not achieved.
We're not starting from scratch. Last year's talks at Copenhagen may have dashed expectations but there were some positive outcomes. Significantly, more than 100 countries put forward actions as to what they would be doing to limit their emissions, including, crucially, both China and the US.
But our priority now must be to ensure what was achieved there is banked, built on and brought into the mainstream UN process. Cancun is about bringing a global deal closer and making it more likely, ahead of next year's meeting in South Africa. So what do we want to achieve in Cancun 2010?
We want to make progress on a range of issues that are important to developing and developed countries. First, we need to maintain and strengthen the offers to cut emissions made in Copenhagen. But we also have to strengthen verification arrangements. People in Britain should feel confident their efforts are being matched around the world.
Second, we need to do more to deal with the disaster that results from the destruction of the world's forests, a massive contributor to climate change. Few people realise that the destruction of rainforests accounts for more carbon emissions than the whole aviation sector.
Third, we must press on with making the best use of the ""fast start"" funding for climate change action in developing countries which was agreed in Copenhagen, as well as setting out the structures for climate finance and investment beyond 2012.
The recent report from the Advisory Group on Finance to the UN's Secretary-General was significant It concluded that the world can meet the goal set in Copenhagen of mobilising $100 billion a year by 2020 of public and private finance to assist poorer countries achieve sustainability. It won't be easy, but it can be done. This will involve getting private-sector finance flowing, and I want the City of London to be the global capital of the new, fast-growing green-investment sector. That's why we set up the Capital Markets Climate Initiative - to dismantle the barriers to low-carbon growth and facilitate a new wave of green investment in emerging economies.
But even as governments prepare for Cancun, many businesses are getting on with practical co-operation on low-carbon investment, as demonstrated by the report on November 15 from the UK-India Business Leaders Climate Group. The report by this new group - chaired by Sir Stuart Rose and Mr Rajan Bharti Mittal - was the first of its kind where business leaders from a developed and developing country have come together to consider the practical steps necessary to deliver a low-carbon economy.
And while companies the world over aren't multitrillion-pound low-carbon goods and services market - currently growing at 4 per cent a year - they are sending an ever louder and clearer message to governments.
They are calling for governments to join together in providing the long-term certainty and global framework within which they can invest in low-carbon technologies. They want a globally binding climate change agreement. It's in all our interests as a key step to unlocking the ""green growth"" agenda we all need to see.
That's a message that I've heard loud and clear and will be taking with me to Cancun.
So while a binding deal at Cancun isn't on the cards, concrete achievements are possible.
The UK Government won't tire from working inside and outside the negotiating room to make the progress required by the rate of climate change, and by the businesses whose innovation and investment offer the best hope of a sustainable future."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Monday, November 29, 2010",CALL FOR WAR RATIONING TO BEAT GLOBAL WARMING,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"In a series of papers published by The Royal Society, physicists and chemists from scientific institutions including Oxford University and the Met Office said that current plans to tackle global warming were not enough.
Unless emissions are reduced dramatically in the next 10 years, global temperatures are expected to rise by more than 4C (7.2F) by 2060, causing floods, droughts and mass migration.
As experts met in Cancun, Mexico, for the latest round of United Nations talks onÊclimateÊchange, the academics called for tougher measures to cut carbon emissions.
In one paper, Prof Kevin Anderson, the director of the Tyndall Centre forÊClimateÊChange Research, said the only way to reduce global emissions sufficiently, while allowing poorer nations to continue to grow, was to halt economic growth in wealthy countries over the next 20 years. This would mean a drastic change in lifestyles for many people in countries including Britain as they would have to buy less ""carbon intensive"" goods and services such as long-haul flights and cars.
Prof Anderson said it ""would not be easy"" to persuade people to reduce their consumption. He said politicians should consider a rationing system similar to the one introduced during the last ""time of crisis"" in the 1930s and 1940s.
This could mean a limit on electricity so people were forced to turn the heating down, turn off the lights and replace old electrical goods such as refrigerators with more efficient models.
Food that has travelled from abroad may be limited along with goods that require a lot of energy to manufacture.
""The Second World War and the concept of rationing is something we need to seriously consider if we are to address the scale of the problem we face,"" he said.
Prof Anderson said that halting growth in the rich world did not necessarily mean a recession or a poorer lifestyle, it just meant making adjustments in everyday life such as using public transport or wearing a jumper rather than turning on the heating.
""I am not saying we have to go back to living in caves,"" he said. ""Our emissions were a lot less 10 years ago and we got by OK then.""
Prof Anderson admitted people in the developed world may have to accept a level of ""discomfort"" by reducing energy and even a ""loss of liberty"" by travelling less but those changes in lifestyle would prevent worse suffering in the developing world due toÊ  as well as the costs to our own society in the future. ""Whatever the cost is of avoidingÊclimateÊchange - and we might think it is high - it's much lower than the costs of not avoiding dangerousÊclimateÊchange,"" he said.
The last round of talks in Copenhagen last year ended in a weak political accord to keep temperature rise below the dangerous tipping point of 2C (3.6F).
The Cancun meeting will try to make the deal legally binding and agree targets on cutting emissions.

The three-foot-long block was drilled from almost 200ft beneath the surface of the Antarctic in 1989. The ice at this depth was formed hundreds of years ago by falling layers of snow which trapped the air.
The core was brought back to Britain as part of efforts to understand the pastÊclimateÊand how greenhouse gases have affected temperatures. Scientists are able to analyse the air trapped in the ice to find out the temperature at the time and the levels of carbon dioxide present.
The method has enabled scientists to work out that during an ice age, carbon dioxide levels are relatively low, whereas in the warm periods there is more carbon in the atmosphere.
This has prompted concern that the unprecedented growth in carbon since the industrial revolution could lead to catastrophic global warming.
Professor Chris Rapley, the director of the museum, said: ""Ice cores reveal a record ofÊclimateÊand environmental change covering many hundreds of thousands of years. In my experience, the sight and story of the extraction of ice cores, and what they tell us, never fails to enthral.""
The ice core will be displayed in a new gallery dedicated toÊclimateÊchange, which will be opened by the Prince of Wales next month.
The gallery explores how theÊclimateÊhas changed in the past and could change in the future. Other exhibits include stalagmites and sea sediment.
ICE MAGIC
Ice cut from deep below the surface of the Antarctic shows layers of snow that fell hundreds of years ago.
Viewed in cross section, an ice core has a series of layers representing decades of snowfall.
Scientists can count the layers to work out the approximate age of the ice.
Ancient pollen and dust in ice cores can be used to estimate the prevailing wind direction in any given year and find out more about the wider environment.
Darker sediments can show volcanic activity or other geological events that also give a clue to age.
Tiny bubbles of air trapped in the ice hundreds of years ago allow scientists to measure how much oxygen, carbon dioxide and other gases there were in the atmosphere.
Air and water trapped in the snow also show the approximate temperature at the time by measuring isotopes. Scientists can also estimate how much temperature changed by the different gases in the trapped air."

There is also an increased risk of hurricanes and storm surges.
According to the research by Oxford University, this would mean that 260,000 people would be displaced from the islands, onemillion would be at risk of flooding and billions of dollars would be lost every year from the tourism industry alone.
As 194 nations meet in Cancun, Mexico, for the latest round of UN talks on global warming, small island states are demanding tougher action to stopÊclimateÊchange.
Antonio Lima, the vice chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States (Aosis), said whole nations would be washed away by rising seas.
He said the people of Kiribati, Tuvalu, most of the Cook Islands, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives -- which are all just a few metres above sea level now -- could be lost as a race.
""We are going to be the first human species endangered in the 21st century. We are going to be in danger of going extinct,"" he said.
""We do not want to be the forgotten of the 21st century. We do not want to be sacrificed. We want to survive, and to survive we need solidarity from those who can do something about the weather."" As well as cuts in emissions to stop global warming, the small island states are calling for a ""global insurance fund"" to be set up that would help vulnerable nations cope with the effects ofÊclimate change.
Poor nations at risk from rising sea levels would pay an annual premium, but a large chunk of the money would come fromÊclimate-change aid provided by rich nations.
Similar to a normal insurance fund, the money would be invested so there would be hundreds of billions of pounds available for a crisis.
The fund would pay out according to the level of damage incurred.
The insurance would be for nations that are affected by global warming and do not have the capacity to protect themselves.
The countries would have to first take reasonable preventive measures, such as building coastal defences, so that the money was only used for extreme events.
Aosis, which represents more than 40 nations, is calling for the insurance fund to be part of any global deal onÊclimateÊchange.
British officials said it was too early to make an insurance fund part of a global agreement. But they agreed that the UN should order an investigation into the issue."

The main problem was that developing countries wanted an extension of the Kyoto Protocol, that imposed targets on rich nations, while developed countries wanted a new treaty.
Mr Miliband said both could be done at once.
He said Britain and other countries were willing to sign a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, which ends in 2012, as long as poor nations such as China agreed to cut their emissions.
The move is a clear attempt to force the United States and China, the world's two biggest emitters, to sign up to some sort of legally-binding agreement to tackleÊclimateÊchange at a UN meeting in Mexico next year -- even if it means having separate treaties.
Unveiling Beyond Copenhagen, the Government's action plan onÊclimateÊchange, Mr Miliband said: ""We do not want to let a technical argument about whether we have one treaty or two derail the process.

The admission threatened to undermine the basis on which governments justified spending billions of pounds tacklingÊ .
Yesterday's inquiry report said that the 2007 findings on the rate ofÊclimateÊchange and its risks were generally sound, and had ""been a success and served society well"".
But the IPCC's conduct had on occasions ""dented the credibility of the process"". It warned that ""straying into advocacy can only hurt IPCC's credibility"".

I regularly drive a professor of climatology at UCLA, and he says that once in a while the Earth just judders a little during its regular rotation. It's a wobble. It'll right itself next year.""
Hmm. Is he aÊclimateÊchange denier, your prof? ""No, ma'am. He's a believer."" When I got home I search-engineered for ""  Los Angeles"" and plodded from link to link until I stumbled upon an energetically jolly, predominantly pink site called 10:10Global.org.uk. Clearly a campaigning site. I'd vaguely heard of a campaign called 10:10 and knew it was something to do with making organisations cut their carbon emissions. But I'd no idea whose campaign it was except that it was obviously someone bien-pensant and planet-friendly (Blue Peter? Ed Miliband?).
There was a button called ""Mini Movie"", which I pressed, on the assumption that mini is quicker than maxi or regular. It was quick; also disturbing. It's called No Pressure, written by Richard Curtis and begins with a classful of sweet-faced schoolkids being asked by a totally lovely teacher what they are doing to reduce their carbon emissions. The bright-eyed child actors fling up their hands and tell Miss they're cycling to school instead of being driven, using low-energy light bulbs, blah-blah. Totally lovely teacher asks how many are signing up to the 10:10 campaign? And all but two sweethearts fling up their hands. ""No pressure!"" says the teacher, presses a button and blows the non-joiners to pieces. Class screams as prop blood and body parts rain down on them. It is disturbing.
I'm not sure having Richard Curtis doing your ads is a good idea. He's rightly famed for romantic fiction (Bridget Jones's Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill) and I never mind having my withers wrung by (a younger) Hugh Grant in the small hours. But I didn't like this ad a bit. There's a wooden bit of business by Ledley King and Peter Crouch about low-energy floodlights and people coming to Spurs matches, at which David Ginola looks puzzled and says he doesn't care about carbon emissions that much. BANG! Ha ha! Unfortunately, he is so realistically exploded that when his fictionalised foot thuds down, it can't help but call to mind human bombs, Tubes, trains and buses - for those of us who don't go to matches by bike.
Is it the Government that wants me to cut my own carbon emissions by 10 per cent by October 2010? Which government, anyway? It was always global Gordo doing big thinks about planet-saving, but it seems to be all Cameron in the clips on the 10:10 website.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, June 29, 2010",INVENTOR PAINTS THE ANDES TO COMBAT GLOBAL WARMING,Damien McElroy Foreign Affairs Correspondent,,"By painting the mountains, Eduardo Gold hopes to replicate the effect of Andean glaciers, which reflect sunlight and hence heat back through the atmosphere.
The technique is scientifi-cally plausible and, according to some scientists, may be the only method of lowering global temperatures in a crisis. ""A white surface reflects the sun's rays back through the atmosphere and into space. In doing so, it cools the area around it too,"" said the 55-year-old activist. ""In effect it creates a micro-climate, so we can say that the cold generates more cold, just as heat generates more heat.""
It is hoped the project will slow the melting of the glaciers.
Four workmen have been given the task of painting three peaks, starting with Peru's Chalon Sombrero peak, 15,600ft above sea level.
Chalon Sombrero, like many of the Andean peaks, has seen its glacier disappear within living memory.
The painters who have already completed two hectares of a planned 70 have been recruited from Licapa village, which depends on the run-off from the mountain for its water. The project is a low technology remedy for global warming. The workers use an environmentally-friendly mix of lime, industrial egg white and water, which is known to have been used since Peru's colonial times.
The whitewash is slopped out on the slopes from jugs.
If the underlying theory, which is known as solar radiation management, works the glacier should re-emerge in a cooler micro-climate.
The GBP135,000 project is funded by the World Bank after Mr Gold won a competition called ""100 Ideas to Save the Planet"". The World Bank estimated last year that 22 per cent of Peru's glaciers had melted since 1980. There are projections that all the country's glaciers could disappear in the next 20 years.
While novel, the painting scheme is not the only outlandish way of tackling global warming proposed.
Firing mirrors into space to reflect the sun's rays, or feeding cattle garlic to reduce methane emissions have been mooted.
Locals who have witnessed the destruction of the glaciers are strong supporters of Mr Gold's scheme.
""All the peaks here should be painted in this way,"" said Pablo Parco Palomino.
""That way there would be as much water as there was before the glacier disappeared, and that would mean more pasture to support more livestock.""
But Antonio Brack, Peru's environment minister, told the World Bank that its funding would be better spent on other ""projects which would have more impact in mitigatingÊclimateÊchange"".
Mr Gold believes he can get results. ""I'd rather try and fail to find a solution than start working out how we are going to survive without the glaciers, as if the situation was irreversible,"" he said.
Steven Chu, the US energy secretary, has endorsed installation of white roofs to help preventÊclimateÊchange, an idea seen as more logistically feasible than painting mountain peaks."

Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the IPCC, has been accused of compromising his position by also working as an environmental consultant.
The report by the InterAcademy Council, a grouping of the world's most highly regarded science organisations, identified a number of procedural management failings at the IPCC.
It highlighted the role held by Dr Pachauri as needing particular scrutiny. As well as being the head of the IPCC, he is a director of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a consultancy that has advised Indian energy companies and multi-national firms on how to reduce their emissions.
Dr Pachauri, who is serving his second term as unpaid chairman of the IPCC, has faced repeated calls to resign, most notably following the incorrect claim that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. Questions over IPCC policies and management led to the Inter-Academy Council's investigation.
""It was beyond our charge to review the conflict of interest controversies that have been reported in the press,"" said Prof Harold Shapiro, the chairman of the investigating committee. ""But we did note that the lack of a conflict of interest policy was troubling to many of the stakeholders we heard from.
""Operating under the public microscope the way IPCC does requires strong leadership, the continued and enthusiastic participation of distinguished scientists, an ability to adapt, and a commitment to openness if the value of these assessments to society is to be maintained.""
Following criticism that the position of chairman was too powerful, the report also suggested that no chairman should be allowed to serve more than one term. It did not comment on whether Dr Pachauri should be able to serve out his second term.
Dr Benny Peiser, the director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that challenges the mainstream scientific view that global warming is the result of human activity, said Dr Pachauri was now ""damaged goods"".
""The criticism of the management process is quite severe,"" he said. ""It is an indirect call for Dr Pachauri to step down.""
Dr Pachauri has stood up in the past against what he has called ""ideologically driven"" attacks on the IPCC, and insisted that he has always made clear to the panel that he has another role as a director of TERI. He said: ""The IPCC will be strengthened by the IAC review and by others of its kind this year. We already have the highest confi-dence in the science behind our assessments.""
The IAC report also said that the IPCC needed to improve its communications.
One of the world's most prominentÊclimateÊchange sceptics has shifted his stance on the severity of the threat. Bj&#xF8;rn Lomborg, a selfstyled ""sceptical environmentalist"" urged governments to set up a $100billion (GBP64billion) fund to fight the effects of global warming. His new book argues the issue is ""undoubtedly one of the chief concerns facing the world today"".
Editorial Comment: Page 19
The claims Evidence that has been disputed by sceptics
ClimateÊchange sceptics have seized on a number of claims put forward by the IPCC: Glaciers The most serious mistake the IPCC made was asserting that the Himalayan glaciers could disappear by 2035. The claim was traced back to an interview with a scientist published in a leading magazine in 1999, although some think it could have been confusion over a previous figure that gave the date as 2350.
Sea levels in Holland The report said 55 per cent of the Netherlands was vulnerable to flooding because it was situated below sea level. In fact, only 26 per cent of the country is at risk because it is below sea level, although more than half is prone to flooding because of the sea and rivers. The mistake was traced back to information given by the Dutch environment agency. The Amazon The IPCC claimed that up to 40 per cent of the Amazonian forests could be badly affected by global warming. The claim was tracked back to a report by WWF and the IPCC was criticised for using environmental groups as sources. The claim continues to be contested.
In the hot seat A controversial chairman
Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC), is under the spotlight again following the latest criticism of his organisation.
The Indian has been chairman since 2002, renewing his initial six-year term in 2008.
The unpaid, part-time job makes him one of the world's most powerful men.
The former railway engineer was first pushed into the limelight when he was forced to admit that a report by the IPCC in 2007, that made the case for man-made global warming, contained a serious error -- namely that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035.
Dr Pachauri then came under scrutiny because of his other role leading The Energy Research Institute (Teri), a think tank promoting sustainable development.
Questions were raised about ""conflicts of interest"", because of his business links to carbon trading companies. However he was cleared of any financial wrongdoing by an independent review.
The 70 year-old has also hit the headlines for ""steamy novels"" he wrote while travelling the world in his demanding job.
The latest report into the IPCC does not look at individuals.
But it does recommend that the chairman should serve only one sixyear term. It also called for checks on conflicts of interest by board members.
Asked if he would consider resigning if requested to, Dr Pachauri told reporters he would abide by any decision the IPCC made."

He said the Treasury was unlikely to set up new mechanisms to raise such a small amount of money. it was therefore better to raise 10 times as much and use just 10 per cent for the green fund. The rest could be used to cut other taxes such as VAT and income tax, pay off the deficit or even fund schools.
Lord Stern said an extra GBP15billion could be raised in taxes on polluting industry and power from coal, gas and petrol. Although the levies would be directly on factories or power stations, eventually it would come down to the consumers.
Such green taxes would cost each British home GBP600 a year, although it is likely to be unevenly distributed as households with more cars or high energy use would pay more.
""People would see these tax rises through electricity, through cars,"" said Lord Stern. ""This is a story of people paying for the damage they do, this is stopping subsidising pollution.""
Britain is already paying billions of pounds installing wind turbines and other green energy sources, as part of global efforts to cut carbon emissions.
Lord Stern, a former Government adviser who first warned of the costs ofÊclimateÊchange, is attending the talks to advise leaders.
The green fund is a key element of the talks. It is aimed at helping poor countries to adapt to global warming and helping to develop green technologies such as wind turbines and solar panels.
Countries are expected to agree to the principle of the fund and commission further studies into how the money will be raised. A substantial proportion of the money could come from new international taxes on aviation and shipping or on banking transfers. The rest could come from public money contributed by each country.
World leaders have agreed that GBP60million a year should be raised by 2020. Most of the money will go through the green fund, although some may come through other existing mechanisms like the World Bank or from the private sector. Britain has accepted that it will pay its fair share towards the green fund but has not yet decided how the money would be raised.
Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, appealed for world leaders to agree a new deal onÊclimateÊchange, warning that ""nature will not wait while we negotiate"".
He referred to talks that collapsed in Copenhagen last year, saying that the world could not afford to get it wrong again.
The Copenhagen talks ended with the world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, refusing to sign up to legally binding targets to cut greenhouse gases.
""I am deeply concerned that our efforts so far have been insufficient,"" Mr Ban said. ""Nature will not wait while we negotiate. Science warns that the window of opportunity to prevent uncontrolledÊclimateÊchange will soon close."""

A study by the UN Environment Programme indicated that the voluntary pledges by countries to curb emissions drawn up in Copenhagen last year would not be sufficient to keep global temperatures from rising by more than 2C -- widely recognised as a level below which dangerousÊclimateÊchange could mostly be avoided.
The series of papers published today in a special edition of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, looked at the impacts of a 4C rise.
Scientists from the University of Exeter and the Met Office warned that if high levels of emissions continued that level could be reached by the 2060s.
Authors of other papers said land areas warmed more than the oceans, so an overall increase of 4C could lead to higher temperature rises in certain parts of the world, including the northern forests and the Arctic. A series of ""thresholds"" could be crossed, including the permanent absence of summer ice in the Arctic, loss of most of the tropical coral reefs, melting of the permafrost, which would in turn give out yet more greenhouse gases, and ""dieback"" of the Amazon forest.
Sea levels could rise by half a metre and the cost of protecting coastal areas from the sea could reach GBP173billion a year by 2100, with countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam having to depend on money from richer countries.
One of the main areas to be discussed at this year's talks is the issue of finance for poor countries to help them cope with the impacts ofÊclimateÊchange and develop on a low-carbon path, with a figure of GBP60billion a year by 2020 agreed as a goal at last year's talks in Copenhagen.
In an article yesterday, David Cameron said Britain'sÊclimateÊchange response should not have to suffer because of the austerity measures and the nation could be a ""shining example"" for other countries to follow.
Researchers from Oxford University warned that it was not just by how much the planet warmed that could be dangerous, but the speed, as fast rates could outpace the ability of wildlife and natural systems adapt to the changes.
- Oxfam UK said global warming contributed to the deaths of 21,000 people in weather-related disasters in the first nine months of 2010, more than twice the number for the whole of 2009. It said floods in Pakistan and droughts in Russia had been linked toÊclimateÊchange."

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, December 3, 2010",ARE WE FREEZING BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING?,Roger Highfield,,"So which is it? Is it the vagaries of the elements that we should be cursing through our chattering teeth, or the carbon emissions from Chinese smokestacks?
Well, the most alarming way in which temperatures in Britain could fall significantly is through a decline in the warm Atlantic current that maintains our mildÊclimate. Although our weather depends on turbulent events in the atmosphere, these are shaped -- in the long term -- by the oceans, whose currents transport vast amounts of heat around the planet. Ancient records show that if these slowed or stopped, temperatures could drop by up to 10C within decades.
For six years, a team at Southampton University has been using instruments, strung across the Atlantic from the Bahamas to north Africa, to monitor the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. This is the massive system of currents, including the Gulf Stream, that carries a mindboggling 1.3petawatts of heat -- that's 1,300,000,000,000,000 watts -- northwards in its warm upper waters.
The Gulf Stream relies on the fact that as the water loses its heat in the north Atlantic, it cools, sinks and flows back to the south. The fear has been that, as the planet warms, melting Arctic ice will weaken these currents, plunging Europe into the cooler.
On this count, however, there is good news. According to Prof Mark Maslin, of University College London, there seems -- at present -- ""to be no evidence of changes in the Atlantic circulation which could account for the last two harsh winters"". There are, he says, shorter--term patterns in ocean circulation which have a major effect, and have been linked to the severe winters in the 1940s and 1960s. But again, that is probably not the case today.
So why is it so bone--chillingly cold? Well, Prof Maslin thinks the cause of the big freeze can be found in the atmosphere. As Ewen McCallum, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office, explains, this year and last have seen large areas of high pressure develop in the Atlantic, blocking the westerly winds and allowing chilly Arctic air to move south across Europe.
Winds from the east are always freezing -- and at this time of year, the long nights cool the European land--mass more rapidly, meaning that the air remains bitterly cold when it reaches us. To make matters worse, the winds pick up moisture and heat as they cross the North Sea, which is dumped on us in the form of snow (explaining why coastal areas to the east have seen the heaviest falls).
But before we write off our current cold snap as the British weather playing its usual tricks, we still need to explain why the Arctic high pressure has strayed so far south. And here, says Prof Maslin, is the more likely, and more subtle, link withÊclimateÊchange. ""For me,"" he says, ""this shows that theÊclimateÊis becoming more dynamic, and thus large shifts in the wind patterns are possible -- in this case, sub--tropical air being trapped further south than usual.""
In other words, we need to remember that while the average temperature is rising,ÊclimateÊchange also delivers more extreme weather, from chills to heatwaves. Today, we're stocking up on snowshoes -- but best to invest in some air--conditioning as well."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, November 6, 2010",A GIANT VICTORY FOR THE WORLD,Geoffrey Lean,,"The victory, on a state ballot initiative, was all the more significant - and surprising - since it came on a night when the country turned sharply Right, electing scores of Republican Congressmen who, as Barack Obama admitted, will kill off his last hopes of securing national legislation to combat global warming. Yet hundreds of thousands of Republican voters formed part of the 60-40 majority that defeated Proposition 23, which would have forced the state to shelve its farreachingÊclimateÊlaw indefinitely.
The site of the second celebration was a bar at the baseball stadium - which was particularly apt, because the proposition had been promoted by two big Texan oil companies. ""It was here yesterday that California beat Texas, and less than 24 hours later we have beaten Texas again,"" said the outgoing governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger (much smaller than you'd expect, but so well preserved - apparently artificially - that he seems to belong in Madame Tussauds). He added, inevitably: ""To anyone who tries to take out our environmental laws, I say 'Hasta la vista, baby!'
"" Parochial populism apart, this was a momentous event. A ballot of some seven million people, representing one of the world's top ten economies, decisively endorsed low-carbon growth - even at a time of recession and sky-high unemployment. That will have a worldwide effect, encouraging governments (like ours) who believe it provides the best prospect of prosperity.
If the vote had gone the other way, it would have delivered a devastating blow to the world's already fragile efforts to fend off dangerousÊclimateÊchange. And that, for a long time, is what looked like happening. Proposition 23 was couched in eminently reasonable terms. It did not seek to deny the existence of global warming, or call for all measures against it to be abandoned. It merely proposed suspending enforcement of the state's mainÊclimateÊlaw - aimed at returning its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 - until the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5 per cent for a full year. In fact, that is extremely unlikely - it has only been achieved twice in the last 34 years, and the rate currently stands at a massive 12.6 per cent - but it seemed reasonable enough.
The proposition rapidly gathered two-to-one support. Even a month ago, voters were evenly split; they only reversed their original position after hearing both sides of the argument. Greens are busy spinning it as a ""David v Goliath"" coup, but it was more like King Kong v a video game boss: it developed into battle between old industry and the new, and fossil fuels against clean energy, as the entrepreneurs around Silicon Valley joined, and largely financed, the environmentalist side.
Equally important, the political battle was fought on economic, not ecological, grounds. The oil companies called theÊclimateÊlaw a ""job killer"", but the technocrats could show that the law had already attracted nearly $9 billion in venture capital for clean technology, and that green jobs have been increasing 10 times faster than the state average.
Of course, California did generally buck the Rightward trend on Tuesday night. But 28 per cent of those who voted for Meg Whitman, the defeated Republican candidate for governor, still sided with the environmentalists. It's true, too, that the new industries far outspent the old: but Miss Whitman's spending dwarfed that of her own rival, and it didn't get her very far.
Flushed with the success of what he called ""an extraordinary coalition"", Schwarzenegger promised to go to Washington to try to ""jump-start"" national legislation. That seems a very tall order, but his fellow Republican George Schultz - Ronald Reagan's treasury secretary, who chaired the campaign against Proposition 23 - stresses that, for the first time, an electorate has spoken. ""Pay attention, politicians,"" he warned at Tuesday's celebrations. ""Pay attention."""

Ruth McTernan, a spokesman for the camp, said: ""It's been a dramatic start to what's going to be a week full of workshops, sustainable living and direct action against RBS's crimes against theÊclimate.
""We're in a beautiful location here at Gogarburn, surrounded by the woods. People should come down, have a cup of tea and check out what's going on for themselves.""
Activists have also declared a day of mass action against RBS on Monday.
Robbie Gillett, of Stop the Expansion of Manchester Airport, added: ""RBS is aÊclimateÊcriminal whose dirty investments have led to countless human rights abuses, devastation of land across the world, including mountains and forests, and deep drilling."" Police arrested two people at the site at Gogarburn, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, but said they had a duty to ""facilitate peaceful protest and allow for freedom of assembly"".
A spokesman for the bank said it provided support for businesses working across many industries and reflected the make-up of society and the economy.
She added: ""Just as society as a whole has to make a transition to renewable energy sources, so will banks like RBS.
""In fact in recent years RBS has been one of the most active banks in the world in providing funding for renewable energy projects so we are at the forefront of helping finance the transition.
""Therefore, while we understand the protesters' intent and publicity tactics, we clearly cannot agree with their decision to target RBS. We have offered to meet with the leaders of the protest, and although they have not accepted, this offer still stands.
""Our top priority is securing the safety of our staff and customers and we urge the protesters to make their point peacefully.""
The protesters have set up tents, marquees, eco-toilets and kitchens at the site."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, October 8, 2010",CHANGINGÊCLIMATEÊ'THREATENS HARVESTS',Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"It said the worst effects of rising temperatures could be limited by investment in better farming and the development of new drought resistant or heat tolerant crops.
This could involve new technologies such as genetic modification.
In a study published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the scientists warned that rising temperatures would make crops mature more quickly, reducing their yield. Extreme temperatures could also significantly reduce yields, they said.
More droughts would affect crops, while more intense monsoon rains could lead to flooding and crop damage, the researchers said.
Dr Andy Challinor from the University of Leeds looked at the effect ofÊclimateÊchange on spring wheat in China.
""Due to the importance of international trade, crop failure is an issue that affects everyone on the planet, not just those in crop-growing regions.
""More extreme weather events are expected to occur in the coming years due toÊclimateÊchange and we have shown that these events are likely to lead to more crop failures.
""What we need to do now is think about the solutions. It is highly unlikely that we will find a single intervention that is a 'silver bullet' for protecting crops from failure.""
An approach was needed which combined building up crops' tolerance to heat and water stress alongside investment in agriculture, the researchers suggested.
Dr Evan Fraser, a co-author of the study, of the University of Leeds, said rich and poor countries must adapt.
""What is becoming clear is that we need to adopt a holistic approach: new crops for a changingÊclimateÊand better farming practices that can only come about under more favourable socioeconomic conditions,"" he said."

They forecast that this year will be the hottest on record, globally. Usually scientists rely on the temperature over land, taken from weather stations, to gauge whether theÊclimateÊis changing.
However, today's State of theÊClimateÊreport brings together data from 10 separate indicators stretching back 150 years, including measurements of sea level rise taken from ships, the temperature of the upper atmosphere taken from weather balloons, and field surveys of melting glaciers.
New technology also means it is possible to measure the temperature of the oceans, which absorb 90 per cent of the world's heat.
Seven of the 10 areas measured including air and sea surface temperatures, the amount of heat in the ocean and humidity, had rising figures.
Three areas, the extent of Arctic sea ice, glaciers and winter snow cover in the northern hemisphere, were in decline.
According to the researchers, the study shows ""unequivocally that the world is warming and has been for more than three decades"".
And despite the cold winter in Europe and north-east America, this year is set to be the warmest ever.
The NOAA has stated that the first six months of this year were the hottest recorded, while the Met Office believes it is the second hottest start to the year after 1998.
Dr Peter Stott, head ofÊclimateÊmonitoring and attribution at the Met Office, said ""greenhouse gases are the glaringly obvious explanation"" for the 1F (0.56C) rise in average global temperatures over the past 50 years.
""Despite the fact people say global warming has stopped, the new data, added on to existing data, gives us the greatest evidence we have ever had,"" he said.
ClimateÊchange sceptics have questioned global warming in the wake of the ""climategate"" scandal. It was claimed that emails stolen from the University of East Anglia show scientists were willing to manipulate the land surface temperatures to show global warming. The scientists were cleared in an independent inquiry.
But Dr Stott said that sceptics could no longer question land surface temperature as other records also prove global warming. He said each indicator takes independent evidence from at least three different institutions. Despite variations from year to year, each decade has been warmer than the last since the 1980s.
He said: ""When we follow independent analyses from around the world, we see clear and unmistakable signs of a warming world.""

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, March 13, 2010",ROMPING IN READING - AND THE ARCTIC,Lorna Bradbury,,"Ian McEwan has always done sex with gusto. Who can forget the moment in On Chesil Beach when Edward and Florence's long-awaited sexual union misfires so disastrously in ""gouts"" of premature fruition; or the tender descriptions in Saturday of the neurosurgeon Henry Perowne rousing his wife from her slumbers?
But never before has he used it for a comic end, at least never intentionally. This is the case with his new novel, Solar. Here we have Michael Beard, McEwan's magnificent anti-hero, a philanderer whose fifth marriage is on the rocks, whose body is failing him and whose professional achievements are buried in the past, trying - and, increasingly, failing - to get a woman into bed.
There's his fifth wife, Patrice, who abandons him for their builder after learning about his 11 affairs in five years, and whom he tries to get back by feigning a lover in the house they still share. And a subsequent girlfriend, Melissa, a mother substitute into whose generous bosom he gratefully falls - until she traps him with pregnancy and the thrill is lost. To get through a particularly vigorous session with Melissa, Beard has to resort to a fantasy about sex in public with an immigration officer who had previously rejected his advances. And then there's Darlene, a waitress almost as bulky as Beard who, in a wild moment, he promises to marry - an offer he comes to regret as the elements of his life gather around him in the novel's final section.
Michael Beard is a comic creation in the same class as Martin Amis's John Self. Indeed, if Money could be seen as the high point of Amis's career, summing up the excesses of the Eighties, so Solar is likely to come to be regarded as the equivalent for McEwan. For this novel takes on the political obsession of our age -ÊclimateÊchange - and fashions out of it a satirical masterpiece.
McEwan nails Beard in his opening sentence: ""He belonged to that class of men - vaguely unprepossessing, often bald, short, fat, clever - who were unaccountably attractive to certain beautiful women."" And it is not long before Beard's professional failings are nailed, too. Though he achieved distinction early in his career with the Beard-Einstein Conflation, which earned him a Nobel Prize, he has been coasting on this success for decades. Honorary degrees, after-dinner speeches, positions on committees: all this for a frustrated has-been who compensates for his lack of ideas with an abundance of deviousness.
Beard's views onÊclimateÊchange are bracing, to say the least: ""There was an Old Testament ring to the forewarnings, an air of plague-of-boils and deluge-offrogs, that suggested a deep and constant inclination, enacted over the centuries, to believe that one was always living at the end of days."" But the Blair government is concerned to appear to be takingÊclimateÊchange seriously, so a centre is set up outside Reading - and who is charged to oversee it, but Beard. The hopelessly inefficient institution is run by a yes man in line for a knighthood and spends its time fielding ""clean energy"" schemes from loners and eccentrics.
The research trip Beard is sent on to the Arctic yields some amusing moments for our increasingly farcical hero: the horror of getting into a ski suit, only to realise that one has forgotten to put one's boots on before one's gloves; the challenges of urinating in the Arctic, especially when ""his penis had attached itself to the zip of his snowmobile suit"". The only solution is to douse it in brandy. Beard, in pain from this incident, and drowning his sorrows in buckets of wine, acts as an amusing foil to the artistic do-gooders around him.
McEwan sends up the workings of government and how personal gain is played out at the expense of ideology. Beard's views mutate as the novel progresses and his business interests lead him to champion solar energy in a photosynthesis plant in New Mexico. But McEwan casts his net wide, poking fun at contemporary life, from installation art (Stella Polkinghorne's ""scaled-up Monopoly set on a playing field in Catford"") to journalism. ""Nobel Prof Says No to Lab Chicks"" is the headline accompanying a tabloid story reporting Beard's indifference to the matter of why women are under-represented in physics. And all the while he belches his way through piles of junk food.
Solar can, at times, seem loose, structured through a series of anecdotes and diversions about Beard's life. It i s only quite far in that it becomes clear just how well plotted and rigorous it is. Though it incorporates a series of styles ranging all the way to slapstick farce, there are few superfluous plot strands. And all roads lead to the dramatically abrupt - though hardly surprising - ending. If Solar is a satisfying read, it is because McEwan plays directly to our expectations. The polar-bear skin that slides too easily on the polished wooden floor, or the alien toolbox in the cupboard - we know that these will amount to something for our hero, and so they do.
McEwan is in many ways the closest thing we have to a national novelist - he has won the Booker Prize twice, his books are frequently transferred to the screen and he is the only literary novelist to find himself with any regularity on the bestseller lists. He has long been celebrated as a master of macabre, and of the realist novel, and with Solar he has proved, after the qualified success of Saturday, that he is a fine proponent of the state-of-the-nation novel, too - one delivered not as a polemic, such as the Poet Laureate's poem ""Atlas"", but as a dark satire. Solar is fun and clever, but the brilliance of its timing, as our scepticism about the received scientific view ofÊclimateÊchange grows, means it will come to be regarded as a classic."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, September 11, 2010",PRINCE'S CHALLENGE TOÊCLIMATEÊSCEPTICS,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"In a television interview yesterday, the Prince questioned the sceptics' belief that carbon emissions ""just disappear through holes"" in the atmosphere. Asked what he thought of people who deniedÊclimateÊchange, he said they misunderstood the science.
""I find it quite extraordinary, because to me it seems only sensible to take a precautionary approach,"" he said. ""There is something going very wrong.""
Scientists believe that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, causing the ""greenhouse effect"". It is feared that if mankind continues to burn fossil fuels, the warming will cause catastrophic floods and droughts around the world. The Prince challenged the sceptics to offer another explanation for the warmingÊclimate.
""It may be very convenient to believe that somehow all these greenhouse gases we're pouring into the atmosphere just disappear through holes conveniently into space -- it doesn't work like that,"" he said.
The Prince has campaigned on cutting greenhouse gases for more than 30 years.
His latest initiative, Start, focuses on how ordinary people can make a difference through simple changes in their lifestyle. He has been touring the country to see projects where communities are growing fruit and vegetables in school playgrounds, cycling to work and installing solar panels at pensioners' homes.
The Prince completed his tour at The Garden Party to Make a Difference yesterday, a festival to celebrate sustainable living in the grounds of his London residence, Clarence House.
He showed visitors his own efforts to cut his carbon footprint.
The Prince said people were more interested than ever in green living, citing the increase in bee-keeping and work on allotments.
""People have taken it on to themselves to try to do all these things because they get frustrated and they realise there is a huge challenge that we're facing,"" he said.

During a speech at London's Science Museum yesterday to open a GBP4.5million Atmosphere gallery, the Prince said thatÊclimatescience ""has taken a battering of late"". This was why in January he had visited the University of East Anglia's School of Environmental Sciences, of which he is patron. It is the home of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) -- the department at the centre of the Climategate row.
""I wanted to discuss with them the appalling treatment they had endured during the so-called Climategate row because, as they reminded me, the University of East Anglia is not a campaigning NGO, nor an industry lobby group,"" said the Prince.
""It is an academic institution working to understand precisely and dispassionately what is happening to our world; to separate the facts from the fiction and build the sum of human knowledge on the one issue that could very well balloon into the cause of our downfall.""
Prof Phil Jones, the director of research at the Climatic Research Unit, said yesterday: ""I am extremely grateful for Prince Charles's continuing support at the end of what has obviously been a gruelling period in my career.
""His visit earlier in the year gave great comfort to me and my colleagues in the Climatic Research Unit at a very dark time.
""To receive such public support from the Prince is a further boost.""
The Climategate row began when emails from CRU scientists were hacked into and released online last year.
ClimateÊchange sceptics claimed the messages showed that researchers were manipulating and suppressing data to back up the theory of manmade global warming. Despite three inquiries, the events are still not clear.
The final inquiry cleared the scientists of any dishonesty or exaggerating the extent of global warming.
But it said they had been ""unhelpful"" and not suffi-ciently open about research that supported the case for man-made global warming.
The Prince has previously criticisedÊclimateÊchange sceptics, claiming they used ""pseudoscience"" and ""intimidation"" to stop the world from addressing global warming.
He said more and more people were listening to the ""siren voices"" of sceptics who claimed the theory of manmade global warming was a ""sinister attempt to undermine the capitalist system""."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, May 7, 2010",PARTIES AGREE ON GREEN POLICIES BUT WHICH ONE WILL DELIVER ON PLEADGES?,Louise Gray,,"The reason for this is that most of the main parties' policies on how to tackle it are the same.
All three want to make homes more efficient, generate more energy from renewable sources and increase recycling. Most importantly, they all agree that global warming is man-made and Britain should be part of an international deal to cut carbon emissions.
With environment groups warning that global warming must be stopped within five years, the question is which party means what it says.
The Liberal Democrats have the greenest policies of the three main parties. Nick Clegg made the most of this during the leaders' debates, using his party's radical environmental policies to distance himself from ""old politics"".
He promised to go beyond currentÊclimateÊchange targets and cut Britain's greenhouse gases to zero by 2050. He said this could be done through insulating leaky building stock, building a high-speed rail network and curbing emissions from aviation and manufacturing. He said offshore wind, solar and other renewables could provide all the country's energy needs without having to resort to nuclear power.
Labour and the Tories claim it will be impossible to keep the lights on without nuclear, although both say that no public subsidies will be offered.
Labour set out plans for up to 10 new nuclear power stations and promised to continue with plans to build thousands of wind turbines on land and at sea.
Ed Miliband, theÊClimateÊChange Secretary, said the Tories would put this at risk by shaking up the planning system.
He said only Labour would keep Britain on track to a low carbon economy, despite the fact that most of his hardfought policies on renewables - such as setting up a green investment bank - were repeated by other parties.
The Tories matched Labour on green policies, although many of the details were different.
The party promised loans to help people insulate their homes and to invest in renewables, although they are more cautious about onshore wind.
But despite managing to largely ""decontaminate"" his party ofÊclimateÊsceptics, David Cameron was largely quiet on green issues.
The nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales have some of the most ambitious plans for renewable energy, while the Green Party was hoping to get its first MP in Brighton.
Environmental groups remain hopeful that all the parties will stick to the ambitious green policies in their manifestos, arguing that many of the measures to boost renewables and insulate homes will provide jobs and help the economy."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, November 24, 2010",PLEDGES TO CUT CARBON EMISSIONS FAILING TO SAVE WORLD,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"Under the Copenhagen Accord, signed at the end of last year, 80 countries promised to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
But even if every target is met it will deliver less than two thirds of the cuts needed to stop global temperatures rising by more than 2C (3.8F). The report casts doubt on the world's ability to tackle global warming as countries prepare to meet for the next round of UN talks in Cancun, Mexico.
The talks are aimed at reducing global greenhouse gases to prevent the warming of the atmosphere.
Scientists say that if temperatures rise by more than 2C the ice caps could melt and more extreme weather will occur, such as droughts and floods.
Achim Steiner, the UN's top representative on the environment, said that unless the targets were increased global warming would rise to dangerous levels.
Mr Steiner urged countries to work together through the UN to reach an agreement onÊclimateÊchange. The world is heading for ""mutually assured destruction if we do not act"", he said.
About 48 gigatons (48 billion tons) of greenhouse gases are emitted every year.
If countries carry on with ""business as usual"", emissions will rise to 56 gigatons by 2020, with temperatures to rise by 7C (12.6F).
To stand a good chance of limiting temperature rise to 2C, emissions have to fall to 44 gigatons by 2020. But the current pledges would bring emissions down to only 49 gigatons.
This gap is the equivalent of taking all the vehicles in the world off the road.
Mr Steiner said it would be possible to fill the gap by using new technologies and helping poor nations to switch from fossil fuels to renewables such as wind and solar power.
The Copenhagen Accord is a political agreement and Mr Steiner said countries would be encouraged to act by a more ""legally binding"" agreement in Cancun.
Britain will negotiate as part of the European Union bloc at theÊclimateÊchange talks. Dr Keith Allott, the British head ofÊ , urged ministers to try to raise the EU target to help fill the ""gigaton gap"".
Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary General, urged countries to raise targets.
""I encourage all parties to make good on their national pledges and to further progress within the negotiations as well as through strengthened efforts on the ground to curb emissions,"" he said. ""There is no time to waste.""

"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Tuesday, June 29, 2010",'WE CANNOT GO ON RELYING ON EXPENSIVE FOREIGN FUEL',Louise Gray,,"Barker, a former PR executive who took his close friend David Cameron to the Arctic resulting in that infamous snap with the huskies that was dismissed as a cynical stunt by critics, is ""100 per cent certain"" that man-made global warming is happening.
In his Whitehall office, there are two prints from the ""husky"" set as well as a strategically placed ""Save the Planet'' cushion. However, he insists that it's not ""all doom and gloom"".
The 43-year-old believes Britain could become the ""Saudi Arabia of renewable energy"" by investing in offshore wind, wave and tidal sources. In the Budget, the Coalition pledged to set up a Green Investment Bank to help finance renewable power stations, and Barker has ambitious plans to make London ""the world hub of green finance"", creating ""green ISAs and pensions"" so that the public can invest in, and benefit from, the massive growth in the clean energy industry.
""We are absolutely convinced we have to move rapidly to decarbonise our economy, but we are not in the business of scaremongering. We are in the business of promoting the opportunities this will create for the green economy,"" he says.
This strategy is central to the Government's Green New Deal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050. If that is to be achieved, between 400,000 and 1.8 million homes a year will have to be upgraded between now and then, at an annual cost of between GBP5billion and GBP15billion.
A flagship ""pay as you save"" scheme will allow people to book a free consultation with an ""energy doctor"" at a participating supermarket or store. After an energy audit, corrective measures up to a cost of GBP10,000 will be recommended. Home owners will repay the cost over time through savings on their fuel bill, says Mr Barker. Although details are yet to be finalised, the scheme could start as early as next year.
He hails this policy as a ""completely new radical and ambitious approach to insulating the nation's homes"" that will not only help combat climate change by cutting emissions but help cut the average family's fuel bill, which has soared to around GBP1,300 per annum.
""We have to help families reduce the amount they are spending on electricity and heating their homes, and we will do this by creating a new market,"" he said. ""We will bring new participants into the insulating business, like B&Q, Marks & Spencer or Virgin, as well as trusted energy companies like British Gas and others, to help pay for the upfront cost without the householder having to incur debt on their bills. The cost of upgrading each property will be attached to the energy bill and repaid over 25 years.""
Mr Barker is committed to cutting carbon emissions but, unlike his predecessors in office, he doesn't dismiss climate-change sceptics as ""flatearthers"" - there are too many of them on the back benches for him to do that.
""There are people that take different views. I am not a scientist, but I do understand science is about probabilities. I think, if anything, the slightly preachy tone that some in the climate-change debate have adopted and the rather intolerant tone of those who have genuine concerns is not helpful.""
But he says the Coalition will continue with Labour's policy on climate change, including cutting carbon emissions by at least 34 per cent by 2020 and pushing for a global deal that could see the target increase to 42 per cent.
It will be tough to make such cuts while the Government budget is also being reduced and Liberal Dem colleagues disagree on key matters, such as nuclear energy, but the MP for Bexhill and Battle is a fighter and unafraid to court controversy. Four years ago, the father-of-three was mired in scandal after leaving his wife, Celeste, for a male interior designer. He was also caught up in the MPs' expenses furore, having made GBP320,000 profit on a flat he bought with the help of his taxpayer-funded expenses.
In one sense, Barker is ideally placed for his new role, having worked for the Russian oil company Sibneft, once owned by Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich. Now, however, he says Britain must reduce dependence on imported oil and gas.
""I think there are a lot of fool's choices that have been drawn under the last government that are not necessary. To me, energy security, with a diverse supply of clean energy and more efficient use of energy, is something we should be pursuing regardless of whether you are a believer in global warming or not.
""We cannot as a country go on relying on expensive foreign fuel. We need to have a safe, secure supply of clean energy from a diverse mix of sources.""
It remains to be seen whether a minister who describes himself as ""blue-green"" can convince environmentalists that his free-market strategy is the way ahead.

LORD LAWSON of Blaby, one of the most prominent sceptical voices in the climate change debate, has warned that it is ""madness"" for Britain to try to lead the world in reducing carbon emissions. ""We have said with an extraordinary post-imperial arrogance that we are going to show the world what it should do,"" the former chancellor cautions. ""We are going to be a great example. Well, we have been an example of what not to do - by damaging our own economy to no conceivable purpose.""
While Western countries may be prepared to sign up to swingeing emissions cuts, Lord Lawson believes emerging nations, such as India and China, will never agree to them. It is arrogant of rich nations, such as Britain, to ask them to adopt a policy that might limit economic growth, he says.
He acknowledges that the world has grown warmer in the past 100 years, and that it is likely that man-made greenhouse gases ""played a part"" in that warming. But he believes the science is uncertain: ""We need to get off this absurd carbon-cessation hook that will be hugely damaging to the economy and society. What we should be doing is monitoring what is happening very carefully and closely and preparing to adapt to any changes that might occur.""
The last round of United Nations talks on climate change in Copenhagen at the end of 2009 failed, but the issue came up again at the G8 last weekend, and the UN will resume talks at the end of this year towards getting a global deal. Despite support for a global agreement on climate change among his Tory colleagues, including the Prime Minister, Lord Lawson said it was misguided.
He also said domestic policy to cut greenhouse emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 would drive manufacturing abroad and limit growth.
However, Chris Huhne, the Energy and Climate Change Secretary, has said Britain would continue the policy of the last administration by committing to cut emissions first before asking poorer countries to take action.
""Europe must take a lead in securing an international climate agreement, though we can't just click our fingers and hope the rest of the world will follow. We've got to make real emission cuts at home, and work constructively with all other nations in achieving that ambitious deal,"" he said."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, June 30, 2010",DOUBLE WIND FARM BUILDING AND SELL 1M ELECTRIC CARS,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"Under laws brought in by Labour, the country is committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 34 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
The Committee onÊClimateÊChange (CCC), set up to advise ministers on progress, says today that it is on course to fail.
Lord Turner, the committee chairman, said the recession had created the ""illusion"" that Britain was tacklingÊclimateÊchange, but the substantial declines in emissions were almost entirely due to the downturn in the economy.
Greenhouse gases fell by 8.6 per cent last year, but only a fraction of that was as a result of measures such as renewable energy or making homes more energy-efficient.
To carry on cutting carbon as the economy recovers, the CCC is recommending radical policies, including a ban on polluting power stations, a crackdown on air travel and a tax on farmers' fertiliser.
Its chief executive, David Kennedy, said: ""We've had a light-touch approach in the UK, we've talked a good game but what we've seen is emissions haven't fallen.""
In its report, the committee says Britain needs to increase the proportion of energy generated from renewable sources from 5 to 15 per cent by 2020.
In wind power alone, twice as many turbines need to be built every year.
There should be a tax on carbon to make generating power from fossil fuels more expensive and a ban on power stations that emit too much pollution, so that by 2020 only renewables, nuclear and ""clean"" coal or gas power stations are allowed to operate. Between 400,000 and 1.8million homes a year will have to improve their insulation.
The committee says home owners are not bothering because current subsidies are ""too much hassle"".
The number of electric cars on the road needs to increase from the current 2,000 to 1.7million by 2020, the committee says, and the Government must provide a GBP260million subsidy to ensure electric cars are made and bought in Britain and to set up a national battery recharging network.
Those steps could even enable Britain to meet more ambitious 42 per cent reductions in greenhouse gases, which the committee says the Government should consider.
Chris Huhne, the Energy andÊClimateÊChange Secretary, agreed that more needed to be done.
""There has to be an enduring shift to low carbon, driving growth in new technologies, and it must be locked into the fabric of our economy in good times and bad,"" he said.
""We will overhaul the energy efficiency of homes through our Green Deal, we are working to create a Green Investment Bank to help low carbon investment, and we have committed central government itself to cut emissions by 10 per cent within a year.""

Indeed, there is a good chance that it will go careering over the edge at full tilt, not merely failing to make progress towards a new treaty, but actually sabotaging the only one that the world already has - and doing grave damage to the United Nations, and confidence in multilateral negotiations as a whole, in the process.
Not that you would guess anything of the sort if you dropped in on the Moon Palace, the vast campus-style hotel where the talks are taking place. It looks more like a particularly laid-back academic conference, with bureaucrats who normally seem to be surgically attached to their suits ambling around in the sun in chinos and shirt sleeves: unusually, the organisers of the UN conference specified a casual dress code to help lighten the atmosphere.
In the closed negotiating sessions in the boxily functional meeting rooms, the mood is equally relaxed and sunny. None of the many flashpoints that caused the Copenhagen conflagration have so far ignited, and the repeated procedural points deliberately raised in the Danish capital to bog things down have, as yet, been mercifully absent.
The Mexicans are proving to be far better hosts than the disastrous Danes, winning the confidence of both industrialised and developing countries. And peace is also breaking out between the United States and China - the two carbon superpowers, together responsible for about half of the world's emissions - whose clash was at the root of the problems in Copenhagen. Both delegations are going public with warm words for each other; Su Wei, China's chief negotiator, even says that the differences between them on the most contentious issue of all - the American insistence on international monitoring of the domestic measures China takes to control emissions - are ""not that huge"". In general, he adds, ""both countries would like to emerge from Cancun with a deal"".
""It is not eventful and that's very good,"" says the leader of one European delegation. ""The fact that we are making slow progress is actually a great success at this stage of the proceedings."" And yet, despite this rare outbreak of sweetness and light, everyone is aware that a grenade has been rolled under the door that could blow up and destroy everything.
It comes from the unlikely hands of the Japanese, who normally go out of their way to avoid being contentious in international environmental negotiations (those involving whaling excepted). They pulled out the pin on the very first day of the meeting, announcing that they would not ""on any conditions or under any circumstances"" tolerate the renewal of the emission controls set by the existing Kyoto Protocol when they run out at the end of next year. Since no new treaty is conceivable by then, this would leave the world without any internationally agreed targets to combat global warming and probably destroy much of the emerging world carbon market.
Hideki Minamikawa, the country's vice-minister for global environmental affairs, says that it does not make sense to rely on the protocol, which covers only 27 per cent of the world's emissions, since the US has refused to sign up and China and other developing countries are exempted.
Technically, he is right. But politically, Japan's actions are explosive.
Developing countries see extending controls under the protocol as the crucial litmus test of whether the industrialised nations are serious about tacklingÊclimateÊchange - suspecting, with justice, that many would like to avoid any internationally agreed, legally binding targets at all. This suspicion was a major cause of the breakdown in Copenhagen and if not allayed, will doom the talks here, too.
Britain and the rest of Europe also wanted to do away with the protocol in the past, but now accept that if there is to be any hope of international measures to combatÊclimateÊchange, Kyoto will have to continue, at least for the time being, alongside a separate agreement covering the US and developing countries.
It is on their shoulders that the chances of averting disaster now rest - especially those of the Coalition, which has recently taken the lead in the EU. Chris Huhne, theÊClimateÊChange Secretary, who flies out today, determined to keep the talks on track, might care to pack a lightsabre."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, November 30, 2010",SPACE MIRRORS AND ALGAE TO CUT GLOBAL WARMING,Louise Gray in Cancun,,"Speaking at the summit, Dr Rajendra Pachauri, the head of the Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange (IPCC), said the panel's next report on global warming would not only look at the threat of rising temperatures but also consider ""geo-engineering"" options that could reverse warming.
The announcement implied that scientists were losing faith in a global deal to stop temperature rises by limiting emissions.
There are already low expectations for the summit, being held at a beach resort on Mexico's east coast.
Representatives from more than 190 countries are meeting at the heavily guarded Moon Palace Hotel to try to find a way to limit emissions so that temperature rises stay below 3.6F (2C).
The IPCC is responsible for setting out the scientific basis on which the talks are based.
Addressing the opening conference, Dr Pachauri said if mankind continued to produce greenhouse gases at the current rate the world could experience catastrophic warming within 50 years.
He said the threat was so great that the fifth assessment report (AR5), due to be presented to the UN in 2014, would look at ""geo-engineering options"". ""The AR5 has been expanded and will in future focus on subjects like clouds and aerosols, geo-engineering and sustainability issues,"" he said.
Later this year IPCC ""expert groups"" will meet in Peru to discuss geo-engineering. Options include putting mirrors in space to reflect sunlight or covering Greenland in a massive ""blanket"" so it does not melt.
Sprinkling iron filings in the ocean ""fertilises"" algae, which absorbs CO2 and ""seeding clouds"" means that sunlight is blocked. Other options include artificial ""trees"" that suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, painting roofs white to reflect sunlight, and man-made volcanoes that spray sulphate particles high in the atmosphere to scatter the sun's rays back into space.
Critics have argued that the process could makeÊclimateÊchange worse through unintended consequences.
Earlier this year the IPCC was forced to undergo a review after it was disclosed that the last report to the UN, the AR4, included the mistaken claim that the Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035. Critics called for the chairman to resign.
But Dr Pachauri insisted that the review made the panel stronger than ever.
""We are confident that the IPCC will emerge stronger as a result of this exercise and live up to the expectations of the global community,"" he said. The prospect of a treaty being agreed in Cancun is remote, as the world's two biggest emitters, China and the US, will not agree to legally binding targets.
Chris Huhne, theÊClimateÊChange Secretary, has already admitted that a global agreement is unlikely this time, although he said it was possible to make progress in other areas.
Opening the talks, Felipe Calderon, Mexico's president, insisted a deal was still possible. ""During the next two weeks, the whole world will be looking at you. It would be a tragedy not to overcome the hurdle of national interests."""
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, November 20, 2010",IN SEARCH OF A FUTURE THAT WILL WORK FOR THE WORLD,Andrew Cave,,"Yet it is possible to develop credible potential scenarios highlighting choices that need to be made about our future in a carbon-constrained world.
Shell has done exactly that, producing two potential scenarios that may develop from mushrooming energy demand from globalisation and rapid population growth, diminishing conventional oil and gas resources, and environmental stresses fromÊ .
The first, called Scramble, reflects a focus on national energy security, with immediate pressures driving country decision-makers to focus on securing near-future energy supply for themselves and their allies.
Policymakers, therefore, pay little attention to more efficient energy use until supplies are tight, while greenhouse-gas emissions go effectively unaddressed unless majorÊclimateÊshocks occur.
National government attention falls on supply levers that can easily be pulled, including the negotiation of bilateral government deals between energy producers and energy consumers, and incentives for local resource development. Coal, biofuels and renewable energy become much more significant, with the global coal industry doubling in size between 2000 and 2025 and biomass representing 15 per cent of primary energy by 2050.
However, energy efficiency and other policies to do with energy demand are not addressed meaningfully until the supply stresses become too serious for the market to cope with. Then, an overall energy supply crisis results, and governments react with draconian domestic price rises or personal mobility restrictions, resulting in a global economic slowdown by 2020.
The turnaround to healthy economic growth takes a decade, with locally developed biofuels, wind and thermal solar energy eventually stimulating innovation.
However, by then it is clear that a new international approach to energy security andÊclimateÊchange mitigation is needed.
The world is 20 years behind where it would have been had it set up such a system by 2015. In addition, nations are likely to face expensive consequences beyond 2050.
Blueprints, Shell's other scenario, paints a more collaborative picture in which local actions begin to address the challenges of economic development, energy security and environmental pollution.
Alliances in developed and emerging nations lead to parallel responses to supply, demand andÊclimateÊchange stresses, starting with a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.
CO2 prices strengthen - helped by a new pricing mechanism and trading scheme - energy efficiency improves, the emergence of mass-market electric vehicles is accelerated and the rate of growth of atmospheric CO2 is constrained.
The US responds to pressure by promising to reach European minimum fuel economy standards for cars by 2020, while China and India secure agreements to facilitate technology transfer and investment in energy-efficient plants in exchange for taking part in international frameworks.
Increasingly aligned approaches to CO2 management in the US, China, India, Japan and Europe pave the way for carbon capture and storage to become a reality after 2020.
By 2050, economic growth no longer relies on an increase in the use of fossil fuels. The world is increasingly one of electrons, rather than molecules, with electric vehicles becoming the norm and power generation from renewable energy sources growing rapidly.
Almost 90 per cent of coal and gas-fired power stations in OECD countries and 50 per cent elsewhere are equipped with carbon capture and storage technologies, reducing overall CO2 emissions by 15 to 20 per cent, compared to what would otherwise have happened.
By 2055, the US and the EU are using an average of 33 per cent less energy per capita than today, while Chinese energy has peaked.
Neither scenario is ideal or comfortable.
However, acknowledging their potential can be the first stage of developing a road map to answer the problems that the Age of Energy poses over the next 40 years."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, April 27, 2010",A TREE FOR EVERY CHILD: HOW TORIES AIM TO WIN GREEN VOTE,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"Despite rebranding the party as environmentally friendly and advertisements urging ""vote blue, go green"", the Conservatives have been largely silent on the issue during the election campaign. In the television debate last week, Mr Cameron was the only leader not to mentionÊclimateÊchange in his opening speech.
Some Conservative Party members have denied that global warming is man-made. A recent poll found thatÊclimateÊchange was at the bottom of the list of priorities for many Tory candidates.
Yesterday, Mr Cameron published a series of commitments in a new ""green manifesto"". He promised to create a green deal that would give every home owner access to GBP6,500 for energy improvement measures. By 2016 there would be smart meters in every home. Transport would be transformed by a high-speed rail network and charging points for electric cars. The green belt would be protected and new ""wildlife corridors"" would connect nature reserves. Money from the sale of 1.5 per cent of the public woodlands estate would help to plant one million trees over the next parliament, including one for every child born in England from 2013.
The Tory leader made it clear that voting for the Liberal Democrats would jeopardise a change in environmental policy, as it could mean that Labour would still be in power.
""If you vote Conservative you know you'll get every single word in here in terms of our green manifesto - you'll get all that done,"" he said. ""You vote for anyone else, you can't be certain of any change.""
The Tories promised to adhere to the European target to generate 15 per cent of energy from renewables by 2020, by setting up a green investment bank and a marine energy park for offshore wind, wave and tidal power.
Ed Miliband, the Energy andÊClimateÊChange Secretary, said many of the measures promised by the Tories - such as a pledge to pay people for generating their own electricity - had already been introduced.
He criticised Mr Cameron for talking aboutÊclimateÊchange while members of his own party blocked applications for onshore wind farms. Darren Johnson, one of the three Green Party candidates with a good chance of being elected for the first time, said all the main parties were failing on the environment."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, October 5, 2010",THREE EXPERTS SHARE THEIR VIEWS ON HOW BUSINESS AND WIDER SOCIETY MUST FACE UP TO THE ENERGY CHALLENGES AHEAD,"ALAIN GLATIGNY, Innovation Energy Manager, Schneider Electric",,"MATTHEW CHINN, Managing Director Siemens Energy Sector and Sector Lead, North West Europe
Q: WHAT ARE THE DD7FICULTIES OF INTEGRATING RENEWABLE ENERGY INTO THE GRID? A: Europe's leaders are committed to the 20-20-20 targets onÊclimateÊand energy use. Integrating energy from renewable sources is one of the main technical challenges. Renewable energy is unpredictable and it is difficult to match supply with demand, which makes the planning of the grid dispatcher more complex.
Renewable energy creates a bi-directional flow which has implications for network protection, voltage regulation and islanding. The key challenge is to find affordable solutions which will allow the integration of any type of renewable energy at any location on the grid and provide the means to control the load, depending on the available power. Q: WHY IS NETWORK STABILITY IMPORTANT AND HOW CAN IT BE ACHIEVED? A: A high rate of renewable energy distributed on the grid coupled with changes in customer usage can create instability on a network.
The result could be black-outs, regionally or nationally, which is obviously bad for the economy. Network stability can be controlled on two levels: at transmission level, and at distribution level, by controlling the loads and distributed generators. So ancillary services which contribute to network stability, such as active-reactive power management, will definitely become more valuable.
Q: WHAT IS 'DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT' AND HOW DOES IT AFFECT THE NEED FOR NETWORK MANAGEMENT? A: Demand side management (DSM) means taking actions which respond to how much energy is consumed and also to the pattern of use. It can mean, for example, taking steps to reduce demand at peak times. It requires an efficient communications infrastructure to link the demand, supply and market sides. It's a great opportunity for operators to make more intelligent use of existing assets, using 'smart grid' technologies, such as grid automation and networking management.Êwww.schneider-electric.comÊNATIONS TOGETHER AND CO-ORDINATING POLICY ON RENEWABLE ENERGY? A: The leadership of Abu Dhabi realise the importance renewable energy will play in meeting future global energy needs.
Through Masdar, Abu Dhabi has invested in a strategic and comprehensive initiative dedicated to all aspects of renewable energy. Masdar, through global partnerships and collaboration, is making significant advances in the areas of energy security,Êclimate change and sustainable human development. Events such as the European Future Energy Forum and the annual World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi serve as ideal platforms for Masdar to secure long-term strategic partners for the joint development of renewable energy technologies.
Q: WHAT AREAS OF POTENTIAL CO-OPERATION ARE THERE BETWEEN MASDAK AND EUROPE, PARTICULARLY THE UK?
A: In Europe our focus is mainly on developing cooperation across R&D, venture capital investments in cleantech andÊclimate-change mitigation plans, as well as large scale deployment of renewable energy technology.
The London Array, a joint venture between DONG, E.ON and Masdar, will be the world's largest wind farm, providing enough energy to power around 750,000 homes in Greater London, around a quarter of the total.
Q: HOW WILL THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN ENERGY MOVE FORWARD IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS?
A: Clean energy has the ability to mitigateÊclimateÊchange, establish new economic sectors, revive failing economic sectors and help meet global energy requirements without sacrificing economic growth and human progress.
Q:WHY IS THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES A GOOD PLACE TO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS?
A: There is no equivalent to Masdar anywhere, either in scale as a test-bed or hi the comprehensive nature of the approach. Masdar offers an unparalleled investment portfolio with access to human capital and R&D capabilities, entirely dedicated to clean energy solutions. www. masdar. ae www. worldfutureenergysummit .com ENERGY INDUSTRY IN A LOW-CARBON FUTURE?
A: To decarbonise energy generation rapidly while maintaining energy security. Electricity consumption is expected to rise by more than 60 per cent by 2030 and our new generating capacity will need to be a mixture of technologies, such as wind power, nuclear, clean coal and biomass.
Q: HOW CAN NEW TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY HELP ADOPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES? A: New transmission technologies such as high voltage direct current (HVDC) enable electricity to be moved across longer distances with up to 40 per cent fewer losses than AC technologies.
This allows the industry to generate electricity in more remote locations and efficiently transmit it to where it is needed. So for wind energy, where Siemens provides more than 40 per cent of wind turbine generating capacity in the UK, HVDC technology will enable wind farms to be established further offshore.
Q: HOW CAN THE GROWTH IN ENERGY CONSUMPTION BE MANAGED EFFICIENTLY?
A: Smart grid applications will help manage future consumption. For example, digital smart meters tell consumers when they are using high-cost electricity, so they can adjust their consumption and use less power at peak times and save money. Trials with smart meters have demonstrated that consumers and business users become highly motivated to save electricity when they know how much they are using from moment to moment.
Q: WHAT CHANGES CAN WE EXPECT TO THE ENERGY SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE FUTURE?
A: Undoubtedly e-cars and smart grid applications will be the greatest changes. Besides changing the way we travel, e-cars could also be used to help balance electricity peak supply and demand. The batteries in e-cars could be used to store electricity during periods of low demand and if the car is not being used, the electricity could be released into the grid during periods of high demand.Êwww.siemens.co.uk"
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Thursday, April 1, 2010",GREEN LOBBY ATTACKS OBAMA AS HE APPROVES OFFSHORE HUNT FOR OIL,Toby Harnden in Washington,,"Mr Obama unveiled a policy that could put new platforms along the Atlantic coastline, the Gulf of Mexico and off parts of Alaska.
It was welcomed by cries of ""drill, baby, drill"" from Republicans repeating a slogan from their 2008 election campaign. Their leaders on Capitol Hill claimed credit for encouraging the move and said they were ready to work with Mr Obama. The decision is expected to help the president secure opposition support for aÊclimateÊchange bill.
""This is not a decision that I've made lightly,"" Mr Obama said in anticipation of the outcry from environmentalists, stressing that it would be done ""in ways that balance the need to harness domestic energy resources and the need to protect America's natural resources"".
He said he had studied the issue for more than a year and concluded that it was the right decision given the nation's thirst for energy and the need to produce jobs and keep American businesses competitive.
Proposed contracts in Alaska's Bristol Bay, however, were cancelled over environmental concerns. Brendan Cummings, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that the announcement was ""all too typical of what we have seen so far from President Obama - promises of change, a year of 'deliberation', and ultimately, adoption of flawed and outdated Bush policies as his own"".
He added: ""Rather than bring about the change we need, this plan will further our national addiction to oil and contribute to global warming, while at the same time directly despoiling the habitat of polar bears, endangered whales, and other imperilled wildlife.""
Phil Radford, Greenpeace executive director, said: ""Is this President Obama's clean energy plan or Palin's 'drill baby drill' campaign? ""Expanding offshore drilling in areas that have been protected for decades threatens our oceans and the coastal communities that depend on them with devastating oil spills, more pollution andÊclimateÊchange.""
Mr Obama was capitalising on the upturn in his political fortunes after the passage of the Democratic health care bill to do something that the White House knows will be unpopular with its liberal supporters.
The decision was part of a broader strategy, Mr Obama said, that included expanding the production of nuclear power to ""move us from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that relies more on homegrown fuels"" and clean energy.
""While our politics has remained entrenched along worn divides, the ground has shifted beneath our feet. Around the world, countries are seeking an edge in the global marketplace by investing in new ways of producing and saving energy,"" he said.
An important factor was to attract Republican support for aÊclimateÊchange bill that orders cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and has been stuck in Congress with little prospect of progress towards becoming law.
Although the White House presented it as a carefullyconsidered middle ground, environmentalists were shocked by the scope of the drilling. Access to huge areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for exploration has long been a priority for the oil industry. Drilling could take place only 125 miles from Florida.
The announcement was accompanied by other energy proposals that could placate environmental groups, including the ordering of 5,000 hybrid vehicles by the US government and tougher fuel effi-ciency standards for new cars.
During the 2008 election campaign, Mr Obama said that he backed expanded offshore drilling."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, June 4, 2010",PACIFIC ISLANDS ARE RISING TO CHALLENGE OF GLOBAL WARMING,Paul Chapman in Wellington,,"Scientists are surprised by the findings, which show some islands have grown by almost a third over the past 60 years.
Among the island chains to have increased in land area are Tuvalu and neighbouring Kiribati, both of which attracted attention at last year's CopenhagenÊclimateÊsummit.
The researchers say the findings challenged accepted views on the effects of global warming.
In the study, they compared aerial photographs and high-resolution satellite images of 27 islands taken since the 1950s. Only four, mostly uninhabited, had decreased in area despite local sea level rises of almost five inches, while 23 stayed the same or grew. Seven islands in Tuvalu grew, one by 30 per cent, although the study did not include the most populous island.
In Kiribati, three of the most densely populated islands, Betio, Bairiki and Nanikai, also grew by 12.5 to 30 per cent.
Prof Paul Kench, of Auckland University, who coauthored the study with Dr Arthur Webb, a Fiji-based expert on coastal processes, said the study challenged the view that the islands were sinking as a result of global warming.
""Eighty per cent of the islands we've looked at have either remained about the same or, in fact, got larger,"" Prof Kench told New Scientist magazine. ""Some have got dramatically larger. The physical foundations of these islands will still be there in 100 years.""
He said the study suggested the islands had a natural ability to respond to rising seas by accumulating coral debris from the surrounding reefs.
""It has long been thought that as the sea level goes up, islands will sit there and drown. But they won't,"" Prof Kench said.
The islands comprise mostly coral debris eroded from encircling reefs, which is pushed up on to the islands by wind and waves.
Because coral is a living organism, it continues to grow, so the process becomes continuous. Land reclamation and deposition of other sediment also contribute to the process.
""These islands are so low lying that in extreme events waves crash over the top of them,"" Prof Kench said. ""In doing that they transport sediment from the beach or adjacent reef and throw it on to the top of the island.""
But the two scientists said islanders still faced serious challenges fromÊclimateÊchange, particularly if the pace of sea level rises were to overtake that of sediment build-up.
The fresh groundwater that sustained villagers and their crops could be destroyed. ""The land may be there but will they still be able to support human habitation?"" Prof Kench said."

Under the last government, major legislation was introduced to cut carbon emissions in an effort to tackle global warming.
But the countryside continued to lose important wildlife such as farmland birds, meadows and bees.
Ben Stafford, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said the countryside had been ""neglected"".
""For the last few years,ÊclimateÊchange has been the sexy issue whereas protecting biodiversity was not politically exciting,"" he said.
The Coalition has promised to bring the focus back on to issues such as endangered animals and cleaner water.
The first environmental paper to be introduced by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in 20 years will focus on protecting the countryside. Helen Meech, from the National Trust, said some ""great legislation"" was brought in by the last government to cut greenhouse gases by 80 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050.
But there was a need for new laws to protect the environment that was suffering now, she said.
Honey bees are in crisis, 97 per cent of flower-rich meadows have been lost since 1930, and house sparrow numbers fell by 10 million in the past 25 years.

"Telegraph (London, UK)","Monday, December 13, 2010",CLIMATE CHANGE BACK FROM THE BRINK,Geoffrey Lean reports,,"The breakthrough - which Britain and the Prime Minister did much to bring about - came amid unprecedented scenes of enthusiasm and emotion in the early hours of Saturday morning, when tears flowed and thunderous ovations from almost all the representatives of the 194 nations gathered in the resort's sprawling Moon Palace hotel complex drowned out the last resistance from Left-wing Latin American states.
Less than 24 hours earlier the talks had been deadlocked. And for most of the preceding two weeks of talks the belief had grown that the 20-year-old, frequently sclerotic United Nations negotiations simply could not produce the kind of complex and far-reaching agreement needed to combat climate change.
Many warned that failure here, following the deeply disappointing result of last year's Copenhagen summit, would cause much of the world to give up on the process, casting doubt over the entire future of multilateral negotiations. Indeed, that very prospect - together with savvy, skilful chairmanship by the Mexican government - did more than anything to haul delegates back from the abyss and vindicate those, in Britain and abroad, who insisted that the international system could deliver after all.
The outcome, though it falls well short of what will be needed to avert dangerous climate change and will have to be confirmed and adopted at a future summit, is, as ministers pointed out yesterday, the most significant since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed 13 years ago, and is much more wide ranging. It calls for ""deep cuts"" in emissions, enshrining for the first time in a UN agreement that temperatures should be prevented from rising more than two degrees centigrade above preindustrial levels, and formalises reduction targets pledged by developing and industrialised nations alike. And it adds a broad list of other measures, including establishing a Green Climate Fund to help poor countries tackle global warming and a scheme for compensating countries that desist from felling their forests.
""This is way beyond what we were expecting,"" said Climate Secretary Chris Huhne, fortified by the three cans of Red Bull that had got him through the all-night session. ""It is a really important moment, a turning point in the long-running saga of international climate change negotiations.""
Difficult as they were, though, the talks took place in a more constructive, problem-solving atmosphere than anyone could remember as delegates recoiled from the acrimonious ambience of Copenhagen. Most remarkably, there was an unanticipated outbreak of amity between the United States and China, whose clashes lay at the heart of the denouement in the Danish capital.
Just a few weeks ago, the two carbon superpowers were still in combat, each trying to ensure the other was blamed for a breakdown. But here they rapidly reduced the differences between them; and others of last year's vociferous proponents also quietened down. As Elliot Diringer, of the Washington-based Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, put it: ""Everyone was a bit more comfortable seeing the two big elephants in the room playing nicely with each other.""
But trouble promptly arose from an unexpected quarter. Japan, which normally takes a low profile in international negotiations, announced that it would not ""on any conditions or under any circumstances"" accept new targets for emission reductions under the Kyoto Protocol when the existing ones end next year. The undiplomatic unconditionality of the statement seemed designed to kill the treaty before any new one could be in place, and was bound to inflame Third World countries for whom the protocol has totemic importance.
Developed and developing nations have long differed over extending the treaty, which applies only to industrialised countries - it was the main cause of conflict in Copenhagen - and the summit organisers had planned to postpone discussion until next year's meeting while seeking agreement on less contentious issues. Japan's move prevented this and threatened to destroy the whole negotiating process. Huhne was asked to intervene.
Day after day, he and Izabella Teixeira, the Brazilian environment minister, co-chaired delicate talks to try to find a solution, which repeatedly only narrowly avoided breakdown. ""It was a bit like that film Sliding Doors,"" Huhne says. ""There were three or four occasions when you realised that, if we made it on to the carriage, we had a chance of happy ending and, if not, disaster would ensue.""
Part of the problem was that the Japanese government appeared naively to have been persuaded by big business at home that it would get international credit for killing Kyoto and allowing a new ""negotiating paradigm"" somehow to emerge - whereas, in fact, it was courting condemnation to eclipse the obloquy it attracts for its whaling. At one stage, Huhne, a former journalist, warned its delegates from his 19 years' experience in the profession that they inevitably would be blamed if the talks broke down. David Cameron phoned his Japanese counterpart, Naoto Kan, and eventually a form of words was found that allowed the issue to be parked.
It almost didn't happen because, just at the most crucial moment, it seemed Huhne would have to fly home for the tuition-fees vote. The ticket booked, he was ready to go when Cameron and Nick Clegg decided that his work here was so important they would risk it without him.
While all this was going on, progress on almost every other issue was becoming deadlocked.
Finally, Patricia Espinosa, the Mexican foreign minister who chaired the conference, took the extraordinary step of calling meetings, open to all delegations, to try to find compromises. Astonishingly, under her leadership some 50 nations managed to hammer out a draft agreement that went further in tackling climate change than anyone thought possible.
Die-hard sceptics were suddenly left relying on Cuba, Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Evo Morales's Bolivia to block the breakthrough. The Left-wing alliance had been enough to deliver the coup de grace in Copenhagen, but this time only Bolivia withstood the tumultuous applause that greeted appeals from almost every other country to close the deal, and eventually Espinosa gavelled down its objections.
Most of the credit for the summit's success rests with her and the Mexican government's inclusive, flexible and open approach: they seemed to have studied the Danes' disastrous conduct of Copenhagen so as to do the precise opposite. Britain, which has spent years working with the Mexicans on the issue through its embassy, can also be well satisfied. But both also benefited from delegates' desperation to avoid the whole process collapsing, partly for the sake of the planet but partly too because their own jobs were at stake.
""Confidence has returned,"" says Calderon, and already previously dubious possibilities are opening up. Europe is now much more likely to increase its emission reductions, provoking others to follow suit. And developing countries like India are hinting, for the first time, that they, too, could accept legally binding targets.
Such progress is urgently needed, but there will need to be very much more - and further breakthroughs - before there is a new treaty strong enough to save the climate. At least there is now a chance that it may eventually come about."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, November 27, 2010",THIS MAN'S CAR IS ELECTRIFYING,Geoffrey Lean,,"The 42-year-old Israeli entrepreneur has set himself a modest goal: ending the burning of oil in the world's 700 million cars, which release a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions, while slashing the cost of motoring. And astonishingly, his plans have a good chance of succeeding. If they do, they could turn him into transport's Bill Gates - and make his fledgling Silicon Valley firm (called, as could only happen in California, Better Place) the world's biggest business.
An unrealistic dream? Some traditional car companies say so. But Agassi has raised $700 million in capital - including $125 million from HSBC - in the most difficult investmentÊclimateÊin decades. Renault-Nissan has committed to producing at least 100,000 of his electric cars, under the brand name ""Fluence"". And governments are fasttracking programmes to transform motoring.
Israel will be first on the road next year, aiming to eliminate petrol pumps by 2020. Denmark will launch its programme just months later. Australia is not far behind, while the Chinese government has just announced that it is providing $15 billion in seed money to build a world-beating electric car industry.
Agassi's secret, however, is more conceptual than technological: he will market cars like mobile phones. Just as consumers buy a number of minutes of call time, and receive a discounted handset, motorists will buy subscriptions based on the number of miles they drive, and get their electric car subsidised. The subscription gets them access to tens of thousands of charging points - including two personal ones, installed at their home and place of work - as well as a fully charged battery whenever their existing one goes flat.
These batteries are at the heart of Agassi's breakthrough, for they get round the two major limitations of electric cars: cost and range. His company will retain ownership of the batteries (which cost some GBP7,600 each), slashing the price of the rest of the car. If a vehicle reaches the end of its 100-mile range on a long journey, motorists can pop into a special service station where the batteries will be replaced by robots in less time than it now takes to fill the tank.
It's an exciting idea - and it all started when the entrepreneur, then shooting up the corporate ladder at the mammoth software company SAP, was asked, alongside other ""young leaders"" attending the 2005 World Economic Forum in Davos, to suggest a way of making the world a better place. He picked turning cars away from oil, not through government intervention, but by making them cheaper and more convenient without it.
For the next year, working at nights and weekends, he studied the fashionable ""solutions"", biofuels and hydrogen, before plumping for electricity. After another year developing his concept, he presented it at a Brookings Institution seminar attended by Shimon Peres, Israel's president. Inspired, Peres told him that his country - which has an obvious strategic interest in weaning itself off oil - would put the idea on the road if he could win over a major car manufacturer and raise $200 million. Carlos Ghosn, the president and chief executive of Renault-Nissan, saw the opportunity and took the risk - and the money flowed in.
The system has just been successfully tested with Tokyo taxis, which are almost continually on the go. Commercial operations are expected to start in Israel at the end of next year, and in Denmark in early 2012. Both are small countries, where journeys are short - but Australia thinks the idea will work along its east coast, where it plans to build a chain of battery-switching stations.
Running on electricity, Agassi says, will be cheaper than using petrol, even in the US. Most of the difference will be used to subsidise the cars, to make them cheaper than traditional equivalents. He believes that the ""tipping point will come when a new electric vehicle costs less than a threeyear-old petrol one. He expects the Chinese to achieve that by 2015, at which point the whole thing would go critical.
Of course, theÊclimateÊdoes not benefit from electric cars if the electricity comes from burning fossil fuels - but Agassi's plans suit renewables well, because they help to offset their intermittency. The cars would mostly recharge at night, when wind is often stronger but its electricity is unused. And the batteries could even be used to store power, sending some back to the grid when supplies are low.
If it works, the potential is mindboggling. ""I didn't start out to create the biggest company on earth,"" Agassi tells me. But he believes that his plan to help save the world might - as a byproduct - do just that."

""The character of weather is changing,"" said Dr Betsy Weatherhead, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Colorado and the lead author of the report.
She said ""persistence"" - the tendency of weather to remain stable for a few days at a time - was decreasing across the Arctic, but was on the increase in more temperate zones.
""At mid-latitudes, we're getting a lot more persistent weather,"" she said.
The findings will not surprise Britons after a winter that saw one of the most protracted cold spells in 30 years.
However, the suggestion Britain's weather is becoming more predictable may not chime with the Met Office, which has abandoned long-range forecasts after last year's ""barbecue summer"" prophecy saw rainfall and ridicule in equal measure.
Meteorologists said the findings underlined the need for more research into fluctuations in patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation, the latter of which was blamed for Britain's cold winter by pushing colder air southwards from its usual course.
Philip Eden, The Daily Telegraph weather correspondent, said: ""Persistence is a fundamental part of all regional climatologies, and it surprises me that people have not been analysing it until now.""
Dr Weatherhead's study was prompted by an apparent disparity between temperature data and reports from Inuit communities that increasingly unpredictable weather was endangering the livelihood of hunters.
""We know that things pass and there's a natural time spell to it,"" she said. ""We know that a cold spell doesn't last half a day, for instance."" Analysis of hourly weather logs for May and June in two such communities confirmed that, while the weather wasn't necessarily unusual, the speed of changes had grown over the past four decades.
""We had always had the data, we just hadn't asked the right question,"" said Dr Weatherhead. Dr Stephen Dorling, a senior lecturer in meteorology at the University of East Anglia in Norwich, said: ""Analysing hourly data is painstaking but much more research is needed before we can say for certain what the links are between weather in one area and weather in another.
""Many countries are in the middle latitudes, not just little old Britain.
We are still learning about oscillations and what they mean for ourÊclimateÊ- there is so much that we don't know.""

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Monday, May 3, 2010",WHY NEWÊCLIMATEÊLAW COULD BE A CASUALTY,Alex Spillius,,"Congressmen have signalled that they are considering withdrawing tentative support for the White House'sÊclimateÊplans, which seek to limit emissions of carbon dioxide, because they currently includes offshore exploration plans.
A number of Democrats are among those threatening to take back their support, including two of New Jersey's congressmen and both of its senators.
""I think that's dead on arrival,"" said Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, one of the states whose coastlines will be affected by the disaster.
The proposals could eventually become a bill, which is expected to be sponsored by Democrats and Republicans. They have already been watered down from an earlier version and were already not certain to pass Congress in their current form, as there is stiff opposition to proposed limits on carbon emissions within the legislature.
The proposals aim to cut US production of greenhouse gases to 17 per cent less than 2005 levels by 2020, and would also expand domestic production of oil, natural gas and nuclear power.
President Barack Obama has already made a considerable concession to the petroleum industry when he recently opened up 500,000 sq miles of America's coastal waters to oil exploration, reversing a campaign promise in the process.
Though no further drilling had yet been approved, the White House has now emphasized that none will be until a thorough examination of what went wrong on the BP field has been carried out.
With the crisis escalating, environmental groups said the likelihood of further offshore exploration decreased by the day.
""When you're trying to resurrect aÊclimateÊbill that's face-down in the mud and you want to bring it back to life and get it breathing again, I don't think you can have offshore drilling against the backdrop of what's transpiring in the Louisiana wetlands,"" said Richard Charter, energy adviser to Defenders of Wildlife, an ecological campaign group.
""I think it's flat-lined."" David Jenkins, a spokesman for Republicans for Environmental Protection, said the politics were ""changing by the minute"" as the spreading slick threatens coastal states that traditionally support offshore drilling.
""If this plays out, how many politicians will be jumping up and saying they won't vote for this because it doesn't include offshore drilling?"" Mr Jenkins said.
Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, however, said that he had not wavered in his support.
""We've had problems with car design, but you don't stop driving,"" he said.
A White House spokesman has said that Mr Obama remains committed, at least for now, to plans to expand drilling.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, July 2, 2010",' THE EU'S RESPONSE TO GLOBAL WARMING IS A COSTLY MISTAKE ',Bjorn Lomborg,,"One bright spot is that politicians remain committed to responding to global warming. Unfortunately, their plans do not withstand scrutiny. New research shows that the EU's ""20/20/20"" policy, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 (and ensure 20 per cent renewable energy), will cost hundreds of billions of euros but yield only tiny benefits. The UK alone will be hit to the tune of an annual 35 billion euros (GBP28 billion).
As a cost-benefit analysis by theÊclimate-change economist Richard Tol shows, any single regional carbon-reduction scheme will have a very small effect on emissions and temperature rises across the globe. That's not an argument against ever implementing one: but it means that it's crucial that the numbers stack up.
The EU recently stated that it would cost GBP39 billion a year to meet its emissions target. That figure is implausibly optimistic. Averaging out the best-regarded economic models shows that, even if politicians got their policies exactly right, the cost would come to at least GBP90 billion a year.
And Europe has not got it exactly right. Instead, it has made things worse, by introducing additional red tape, complication and constraints - in particular, that 20 per cent renewable-energy target. This is expensive because popular ""green"" energy sources such as wind and solar power cost more than replacing coal with gas. As a result, the real cost of EU policy is likely to be as much as GBP170 billion.
In his study for the Copenhagen Consensus Centre, Tol assessed the net economic benefits of this policy. Using the conventional estimate that one ton of carbon dioxide is likely to cause about $7 (GBP4.50) of damage, he found that the total benefit of the EU policy was just GBP5.7 billion. In other words, every euro spent is likely to generate just three cents' worth of benefits. My research shows that by the end of this century, the EU's approach will reduce temperature rises by approximately 0.05C - almost too small to measure.
The tragedy is that the EU could do much better for the world, and for itself. For far less than GBP8 billion a year the EU could halve the incidence of malaria, provide micronutrients (particularly vitamin A and zinc) to 80 per cent of the world's undernourished children and prevent a million deaths from TB.
EU leaders should not abandon the fight againstÊclimateÊchange. But instead of wasting vast sums on a pointless policy, they should invest in developing green-energy alternatives. The reason it costs so much to reduce carbon emissions is that the green alternatives aren't close to being ready to replace oil and other fossil fuels. Change this, by investing in R&D, and the global impasse overÊclimateÊchange disappears. If we had affordable green-energy sources, everyone - including China and India - would buy them, and long-term emissions would drop significantly.
What Europe must not do is continue to barrel down a path that makes no economic sense. Yet it seems committed to its reckless course. The European Commission wants to toughen the carbon-reduction target to 30 per cent below 1990 levels - which Tol calculates would cost roughly GBP370 billion a year, twice as much as the existing plans. The effect, over the next 90 years, would be to reduce temperatures by an additional one-hundredth of a degree.
Expensive, poorly conceived carbon-emission plans such as the EU's will cause major economic damage and political strife, while doing little to slow global warming. Europe must change course.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, September 15, 2010","CLIMATEÊGATE INQUIRIES WERE FLAWED, SAYS LAWSON",Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"Sceptics claim emails stolen from the University of East Anglia last year showed scientists were willing to manipulate data to show a rise in global temperatures since the industrial era. Three official inquiries were launched by the university and the House of Commons that concluded the scientists did nothing wrong.
But a report by the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank set up by Lord Lawson, now claims that the inquiries were ""rushed and seriously inadequate"".
Lord Lawson said the ""defective"" nature of the inquiries left doubts about the science behind proof of man-made global warming.
""When the UEA emails were leaked it cast a huge cloud of doubt over the whole issue ofÊclimateÊchange,"" he said. ""This was why the inquiries were set up, to allay that doubt. But the defective nature of the inquiries [means that] from the point of view of the public, these inquiries have not succeeded in putting to rest the concerns.""
The emails showed Prof Phil Jones, the head of the Climatic Research Unit, refusing to give information aboutÊclimateÊchange data and discussing plans to alter charts.
The House of Commons science and technology committee, a study by Lord Oxburgh and an independent inquiry by Sir Muir Russell, a former senior civil servant, all found the UEA science was sound, although the university was criticised for lack of transparency.
A report for Lord Lawson's think tank by Andrew Mont-ford, a well known blogger, said the inquiries failed to ask the opinions of sceptics. He also said they failed to probe allegations of fraud in scientific papers."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, May 22, 2010",THERE CAN BE NO ART WITHOUT SCIENCE,Lorna Bradbury,,"McEwan is taking questions at the end of a lecture he has given to the Royal Society of Literature on Darwin and Einstein and the ways in which notions of ""originality"" might relate to the sciences compared with the arts.
""I want to try and usefully blur the distinctions between the two realms,"" McEwan tells me the next morning. ""On the one hand there is a scientific tradition. Scientists do stand on the shoulders of giants, just as do writers. Conversely, in the arts we do make discoveries. We do refine our tools. So I am arguing with, or at least playing with, the idea that art never improves.""
McEwan is rare among his peers in taking an active interest in the sciences -- and in welcoming scientific ideas into his fiction. ""I'm not interested in a form of modern intellectual who has no interest in science,"" he says. Since he wrote Black Dogs (1992), which used a failing marriage to dramatise the argument between rationalism and faith, rationalist ideas have won out, and have often been the driving force of his novels.
In Enduring Love (1997), a science writer was stalked by a delusional man. Saturday (2005) featured a neurosurgeon, Henry Perowne, who tried to protect his family from a violent intruder. And McEwan's new novel, Solar, fashions a dark satire out of the most trumpeted scientific issue of the day: global warming. The novel is steeped in research, and uses a technology -- artificial photosynthesis -- that is not yet a reality but is within our grasp. But its brilliance stems from the fact that it does not preach.
McEwan might, like his ""liberal arts, know-nothing friends"", as he puts it, feel gloomy aboutÊclimateÊchange, but he is as comfortable sending up the scientific optimists, in the form of the anti-hero, Michael Beard -- a deeply flawed philanderer and professional chancer -- as he is the politicians, or the industrialists, or the journalists caught up in the story.
""It should simply be an empirical matter whether theÊclimateÊis changing or not and whether we're responsible,"" he says. ""But the various sides of the debate have now become so tribal that it's no longer a matter of changing our views as more information comes in.""
Solar received glowing reviews and was warmly received by scientists, too. McEwan tells me that Graham Farmelo, the biographer of the theoretical physicist Paul Dirac, wrote to him to express his admiration for the novel, ""but there was a word or two he would change in the description of Dirac's work. I ran it past a physicist friend who said it was a bit hairsplitting, but, yes, OK, change it,"" he says, at once humble in the face of proper science and pleased with the scientific accuracy of his own formulations.
But the novel has suffered at the hands of the American literary establishment, with the influential critic Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times dismissing it as one of McEwan's ""lesser efforts"".
""It was horrible,"" McEwan says. ""They didn't get it at all."" I ask whether their response has to do with the subject matter - maybe American critics felt unwilling to read a comedy dealing with such weighty matters? But McEwan says it has more to do with formal than political concerns, comparing his experience with the dismissal by Americans of late-period John Updike, who is quoted in the epigraph and whose Rabbit Angstrom is the inspiration for Michael Beard. ""Americans don't like an unattractive character who is not redeemed at the centre of a novel,"" he says. ""And maybe it's a matter of British humour too. Our comic writers - Michael Frayn, for example, Evelyn Waugh initially, Malcolm Bradbury certainly - were never really warmly received in the States.""
As McEwan argued in his lecture, we might think of Einstein and Darwin battling to be the first to get their theories into print, but this notion isn't at odds with literature either. It might not have been artistically important that Solar emerged as the first book in a no-doubt blossoming literature ofÊclimateÊchange, but it can't have done it any harm.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Thursday, May 27, 2010",A SUMMER OF' 76 EVERY DECADE (MET OFFICE PREDICTS),Louise Gray Environment correspondent,,"Then the forecasters at the Met Office told the public to prepare for a mild winter. It was one of the coldest on record.
Undeterred by the critical reaction, the organisation is looking ahead again, to predict long, hot, dry summers every decade.
Extreme droughts could become 10 times as frequent as now because ofÊclimateÊchange, meteorologists warned in a report yesterday.
The weather will be similar to 1976, the hottest summer since British records began, when temperatures reached 95F (36C), rivers and lakes dried out and the south of the country experienced forest fires.
Critics suggested that the predictions, looking ahead 90 years to the turn of the century, should be ""taken with a pinch of salt"".
In the aftermath of last year's seasonal forecasts, the Met Office was criticised for handing out GBP12million in bonuses to staff over five years and was even rumoured to be likely to lose its contract with the BBC for the first time.
Since then, seasonal predictions have been quietly dropped in favour of updating the forecast every month.
But the government agency, which is part of the Ministry of Defence, is still producing ""long range"" studies. The latest looks at the likelihood of a recurrence of 1976.
Currently, such prolonged dry spells occur every 50 to 100 years.
But even in what the authorities regard as the best case scenario forÊclimateÊchange in Britain - in which average temperatures rise by about 3.6F (2C) - droughts would become more frequent.
In the Met Office's worst case scenario, temperatures could reach 7.2F (4C) above average, summer rain would be less frequent and droughts could occur every 10 years.
They could be even worse than 1976, when some areas had no rain for months, elderly people were taken to hospital with heat exhaustion and domestic water supplies had to be restricted.
Eleanor Burke,ÊclimateÊextremes scientist with the Met Office, said Britain had to prepare. This could include designing buildings to cope with heat, producing emergency plans in hospitals and schools, growing heat resistant crops like vines and, of course, hosepipe bans.
""Severe droughts have a big impact - causing water shortages, health risks, fire hazards, crop failure and subsidence. Understanding how the frequency of these events will change is therefore very important to planning for the future,"" she said.
Jonathan Powell, of Positive Weather Solutions, said the weather would continue to oscillate as it was now controlled more by pressure systems than global warming. ""Not long ago the Met Office were saying summers would be wet and cloudy over the next 80 years, so it seems like a complete reversal,"" he said. ""I would take anything they say with a pinch of salt.""
Despite the ""ice cream weather"" last weekend, it is predicted to be cooler and wet over the next few days.
On the bright side, if this is a hot summer there should be plenty of places to swim. The Environment Agency has secured GBP4billion of investment by water companies to improve bathing water quality in 160 sites in England."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, September 18, 2010",BRITAIN'S BIG PROBLEM WITH WATER,Geoffrey Lean,,"That seems pretty improbable. After all, ours is a notoriously soggy nation where it often seems that, as Shakespeare put it, ""the rain it raineth every day"". But it's true. South-east England has less water per capita than the countries above.
Partly, that's because we are two nations when it comes to the weather. The North and West normally get plenty of rain - often more than they want - but the South and East receive less than some parts of the Mediterranean. Added to which, it's the most heavily populated part of the country.
Things are only going to get worse. Another one and half million homes have been planned for the overcrowded region over the next 15 years. And global warming is expected to sharpen the dampness divide over the next 70, increasing rainfall sharply in the wet part of the country and cutting it by as much as half in the South and East.
An Institute for Public Policy Research study has predicted permanent water-rationing in the South East by 2025. And last week Lord Krebs - launching another report - suggested that families should face extra charges for using it excessively.
The report, by the Government's Committee onÊClimateÊChange, looks at how well-prepared Britain is for the effects of global warming. Almost all official efforts so far have gone into trying to minimise them, by restraining emissions of carbon dioxide, for example. But, as the report concludes, someÊclimateÊchange is now inevitable.
Average annual temperatures in Britain have already risen by about a degree Celcius since the 1970s, and could increase by some four degrees in southern England by 2080.
Extreme heatwaves - like the one that killed 2,000 people in Britain in 2003 - are ""likely to become the norm"". Sea levels are expected to rise - by at least 16in near London, for example - and droughts and extreme downpours to increase.
As the South East gets drier, the damper part of the country is likely to suffer increasing floods, with ""extremely wet winters"" up to five times more common. Already flooding is twice as frequent as it was 100 years ago, and the Environment Agency expects it to increase tenfold over coming decades.
Yet half of all the housing built in Britain since the Second World War - covering a total area the size of the West Midlands - has been plonked down on land prone to inundation. Successive governments have neglected flood defences; when the big 2007 floods came, only about half were in good condition. A government study headed by the former chief scientist, Sir David King, estimated that the cost of damage could rise from an average of around GBP2 billion a year to more than GBP25 billion by 2080. And the Association of British Insurers suggested that new houses in the Thames Gateway should be built with their living areas on the first floor.
Lord Krebs last week suggested that houses should also be fitted with shutters to help them keep cool, that millions of trees should be planted in streets to make them bearable to walk in, and that roads should be given new surfaces that will not melt in the heat. Hospitals and other vital buildings should be built on high ground and railways and other essential infrastructure protected from flooding.
In all, the report says, such precautionary measures would halve the ill-effects of the moderate amount of warming that might be expected if governments took urgent steps to reduce emissions (at higher temperatures such adaptation will be much harder if not impossible). But so far little is being done.
It found that only seven per cent of local authorities had plans to cope withÊclimateÊchange - and none had begun to implement them - while few businesses had made any preparations, even though 87 per cent of top companies believed that they were exposed to risks from global warming. And only six per cent of families in flood-prone areas were taking action to protect their homes.
There are a few encouraging signs.
Water companies are taking some measures to conserve supplies and councils are finally beginning to take flood risk seriously in planning decisions. But we have hardly begun.
And yet it should be relatively easy to agree on action. Even many people who do not believe that humanity is causing global warming do accept that things are hotting up. Keeping Britain pleasant, after all, should not be left to the Greens."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Thursday, March 18, 2010",HOW BRITAIN MUST LIVE TO HITÊCLIMATEÊTARGETS,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"The Royal Academy of Engineering, which set out how Britain could cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, said that even if electricity needs fell, the Government would still have to engage in ""the biggest programme of investment and social change the UK has ever seen"" over the next four decades.
The report assumed that the maximum level of renewable electricity would be installed, including 9,600 wind turbines on land and 10,000 at sea.
The Severn Barrage would have to go ahead as well as 1,000 miles of wave machines and further installations for tidal power. Most of the country's 25million households would need solar panels and to replace boilers with pumps taking heat from the air or ground.
The country would need to build 40 low-carbon power stations such as nuclear, or coal with carbon capture and storage that kept carbon dioxide underground. The transport sector would have to run on electricity from renewables or low-carbon energy such as nuclear, meaning a national network of charging points.
The authors compared the scale of the challenge with the Victorians building the sewerage system or the manufacture of Spitfires in the Second World War, and warned of blackouts without a large infrastructure programme. The Royal Society, the national academy of science, has begun a study into ""geoengineering"".
It fears measures to stopÊclimateÊchange, such as launching mirrors into space to reflect the sun's heat, or fertilising the oceans to grow algae to absorb more CO2, could harm the wider environment."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, April 3, 2010",WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GREEN TORIES?,Geoffrey Lean,,"My companion - female, I hasten to say - was not being sexist, but making the point that one way of finding an idea whose time has come is to see where the smartest young people are to be found. For it was not just the women: the launch of the Conservative Environment Network, at the Saatchi brothers' London offices last month, was awash with the formidably intelligent and frighteningly youthful of both sexes. Rarely have I felt so old, or so dim.
Yet scanning the room, something was missing - the Tory leadership. There was no Oliver Letwin, their verifiably verdant policy chief; no George Osborne, who has promised to make the Treasury ""a green ally, not a foe""; no William Hague, despite a recent speech identifyingÊclimateÊchange as one of his two main foreign policy priorities; and, above all, no David Cameron, arguably the most environmentally friendly party leader to date.
The young organisers of the new green ginger group were disappointed: so much did they value visible top-level endorsement that they were even hoping, in vain, to bag Iain Duncan Smith. True, the shadow environment andÊclimateÊchange secretaries did tip up - but they could scarcely have stayed away.
It was strange, for the occasion exhibited exactly the new face of Toryism of which Cameron dreamt on becoming leader. In his early years, you could hardly keep him away from green gatherings: indeed, he and David Miliband first met socially in a doorway, as one entered, and the other left, a Friends of the Earth shindig. That was when he transformed the Tories' logo into a squiggle representing a sturdy British oak, visited the Arctic to hug a husky and deplore global warming, and campaigned in the local elections under the slogan: ""Vote blue, go green.""
The absence of the party's lions from that launch has not been the only sign of the browning of its priorities. There is no mention of the environment in the six things the party says it ""stands for"" on its website. And in last week's Ask the Chancellors debate the only mention of greenery that I heard came - unexpectedly - from Alistair Darling.
If you raise all this with top Tories, as I did last week, you are asked, in effect: ""Don't you realise there's an election on?"" The leadership now has far less time to attend events, you are told, and the environment always loses priority as polling day approaches, partly because it rarely comes up on the doorstep.
It is true that voters in Britain tend not to see green issues as political ones, not least because the policies of the major parties have normally been broadly similar. Nor, it appears, has Cameron's commitment dimmed. He insisted on personally launching his party's new energy policy document - probably the greenest and most comprehensive yet produced by a major party - 10 days ago, and more is promised. ""Judge us by our manifesto,"" one senior Conservative source says. ""It will be the most radical and serious green plan ever put before the electorate by any of the great parties.""
If so, the Tories would benefit from talking about it. Concentrating on conventional economic politics over the past few months - and on projecting Cameron as a tough leader for hard times - could have been more successful: in a sharp reversal, many more people now trust Labour on the economy. Millions still feel, especially after its recent gyrations over cuts, that they do not know what the party stands for, and fewer than two in five Britons believe it shares their values.
One thing the public thought they knew about Cameron was that he was green, thanks to his early emphasis on the environment. Downplaying this now adds to the confusion over the Conservative message, and even raises suspicions of Blairite insincerity.
Though it is rarely top-of-mind on the doorstep, poll after poll shows that the environment is central to voters' value judgments: politicians now have to have credible green policies - just as they do defence ones - to be electable. And despite theÊclimatescience furore and the failure of Copenhagen, global warming remains a surprisingly potent issue politically: a new poll carried out for the Institute of Public Policy Research shows that it is among the key vote-deciding issues for 17 per cent of the electorate in marginal constituencies, and especially important among swing voters and under-35s.
The Tories, moreover, have done the work on how to bring about lowcarbon prosperity. Though all the main parties now support what now looks like becoming the next big economic theme, they have the most thorough and thought-out policies. That is what is attracting the bright and the young. So why is the leadership so bashful?"
"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)","Tuesday, March 23, 2010",THE BIG IDEA,Roger Highfield,,"Today, at the Royal Society in London, Prof Palmer has gathered experts to discuss how we should handle uncertainties. Among them is Lord May, who put chaos theory into biology.
Chaos rules the weather.
One can appreciate this with a mathematical structure called a Lorenz attractor, named after an American meteorologist. The lines depicting this structure never repeat their trajectory, just as the weather varies from day to day, but overall the lines form an owl-eye shape, just as our climate has regularities, notably warm summers and cold winters.
Although chaos theory limits the accuracy of weather predictions, we can still understand factors that influence the climate such as the greenhouse effect, predicted in 1827 by the French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768-1830). The name arises because, like glass in a greenhouse, gases such as carbon dioxide and water vapour let solar energy in to warm the Earth but also trap some of the planet's heat. Without greenhouse gases, the ground temperature would be 30C lower.
The uncertainty in predictions of global warming have not changed much since pioneering work by the American Jule Charney in the Seventies, when he worked out the possible impact of climate change. His lower limit estimates - of 1.5 deg warming for a doubling of carbon dioxide levels - are similar to those from the latest climate models.
There is little uncertainty when it comes to explaining why the Earth is warming, says Prof Palmer. The big question is what happens next. Some scientists fear apocalyptic scenarios, others believe the change will be smooth. All agree, however, that there are major holes in our understanding.
""What has been naggingly difficult has been working out the upper limit of possible warming,"" says Prof Palmer. There is much debate among scientists, but among the public this comes over as ""you are either a believer or non-believer in climate change, which is a false dichotomy"".
There is endless pressure to simplify, he says. PR disasters such as the Met's seasonal forecast can result when uncertainty is rendered down to a soundbite. The Met had said it was ""odds-on for a barbecue summer"" in its press release, which had a greater ring of certainty than the actual 50 per cent probability of aboveaverage temperatures. Similarly, although the winter had a 50 per cent chance of being milder, there was a 20 per cent chance of being colder.
This month the Met Office abandoned these forecasts, where many variations on the same computer model of the climate are run to produce a fuzzy ""ensemble"" of forecasts, a method Prof Palmer popularised in New Scientist back in 1989. Palmer believes they are still valid. ""The Met has been criticised too much.""
Uncertainty is a part of everyday life. ""The big issue is this,"" Prof Palmer explains. ""When it comes to a catastrophic 4 deg average global warming, how big a probability would the public have to be faced with to back taking drastic action?"" The failure to make the uncertainties of climate change crystal clear may be another reason why public confidence in climate science has slumped.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Monday, November 8, 2010",GREENS COME TO SEE THE ERROR OF THEIR WAYS,Charles Moore Reviews,,"This was no such programme. Instead, it was a platform for every sinner that repenteth. Former hippy Greens, directors of Greenpeace, the chairmen of the CopenhagenÊClimateÊCouncil and the like, queued up to admit error. Their reasons for doing so were interesting. None of them repudiated all their previous ideas. All continue to believe that there are serious environmental threats to the welfare of life on earth and most seem to be devoting their lives to addressing them. But, as one put it, environmentalists over the past 40 years have ""failed to achieve Job One, which was to protect the planet"".
At least three central reasons were identified.
Misanthropy. According to a veteran American Green, Stewart Brand, too many Greens believe ""Nature good - humans not so good"". This approach is ultimately unpersuasive, since it is human beings you are trying to persuade. A policy focused on preventing human activity is one which defies human nature. Mark Lynas, one of the repenters, was shown in his younger days stuffing a custard pie into the face of the environmental sceptic Bjorn Lomborg. Now, he admits with shame, he was ''motivated by a sense of righteousness'' which was self-regarding.
Exaggeration. If you say that the end of the world is nigh all the time, people start to disbelieve you. Paul Ehrlich talked utter rubbish about how the world would starve in the 1970s. A glorious clip showed a young but authoritative Magnus Magnusson explaining against a backdrop of artificial snow that ""the new Ice Age"" was upon us. Green activists give out the figure of 93,000 for deaths attributable to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. The figure favoured by the recent UN investigation is 65. The idea that there are only a few months or years left to save the planet is both so discouraging and so untrue that it disables the cause it is supposed to galvanise. ""We have got some time,"" said Tim Flannery of the CopenhagenÊClimateÊCouncil, with heretical courage.
Damage. The most powerful part of the programme was that arguing that the Green obsession with banning and preventing things has done actual harm. The refusal to contemplate nuclear power has encouraged more use of fossil fuels and therefore - if you believe the warmist theories - more adverseÊclimateÊchange. The banning of pesticides has led to the deaths of millions of Africans from malaria. The obsessive hatred of GM crops led, in 2002, to the Zambian government refusing US supplies of GM food sent to relieve its people's starvation.
The ""precautionary principle"", upon which environmentalists say we should operate when considering scientific innovation, turns out to be one which would deny to countries like China, India or Kenya the chance to escape the poverty which the West has put behind it for more than half a century. These nations, anxious to feed themselves better, resent Green lectures. Developing countries such as these form 80 per cent of the world's population, so Green arguments are least accepted in the places where, environmentalists say, they are most needed.
Another aspect of the damage done is the effect of fear. After Chernobyl, local people, told that their children would be deformed, had huge numbers of abortions. Their levels of alcoholism and stress rose appallingly. Even in Britain, we all know people whose lives are blighted by unnecessary anxiety about the world boiling, flooding, melting down etc. It is a terrible thing to frighten people for no good reason.
Out of all this breast-beating came hope. The rueful campaigners of yesteryear now see science and technology as their friend. We can produce nuclear power much more safely than in the past. In California, ""geo-engineering"" is being developed so that humans will be able to change the weather one way to correct it if they have already changed it too far the other. We might be able to blow up a volcano ''on purpose'' to slow down global warming. We are already perfecting GM rice which can ''hold its breath'' under water for two weeks, and so survive flooding.
Natural conservatives are always suspicious of the phrase ""win-win"" (so many situations turn out to be ""lose-lose""), so I was not persuaded that all will be well. There is surely a conflict between economic growth and the environment which will never go away. It was in the interests of the ex-radicals, many of whom now work for businesses in the energy field, to be cheerful. But their views seemed infinitely more realistic than the orthodoxies they once espoused.
If the drift of this programme is correct, the consequences for politics will be large. All the main political parties have chosen to put their eggs in the frail, Fairtrade, hand-weaved basket of Greenery, imposing rising levies to develop ""renewable"" sources of power which cannot do the job demanded of them. The basket is starting to break. There will be a political prize, I suspect, for the first party which dares to put its eggs elsewhere."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, May 7, 2010",SUMMER IS STARTING 18 DAYS EARLIER,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"They found summer temperatures, averaging at least 57F (14C) for three days in a row, now occur in early May rather than mid June. Summer flowers such as geraniums and roses are coming out three days earlier than in the past, the study found.
The team attributed the changes to global warming and warned that the early onset of summer could cause prolonged droughts and problems for wildlife. Previous studies have shown that spring is coming earlier and autumn later but this is the first paper to look at summer.
Prof Grant Bigg, the lead author of the study which was published in the journal Climatic Change, looked at temperatures from 1954 to 2007. Although he found the day on which summer arrives fluctuates each year, on average it is starting earlier. By the 1990s, summer temperatures had advanced by 11 days, compared with the period 1954-1963 when the season arrived on May 25. By the beginning of this decade, the season was arriving 18 days earlier on average.
This means that summer should be beginning in Britain today - May 7. Prof Bigg explained that it would be a little later this year as a result of the cold winter. He also said early summers did not necessarily mean temperatures would be hot throughout the season, although there are expected to be more heatwaves in the future. ""This particular year is a little bit later, but on average this period in May has become much warmer than it has been for the last few decades,"" he said.
Traditionally the British summer begins on June 21 with the summer solstice. The Met Office counts June through to August as summer. Forecasters predict the weather will remain cloudy and fairly cool for the next few days, with showers across the country.
ClimateÊPoliticians use 'McCarthy tactics'
LEADING scientists have demanded an end to the persecution ofÊclimateÊchange experts. In a letter in the journal Science, members of the US National Academy of Sciences said: ""We call for an end to McCarthy-like threats against colleagues, the harassment of scientists by politicians seeking to avoid taking action, and the outright lies being spread about them."" A 10-year plan is vital to stop wildlife disappearing, said an international conservation group."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, November 12, 2010","WORLD IS FACING FISH AND FRESH WATER CRISES, SAYS PRINCE",Daily Telegraph Reporter,,"The Prince also highlighted specific environmental issues, warning that the collapse of threatened fish stocks would be ""catastrophic"" for billions of people, and that the planet only had a ""finite"" fresh water supply.
His comments were made last night during an address at St James's Palace to leading executives before a business conference organised by KPMG.
The Prince said that if society failed to see the risk it faced by ""over-utilising the world's natural capital"" serious problems would be encountered in the future. ""We will see much more economic disruption and much more human deprivation and misery than we did after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on Sept 15 2008.""
The Prince has made a number of speeches about the problems facing the planet, fromÊclimateÊchange to other issues, such as the felling of the rainforests.
He has also set out his views on how to live sustainably in his book Harmony, co-written with Tony Juniper, the leading environmentalist and Ian Skelly, the broadcaster.
The Prince also spoke about the problems caused by unsustainable agriculture, claiming that ""a staggering 35 tons of fresh water is needed to make a single ton of artifi-cial fertiliser"".
He added: ""It is worth, perhaps, remembering that the total amount of water circulating throughout the world is in fact finite and yet, at the same time, there are currently one billion people who are chronically undernourished, who live on less than a dollar a day and who have no access to any clean water whatsoever.""
Directing his attention to global fish stocks, the Prince said: ""The impact of the collapse of fish stocks on the 200million people employed in the world's fisheries and on the billions of people who depend upon fish as a major source of their dietary protein will be catastrophic. And bearing in mind the way we are going, this will happen."""
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, October 30, 2010",CENTURY OF DEVELOPMENT,Professor Stephen Glaister,,"Fast forward 100 years or so and we are in a similar position, though this time the necessity to beatÊclimateÊchange is the mother of invention, rather than big business.
As an independent motoring think tank, the RAC Foundation sees the ""greening"" of the automotive sector as probably the most important research topic. Which is why we are backing the Future Car Challenge.
It is fitting we are working alongside two other organisations that carry the same illustrious initials and to whom we have historic links. Who better to run the Challenge than the Royal Automobile Club; a body inextricably linked with the development of personal travel? RAC Motoring Services have also been progressive enough to support and promote the new generation of eco-friendly vehicles. The company's participation should be reassuring, because drivers need to know not only that they can buy green vehicles but that they can then fuel and insure them and get them fixed should they break down.
The especially encouraging aspect of the FCC is that most of the cars on display are not prototypes but real models that are already in the showrooms, or will be soon.
By 2050 the Government must cut the UK's greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent - this is a legal requirement under theÊClimateÊChange Act. Progress has already been made and not at the expense of the freedom to travel we individually and collectively rely on.
Over the past decade exhaust emissions of CO2 have been reduced by 20 per cent. How? Through the refinement of existing petrol and diesel engines. Vauxhall's ecoFLEX, VW's BlueMotion and Ford's ECOnetic are three of the technologies demonstrating this as manufacturers close in on and beat the magic 100g/km of CO2. Making cars lighter and smaller will also help reduce energy usage.
Yet so great is the challenge that ultimately a sea change will be required in the way the cars we drive are powered. Which technology will become dominant is far from clear. Electric cars have taken an early lead but hydrogen vehicles and those using bio-fuels also have their fans. And who is to say solar-powered cars won't have a part to play? Before all this, hybrids will make an important contribution, combining two or more fuel technologies to achieve big savings in energy consumption. Indeed they already are. Witness the successful petrol/electric Toyota Prius.
But ""greening"" the car fleet is no small feat and does not currently come cheap. There are 27 million cars registered in the UK. Of these you can count the ultra-low carbon models on the fingers of one hand; an exaggeration, perhaps, but it makes the point. Mass production should help bring down the cost to the consumer. So too will the GBP43 million the Government is setting aside next year to offer grants of up to GBP5,000 to those buying the most environmentally friendly cars.
In 1896 pioneering motorists held the first emancipation run to mark the de-regulation of motoring. It was a milestone in the automotive annals. In so many respects the Future Car Challenge deserves similar recognition.
See telegraph.co.uk/motoring for full reviews of many of the cars taking part in the RAC Future Car Challenge, as well as news and features on ""green"" motoring."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, October 19, 2010",PUBLIC TO PAY FOR NEW NUCLEAR ERA,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"Chris Huhne, the Energy andÊClimateÊChange Secretary, said nuclear power would be a key part of the energy mix over the next 40 years.
He announced eight sites around the country where nuclear power stations could be built.
However, there are concerns about the cost of cleaning up radioactive waste. Britain is already paying out up to GBP100billion to decommission the nuclear power stations currently in use.
Mr Huhne said there would be no public subsidy for new nuclear reactors. But he said the Government would have to take on liability for both accidents and cleaning up the radioactive waste, so that power companies were confident of investing in the new technology.
The upper limit on what can be paid out by power companies in case of an accident could be raised to up to GBP1billion.
The Government will take ultimate responsibility for clearing up the waste in case the power companies go bust, although Mr Huhne insisted that businesses would be asked to put aside enough funds to pay for this.
""We are not ruling out action by the Government to take on financial risks or liabilities for which it is appropriately compensated or for which there are corresponding benefits,"" he said.
Prof Gordon MacKerron, of the Sussex Energy Group, a research body, said power companies would be asked to pay into a decommissioning fund. ""There is a risk that taxpayers get landed with the bill if companies go bankrupt,"" he said.
Mike Childs, of Friends of the Earth, said the public could end up paying billions to clean up power stations because there was unlikely to be enough in the decommissioning fund. ""Nuclear power is not the solution to tacklingÊclimateÊchange -- it would leave us saddled with toxic waste for centuries to come,"" he said."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, September 17, 2010",THE MEEK SEEM TO HAVE INHERITED WESTMINSTER,Andrew Gimson Comons Sketch,,"Yet when Ed Miliband appeared yesterday morning in the Chamber, he did not even look out of breath. Nor did he liven things up by wearing a yellow jersey, like the leader of the Tour de France. Mr Miliband was clad in a white shirt, a dark suit and a light purple tie: standard gear for running against his brother.
Chris Huhne, the Secretary of State for Energy andÊClimateÊChange, observed that ""we're not a very sunny country"", which means that solar panels work twice as well in Arizona.
We hoped this might be the cue for Mr Miliband to announce that if he becomes leader, his policy will be to make the country sunnier, though maybe not as sunny as Arizona.
But Mr Miliband is a more cautious politician than he likes to pretend, and stuck to the conventional line thatÊclimateÊchange is bad. He said he and Mr Huhne were ""in agreement about the importance of renewables"", but omitted to remind us that he himself counts as a renewable.
Mr Huhne regretted that ""renewables are more expensive at the moment than fossil fuels"". Mr Miliband used to work for Gordon Brown, a man who turned out to be one of the fossil fuels of politics. But Mr Miliband has striven in recent years to transcend his Brownite past and go greener than green, or at least greener than Mr Brown.
Mr Miliband accused Mr Huhne of a lack of enthusiasm, if not for saving the planet, then at least for getting the money to do so out of the Treasury. Mr Huhne said he was reminded by ""the passion"" of Mr Miliband's ""oratory"" that his adversary was trying to rustle up support in the Labour leadership race.
It is true that Mr Miliband had a slight go at Mr Huhne, even telling him at one point: ""I wasn't quite sure whether that was a yes or a no."" But there was much more piety than passion in Mr Miliband's remarks.
We waited in vain for anyone to say anything faintly passionate about energy security, fuel poverty or the transition to a low-carbon economy. The language was so earnest and managerial it was hard to imagine anyone who was not already a committed environmentalist getting in the slightest bit excited.
Perhaps that is what is wrong with the Labour leadership contest: too much pious repetition of conventional views and not enough passion.
At one point the Speaker, John Bercow, had to intervene to stop what sounded as if it was developing into a full-scale lecture by Mr Huhne on the state of the economy.
The Speaker got through all 20 questions on the Order Paper. But even this admirable performance failed to produce a sense of momentum."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, November 26, 2010",NOW GLOBAL WARMING IS SLOWER ... THANKS TO POLLUTION,Louise Gray Environment Correspondent,,"The world is pumping out so much pollution it is reflecting the sun's rays and causing a cooling effect.
The latest figures from more than 20 scientific institutions around the world show that temperatures are higher than ever.
However, the gradual rise in temperatures over the past 30 years is slowing slightly.
Global warming since the 1970s has been 0.3F (0.16C) but the rise in the past decade was just 0.09F (0.05C), claims the Met Office.
Sceptics suggest this is evidence that man-made global warming is a myth.
The Met Office said in a report that the reduced rate of warming can be easily explained by a number of factors.
Indeed the true rate of warming caused by man-made greenhouse gases could be greater than ever.
One of the major factors is pollution over Asia, where the growth in coal-fired power stations mean gases such as sulphur are being pumped into the air. This reflects sunlight cooling the land surface temperature.
Dr Vicky Pope, the head ofÊClimateÊChange Advice, said pollution may be having a cooling effect.
""A possible increase in aerosol emissions from Asia in the past decade may have contributed substantially to the recent slowdown,"" she said.
Dr Pope said the global temperature was still rising and 2010 was set to be the second warmest year on record.
Other groups, including the US space agency Nasa, think it will be the hottest year on record at about 0.9F (0.5C) above the 1961-1990 average of 57.2F (14C).
Dr Pope said the world should not be lulled into a false sense of security because the warming trend had slowed down.
In Britain especially, people are less worried about global warming because of a run of cold winters, including snow this weekend. But this is a short-term trend.
Dr Pope said that in the long term the world, including Britain, was getting warmer. ""If you look at the long-term trends we are in fact experiencing fewer freezing winters and more heatwaves,"" she said. Dr Pope also said warming in the Arctic was likely to be greater than the rest of the world but its statistics were not included because of the lack of weather stations in the Poles.
Also more accurate readings of sea surface temperature, using buoys rather than ships, suggest that temperatures for the past decade are about 0.5F (0.03C) higher than estimated.
More than 190 countries are meeting in Cancun, Mexico, forÊclimateÊchange talks later this month to discuss the best way to bring down emissions so that the rise in global temperatures remains below 3.6F (2C).
At the moment the global temperature rise is 1.4F (0.8C) above pre-industrial levels.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Thursday, December 2, 2010",UN REPORT CALLS FOR WORLD BAN ON TRADITIONAL LIGHTBULBS,Louise Gray in Cancun,,"A UN study found that if every nation switched from incandescent lamps to energy--efficient alternatives, the world's electricity demand for lighting would fall by more than 2 per cent. This is equivalent to saving about 800 million tons of carbon emissions. The study was disclosed at UN talks in Cancun to prove how easy it would be to cut emissions if the world worked together.
Britain is already phasing out traditional bulbs as part of European regulations.
The scheme has been unpopular with many because compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) take longer to warm up and can give some people headaches. But they last 10 times longer and require far less electricity to produce the same amount of light.
Indonesia alone could save $1 billion (GBP640 million) a year and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by eight million tons of CO2 a year, the equivalent of taking two million cars off the road each year.
Small nations such as Cambodia could save more than 30 per cent of electricity consumption while reducing CO2 emissions by 13 per cent.
At the moment at least half of the lights sold are the inef--ficient incandescent lamps, which cost a quarter of the price of energy--saving bulbs.
However, CFLs are becoming cheaper and could fall further in price if there is mass demand across the world.
New Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), which are due to come in soon, will be even cheaper and more efficient.
Already lighting companies such as Osram and Phillips are rolling out the new models in developing countries.
The UN said it was up to each country to determine the best way to encourage a switch to energy efficient models.
Other ways to encourage the switch include using taxes, subsidies or campaigns.
The US, Australia, Cuba, Canada and the Philippines are all banning incandescent bulbs, as well as Europe.
The UN is trying to phase out incandescent bulbs in China, Russia, Vietnam and Morocco.
Achim Steiner, the head of the UN's Environment Programme, said it would not only be good forÊclimateÊchange but the economy, as businesses saved money on lighting and fewer power stations were needed."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, April 24, 2010",BRITAIN'S SILENT REVOLUTION,Geoffrey Lean,,"No matter how the votes tally up in Brighton Pavilion, the contest has greened British politics - to a degree that would have been unimaginable last time the country trudged off to the polls. All the major parties are signed up to transforming Britain into a green, lowcarbon economy to boost growth, as well as to combatÊclimateÊchange.
If they meet their promises - global warming and rising fossil fuel prices will make it hard for them to avoid it for long - they will effect the biggest change in Britain since the Industrial Revolution steamed into life in a blaze of coal.
It's all there in the manifestos. The Conservatives aim to make Britain the ""world's first low-carbon economy""; the Lib Dems want Britain to ""lead the new green economy that the world needs""; and Labour maintains that ours is already ""a transition economy from high carbon to low carbon"". And all have set out more or less far-reaching policies to put the promises into practice.
This will have a more profound and lasting effect on our lives than anything else in their manifestos. But you'd never guess it from the hustings. Green issues have hardly featured - apart from some lacklustre exchanges onÊclimateÊchange during Thursday's leaders' debate.
Little attention has been paid to the low-carbon economy, and on how it might be created, despite a little-noticed attempt by Nick Clegg to introduce the subject on Monday. No doubt it will get a mention or two in next week's debate on the economy, but I would not bet on it playing a central part.
And that, to my mind, is profoundly undemocratic. If our political parties are bent on taking the economy in a new direction, surely they have a duty to lay out their plans in detail before the electorate and to explain their importance? It's not as if they haven't done the work. The Tories last year produced a groundbreaking policy document. The Lib Dems have 77 policies, marked out in green, scattered throughout their manifesto (though there is a bit of doublecounting).
And Labour can point to recent achievement - under the aegis of that unlikely eco-warrior Lord Mandelson - in attracting green industry and jobs.
Part of the problem is that there is not that much difference between the parties on the issues: the main note of dissent in the debate was a superficial slanging match over nuclear power. But there is an important philosophical difference between the Tories, who want to encourage people through incentives, and Labour, which relies more on regulation.
A more substantial drawback is that the environment is not thought to be a votewinner in general elections. But is that true this time? The admittedly unfocused national mood is for change, and this is the greatest departure that the parties have to offer.
And if David Cameron has lost some of his freshness to Nick Clegg and finds that the electorate has trouble in working out where he stands, maybe that has something to do with his more recent failure to stress the green issues with which he freshened up his party and which originally defined him in the public mind.
Maybe it's time for a trip to Brighton."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, March 27, 2010",LOGGING ON: WHY STOVES ARE THE HOT 'MUST HAVE',Adam Edwards,,"In the Seventies, for example, the avocado bathroom suite and the Magimix were the ne plus ultra of the day. In the early Eighties, the zeitgeist bowed before the Breville sandwich toaster (amazing, but true) to say nothing of the naughtyknickeresque ruched blind. In the Nineties one's house could not be counted a home without a Le Creuset casserole dish, kitchen island and granite worktop. More recently the retro-American fridge-freezer and the baby espresso machine have been the siren song.
Today, however it is the wood-burning stove after which we lust. A roaring open fire with the heat escaping up the chimney is so yesterday. To be at the cutting edge, one needs a Scandinavian logguzzler that generates more hot air than the CopenhagenÊclimateÊchange conference.
The cast-iron heater, like the Toyota Prius and the reusable jute shopping bag, is green and groovy. The stove is feted by the eco-lobby, loved by the parsimonious and all the rage with the fashionistas of Notting Hill, despite the fact that the only wood available in the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea is either from skips or sold at garages in green net bags by the log (about 70p for a log the size of a small bloomer loaf).
Making the trendy firebox even more attractive was this month's announcement from the Department of Energy andÊ , which claimed that a wood-burning stove owner who generated his own electricity could earn 6.5p per kilowatt hour.
In the past 12 months, sales of the eco-friendly heaters have risen by more than 300 per cent. Stoves Online, the biggest seller of the wood burners in the country, says that the recent cold snap has seen another massive increase in sales.
""We had a huge rise in sales in the past two years and another large increase in the past couple of months,"" said John Nightingale, owner of Stoves Online, who has been making, selling and installing stoves for more than 30 years. Famous owners of these toasty furnaces include Prince of Wales, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, Lily Allen, Alex James, Anne Robinson, Daniel Day-Lewis and legions more right-on celebrities.
""The reason for their sudden popularity is twofold,"" Nightingale says. ""Oil and gas have become very expensive, and wood is a carbon-neutral fuel. The stoves give out five times as much heat as a regular fireplace and heat a far bigger part of the house."" The cost and installation of a decent stove can be as little as GBP1,000, but is likely to cost much more as most chimneys need to be lined. However, enthusiasts like Nightingale believe that that money is quickly recovered by cheaper fuel bills.
Cast-iron wood-burning stoves have been popular on the Continent since the 18th century (although there were ceramic stoves as early as the 16th century). But it was in Scandinavia where, thanks to its swathes of forest, the logburners became as ingrained as a post-sauna birching or a brisk sm&#xF8;rgasb&#xF8;rd. Today it is still the Nordic stoves that are the most fashionable. Companies such as Jotul, the Volvo XC90 of stoves that has the gentle sound of burning, crackling wood on its website, and Dovre (""successfully combating Norwegian winters for 60 years""). In Britain, manufacturers include the excellent Esse company, Aarrow stoves and now Aga.
""A good stove has a good airtight box without any leaks, it successfully gets rid of the gases, but does not let the heat go up the chimney,"" says James Price, of Green Man Stoves, a young company that has opened a showroom in the Cotswolds this winter. ""Nowadays there are some really good British manufacturers, and a top-ofthe-range model will last you a lifetime.""
And surprisingly, many of those buyers are from metropolitan areas. ""We are selling a lot of stoves in London that are so efficient they can burn wood in a smokeless zone,"" Nightingale said.
""The stoves have clean lines and lovely proportions. I can't think of any reason why one would have an open fire in preference to a stove other than downright stubbornness.""
There are, however, stove deniers who claim that you need a great big pile of logs to feed one and a forest to supply the woodpile (you can't run a stove on a chair leg purloined from a skip). Most stoves will rarely burn unattended for more than four hours and fire-lighting becomes a nightmare.
Furthermore, it was once claimed that Country Life magazine refused to feature any house with a woodburning stove because they were thought to be ""common"". Now, of course they are anything but- until of course the next ""big thing"" when I imagine their social standing will once again be that of a flat-pack shelf unit from Ikea.

' oil and gas are very expensive- and wood is carbon-neutral'"
"Telegraph (London, UK)","Wednesday, September 1, 2010",DR PACHAURI IS DAMAGING THE WORLD,Geoffrey Lean,,"For Barack Obama, things have only gone downhill since he was awarded the prize (prematurely, to put it at its kindest) last year. Al Gore has looked increasingly tarnished since getting it in 2007. Although most past winners have been praiseworthy choices, others have included Yasser Arafat, Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho (although the North Vietnamese revolutionary-turned-negotiator had the grace to refuse to accept).
Yet no fall from grace has been so unforeseen as that of Gore's co-winner, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Just two years after picking up the prize, the UN organisation - chiefly criticised until then for its caution in interpreting the growing evidence of climate change - was plunged into controversy, after it was found grossly to have exaggerated the rate at which Himalayan glaciers are melting.
Climate sceptics were quick to seize on other ""errors"" in the IPCC's latest 3,000-page report - sometimes justifiably. Coinciding with the cold winter in Britain and the US, the controversy caused by hacked emails from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, and the disappointing outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit, the furore severely eroded public support for measures to tackle global warming.
Now an inquiry carried out under the auspices of the world's top 15 academies of sciences, including Britain's Royal Society, has revealed shortcomings in the IPCC's organisation and management. It strongly suggests that the panel's controversial chairman, Rajendra Pachauri - who collected the Nobel Prize on his institution's behalf - should not continue in his post.
It found that the IPCC had disregarded its own guidelines on how to communicate scientific uncertainties in one of the ""summaries for policymakers"" that it published with its latest report: ""many statements... are assigned high confidence, but are based on little evidence"". It highlighted flaws in the review process, pointing out that the Himalayan howler was identified by two participating scientists while the report was being prepared, without being corrected. It revealed that the leaders of the IPCC, like Dr Pachauri, were not subject to a policy on potential conflicts of interest - unlike its staff, which have to obey strict UN rules. And it is concerned that the panel may have strayed beyond its remit of laying out the science into advocating specific policies.
Admittedly, climate sceptics will be far from happy, because the report provides no support for their main charges. Like the three inquiries carried out into the emails controversy at UEA, it has found nothing to undermine the basic science of global warming; the statements it criticises are overconfident predictions about the precise effects that climate change may have, rather than judgments on whether it is occurring in the first place.
Also, far from being the overmighty, all-controlling leviathan depicted by some of its opponents, the inquiry shows the IPCC to be an amateurish, ramshackle operation with 10 staff, a part-time boss, and poor public relations skills - struggling with the increasing torrent of scientific studies on the climate, and ""sluggish"" and inept at responding to publicity and criticism.
It recommends setting up a proper management structure, including an executive committee and a full-time executive director. And it also recommends that no chairman should serve more than one six-year term. It is hard not believe that this is aimed at Dr Pachauri, who was elected to a second term two years ago. Indeed, Dr Harold Shapiro, the Princeton economist who led the inquiry, has confirmed that the ""one logical conclusion"" was that Dr Pachauri should go.
Dr Shapiro said he was not criticising Dr Pachauri personally, but there is no doubt he should go. As the IPCC's leader, Dr Pachauri is ultimately responsible for the defects identified by the inquiry. Worse, he has done much to aggravate them. He has been in the vanguard of the panel's detour into policy pronouncements - for example, by calling a decision by President Obama not to try for a full climate treaty in Copenhagen ""an abandonment of moral responsibility"". And his bombastic rejection last winter of any criticism deepened the crisis.
But he is refusing to quit, saying he will stay to implement the changes unless he is dismissed by the representatives of the 194 governments who run the IPCC. That is most unlikely to happen. In the arcane world of UN politics, heads of organisations are rarely unseated when they are backed by their own governments, and India reiterated its support for Dr Pachauri only yesterday. Other developing countries will defend one of their own.
Yesterday, it was revealed that Bjorn Lomborg, long regarded by many climate scientists as one of their fiercest opponents, is to call for $100billion a year to be spent on combating global warming, calling it ""one of the chief concerns facing the world today"". Pachauri was once quoted as comparing Lomborg to Hitler, but today the self-styled ""sceptical environmentalist"" appears the bigger man. Until the IPCC chairman is similarly able to adapt to the realities, his organisation, his cause - and that Peace Prize - will inevitably be damaged and devalued."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, July 28, 2010",ENERGY REVOLUTION COULD PUT BILLS UP BY A THIRD,Louise Gray and Harry Wallop,,"In the Coalition's first annual energy statement to the Commons, Chris Huhne, the Energy Secretary, outlined plans to transform Britain's power system and cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent within the next 40 years. He announced 32 separate measures, from the use of smart meters in all homes to a major expansion of renewable energy sources, including a new generation of nuclear power stations and up to 44,000 wind turbines.
However, Mr Huhne's department admitted that such policies could increase the price of electricity by up to a third and gas by up to a fifth. This would make the average family's annual energy bill of GBP1,100, GBP300 more expensive.
To offset this, the Energy Secretary said people would have to make ""ambitious"" cuts in their own consumption and improve the energy efficiency of their homes, including installing energy generators such as solar panels.
The Government believes that householders will ultimately be able to offset all but GBP13 of the GBP300-a-year rise in energy costs with efficiency savings. However, it has assumed that electronics manufacturers will continue to make products more effi-cient and so save the average family more than GBP120 a year.
Ann Robinson, of uswitch.
com, the price comparison website, said: ""Consumers are going to have to significantly reduce the amount of energy they are using just to be able to afford it.""
Consumer Focus, the watchdog, was concerned at the impact on the poorest consumers.
""Only the middle class and better-off can afford to install solar panels, but the subsidies to fund these measures are paid by all bill payers,"" said Audrey Gallacher, its head of energy policy.
In the Commons, Mr Huhne promised ""a clear strategy for creating the 21st-century energy system that this country urgently needs for an affordable, secure, low-carbon future"".
He said the events surrounding BP in the Gulf of Mexico showed the importance of moving away from an economy dependent on fossil fuels. With rising dependence on imported fuel leaving Britain at risk of future oil shocks, Mr Huhne said the Coalition wanted to move ""further and faster"" towards greater energy independence.
He admitted that the cheapest way ""to keep the lights on"" as energy prices rose was for people to ""cut energy use"".
A ""street by street"" refurbishment of Britain's housing would be carried out over the next few years through a combination of private and public investment. Energy companies would be forced to ensure that homes in deprived areas were better insulated.
By 2018 every home would have a smart meter that enabled home owners to monitor and manage electricity use. Mr Huhne said Britain would need to increase the proportion of power coming from renewables from the current 5 per cent to at least 15 per cent. This would mean investing in onshore and offshore wind farms, solar panels and hydroelectric plants, as well as generating energy from wood and waste. Coal-fired power stations would remain part of the grid as long as emissions were stored underground using ""carbon capture"". As a Liberal Democrat, Mr Huhne is opposed to nuclear power on principle. But he admitted that the technology would help Britain meet energy demand and predicted that the first of up to 10 new power stations would come on stream in 2018. ""The lights are not going to go out on my watch,"" he said. John Sauven, of Greenpeace, said the plan was ""worthless"" without details on funding.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Wednesday, May 26, 2010",MELTING ICE IS MAKING IT MORE RISKY TO TACKLE EVEREST,Heidi Blake,,"Rising temperatures have melted much of the ice on the climb to the summit and mountaineers are struggling to get traction on the exposed rock surface, according to the 49-year-old sherpa, known only as Apa.
The melting ice has also exposed deep crevasses into which climbers could fall.
Experts have warned that people scaling the mountain risk being swept away by ""outburst floods"" from the rising volumes of glacial meltwater.
Apa, who grew up in the foothills of Everest, reached the 29,035ft summit on Saturday for the 20th time, breaking his previous record of 19 ascents.
After returning to Kathmandu yesterday, he said: ""The rising temperature on the mountains has melted much ice and snow on the trail to the summit.
""It is difficult for climbers to use their crampons on the rocky surfaces.""
He said there was hardly any exposed rock on the trail to the summit when he first climbed Everest in 1989.
However, the slopes are now dotted with bare rocks.
The world's highest mountain is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination, with a procession of novice climbers scaling the summit with the help of highly expert sherpas, such as Apa.
Bonita Norris, a 22-year-old media studies graduate from Berkshire, recently became the youngest British woman to conquer Everest.
She admitted that she had never even climbed Snowdon, the highest peak in Wales, before setting her sights on the world's highest summit.
However, expert mountaineers have warned that many amateur climbers may not be aware of the risks they face in tackling Everest.
A report by scientists at University College London said the Himalayan glaciers were retreating faster than many others around the world, at rates ranging from 32 ft to 196ft each year.
Prof Steve Edwards, an earth scientist who coauthored the report, titled The Waters of the Third Pole, said the effects of glacial melting posed a real risk to climbers.
""The general trend shows that the Himalayan glaciers as a whole are melting faster than many others. It is probably the fastest rate of melting in the world,"" he said.
""The result is that in the summer months there is going to be a lot of slush on the ice fields.
""There is also the risk of glacial outburst floods, where the meltwater tops the bank of sediment left behind by the glacier during a period of intense melting and crashes down the river valley, destroying everything in its path.""
The United NationsÊclimateÊchange panel warned in 2007 that the Himalayan glaciers were melting so fast that they would almost completely disappear by 2035.
The Intergovernmental Panel onÊClimateÊChange admitted that the claim was an exaggeration earlier this year, but melting ice in the mountain range remains a source of grave concern.
Lewis Gordon Pugh, the British environmentalist, swam 1km (1,093 yards) across a lake of meltwater on Everest at the weekend to highlight the speed at which the ice is melting."
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, October 5, 2010",CHANGE IS IN THE AIR,"Fossil fuel dependence is a vice that we have to be rid of. And the United Kingdom should be well positioned to be at the forefront of the energy revolution. After all, we have a natural environment readily suited to the generation of renewable energy. Wind, wave, tidal and hydro resources are plentiful. There are also excellent opportunities to increase the provision of solar, geothermal and biomass based energy systems.",,"In a letter this month to new environment secretary Chris Huhne, the chairman of the Committee onÊClimateÊChange, Lord Turner, stressed not only the need for the UK to up its game, but also the benefits of doing so. Lord Turner wrote: ""Investment now in a broad range of renewable technologies, but predominantly onshore and offshore wind, will directly contribute to required decarbonisation... It could also provide economic opportunities for UK-based firms."" NEW MONEY Alina Bakhareva, research manager for renewable energy at analysts Frost & Sullivan, is confident that this change is coming.
""Overall, the UK hasn't been doing that great, compared with other European countries,"" she says. ""It looks like the government is determined to catch up, putting effort and money into renewable energy development."" Bakhareva quotes research indicating that while wind, tidal and wave are all expected to provide a growing share of electricity generation, it is offshore wind farms that have the best prospects. ""Europe is a global leader [hi offshore wind], but the UK has been quite slow,"" she explains. ""We are seeing industry step out of its cradle and a lot of independent projects developers are showing interest. ""Project finance was not available, except from a limited number of investors,"" Bakhareva explains.
""Utilities were able to finance this from their balance sheets. Now we are seeing banks and other investors interested in financing offshore wind projects. We are expecting a lot more projects will be able to secure finance. That will translate into more projects being constructed."" The company that has led the way in recent years in the UK is Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE), which is the largest player in the renewable energy market. It is also -- in a joint venture with RWE npower renewable - responsible for the biggest single new renewable energy project currently under construction in the UK: the Greater Gabbard offshore wind farm, situated off the Suffolk coast. By the time it begins operations in 2012, this will comprise 140 wind turbines. When all schemes currently under development are completed, SSE will have 15,000 MW of renewable energy capacity from hydro electric, biomass and waste-to-energy projects, as well as wind farms.
A spokeswoman for the company explains: ""SSE's core purpose is to provide the energy people need in a reliable and sustainable way. In 2008, following SSE's acquisition of the renewables company Airtricity, we made a statement outlining our plans in the renewables sector and confirming a massive investment in this area."" By the time it is completed, that investment programme will see the group spend GBP2.5bn on renewable projects in the UK and Ireland. POWER SURGE Tidal and wave power electricity generating schemes are also causing a lot of interest. Studies have shown that sites off the Orkney islands and Pentland Firth in Scotland are the most promising.
A site in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland has been trialing an experimental tidal powered electricity generator, which has been performing well. The Crown Estate is about to give approval for new schemes for large scale commercial development of marine energy off the north coasts of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Smaller scale renewable schemes have just been given a boost by Chris Huhne's decision to permit local authorities to sell surplus electricity generated by renewables to the grid. The Local Government Association predicts this will create a GBP100m trade that will subsidise council taxes and will see wind turbines and solar panels sprout on town halls and leisure centres, and even on council houses.
While Huhne has stressed his commitment to renewables, the government's position on nuclear power is less clear. Prior to the election, Huhne's party, the Liberal Democrats, stated they would oppose new nuclear power plants. But the programme agreed between the two parties committed both to allowing new nuclear stations to be built, providing there was no financial subsidy. Yet, without that subsidy the viability of the sector is in doubt. At present, renewables look a more attractive investment option -- and schemes are smaller and therefore both more manageable and more affordable than nuclear. Frost & Sullivan's Alina Bakhareva believes that investors will increasingly include major supermarket chains keen both to reduce overheads and improve their images.
Yet despite all the advances, the move away from fossil fuels will be neither easy nor quick. The interim technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS) will therefore be a very important stepping stone on the journey. CCS has the potential, believes the Department of Energy andÊClimateÊChange, to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel power stations by about 90 per cent - making a very important contribution to carbon reduction targets.

The Coalition is planning to invite private investment in green development projects that could create jobs and reduce carbon dioxide.
Aid agencies and charities say there is a danger in involving big business in aid because they claim they will only help people while there is the potential for profit.
Mr Mitchell announced two public-private partnership projects in Africa and Asia to stimulate investment in renewable energy schemes.
The Coalition has put aside GBP2.9 billion of the aid budget to fightÊclimateÊchange over the next four years.
From this, grants for public-private renewable energy projects will be put in a central pot and added to by private investors. Companies can then dip into the fund to develop green schemes.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Tuesday, April 6, 2010",ENERGY SECURITY IS NOT A LUXURY BUT A NECESSITY IN A DANGEROUS WORLD,Malcolm Wicks Personal view,,"Certainly during my time as energy minister it was energy supply that played on my mind. I therefore welcomed Gordon Brown's invitation to mount an enquiry and publish a report on energy security [Energy Security: a national challenge in a changing world, August 2009]. My report made many recommendations, to which the Government made a serious response last week.
Why do we now need an urgent focus on security, alongside the priority ofÊclimateÊchange? The answer is given by the risky coincidence of two substantial developments. First, Britain is now experiencing a decade or more of rapid transition towards import dependency. Gas is critical. From recent North Sea self-sufficiency, we now import about 25pc of our requirement. And by 2020, it could well be around 70pc.
Second, this radical transition occurs when, post-recession, there will be an enormous global thirst for energy. The International Energy Agency estimates that up to 2030 global demand could increase by as much as 40pc (although only half that amount ifÊclimateÊchange measures are pursued vigorously). Strong nations will flex economic, political and, perhaps, military muscle in the pursuit of fuel to power their economies.
Fewer fossil fuels are being produced in Europe and there will be more reliance on the Middle East in particular, but also on both Russia and Africa. For the European Union (but not the UK directly) Russia is crucial, supplying some 40pc of European gas demand, with the potential for this figure to rise.
Such developments occur at a time of substantial investment risk. The recession has hit investment and this could mean tight energy supplies when economies recover. The IEA has estimated that over $5 trillion (GBP3.3 trillion) of investment is required in the oil sector and $3.3 trillion for gas. Output from existing oil-fields is depleting. Additional production equivalent to four Saudi Arabias will be needed to maintain oil supplies at existing levels and six Saudi Arabias to reach the increase in demand towards 2030.
By 2025 the UK could be importing some 50pc of its total energy. Very different from the 1950s when coal was king and 700,000 miners were employed in 900 British pits. Different too from the heyday of the North Sea.
In my report I call for action internationally but also on the home front. Energy efficiency must be the starting point. This must not be regarded as some kind of soft option but rather as a rigorous programme to reduce the country's demand for energy.
Reduced demand must be matched by maximising 'home grown' energy. The Government has committed itself to increase renewables to 15pc of total energy by 2020.
Should the UK be more ambitious on nuclear power? I believe the answer is yes. In recent times nuclear has provided some 15pc of our electricity requirement but it was over 25pc in the 1990s. The proportion will decline in coming years when old generators are decommissioned. By the early 2020s we could have the same proportion of nuclear in our mix as now. Should we go further? If we electrify much of our transport and heating, our demand for electricity in 2050 could be 50pc higher than it is today. A range between, say, 35pc-40pc of electricity from nuclear could be a sensible aspiration beyond 2030. This might seem ambitious, but compares with France's 80pc of electricity coming from nuclear.
Diversity of supply is vital and that means a role for coal. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) could enable new coal plants to be part of the low carbon economy. It is also important to pursue new coal technologies, such as underground coal gasification.
Gas will remain important for the foreseeable future. The Government therefore needs to take steps to satisfy itself that gas supply is secure. It would be advantageous to the security of our gas supplies if long-term, fixed volume contracts were in place. The UK also requires more gas storage as stocks from our natural 'store', the North Sea decline.
There are welcome plans for more commercial storage, but gas stored in this way will be sold to the highest bidder, and often used to supply continental demands. Government either needs to ensure that proportions of commercially stored gas are available just for the UK market in extreme circumstances, or should consider seriously the option of investing in strategic gas storage.

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, July 10, 2010",'CLIMATEGATE' FAILS TO WHIP UP A STORM,Geoffrey Lean,,"The result of Sir Muir Russell's inquiry had been widely predicted - both by those who have long known that there was no evidence of scientific malpractice (but plenty of excessive secrecy and flouting of Freedom of Information laws), and by sceptics forecasting a whitewash.
The public's reaction, however, has been much more surprising. Thanks to the free run enjoyed by the sceptics - through cowardice among scientists and green groups - it should have had a big impact. But new polls on both sides of the Atlantic suggest that, while acceptance of global warming has been falling, the much-hyped furore is not responsible.
An American poll found that only 9 per cent of the respondents thought that ""Climategate"" indicated thatÊclimateÊscientists are untrustworthy, about the same proportion as told a Scottish one that they had altered their opinions as a result of it. A survey for the BBC indicated that just a quarter of those who had heard of it had changed their views - and that most of these had become more convinced of global warming, not less. Polls in both Britain and America show that the cold winter was much more influential in changing minds, something the present heatwaves may mitigate. And indeed, the latest signs are of increases in the already large majority who are sure that humanity is warming theÊclimate. Given that this seems to have been a storm in a piece of crockery, should we rename it ""Climatecup""?"
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Thursday, June 10, 2010",HOT WEATHER WAS THE MAKING OF MAN,Daily Telegraph Reporter,,"For the first time, scientists have estimated accurately theÊclimateÊduring the development of the earliest humans in the Turkana Basin in Kenya four million years ago. The basin is nicknamed the cradle of evolution and fossil evidence suggests it is the birthplace of mankind.
It has been possible to work out rainfall and the kind of plants that existed during this time but until now it has been much harder to measure the temperature accurately.
Scientists discovered that average daily temperatures have remained around the mid-90sF in the basin, avoiding the global cooling due to the Ice Age.
The discovery backs up a theory called ""thermal hypothesis"" which claims that the high temperatures led to the evolution of mankind. Humans began walking upright, as the air a few feet above the surface of the earth is not so hot, shedding fur and sweating as they did so to cool down.
Scientists used a new system examining isotopes, a kind of atom, embedded in layers of soil going back millions of years.
The isotopes they found suggested constant temperatures in a range between 85 and 95F (29 to 35C).
The research has been published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.
Benjamin Passey, who led the study, said: ""This region, which is one of the key places where fossils have been found documenting human evolution, has been a really hot place for a really long time, even during the period between three million years ago and now when the ice ages began and the globalÊclimateÊbecame cooler.
""Now we have evidence that it was hot. Thus, we can say that the thermal hypothesis is credible.""

"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, April 10, 2010",HAS EUROPE SEEN THE LIGHT?,Geoffrey Lean,,"Yet one of the most visionary - there is no other word - reports recently to cross my desk comes from a firm whose name is almost synonymous with accountancy. Just published, virtually unnoticed, by PricewaterhouseCoopers, it is the sort of tome you would expect from an idealistic green group. But given its source, and the practicality of its approach, it should be taken seriously.
It forms a blueprint for a Europe powered entirely by renewable energy - and yet more prosperous, more mobile, and using more electricity than now. Impossible, you may well say: vegan pie in the sunlit sky. How could a modern, industrial, highly developed continent even begin to survive if it was wholly dependent on such unreliable sources? And yet the report not only recognises the inherent volatility and unpredictability of winds that only blow part of the time, and of sunlight that only reaches us on clear days, but tackles these issues head on: it says renewables could provide at least as secure an energy system as anything we have today. And, this week, an equally blue-chip study produced by a group including McKinsey, Imperial College, and the EuropeanÊClimateFoundation will come to much the same conclusion.
The secret, both studies report, lies in two concepts: diversity and connectivity. They envisage a continent-wide ""supergrid"", linking the areas with ""the best sites for each technology"", as the accountants put it, ""regardless of national or regional borders"". Thus the North Sea would contribute electricity from windpower, for example, the Iberian peninsula would generate it from the sun, and Norway and Austria would provide hydropower. The diverse sources would be connected by high-voltage, direct-current power lines, which would run mainly on existing national grid networks and be linked by undersea cables - much more efficient than our existing alternatingcurrent lines.
The Norwegian and Austrian contributions would provide vital back-up, since - unlike other renewable sources - hydropower can effectively store electricity by pumping water uphill to its reservoirs at times of surplus, and generating power when needed by letting it rush downhill again. Denmark already relies on its Scandinavian neighbour in this way to cover its windpower - which can go from generating as much electricity as three large power stations to zero in just a few hours - and there is plenty still to spare.
There is even more potential if tide, wave and - especially - geothermal energy are developed, but the reports, conservatively, do not count on them at all. With them, an entirely renewable-powered Europe might be self-sufficient. Without them, it would have to import about a fifth of its electricity from North Africa, mainly from its abundant solar energy, by 2050. This raises obvious concerns about energy security but, as the accountants' report puts it, there would be ""a lower level of risk"" than at present. Europe now imports little electricity, but buys in more than half of the fuels needed to generate it (ranging from 41 per cent of its coal to 97 per cent of its uranium), a proportion expected to rise to nearly three quarters over the next decades. And while it is now becoming increasingly dependent on Russia, which has already shown its willingness to disrupt supplies, the solar electricity would come from a range of north African states.
The cost, the reports agree, would be, at worst, little more than for continuing the present energy system, and the accountants conclude that consumers will eventually enjoy ""considerable, and growing, savings"".
The accountants do, however, point to one serious problem. Solar power stations need large amounts of water, but work best in arid areas with few clouds. Siting them by the sea would be one possible solution, and could produce desalinated water as a welcome by-product; but coastal areas tend to be more overcast.
The reports are not just setting out a dream; important building blocks for putting the concept into practice are beginning to appear on the ground. Big companies, including Deutsche Bank and energy giants RWE and E.ON, are already investing in a plan to provide 15 per cent of Europe's power from the Saharan sun, while nine North Sea governments are planning to link their electricity networks through a forerunner of the proposed supergrid.
Will Europe become all-renewable? It's hard to see it by 2050: nuclear power will surely also have a role. But the reports suggest that the continent could tackleÊclimateÊchange by decarbonising its power supplies - and maybe all its energy as electric cars and heating take over. And that would be a vision worth realising."

Around 30,000 organisations have until September 30 to sign up with the Environment Agency to participate in the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. Yet as the DECC disclosed this week, only 1,200 have done so, and industry analysts expect that 7,500 will end up missing the deadline.",,"It is with these smaller companies that the problems arise. They might not have the resources to make the necessary preparations for the scheme, or to meet the regulatory requirements, yet their owners face heavy fines for failing to register on time and - absurdly - even imprisonment for continued refusal to comply. There are obvious advantages to lower carbon emissions, both for businesses and for the country - even though the Government calculates that the Carbon Reduction Commitment will reduce the UK's CO2 output by just 1.3 million tons a year by 2020, a mere 0.2 per cent of the annual total.
Yet while encouraging lower energy use is to be commended, it is questionable whether this is the right way to go about it. Regulation is not of itself a bad thing; but it must work efficiently, and there are major concerns about the bureaucracy and complexity involved in this scheme. Greg Barker, theÊClimateÊChange Minister, has promised to consider suggestions for simplifying the rules, which will be welcomed by many businesses. He should also ensure that the Environment Agency avoids being overly heavy-handed when they come into force, since smaller businesses will be hardest hit by an excessively punitive approach.

But Gordon Brown insisted that the runway would go ahead as planned, saying that expanding Heathrow was the right decision for the economy.
A coalition of groups including Greenpeace, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and six local authorities had brought the case, arguing that expanding the airport would breach Britain's legally-bindingÊclimateÊchange targets. The judge upheld their complaint, but said that government plans for a further consultation next year were likely to meet his requirement that ministers consider the impact on the environment. He gave the Government and the campaigners until next month to set out the form in which the consultation would take place.
Speaking after the ruling, Mr Brown said that he was confident ministers would prove that the runway would not compromise Britain's green targets.
He claimed that the Government had backed an extra runway ""only after a detailed assessment showing that the strict environmental limits for expansion could be met"".
""We are taking seriously both the concerns that people have and the need for public consultation,"" he said.
""But we took a tough decision, the right decision necessary for the future of Britain and the economy, and a new runway will help secure Britain's economic future."" In his ruling, Lord Justice Carnwath said that the Government's policy for the expansion of Heathrow, first set out in 2003, would need to be looked at again, after developments in a number of policy areas in the past seven years, with theÊclimateÊchange debate in particular having moved on.
But he added that his decision was not a ""show stopper"" for the third runway, which could go ahead if the Government's consultation, due next year, met the required legal criteria.
The campaigners insisted that the runway was dead, however. In a statement, they said: ""If the Government wants to pursue its plans for Heathrow expansion, it must now go back to square one and reconsider the entire case for the runway.""
The Tories oppose the building of the third runway, and are instead planning to put Heathrow at the heart of a new high-speed rail network."
"The Daily Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Saturday, July 17, 2010",VAST POTENTIA REWARDS FOR A GREENER UK,Geoffrey Lean,,"Two months ago the Coalition Government published its programme for government, in which we pledged a package of measures to fulfil our joint ambitions for a low-carbon and eco-friendly economy. Speaking at my department during his first few days in office, the Prime Minister announced that this will be the greenest government ever. The challenge is huge: to reduce the potential impacts ofÊclimateÊchange and ensure our future energy security by weaning ourselves off our addiction to fossil fuels. And we face it as we come out of recession, wrestling with our biggest ever peacetime deficit. Economic recovery, energy security andÊclimatestabilisation all require a commitment to a consistent, long-term policy and this month I will present to Parliament the first of our promised annual statements on energy policy.
Alongside this we will publish the detailed analysis and underpinning data of the 2050 Pathways project, which will help us understand the scale of the challenge and the choices and trade-offs we will have to make over the next 40 years. The long-term task is nothing less than the transformation of our economy, to put in place the right incentives for low-carbon growth to create the investment, exports and jobs we need to bring back economic prosperity. In short, we must seize our share of the green technology revolution and make the UK the best place in the world to do energy business.
During that transition we must secure diversity of energy supplies from abroad while making the most of our home-grown energy, including North Sea oil and gas, and developing renewables technologies such as wind and marine. There can be a role for nuclear so long as there is no public subsidy, a pledge set out in the coalition agreement and guaranteed by the state of the public finances. Carbon capture and storage can also provide us with a low-carbon energy source to meet peaks in energy demand. It will be government's role to provide the long-term certainty in which to develop this new energy infrastructure.
GBP200 billion of investment is needed over the coming decade and we intend to leverage private sector investment through a Green Investment Bank. We are working on a wide range of options for the scope and structure of the Bank and will bring forward detailed proposals in the autumn. In the recent Emergency Budget the Chancellor also announced that we will reshape theÊ  Levy as the way of delivering our coalition commitment to a carbon price floor, in order to boost investment across the range of low-carbon energy technologies. The cheapest way of closing the gap between energy demand and supply is through energy-saving measures. The Green Deal for households will be established through legislation in the forthcoming Energy Security and Green Economy Bill and will encourage home energy efficiency improvements such as insulation and lagging, paid for by savings from energy bills.
Energy saving will also mean smart meters and smart grids that can give consumers control over their appliances, curb energy waste and save money. We will take measures to improve energy efficiency in businesses and public sector buildings - we are leading by example with a target to reduce central government carbon emissions by 10 per cent within 12 months. The transition to a low-carbon UK will be a mammoth task and will in time directly affect us all. Inaction, however, is not an option and the potential rewards for our country are vast That is why I will be looking keenly at the progress of the Telegraph/Shell Age of Energy partnership and hope participants and readers alike find it an informative initiative.

OPENING THE DEBATE WHAT OUR PANEL OF LEADING EXPERTS THINK Jeremy Nicholson DIRECTOR, ENERGY INTENSIVE USERS GROUP The priority for consumers is ensuring that energy supplies remain secure at an affordable price. This is best achieved by allowing freedom to invest in a diverse mix of fuels. All energy sources - coal, gas, oil, nuclear and renewable - have a role for the foreseeable future. But since we need to addressÊclimateÊconcerns, government should ensure future investment is directed towards lowcarbon energy sources by putting a price on carbon emissions. Instead, it has mandated a massive increase in expensive renewables, mostly unreliable wind power which regularly depends on fossil fuelled backup. The cost of hidden renewable subsidies buried in consumers' bills is GBP1.4bn per year and growing, increasing fuel poverty and damaging the competitiveness of British manufacturing. We need an honest debate about this: if it's easier to keep the lights on and reduce emissions affordably with more nuclear and less wind, what's wrong with that? Gordon MacKerron Bernice Lee DIRECTOR, SUSSEX ENERGY GROUR SUSSEX UNIVERSITY
ClimateÊchange is the most challenging long-term global Issue and it is vital that the world takes mitigating it seriously. Practically, this involves radical cuts in carbon dioxide emissions which can only be delivered by the energy system - through low-carbon electricity, heat and transport. Energy security is also vital: without enough of it, governments are unlikely to take mitigation seriously. So the critical energy policy issue is reconciling radical emission cuts with maintaining energy security. There is a central role for a very low-carbon use of coal, though we dont yet know how successful this will be. Meanwhile promoting better energy efficiency and greatly expanding renewable energy should become cornerstones of policy. Finally, all this needs to be achieved while restricting energy price rises - otherwise access to enough modem energy will be denied to poor people everywhere.
RESEARCH DIRECTOR, ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT AND RESOURCE GOVERNANCE, CHATHAM HOUSE The UK commitment to moving to a low-carbon economy by 2050 poses daunting challenges - not least because of the imminent need to replace ageing or obsolete plants, equipment, grids and buildings. Policymakers and strategic investors must be aware of the benefits of investing now to ensure multiple sources of clean, sustainable energy for the future. The government must support systematic investment in infrastructure to enable the country to roll out the planned levels of renewables. Many of the needed technologies are already commercially available or near to market. We will miss the next great wave of energy investment if these are not deployed globally in the next 20-30 years. Getting it right will enable the UK and EU to capture a large share of clean energy markets - one of the fastest growing areas of the global economy. James Smith
CHAIRMAN, SHELL UK Energy improves lives and lifts people out of poverty, but needs to be produced more cleanly. The challenge we face is to produce a lot more energy and a lot less carbon dioxide. There are just two big levers to pull: vastly improving energy efficiency and significantly decarbonising energy production. The pace of change will clearly need to accelerate. But tantalisingly, the technologies to get the job done already exist. They are by no means perfect at present but they can be improved. There will have to be huge growth in alternative energies such as wind, solar and advanced biofuels. Nuclear has a role to play. And fossil fuels, together with carbon capture and storage, will long be essential: gas, the lowest carbon one, will be especially important This is about mustering our common will. We should be daunted by the scale of the challenge but invigorated by the opportunity such change will bring. Matthew Spencer DIRECTOR, GREEN ALLIANCE Carbon, the basis of life on Earth, has become the principal threat to it. We've distorted the world's carbon cycle by using fossil fuels a million times faster than they were created. We now have to get the cycle back in balance by creating a zero-carbon energy system.
There are two solutions; use less energy and generate large quantities of clean electricity. Self-interest should drive energy efficient behaviour but often doesn't because of the hassle involved in doing the right thing. One solution is to make good energy consumption a requirement So, just as you can't enter a building site without a hard hat, you now can't sell a house without telling the buyer how energy efficient it is. Rapidly generating large quantities of zero-carbon electricity is the sort of challenge that engineers like, but financiers don't The planned Green Investment Bank would attract individual and institutional investors and allow for a uniquely British approach to the energy challenge. Tim Yeo CHAIR OF THE ENERGY ANDÊCLIMATEÊCHANGE PARLIAMENTARY SELECT COMMITTEE We must make our homes and businesses more energy efficient Increasingly electricity must come from low-carbon sources, including nuclear, waste and renewables. No new coal-fired power stations should be approved without carbon capture and storage, the single technological breakthrough most urgently needed. Once electricity generation is decarbonised, emissions from transport and buildings can be cut The tax system can encourage the use of low-emission vehicles and the greening of the built environment, while investment in high-speed rail can reverse the growth of short-haul flights. The world is on the brink of a lowcarbon revolution: decisions made in the next five years will determine whether Britain leads it Countries and companies which recognise the opportunity will enjoy a first-mover advantage.
If we dont raise our game soon China will overtake us. Gaynor Hartnell CEO, RENEWABLE ENERGY ASSOCIATION Only two per cent of our energy comes from renewables, while Sweden manages 49 per cent. Even Germany - a similar size to us in resources and population density - manages five times as much proportionally as us. The most important task for Britain is to switch to them rapidly, while simultaneously reducing energy demand through increasing efficiency. Renewables are not properly understood in Britain. People just think of wind turbines not realising that renewables can also heat our homes, fuel our transportation and decarbonise our gas network. Rapid transformation is possible, if there's the political will. The new Government must focus on getting the incentives right and letting renewables evolve, innovate and flourish. The UK has always excelled in innovation, but fails to capitalise on it The economic and employment opportunities of renewables are so exceptional that politicians should seize them with both hands.
""The transition to a low carbon UKwillbea mammoth task and will in time directly affect us all"
"Telegraph (London, UK)Ê","Friday, August 6, 2010","BRILLIANTLY INVENTIVE, FIERCELY FLASHY",Charles Spencer,,"But the sheer energy and ambition of the piece are irresistible, while Rupert Goold directs a brilliantly inventive, unashamedly flashy production that adds greatly to the excitement.
The play is an account of life, love and profound unease in present-day London, but it also looks back to 1968 and forward to the years 2026, and 2525, the latter, significantly, the title of a doom-laden 1969 pop song by one-hit wonders Zager and Evans.
The nub of Bartlett's play is that disaster may overwhelm Planet Earth long before then, and the show's mood of febrile anxiety about global warming at times succeeded in niggling even a crustyÊclimate-change sceptic like myself.
What's surprising, however, is how much fun this dark show provides. In a coproduction between the NT and Goold's Headlong company, the Cottesloe auditorium has been spectacularly transformed. Many in the audience sit on bar stools at curvy counters on which the actors perform.
At either end of the auditorium there are two raised proscenium-arch stages for more intimate scenes, and throughout the play combines the political and the personal, bruising family drama and off-the-wall humour.
One moment you are voyeurs at a burlesque show, the next watching appalled as a family of three sisters tear themselves to shreds, only to find yourself laughing with rueful recognition at Bartlett's spot-on depiction of the nervy energy of life in our capital.
Goold's marvellously wellacted and spectacular production is blessed with terrific visual coups, stirring rock music and a hurtling narrative pace, though Bartlett's thesis that today's youth have been betrayed by their baby-boomer parents is beginning to seem a touch over-familiar and glib. The father of the sisters is a scientist, who accepted cash from the airline industry to hush up the dangers of global warming. Now he is a lonely prophet of doom, who has cut off ties with his family and believes that unpreventable disaster awaits the planet.
Meanwhile, his daughters struggle to make sense of their lives. Lia Williams is compelling as a harassed, emotionally steely, Coalition GovernmentÊclimate-change minister (the play is satisfyingly up-to-the minute), whose marriage is falling apart. The middle sister, played with a moving mixture of tenderness and despair by Anna Madeley, is about to give birth to her first child and is driven close to madness at the thought of the world that awaits her baby, while the teenage wild-child Jasmine (a splendidly spunky Jessica Raine) rages at the older generation.
There is sterling support from Bill Paterson as the steely paterfamilias, Geoffrey Streatfeild and Tom Goodman-Hill as the sisters' anxious husbands, and Bryony Hannah as a comic yet deeply disconcerting schoolboy.
The play would benefit from cuts and the ending strikes me as grotesquely sentimental, but such reservations seem niggling in the face of such a rush of invention, humour and raw emotion."

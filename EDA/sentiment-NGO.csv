1646,BACKGROUND,27
1647,"Protected areas and other conserved areas, such as indigenous and community",27
1648,"conserved lands and sacred natural areas, have played a critical role in biodiversity",4
1649,"conservation for the past century. Beyond providing a haven for species, these areas",27
1650,"also provide vital ecosystem services that sustain livelihoods, connect landscapes,",4
1651,"capture and store carbon, and inspire people to value the natural world. Healthy,",27
1652,well-managed protected areas are critical to the 2015 Paris Agreement’s ambitions of,8
1653,creating a low-carbon global economy and a climate-resilient world. The role of forests,27
1654,"and other natural systems in sequestering carbon has been well-documented. Similarly,",4
1655,protected areas provide a suite of ecosystem services that help vulnerable communities,4
1656,during extreme weather events. These include protection from soil erosion due to heavy,27
1657,"rainfall, coastal storm surge and wave attenuation, and flooding. National governments",27
1658,would benefit from acknowledging the benefits that nature provides by placing,27
1659,protected and other conserved areas at the center of their commitments to addressing,27
1660,"climate-related challenges. However, almost all protected areas were designed, and continue to be managed, with",27
1661,the assumption of a stationary climate. Climate change is already causing shifts in,27
1662,"species composition, habitat types, and ecosystem function, challenging their ability to",27
1663,"meet goals and objectives they were designed for. As the climate continues to change,",27
1664,"protected areas will be further impacted as people shift agricultural production, build",27
1665,"new infrastructure, and move away from coasts and floodplains. To ensure these",27
1666,"natural areas continue to deliver benefits, we must increase efforts to protect them",4
1667,from further degradation and climate change itself. By including conserved areas,27
1668,"in Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCCC, Parties can demonstrate",27
1669,commitment to nature-based solutions and emphasize the importance of protected,4
1670,"natural areas to human well-being. With financial support from the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature",27
1671,"Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), WWF US conducted a review of currently",27
1672,available Nationally Determined Contributions to assess the extent of Parties’ use of,27
1673,"protected and other conserved areas for adaptation and mitigation benefits, to identify",27
1674,promising approaches and gaps. Findings were used to develop recommendations for,27
1675,Parties to enhance the role of protected areas in their revised NDCs for submission to,27
1676,the UNFCCC in 2020 and beyond. A second objective of this study was to learn whether governments consider climate,27
1677,"change risks to nature to better inform protected area management. Governments,",27
1678,protected area managers and conservation groups alike often neglect the increasing,27
1679,risk that climate change poses to protected areas and the ecosystem services they,27
1680,provide. Most planners and managers of the world’s protected areas do not consider,27
1681,"climate risks, instead relying on traditional approaches to conservation that are rapidly",27
1682,becoming obsolete with increased warming and climate variability. WWF believes,27
1683,that a viable future for people and nature mandates that conservation efforts and,27

This week we have:It's not all about carbon: CDP to ask for more sustainability dataWill company boards lose focus on advancing racial equality?Germany's central bank chief Jens Weidmann speaks out about climate change. Is Jay Powell listening?ESG data explosion shows surging importance of 'non-financial' dataCDP, the non-profit formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, has seen a big jump this year in the number of companies disclosing sustainability data, which is a strong indicator of investors' growing interest in ""non-financial"" environmental, social and governance information.The group received data from more than 9,600 companies, which is 14 per cent more than last year and 70 per cent more than five years ago. Considering everything else going on in 2020, that is quite striking.It also highlights another crucial point that investors should remember as they ponder the implications of the US election: whatever does (or does not) emanate next from Washington in terms of American federal policy on the environment, the momentum in the private sector to embrace environmental issues is swelling almost in spite of government.Moreover, the nature of ""E"" is shifting. Next up for CDP is to expand its survey beyond its current questions on carbon emissions, deforestation and water security to include a ""full range"" of environmental factors, said chief executive Paul Simpson . Soon it will begin asking for data to track companies' impact on nature or biodiversity - which is the next frontier for sustainable investors.CDP is playing a critical role in steering the future of ESG disclosure, working with a group of peers such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Global Reporting Initiative to set out a harmonized reporting framework - which may well be adopted by regulators in Europe.But even without mandatory disclosure, its work is having an impact. Although the US is miles behind Europe on ESG, 75 per cent of the S&P 500 sent data to CDP, said Mr Simpson. Given the country's uncertain political future at the moment, this is a welcome reminder that ESG investors can play an important role in pushing for climate action, no matter what ends up happening in Washington.""We know that CDP disclosure really works,"" Mr Simpson said. ""Companies, when they're first disclosing, only 38 per cent of them have an emissions reduction target. By their third year of disclosure that's up to 69 per cent. So that process of measuring and disclosing actually is [effective].""He added: ""The markets are driving this, and that data is really coming now in unprecedented amounts . . . We think we need to see mandatory disclosure evolve around the world as quickly as possible. But it is important to note that market levers can actually drive change. Sometimes a lot faster than the regulation."" ( Billy Nauman )Investors to companies: expect no let-up on diversity pledgesAfter all their pledges in response to this summer's protests, will company boards lose focus on advancing racial equality as other challenges compete for directors' time and resources?That has been the concern, but a new survey from the Conference Board suggests that US investors are not about to let companies off the hook on this issue.The US business research organisation spoke to shareholders representing more than $12tn in assets under management and found that race was the socio-economic issue they were most focused on.""There's a clear consensus that something more is required from companies,"" particularly around disclosure, Paul Washington , executive director of theConference Board's ESG centre, Moral Money.toldThat is likely to result in actions that go beyond votes on shareholder proposals, affecting director elections and - in the case of active funds - capital allocation, he said. Nominating committee members of boards that fall short could be particularly vulnerable, he added, maybe not immediately but certainly by next year.The Conference Board advises companies to err on the side of transparency. As its report puts it: ""If companies don't identify their own shortcomings, someone else will.""

Climate policy is primarily a matter for elected governments, he said. But Europe's central banks should ensure that financial risks from climate change are made transparent, Mr Weidmann said. The Euro-system should consider requiring that securities purchased or accepted as collateral meet certain climate-related reporting obligations, he added.""Climate-related risks could be a possible criterion when deciding which securities to buy or which securities to use as collateral for monetary policy refinancing operations,"" Mr Weidmann said.His comments were applauded, but came with reservations. ""Just more reporting and transparency on climate risks are nothing more than a first step, if, for example, fossil fuel companies' shares and bonds in banks portfolios are still accepted as security without restriction,"" Regine Richter , a campaigner at German environmental lobby group Urgewald, told Moral Money.Last month, Christine Lagarde said the European Central Bank would considerThe European ideas are being heard in Washington with perhaps increasing interest as Joe Biden looks likely to win the presidency.

 Climate change: China's coal addiction clashes with Xi's bold promise  
Christian Shepherd in Ordos, Emma Zhou in Beijing and Katrina Manson in Washington  

Cranes and diggers busily pre pare land beneath the red and white-striped chimneys of the Mengtai Group coal-fired power plant at the northern city limits of Ordos, in northern China's Inner Mongolia.  Privately owned Mengtai will soon add another two smoke stacks to the sprawling complex in an expansion that is the group's biggest investment in its 20-year history. The new unit will burn coal to provide heating to nearby neighbourhoods as part of a regional policy unveiled in March that will add 5 gigawatts of coal power to western Inner Mongolia this year.  The resource-rich region, a swath of grassland, desert and forest that spans most of China's northern border with Mongolia, is trapped between China's heavy industrial past and the bold low-carbon future vision of the nation's leaders.  Mengtai's proposal for a new plant was agreed by the local energy bureau in May, one of 17 units recently given the go-ahead by authorities in Inner Mongolia six have won approval this year alone as part of efforts by local governments to stimulate their pandemichit economies. The region has the most pending facilities of any province in  China, according to data from the Global Energy Monitor, a non-governmental organisation that tracks global fossil fuel projects.  So at a time when the world is shifting away from coal and Beijing has indicated that it will eventually do the same China still accounts for the vast majority of newly commissioned projects globally.  ""Coal is just so important in China from an energy supply and security point of view, and local governments don't believe it is possible to get rid of coal immediately,"" says Yang Yingxia, a senior fellow at the Boston University Institute for Sustainable Energy. ""I don't think the Chinese government has a crystal clear sense of how to get to carbon neutrality by 2060.""  China's future relationship with coal is critical. It will have an outsized impact on global efforts to meet climate change targets but will also weigh heavily on President Xi Jinping's announcement in September of a goal to be ""carbon neutral"" by 2060. To achieve that target would mean a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions to near zero with any remaining output dealt with by capture and storage technologies.  Heralded as a shot in the arm for global  efforts to tackle climate change, the move pre-empted the next round of UN climate talks set for November 2021 and has left nations scrambling to catch up. Japan and South Korea followed with pledges to reach net-zero by 2050.  Yet, sceptics point to China's continued investments in fossil fuels and unwillingness to introduce a moratorium on coal as evidence of its lack of credentials to be a global leader on climate change.  China has embraced clean technologies in recent years. It leads the world in annual electric vehicle sales and installations of wind turbines and solar panels, although uptake has slowed as the state has curbed previously generous subsidies.  But in industrial hubs, sustainable energy sectors remain dwarfed by polluting competitors. Since the turn of the century, municipal authorities in Ordos a city of almost 2m people best known for high-end cashmere and coal have embarked on wave after wave of infrastructure projects designed to revamp the local economy and wean it off coal. But many efforts have stalled. A decade-old ""low-carbon valley"" and cloud computing industrial park visited by the Financial Times showed little sign of having attracted business.  In contrast, a network of open-air coal mines in the countryside surrounding the city teemed with activity. Roadside signs, reminding passers-by to ""protect the environment as you protect your eyes"", are coated in coal dust kicked up by a constant stream of trucks carrying piles of the black rock.  The lack of immediate obvious alternatives to bolster local growth means that  residents in neighbourhoods surrounding the plant, located in Ordos's older district of Dongsheng, mostly welcomed the Mengtai project.  ""The best way Dongsheng can go green is by using coal environmentally and efficiently,"" says one Mengtai engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""This is our current advantage. New energy and high-tech industries are developing but it's been a bit slow. We need to use the resources we have.""  Yet, this continued reliance on fossil fuels and heavy industry in China's economy industrial production has driven the country's post-pandemic economic rebound has cast a shadow over Mr Xi's grand pledge. Widely hailed in the west by climate scientists and politicians alike, the announcement has given hope to the possibility of the world's largest emitter actively joining efforts to save climate negotiations stalled by coronavirus and the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.  Rachel Cleetus, policy director for the climate and energy programme at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, says China's move should help the emergence of a global high-level coalition that can genuinely deliver on climate change. But she cautions that the ""Achilles heels for both China and Japan is what they are going to do around coal.""  'Hollow political overtures'  Some sceptics say that China issued the pledge in part to secure a positive role for itself in global diplomacy to take the moral high ground on climate change as the US became more isolationist under President Donald Trump, while also currying favour with Europe.   Others say that it was a distraction away from criticism over Beijing's role in the coronavirus pandemic.  The move put Washington on the back foot. After the announcement, the US state department issued a ""fact sheet"" listing China's environmental abuses. A senior official in the Trump administration dismisses China's climate commitments as ""hollow political overtures"" and told the Financial Times that China had a record of ""deceitful environmental practices where its words do not match reality"".  China responded to US accusations with its own, labelling Washington a ""consensus-breaker"" that had brought about ""major retrogression"" in environmental policy.  The possibility of climate change becoming yet another point of friction between the world's two largest economies threatens to destabilise a process observers say will need Beijing's buy-in to avoid an even more rapidly heating planet. China has accounted for about two-thirds of the growth in global carbon dioxide emissions in the past two decades. US emissions peaked in 2007.  Mr Trump's Democratic rival in Tuesday's presidential election, Joe Biden, has made clear that climate change would be one of his administration's highest priorities. He has committed to rejoin the Paris agreement if he wins the election and to use climate policy as one of the cornerstones of efforts to revive the role of the US in global diplomacy.  ""A significant element of that will be holding the Chinese government accountable to its commitments,"" says one Biden campaign official, adding that the presidential candidate would seek to   pull together allies ""to put pressure on Beijing to ensure it does not shirk its vital responsibility to address climate change"".  Nations hoping to work with China will have to avoid being steamrollered, say critics, into endorsing practices they do not necessarily condone. For instance, Beijing often reaches targets by fiat, an approach that can achieve striking results but can also sideline communities and have devastating effects.  A drive to reclaim grassland in Inner Mongolia has turned local nomadic communities deemed responsible for desertification into ""ecological migrants"", who have been settled into newly built areas in cities, including Ordos. At the same time labour rights groups warn that the drive to consolidate and upgrade the coal industry risks mass layoffs for low-skilled workers.  The net-zero pledge is likely to intensify the best and the worst of China's approach to environmentalism, says Li Yifei, a scholar at New York University's Shanghai campus and co-author of a recent book on China's ""coercive environmentalism"".  ""It could translate into policy [measures] that intervene into every realm of social life,"" he says. ""These heavily industrial areas are becoming the forgotten parts of the Chinese economy. The traditional fossil fuels sector and the most environmentally destructive centres of the economy are being thrown under the bus.""  Peak emissions  The sheer scale of the transition involved in the Xi plan is huge. The Institute of Climate Change and Sustain able Development at Tsinghua University, an influential think-tank, has calculated what China needs to do to reshape its economy to meet, by 2050, the Paris accord target of keeping global temperatures within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels.  Under the most ambitious scenario, nonfossil fuel energy sources that accounted for 41 per cent of China's electricity production in 2019 will make up 90 per cent within 30 years. To hit that mark would require the development of wind and solar installations equivalent to about three times the current global capacity of wind and four times that of solar. Along with costs to electrify industry and transport, this transformation would require investment of Rmb135tn ($20tn), the report estimated.  The research was conducted prior to Mr Xi's announcement, but He Jiankun, an adviser to the government at Tsinghua University who led the research, believes that the recommendations for how to reach the 1.5C target align with the 2060 net-zero goal. China's next five year plan, which is to be released in March, is also expected to include an annual carbon dioxide emission cap of 10.5bn tonnes.  ""The main task of the [next] five year plan will be to ensure that emissions peak before 2030,"" Mr He says. After that turning point, the institute's research predicts a more rapid drop in emissions as renewable energy sources come online and technologies to capture carbon and improve efficiency mature.  Mr He says that new coal power plants are unlikely to mean a rise in overall consumption because of those greater efficiencies. In that scenario, new or  retrofitted plants would contribute to an overall reduction by replacing low-efficiency coal burnt by individuals with high efficiency equivalents, he adds.  But by allowing continued building of fossil fuel projects, China risks carbon ""lock-in"" from polluting projects that will be difficult to unwind, analysts warn. The scenarios mapped out by Mr He and other leading Chinese climate researchers remain cautious and leave open a risk of delayed investments in wind and solar, according to Yan Qin, an Oslo-based analyst for Refinitiv.  ""The government acknowledges the global trend towards net-zero emissions . . . but still wants to take the transition slowly. The [current] economic slowdown is the main concern,"" she says. Adding that, by ""allowing emissions to rise until the peak"", many scenarios leave room for negotiations with the powerful fossil fuel industry.  Policy shifts  Adding to the uncertainty over whether China can reach its targets in 2060 and even peak emissions before 2030 are the policy shifts for greening the economy. Instead of pouring subsidies into establishing wind and solar manufacturers the dominant approach for the past decade the state is shifting towards the use of new market-driven mechanisms, such as an emissions trading scheme, green finance and electricity spot market reforms.  A flurry of new announcements followed Mr Xi's pledge. Last week, five central government bodies released guidelines to bolster private and international investment in green bonds, to prioritise the growth in such finance. Half of all new vehicle sales by 2035 should   it was in 2014, even under a Biden administration. Due to America's failure to ratify both the Kyoto protocol and its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, ""the US has lost some credibility so it needs to have some humility,"" she adds. ""As the two largest emitters we cannot afford for these countries to not co-operate with each other on climate.""  This article has been amended to correct a currency calculation from US dollars to renminbi.  Letter in response to this article :  China has 'will, expertise and need' to back nuclear / From Rupert Boswall, Staplehurst, Kent, UK  be electric or hydrogen and a top official has reaffirmed plans to rollout carbon trading to new industries.  Yet, none of these initiatives alone will provide the necessary heft to push rapid climate reductions, analysts say. The emissions trading scheme, for example, has yet to be expanded beyond the power sector and is based on a measure of intensity, rather than clear-cut caps on total emissions.  China's ultimate success or failure as a driving force for averting climate disaster may happen beyond its borders. About 40 per cent of all China's overseas power plant financing from 2000 to 2019 was in coal, while only 11 per cent goes to renewable energy, according to data compiled by Boston University.  As such, global climate negotiators are determined to seize on China's apparent willingness to encourage stronger global efforts. Kelly Sims Gallagher, formerly a senior White House climate official who helped negotiate the 2014 climate accord between Mr Xi and President Barack Obama, says Mr Xi's new commitment is ""a very important step for China to make"", adding that Beijing had developed a record for keeping to past commitments on climate.  ""Given that China is the largest emitter currently, the sooner that it can achieve that peak and begin its pathway down, the lower cumulative emissions will be [creating] more flexibility for other developing countries to determine when they must peak,"" says Ms Gallagher, who now directs the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School, Tufts University.  But, says Ms Gallagher, it will be harder for the two countries to co-operate than it was in 2014, even under a Biden administration. Due to America‚Äôs failure to ratify both the Kyoto protocol and its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, ‚Äúthe US has lost some credibility so it needs to have some humility,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúAs the two largest emitters we cannot afford for these countries to not co-operate with each other on climate.‚Äù    "

Investors electrify South African
banks' sustainability push

Climate change Environmental disclosures have big implications for the financing of the region's fossil fuel projects, writes Joseph Cotterill
Joseph Cotterill

When South Africa's Standard Bank became the country's first company to table a climaterelated shareholder resolution last year, few expected investors to back moves forcing the bank to adopt and disclose policies on loans to new coal mines and power plants in Africa.

The bank is the largest lender to a continent that is both desperate for energy and exposed to climate change. At the same time, the bank's home country relies heavily on coal to generate most of its power.

Garnering 55 per cent support, the vote passed ""to everyone's shock, including our own ‚Ä¶ it was the first time we had done this"", says Tracey Davies, executive director of Just Share, a non-profit group that promotes shareholder activism and responsible investing in South Africa.

The vote for a coal lending policy marked a watershed moment, although only 38 per cent of shareholders at the meeting backed wider climate disclosures by the bank.

In the year since, there has been a wave of public commitments by South African banks to incorporate climate risk into lending ‚Äî a shift with profound implications for access to capital for energy projects in the region.

Recent climate risk resolutions that were tabled by South African banks themselves, including Investec and Nedbank, all had overwhelming votes in favour ‚Äî ""a strong indication that shareholders want banks to provide them with climate disclosures"", particularly with regards to the share of loans that have climate risks, according to Ms Davies.

In October, Standard Bank published its own disclosures, which revealed R67bn ($4.2bn), or 4.4 per cent, of the bank's credit exposures were linked to fossil fuels, versus R12bn to renewables.

""There's been a very rapid shift at all of the banks in understanding that this is a serious risk, and that they need to up their game in terms of disclosure. They have all done a lot,"" says Ms Davies.

This year, Investec became South Africa's first bank to detail a financing policy across all fossil fuels, and Standard Bank is preparing to release a similar policy by early next year.

What looks like sudden change reflects the build-up of quiet, behindthe-scenes shifts over time, says Wendy Dobson, Standard Bank's head of group corporate citizenship. ""We have reached a tipping point,"" she says. South Africa's financial regulators have taken more interest in climate risk in the banking system and institutional investors have added their voice, she says.

Standard Bank's latest climate disclosures allow investors ""to get a sense of what kind of risk appetite the bank is taking in these sectors ‚Ä¶ that allows them to make decisions about what they want to be invested in"", says Ms Dobson. The disclosures are also intended as a work in progress, she adds. ""We still don't have a definitive approach to definitions and methodologies ‚Ä¶ This is very much something that is evolving.""

The biggest question may be defining how these new policies will relate to Africa's own challenges, with both global temperature rises and the need for its economies to catch up.

Standard Bank's latest disclosures hint at how it believes climate change could ravage African economies and drive banking losses, including a warning that R111bn of agricultural lending is exposed to ""elevated physical risk"".

At the same time, less than half of Africans have access to grid electricity, and fewer gigawatts have been installed south of the Sahara desert than in Spain.

""We are in a different context in Africa ‚Äî we are still dealing with fundamental challenges of people having access to power,"" Ms Dobson says. Standard Bank is being guided by the Paris Agreement, which allows poorer countries more time to make a transition away from fossil fuels, she adds.

None of the South African banks'policies forbid loans to build newafrican coal mines or power stationsoutright, even though coal is generally a small part of their energy portfolios.

Investec ‚Äî which has less than onefifth of its energy portfolio in coal ‚Äî""will only finance new coal miningtransactions or the expansion of‚Äî ongoing operations if there is a comprehensive socio-economic motivation"" that senior leadership hasagreed is valid, according to its newfinancing policy.

""A lot of these policies will exclude South Africa's current plans ‚Äî but basically say that if the opportunity arose elsewhere in Africa, we would consider it,"" says Robyn Hugo, director of climate change engagement at Just Share.

In any case, Ms Hugo says, oil and gas are overtaking coal as the next bigarea of contention for banks' climatepolicies in Africa. Natural gas in particular is being classed by banks as a""transition fuel"" that can help economic development while producingrelatively fewer greenhouse gasesthan coal.

At stake are some of the biggestcapital projects in the continent.They range from LNG (liquefied natural gas) development in Mozambique, where France's Total recentlyarranged the region's largest debt financing at $15bn, to the world'slongest heated oil pipeline in easternAfrica that would link oilfields inUganda to ports in Tanzania. Standard Bank is lending to both.

South Africa's latest energy planalso signalled a greater role for natural gas to speed the country's transition from ageing coal plants.

Activists argue that many Africancountries will see little energy security benefit from oil pipelines andLNG terminals focused on exports torich nations ‚Äî and that far from beinga transition fuel, natural gas will become deadweight infrastructureGiven the pace of change in globalemissions targets.

These activists also argue that African bankers should be fleshing out renewables lending policies instead,""as prices for solar, wind and othersources drop and reliability of suchprojects increases. Lenders ""are stillrelying on old arguments about fossil ""fuel baseload"" or favouring coal, oil and gas to supply bedrock demand, Ms Davies says.

Standard Bank's latest climate disclosures ays that renewables ""provide great potential for African energy utilities"", but it adds that renewables generation in the region is still limited and that hydropower ‚Äî Africa's biggest renewable ‚Äî supplies only 16 per cent of the continent's power.

Even after the past year of change, it is unclear whether shareholders in South African banks will continue to thrash out climate issues at annual general meetings. After the breakthrough vote by its shareholders in 2019, Standard Bank did not table climate risk resolutions put to it by Just Share and the Raith Foundation this year. It said its board's decision ""not to allow the usurping of its role by stakeholders that do not have any fiduciary responsibilities to the com‚Äîpany does not suggest that the board is deviating from its environmentally responsible‚Ä¶path"". Despite the wrangling, the terms of the debate have changed and bank shareholders can now compare climate policies across lenders, Ms Davies says. ""Certainly, we have come a long way."" "

US pension funds failing in climate change challenge
Chris Flood

Fewer than one-in-five pension funds in North America have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions across their portfolios by 2050 according to a study that underlines the need to accelerate the fight against climate change in the world's largest pensions market.

Just 17 per cent of North American pensions funds aim to reach net zero by the middle of the century while a further 8 per cent expect to reach that target at a later date, according to the Aviva Investors analysis.

Four out of every 10 pension funds in both Asia and Europe have already committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, more than twice as high as in the US where the Trump administration has played down the risks of global warming.

However, devastating wildfires in California, which have burnt more than 2m acres of land, have led to calls from pressure groups for pension funds in the golden state to divest entirely from fossil fuels.

The investment arm of UK insurer Aviva polled 535 pension funds and 532 insurance companies from 34 countries with combined assets of more than‚Ç¨2tn to assess how sentiment among institutional investors was shifting during the coronavirus pandemic.

The EU has created a green taxonomy to encourage more sustainable investing in contrast to the US where the Department of Labor is insisting that private pension administrators must prove that they will not sacrifice financial returns by incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their asset allocation decisions. The DoL's narrow interpretation of an administrator's fiduciary duty which focuses purely on financial returns has restricted US pension plans' room for manoeuvre.

The $412bn California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) and Wespath, which manages $24bn on behalf of the United Methodist Church, are the only US pension plans to have signed up to the UN-backed Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, a coalition of thirty of the world's largest asset owners that have committed to cutting the carbon emissions linked to companies they invest in by up to 29 per cent within the next four years.*

The alliance's chair, G√ºnther Thallinger, said ""many discussions"" were ongoing. ""We recognise that achieving net zero carbon emissions is a very big commitment which requires big changes to the investment management processes and portfolios of pension funds,"" said Mr Thallinger, who is also a board member at Allianz, the German insurer.

""Asset owners have to protect their portfolios from threats such as climate change if they are to fulfil their fiduciary duties. Pension funds have a clear responsibility to consider the climate impact of the businesses that they own as shareholders,"" he said.

Almost half of the insurance companies in Europe and Asia which were surveyed by Aviva have already signalled a commitment to reaching net zero by 2050.

""Sustainable investments were seen as an expensive 'nice to have' through much of the last decade,"" said Mark Versey, chief investment officer for real assets at Aviva Investors. ""Now, however, almost eight-in-10 global investors believe that the pursuit of achieving ESG objectives is no longer at the expense of financial returns."" "

How to predict the next pandemic ‚Äî and stop it

There are about 700,000 viruses with the potential to infect humans ‚Äî and climate change is exacerbating the spread. Leslie Hook meets the scientists working to keep the next epidemic at bay

Y anthe Nobel walks through the rainforest, looking for a corpse. Reports of a dead elephant, lying in a stream, have reached camp and her job is to figure out what killed it. It's not the poachers she is worried about ‚Äî they are increasingly rare here in the Dzanga-Sangha Special Reserve in the Central African Republic. It is the pathogens.

When she and her colleagues find the dead elephant, it turns out to be a baby, less than a year old. Nobel dresses in full protective gear ‚Äî gown, face shield, gloves ‚Äî and starts taking samples. ""Anthrax is very common around here,"" she says, referring to the deadly bacteria that lives in soil as one possible culprit.

""It could also be that its mother was poached,"" she tells me over Skype, back in camp.

Nobel, a vet and PhD student in epidemiology, has come to Dzanga-Sangha to study viruses, mainly in bats and rodents. Elephants are not usually part of the job ‚Äî but when a dead animal is found in the forest, she always performs a necropsy. If the cause of death isn't obvious, and none of the usual pathogens shows up in the field lab, the samples are sent on to a bigger lab in Germany. ""You always look for something new,"" she says. In the bigger lab, the samples are tested for unknown viruses ‚Äî pathogens that have not been seen before.

Hunting for new viruses has become more difficult during an actual pandemic, but it has never been more important. This year, Covid-19 has brought some of the most powerful countries in the world to their knees. Like most other novel human viruses, Sars-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19, is zoonotic: it crossed from animals into humans. In this case, probably from a bat to a person, or through an intermediary animal.

""As a veterinarian, I am already trained to see the danger of spillovers from animals to people,"" says Nobel, who studies at the Robert Koch Institute's Leendertz Lab, which specialises in the ecology of zoonotic disease. Covid-19 has put this in the spotlight, she adds. ""People are waking up to a story that was already there.""

For years, epidemiologists and the World Health Organization planned for the advent of an unknown illness ‚Äî often referred to as ""Disease X"". It would be highly contagious, not previously identified and cause a major international epidemic.

In other words: a lot like Covid-19. But even though everyone knew something like this might come along, no one found it until the virus had already infected dozens of people in Wuhan, China.

Zoonotic viruses are responsible for a long list of illnesses: HIV, Ebola, Sars, Zika and swine flu, to name just a few. And more are emerging all the time ‚Äî each year, between two and five new zoonotic viruses are discovered. This year alone has seen several zoonotic outbreaks in addition to Covid-19. There was an Ebola surge in the Democratic Republic of Congo ‚Äî where the disease has claimed thousands of lives ‚Äî and a spike in Lassa fever cases in Nigeria. Over the past three decades, outbreaks of zoonotic disease have increased.

The diseases don't emerge from just anywhere. Often they come from rainforest edges and places of great diversity, where humans and animal species are mingling. These ""hotspots"", where diseases are more likely to spill over from animals to humans, are closely linked to environmental change such as deforestation.

""Tropical rainforests are exceptionally important in this regard,"" says Tom Gillespie, who leads a lab studying pathogens and environmental change at Emory University. ""Here you have a diversity of bats, rodents, primates ‚Äî the species where we are most likely to contract something ‚Äî [so] you are going to have a diversity of pathogens as well.""

The actual work of hunting for viruses is tough. Nobel has just returned to base after two weeks of catching bats at a bush camp, and shows me the deep scratches around her ankles from walking through the forest. Sleeping in tents, showering under a waterfall and staying clear of the elephant herds can make for exhausting days.

This year, Covid-19 has made things even harder for her and other researchers. Though there have not yet been any cases in this corner of the Central African Republic, the local lab is equipped to run PCR tests for the virus, and researchers are taking extra precautions, including wearing masks around the great apes, who could be at risk of catching Covid-19 from humans.

This is one of the most remote forests of Africa, but the research is central to understanding our changing relationship to nature and disease. Climate change adds complexity to this task, as insects shift their ranges and plants bear fruit at different times, creating more potential for new species to mix. But if we knew more about viruses ‚Äî how they act and which animals they infect ‚Äî could it equip us better the next time a ""Disease X"" comes around? Viruses have been on the planet for millions of years, much longer than Homo sapiens. Not quite technically ""alive"", a virus is a strand of genetic code enclosed in a protein sheath and needs a living host to reproduce. We know about only a tiny fraction of the viruses in the world, although the work of finding them has sped up recently with the advent of genetic sequencing. There are about 1.6 million viruses on the planet in mammals and birds, of which about 700,000 could have the potential to infect humans. But of these, only about 250 have been identified in humans. The rest are still out there ‚Äî they just haven't made the leap.

One of the world's most prominent virus-hunters is Peter Piot, who co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976. He explains that viruses are so nimble because they are always looking for their next host.

""What is the raison d'√™tre of a virus? It is to find a host to survive,"" he tells me. ""Because viruses cannot multiply without a living cell ... viruses need susceptible plants, animals, humans, so they have to find them and then jump from one to another.""

Viruses typically lurk in a reservoir host ‚Äî a plant or animal that can harbour them without getting sick ‚Äî and then become more problematic when they cross into a new species.

Speaking over the phone on a recent autumn morning, Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, is in a pensive mood. He is concerned that coronavirus will not be our last deadly epidemic.

""We are living in the age of pandemics,"" he says, sounding a bit short of breath, a reflection of his own encounter with Covid-19 earlier this year. ""I think we are going to see more and more of them, and the fundamental reason is that we failed to live in harmony with nature."" He points to the factors that make disease emergence more likely, such as deforestation and the illegal trade in wild animals. Forests cover about a third of land on Earth, but they are being cut down, often to make way for cash crops or cattle farming. Every minute, forests the size of 35 football pitches are cleared.

""This probably started already when we became sedentary, from nomads,"" Piot says. ""And I'm not saying we should go back and live like nomads. But when you put it all together ‚Äî population pressure, urbanisation, agricultural practices, deforestation, high mobility ... and then climate change is going to make all these things worse.""

As the planet warms up, it is changing the patterns of disease. Insects that carry zoonotic diseases, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are expanding their range and moving into new areas. Lyme disease is spreading into North America and across Europe, recently prompting the European Centre for Disease Control to launch a monitoring programme for the illness, which is carried by ticks.

Extreme weather events such as drought and flooding also have a big impact. For diseases like dengue fever, heavy rains make its spread more likely by creating breeding grounds for the mosquito that carries it. Last year there were a record number of dengue cases in Latin America ‚Äî more than three million ‚Äî amid concerns that climate change will exacerbate the disease.

While these are not new viruses, they are spreading in new areas and interacting with trends such as deforestation in ways that we don't yet fully understand. As humans impact the planet in both obvious and non-obvious ways, by some counts new viruses are appearing more frequently. The broad outlines of how these diseases emerge are clear: they typically come from animals, spilling over into humans through close contact. And the places where this is most likely to happen are also known: disturbed land, fragmented habitats and wildlife markets. Knowing all this didn't stop the world from suffering through coronavirus. But maybe, just maybe, it will help us get it right next time ‚Äî or at least improve our chances.

Dennis Carroll certainly thinks so. He has spent nearly his whole life looking for viruses and is leading an ambitious project to find more of them ‚Äî all of them, in fact.

Sporting shoulder-length white hair and a silver-and-turquoise bracelet, Carroll looks a bit like the godfather of viral research. And in a way he is: he spent a decade leading a $200m virushunting programme called ""Predict"" at the United States Agency for International Development. Now he is the head of the Global Virome Project, a research group with a mission to catalogue all the viruses that could pose a threat to human health.

We speak via Zoom; a Tibetan thangka painting hanging on the wall behind Carroll signals how much time he has spent chasing viruses in various corners of the world. And while over recent months he has been sheltering on his houseboat on the Potomac River near Washington, the pandemic has lent a new urgency to the project.

""The Global Virome Project is basically about going to the viruses before they come to us, and putting together a comprehensive database,"" he says. ""If we had this data, we would have picked up Covid-19 in October [2019], for instance.""

That's a bold claim ‚Äî but Carroll likes to dream big. He believes our response to novel viruses is limited because we don't know about them in advance, before they start infecting humans. ""Whatever the next event will be ‚Äî and we know there will be another event ‚Äî it's already out there,"" he says. He refers to these unknown viruses as ""viral dark matter"".

To build this database will be expensive. Carroll estimates it would take about $1.6bn and at least 10 years to find 75 per cent of the 1.6m viruses ‚Äî or, if they can raise the funds, about $3bn to capture 90 per cent of viruses. The Global Virome Project is working on fundraising from governments, philanthropic foundations and tech companies.

For years, the US was the biggest funder of this type of research through USAID's Emerging Pandemic Threats programme, which Carroll led. This included Predict, which catalogued and sequenced more than 900 novel viruses. But USAID decided to pull its funding for Predict under the Trump administration in 2019, just before the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the programme now shuttered, several of its leading scientists are working with the Global Virome Project to carry on the research.

The Global Virome Project is considered something of a moonshot in the scientific community: even if all those viruses were identified, we might not be able to tell which ones are contagious and threatening to humans.

""What is key to know is which ones are the viruses that can, for humans, not only infect but have the ability to be transmitted from humans to humans ‚Äî and science is not yet there,"" says Piot. ""Humans are probably becoming infected with viruses from animals all the time but in most cases it is aborted, in the sense that it may cause a problem in one person, but that is it.""

Some researchers say the funding could be better used elsewhere. ""There is a huge amount of marketing around this idea that it could stop the next pandemic,"" says Kris Murray, who previously worked as part of the Predict programme and is an associate professor at the MRC Unit The Gambia, at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. ""The big problem is it is far, far too many viruses to shortlist. It starts to look like a very long list of things that will just never make it into people.""

Continued from page 14 But supporters say that the research at Predict has already helped in the fight against Covid-19, and the Global Virome Project will too.

""We discovered more than 100 novel coronaviruses, we also identified more than 60 known coronaviruses and started to expand dramatically the information on what hosts they're in,"" says Jonna Mazet, a professor of epidemiology at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, who was the principal investigator for Predict and is now on the board of the GVP.

Some of those coronaviruses were used to examine whether the drug remdesivir ‚Äî currently the only retroviral approved for use against Covid-19 in the US ‚Äî could be effective against coronavirus, she says, adding: ""And even if it doesn't help us prevent, it prepares us to have the data to be ready to jump into action.""

One thing that scientists agree on is just how little we know about what's out there. We haven't identified all the mammals on the planet, let alone all the viruses. And even the viruses we have identified often remain mysterious. Ebola is one example: scientists have not been able to confirm which animal the virus resides in, also known as the reservoir host. Influenza viruses are another: because they mutate so quickly, a broad vaccine has never been possible.

""Every time we're out there doing long-term surveillance, we're finding new species of vertebrates,"" says Tom Gillespie. Take bats: about 1,400 species have been identified so far, and that number goes up each year. Bats are particularly interesting to epidemiologists, because they harbour so many viruses that can be harmful for humans, including Sars and Ebola.

Gillespie's work focuses on monkeys and great apes, which often act as sentinels for pathogens that impact humans because of their genetic similarity to us. Sometimes they can pass viruses to humans ‚Äî HIV crossed over from chimpanzees ‚Äî but humans can also pass viruses to apes (something of particular concern during Covid-19).

Gillespie has done research in the trinational area in central Africa close to Dzanga-Sangha, a region famous for its gorillas. Research on the front lines is very difficult, he says, which is partly why he is among those sceptical of efforts to catalogue all the viruses in the world. Gillespie has been chased by elephants and armed poachers, and contracted a fair number of tropical diseases, including severe haemorrhagic dengue, which took several months to recover from. ""We are going to the places no one wants to go,"" is how he puts it. ""It's very uncomfortable.""

Viruses are even more diverse than mammals, he explains, because they do not have a common origin.

""Every time we look for viruses, either in vectors or in hosts, we find new things, and they often challenge our understanding of the diversity of the viruses that are out there.""

Another thing scientists can agree on is that destruction of the natural world makes it more likely that new viruses will emerge and spill over into human populations. Cutting down forests, planting single-crop plantations for palm oil and operating large livestock farms can all increase human contact with emerging diseases.

""It doesn't matter if you are a gorilla or a human, if you have a disturbed forest, you have a shift,"" says Fabian Leendertz, head of the Leendertz Lab at the Robert Koch Institute and Nobel's PhD adviser. ""You suddenly have diseases which become very abundant which were not abundant before. Things come into contact which were not supposed to be in contact. Some things die out, others become superabundant ... So you have a higher likelihood of disease being transmitted, that is clear.""

Habitat destruction also means that only the hardiest species survive ‚Äî the very species most likely to carry disease. One example is the multimammate mouse, a common species in west Africa and the carrier of Lassa fever. The mouse appears to thrive in degraded landscapes such as agricultural plantations and around households, and Lassa cases have been increasing over time, killing thousands of people each year.

Another issue is landscape fragmentation: Gillespie's research shows that a tipping point occurs when about 40 per cent of an area has been destroyed. ""That's when everything starts pouring out,"" he says. ""Animals are behaving in very different ways than they normally would just to survive. They're looking for food.""

We do not yet know whether a similar dynamic might have contributed to the emergence of Sars-Cov-2, which is believed to reside in a type of horseshoe bat as its reservoir host. From there the virus may have crossed directly into humans, or transferred through an intermediary such as a pangolin. The suspected role of the pangolin in Covid-19 ‚Äî although still unconfirmed ‚Äî points to another factor which was almost certainly in play: the illegal wildlife trade. Trafficking rare animals also traffics their viruses.

With the world in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a focus on finding solutions like never before ‚Äî and not just for this virus but for the viruses to come. Vaccine research is one area already benefiting from this surge in investment ‚Äî and an area where the hunt for new viruses could help in the long term.

One group in this field is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi, which was set up with backing from the Gates Foundation to work on vaccines for emerging diseases. This year it is leading the Covax initiative, which is developing a vaccine for Sars-Cov-2. (Nine vaccines are under development, of which eight are already undergoing clinical trials.) Melanie Saville, Cepi's director of vaccine research, strikes a rare note of optimism. ""Sars-Cov-2 is an example where things are getting better all the time in terms of vaccine development,"" she says, adding that knowing more about what viruses are out there is important because it can guide research.

""There area finite number of virus families, 25 or 26, and people do see that some of those families are more likely to have an emerging epidemic,"" Saville says. ""So working on viruses in those families you can learn an awful lot, even if that isn't an exact match of what will come in the future."" When Sars-Cov-2 came along, previous research on Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which is also caused by a type of coronaright virus, helped accelerate vaccine development.

Cepi and others are also trying to develop vaccines that could target entire families of viruses, though that goal has been elusive so far. Sometimes the barriers to development are not just scientific: pharmaceutical companies have been reluctant to invest in vaccines for diseases that impact poor and remote populations. One example is Lassa fever, which has been around for 50 years but with no vaccine developed yet. Part of the reason Cepi was set up is to address these gaps. (It has six vaccines in progress for Lassa fever.) Developing futuristic broad vaccines and cataloguing every zoonotic virus on the planet are both compelling ideas ‚Äî but many years away from becoming reality. What else can be done in the meantime? Addressing the environmental destruction at the root of many new diseases is one option, albeit a difficult one. The logging of the Amazon rainforest ‚Äî another hotspot for disease emergence ‚Äî is of particular concern now for ecologists and epidemiologists. But two approaches stand out that may be able to make a difference in the near term. One is to monitor human health more closely in hotspot areas so that new diseases can be spotted and treated more quickly. Another is to incorporate ecology more closely into public health decisions.

Tying human health programmes together with wildlife monitoring is already starting to happen in some areas. In some parts of Brazil, for example, primates are tested for yellow fever, so that humans living nearby can be vaccinated if necessary. Climate patterns and seasonal weather variations can be used to predict the timing and intensity of diseases such as dengue and cholera.

Researchers on the front lines say it is impossible to separate human health from the health of our natural world. Christian Happi, head of the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases in Ede, Nigeria, is setting up an early-warning programme that will detect disease in humans and report the findings to local health authorities.

""I don't think the next pandemic is going to be predicted by some machine learning or some algorithm,"" says Happi, a professor of molecular biology, whose lab diagnosed the first case of Ebola in Nigeria. ""You have to be on the ground. What is needed is to set up a very solid and strong surveillance system that enables people to detect these pathogens in real time, and then make this information available.""

Growing up in Cameroon, Happi wanted to study biology after watching many of his childhood friends die from malaria. Now he is on a mission to set up more diagnostic capacity in Africa so that samples don't have to be sent off to labs in Europe. ""These outbreaks always start in small places and we need to empower people working there, those front-line healthcare workers,"" he says.

He also is setting up a new surveillance network called Sentinel, aimed at improving detection of known and unknown viruses across western and central Africa.

The economic devastation caused by Covid-19 has also renewed discussion about ways to decrease the risk of viruses spilling over closer to their source. A recent paper in Science estimated that spending about $30bn annually on measures such as reducing deforestation and curbing wildlife trafficking would pay for itself many times over by decreasing the risk of the next pandemic. ""A major effort to retain intact forest cover would have a large return on investment, even if its only benefit was to reduce virus emergence events,"" it stated.

As the world fights on against Covid-19, researchers say that there are some silver linings. It has triggered a huge amount of investment and research. Scientists are collaborating more across fields ? critical for an area such as zoonotic disease, which cuts across ecology, epidemiology and molecular biology. Advances in genetic sequencing could arm us better when the next virus arrives. And there is a fresh acknowledgment that human health is deeply connected to the health of our planet. ""A wake-up call is an understatement,"" says Piot, director of LSHTM. ""If Covid doesn't do it, I don't know what it will take.""

Asset managers warned over 'insufficient' climate risk reporting
Matthew Vincent

Asset managers are not providing enough information about climate risks at the companies they invest in to enable clients to make informed choices, a regulatory task force has warned.

Despite record inflows to funds that invest according to environmental, social and governance principles - taking their assets under management above $1tn this year - the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures has found ""reporting to their clients . . . is likely insufficient"".

In its third annual status report, published on Thursday, the TCFD said climate risk reporting by asset managers had increased since 2017. However, it concluded that ""reporting by these organisations to their clients and beneficiaries may not be sufficient and that more progress may be needed to ensure clients and beneficiaries have the right information to make financial decisions"".

According to the TFCD, climate risk reporting by asset managers is essential, given the role they play in the allocation of capital. Their responsibility ""includes obtaining information from investee companies, and providing their clients and beneficiaries with decision-useful information"", it said.

The task force was created in 2015 during the Paris climate negotiations as a market-driven initiative, and was backed by Mark Carney, then governor of the Bank of England and now a UN special envoy for climate action and finance. Former SEC chair Mary Schapiro leads its secretariat.

Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire media executive who chairs the body, stressed the need for better-informed capital allocation when launching the report. ""The more companies know about their risks and opportunities related to climate change, and the more information investors have, the better we'll be able to allocate resources and make progress,"" he said.

More work will now be carried out by the task force ""to better understand"" asset managers' reporting of climate risks.

The report said companies also needed to make progress on climate risk disclosures. To date, more than 1,500 organisations have expressed their support for the TCFD's recommendations, which represents an increase of more than 85 per cent since 2019.

A review of their reports also found that disclosure of climate-related financial information in line with those recommendations had ""steadily increased"" in the past three years. However, the report said disclosure of the financial impacts on businesses ""remains low"".

Only one in 15 of the companies reviewed disclosed any information on the resilience of their strategies, under different climate scenarios. This was ""significantly lower"" than the proportion of companies making other climate disclosures.

Overall, 42 per cent of companies with a market capitalisation of $10bn or more gave their investors at least some of the information recommended by the TCFD in 2019. European companies led the way, ranking highest for 10 of the task force's 11 recommended disclosures. But companies in North America were best at communicating climate-related ""risks and opportunities"". In sector terms, energy companies, builders and materials suppliers provided the most climate information.

Progress towards the TCFD's end-goals remains slow, though. If the growth rate in climate disclosures since 2017 remained constant in coming years, companies would not be providing all 11 pieces of information that the task force recommends until 2029.

Some regulators are now taking action to increase disclosure levels. In March next year, new EU regulation is due to come into force making the online publication of sustainability impacts mandatory. Earlier this year, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said all London-listed companies would soon have to make the climate-related disclosures prescribed by the TCFD - or explain why they cannot.

BlackRock and Vanguard in climate storm

Financials'A lot of them will say ""we will vote for someone's else's resolution"", but why aren't they filing their own'Hohn calls for big asset managers to challenge groups on global warming
ATTRACTA MOONEY INVESTMENT CORRESPONDENT

Billionaire hedge fund manager Christopher Hohn has accused BlackRock and Vanguard of acting like sheep when it comes to climate change, arguing that large asset managers are taking ""insufficient and ineffective action"" on global warming.

Sir Christopher, through his charity The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, has written to seven of the world's biggest asset managers, calling on them to force companies around the world to set out transition plans towards a low-carbon world.

His letters are the latest example of the intense scrutiny facing the $89tn asset management industry over its role in tackling climate change. Many large fund managers, which have immense sway over the world's biggest businesses, have warned that global warming could hit investment returns. But Sir Christopher accused ""most asset managers"" of ""total greenwash"", arguing they were far too complacent about the risks of global warming.

""The asset management industry is a joke in respect to what they are actually doing [around climate change],"" he said. ""They talk but they don't actually do anything effective.""

In the letters, Sir Christopher and CIFF chairman Graeme Sweeney said asset managers such as BlackRock should ""show leadership"", calling on them to file shareholder resolutions at annual meetings that ask companies to prepare transition plans to reduce their carbon emissions.

Sir Christopher's hedge fund, TCI, is already taking this approach, including at Spanish airport operator Aena, which this week agreed to back his demands for an annual shareholder vote on its climate plans.

However, only a handful of big asset managers have filed motions over climate change at annual meetings in recent years, despite the investment industry becoming increasingly outspoken about the risks of global warming. Coalitions of smaller investors have instead filed the majority of shareholder resolutions on climate change.

""Asset managers are sheep,"" Sir Christopher said. ""A lot of them will say 'we will vote for someone's else's resolution', but why aren't they filing their own resolutions?"" Mr Sweeney added: ""The major breakthrough with Aena shows that this approach is possible. It is not difficult for leading investors to table such resolutions. They are choosing not to do so."" The pair said the voting records of BlackRock, Vanguard, Capital Group, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and State Street Global Investors on big climate resolutions were appalling. They added that JPMorgan Asset Management's voting record was weak. ""Pension funds should fire asset managers that fail to use their voting rights to ensure companies produce credible transition plans for net zero [carbon emissions],"" Sir Christopher said. ""Pension consultants also need to wake up to this.""

Vanguard said it ""cares deeply about the long-term impact of climate change and we continue to engage with company leaders and boards on this important issue"".

BlackRock has begun voting against directors over climate concerns and is reviewing its engagement priorities, which includes looking at how it votes on shareholder resolutions.

Investors urge European companies to include climate risks in accounts
Attracta Mooney

More than 30 of Europe's largest companies, including Anglo American, BMW, EDF and Lufthansa, have been urged to include climate change risks in their financial statements as concerns grow that corporate accounts no longer reflect the longer-term outlook.

A group of 38 investors overseeing more than $9tn in assets have written to the chair of the audit committee at each of the companies, calling on them to ensure their financial statements reflect the implications of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit temperature increases to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

Investors are concerned that corporate accounts have become disjointed from businesses' public statements on climate change, with many groups setting out plans to cut their carbon emissions but not reflecting this position in their financial outlook.

The investor letter, which was signed by JPMorgan Asset Management, Fidelity International and M&G Investments, said: ""The accounts are key to how capital is deployed by management as well as investors. If the accounts leave out material climate risks, too much capital will go towards activities that put shareholder capital at risk. Worse still, this puts all our futures at risk.""

Some companies have already changed their financial outlook because of climate risks, following investor pressure. Earlier this year, BP said it would slash up to $17.5bn from the value of its oil and gas assets on the expectation of lower long-term oil prices. Royal Dutch Shell and Total also adjusted accounting judgments, resulting in material impairments.

""Companies can no longer afford to ignore what climate change means for their business. Investors need financial impacts of getting on to a net zero pathway to be booked and acted on,"" said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which brought the investors together.

The letter also called for adjustments to critical accounting assumptions and estimates to ensure they are consistent with achieving so-called net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It said board directors should explain whether they had room to pay dividends if investments were needed to meet environmental goals.

Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at UK asset manager Sarasin and Partners and author of the investor expectations, said the world had reached a ""crossroads in our battle against climate change"" and financial statements that took account of the Paris agreement would ""drive system-wide capital redeployment . . . thereby protecting capital for all"".

Insight Investments, the big fixed income asset manager, the Church of England's investment funds and DWS, the asset manager that was spun out of Deutsche Bank, also signed the letter, as well as several pension funds.

Last week, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak said the UK would become the first country in the world to force big public and private companies to provide climate-related information in their financial accounts.

A separate review by the Financial Reporting Council, the UK audit watchdog, last week found that few listed companies currently made any reference to climate change in their financial statements.

Burgundy's vineyards feel the heat of climate change
Jancis Robinson

For most French people who can afford it, the summer holiday is sacrosanct. Long before Covid-19, offices, shops and restaurants in France were routinely closed for the entire month of August.

However, as in the rest of France, Burgundy's vignerons have had to reshape their annual schedules. July is the latest they can safely go on holiday now that climate change is moving their harvest dates inexorably forward. This year marked the earliest grape harvest ever in many important wine regions, not least Burgundy.

The first grapes were picked there on August 12 and the harvest was well under way by the third week of the month. It used to start a good month later.

At Domaine Michel Lafarge in Volnay, one of Burgundy's most respected producers, the 2020 vintage ripened so much earlier than expected that there wasn't time to move the 2019s before the new crop arrived. Sylvain Pataille got back from holiday on August 24 with just four frantic days to prepare his team, winery and picking equipment before the start of the harvest in Marsannay at the northern end of Burgundy's heartland, the Cote d'Or.

Marianne and Pierre Duroch√© in Gevrey-Chambertin, whose delicate red burgundies are all the rage, had made plans to fly back from their holiday in Canada on August 21. In the end, they couldn't travel to North America because of Covid-19, which saved them from being disastrously late for the start of their 2020 harvest.

The pandemic made an extraordinary vintage exceptional in other ways too. The picking teams had to be socially distanced, for example, and there was none of the usual end-of-harvest jollity. On a recent trip to Burgundy to taste the 2019s, Lo√Øc Dugat of Domaine Dugat-Py described to me how, instead of feeding everyone companionably inside, gloved employees issued the pickers with airline-style pre-packaged meals in the vineyard. To celebrate finishing, the team had to make do with an aperitif in the courtyard.

As Dugat (who now takes his holidays in December) pointed out, vignerons are having to get used to the fact that grapes ripen much faster in the long, hot days of August than they do at the end of September. It is vital, therefore, that they are picked quickly, so he has doubled his picking team from 30 to 60 for just 10 hectares of vines. By contrast, Guillaume d'Angerville of Volnay halved his picking team this year to 20 because of Covid-19 and was delighted to find that productivity was by no means halved. In his father's time, picking was spread out over a fortnight; now they must do it in just a week.

In the hot, dry summers to which Burgundians are becoming accustomed, the problem of sunburned grapes challenges growers who struggled to ripen them less than a generation ago. On arrival at the cellar, the crop used to be sorted for grapes that had rotted in the rain. These days, those at the sorting table need to pick out all the scorched grapes without an ounce of juice. Mid-afternoon is when the risk of sunburn is highest, exacerbated if there are vestiges of vine treatments on the grapes. (Producers were keen to stress that any treatments would be organic.)

Meanwhile, Lalou Bize-Leroy of Domaine Leroy in Vosne-Roman√©e was particularly thrilled with the quality of her 2020 grapes and claims that, thanks to her high-trained, exceptionally leafy vines, none of hers were burnt and all of them were superbly healthy. A leading practitioner of lunar-influenced biodynamic viticulture, she describes her 2020 vintage as ""great"" - even better than 2018 and 2019. Her 2020 alcohol levels are sometimes as high as 15 per cent but the wines are balanced, she assures me. Certainly no one I met in Burgundy complained of low acid levels in 2019 or 2020 - the acid was concentrated, along with the sugar, in the small, sun-dried berries.

Although Bize-Leroy's unusual methods were initially ridiculed, unsurprisingly more and more growers are starting to copy them for their most valuable vines. It is costly in terms of labour - she keeps a permanent vineyard staff of between 12 and 24 people to cosset her 22 hectares - but it does seem to yield results.

This summer was not just hot but extremely dry - so dry that Denis Bachelet of Gevrey-Chambertin seemed in the depths of despair at the number of his older ones that had perished in the drought. It is usually young vines that are most at risk in dry summers because their roots have not had time to penetrate deeply into the soil but this year both Bachelet and Jean-Fran√ßois Coche of Meursault were stunned by the effects of drought on their older vines as well. Irrigating anything other than baby vines is banned in France. I naively asked Bachelet whether there was a move to ask the authorities for permission to irrigate. ""Where would we find the water?"" he replied.

The vinifications were finished so early in September that wine producers now find themselves unexpectedly idle - not least because Covid-19 has dramatically shrunk the number of visitors expected during the popular autumn tasting season. Vintners are busy doing maintenance jobs they used to do in the depths of winter.

Presumably the dry summer was at least appreciated by the bevy of builders I saw in the region. Morey-St-Denis has been invaded by those building new cellars for Bernard Arnault at Clos des Lambrays, Fran√ßois Pinault at Clos de Tart and the Seysses family at Domaine Dujac. In Gevrey-Chambertin, the landscape is dominated by the crane for the Rousseaus' new cellar and the stack of portacabins needed to direct reconstruction of Domaine Rebourseau for yet another prominent French businessman, Martin Bouygues.

Arnault, Pinault and Bouygues all bought into fashionable - but changing - Burgundy in the past six years. I wonder whether their staff did full analyses of the likely effects of climate change before they invested their millions. "

Aena first to grant annual vote on climate policy
ATTRACTA MOONEY

Aena, the Spanish airports operator, is set to become the first company to give shareholders an annual vote on its efforts to tackle climate change, submitting to pressure from Chris Hohn, the UK hedge fund manager.

The billionaire's TCI Fund Management has for a year been at odds with Aena, in which it is one of the largest independent investors, over its response to global warming. Aena agreed yesterday to his demands in a sign of the pressure on companies to address investors' concerns about climate change.

Maurici Lucena Betriu, chairman and chief executive, said Aena had developed a climate transition plan and would give investors a yearly say on it.

He was ""convinced it is a manageable plan"", and added: ""There will be no trade-off between climate protection and overall profitability.""

Institutional investors are increasingly concerned that businesses that are slow to react could be hard hit by the transition to a lower-carbon economy.

Sir Christopher, who sits on Aena's board and helps manage $28bn at TCI, welcomed the plan. ""This accountability mechanism is essential for ensuring that companies take the climate issue seriously and are both transparent and accountable to shareholders,"" he said.

The vote is akin to the advisory socalled say on pay votes held at shareholder meetings in the UK and US.

Under the plan, Aena, which oversees Madrid-Barajas and Palma de Mallorca airports, will generate all of its energy from renewable sources by 2026. The group, which has been hit hard by the pandemic and slumped to a net loss of ‚Ç¨171m for the first half of 2020, has also outlined other efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.

""Chris is not the easiest board member I have ever met but I am very happy to work with him because I think the combination is good news for the company and shareholders,"" said Mr Lucena Betriu.

Investors have been pushing companies to set out plans to transition to a lower-carbon economy but Mr Hohn said the next step was to ensure they had an annual vote on progress.

Sir Christopher's resolution is expected to pass at the group's annual meeting this month because of the Spanish state's majority ownership and management's backing.

 Letter: Nuclear is the free market cure for our climate woes 

 Melville, NY, US  Having read Martin Wolf's colirre change"", Opinion, November 4) I would point out climate change does already have a free market solution, namely nuclear power.   Nuclear power has sat dormant as the countervailing climate change for decades. If not for ""the ecological fanatics"" and government political hacks who discredit nuclear power for assorted ""fake"" indictments of the ""dangers"" of nuclear power, carbon dioxide would not even be on the list of dangers to the Earth's atmosphere.  Technological advances and innovation in nuclear power have been constrained and disincentivised by regulatory restrictions and disregard for property rights.  Recently, the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation, as part of its efforts to fight climate change, attempted to build an experimental nuclear power plant in China. However, the Trump administration restricted nuclear deals with China.  Business media (such as the FT) and climate activists should advocate for nuclear power, if they sincerely seek economically feasible scientific solutions to climate change.  Clifford Sondock   "

Funds issue climate warning for Japan and South Korea groups over coal plant

Commodities
EDWARD WHITE ‚Äî WELLINGTON ROBIN HARDING ‚Äî TOKYO KANG BUSEONG ‚Äî SEOUL

European funds with $3.4tn of assets have criticised South Korean and Japanese groups over developing a coal-fired power plant in Vietnam, underscoring mounting pressure from investors over climate change.

In a letter to be published today, a consortium of 13 investors ‚Äî including Nordea Asset Management, Danish state fund MP Pension and the Church of Finland ‚Äî warned the Japanese banks and South Korean industrial companies over their involvement in Vung Ang 2, a multibillion-dollar project in northern Vietnam.

The investors' objections come as big institutions restructure their global portfolios away from fossil fuels and sharpen their focus on environmental, social and governance issues.

The development also highlights the growing divestment risk for companies that invest in polluting projects.

""Vung Ang 2 is fast becoming the prime exhibit in the case against companies taking on irresponsible transition risk on coal plants, not to mention the obvious conflict with the commitments of those same companies to align with the Paris agreement,"" said Eric Pedersen, head of responsible investment at Nordea.

The Finnish fund, which manages ‚Ç¨235bn in assets, has about ‚Ç¨400m invested across companies involved in the Vietnamese project. Nordea said it was continually evaluating how best to manage the investment risks presented by climate change and how to comply with targets set in the Paris climate accord. ""One of those levers is exclusion,"" Mr Pedersen added.

Vung Ang 2, a project environmentalists said would harm nearby residents and farmland, has been financed by Japanese lenders including Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance, Mizuho Financial, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. South Korea's involvement comes via state-backed groups Korea Electric Power Corp and Doosan Heavy Industries, as well as Samsung C&T, an affiliate of tech group Samsung Electronics. The participation of Japanese lenders comes despite a pledge by Tokyo to reduce support for coal power in the developing world and a plan to phase out older plants domestically.

A new policy adapted by Japan this year sets a higher hurdle for supporting new coal projects overseas. But it does not apply to those already at the planning stage such as Vung Ang 2, as well as Indramayu in Indonesia and Matarbari Phase 2 in Bangladesh.

South Korean lawmakers are considering similar restrictions on financing of overseas coal projects. Groups including Kepco and Samsung C&T have also signalled intentions to halt further coallinked investments.

The involvement of state-linked South Korean groups in coal projects has rankled activists, who claim these investments contradict Seoul's focus on clean energy in its stimulus plans. "

No country is an island in the climate crisis
Huiyao Wang

S tatistically, the over-70s don't do well with Covid-19. Unfortunately, the United Nations seems to be no exception. The pandemic should have been a chance to revive the organisation and prove its relevance during its 75th anniversary. Instead, failure to co-ordinate an effective global response has laid bare its fractures and fragilities. However, that need not be the case for an even greater threat the world faces: climate change.

Following the northern hemisphere's hottest summer on record, calls for global climate action are at a fever pitch. At the UN's annual assembly last month, secretary general Ant√≥nio Guterres drilled home again the need for climatepositive action to rebuild economies after the pandemic. Two days earlier, China's president Xi Jinping made a landmark pledge: the country will be carbon-neutral by 2060. And about a week before that, US presidential-hopeful Joe Biden made a powerful speech putting climate at the centre of his vision. This sees the US rejoining the Paris climate accord and investing $2tn to help the country become carbon neutral by 2050.

It might seem a faint hope at the moment that the world's two major powers can work together on anything. But the birth of the UN shows that dramatic change is possible when facing a shared existential threat. In 1945, that meant averting nuclear war. The UN has since become politicised and failed to prevent many tragedies. Nevertheless, its core mission has been a success. Since the second world war, there has been neither a global conflict nor a nuclear weapon used in anger.

Fast-forward 75 years and the world again faces risks that no country can manage alone. Like nuclear war, climate change assures mutual destruction if states can't work together. It will just happen gradually, rather than with a bang.

The collaborative impetus needed to address the climate crisis should go far beyond avoiding catastrophe. Green cooperation represents a chance to create jobs and rebuild more prosperous and equal societies. The World Bank estimates that climate-smart investment opportunities worth almost $23tn have opened up in emerging markets. There are possibilities for cross-border partnerships in decarbonisation. Such activity could produce a political dividend by creating ""green ballast"" that help keeps global collaboration on an even keel.

The case for post-pandemic green multilateralism is clear. And while the political obstacles are formidable, there are ways to give it a fighting chance.

One challenge is how to kickstart progress. Before the next UN Climate Change Conference in November 2021, major powers should get together under the umbrella of a climate-oriented G10 in order to forge a fresh consensus. Adding China, India and Russia to the existing G7 would expand its representation from 10 to 47 per cent of the world's population. It would include the world's six largest carbon emitters. Crucially, it would bridge faultlines between industrialised and developing nations that have hampered previous negotiations. The G10 body would be representative of global climate interests, but also streamlined enough to make rapid progress possible.

Simultaneously, China, the EU and the US should develop a trilateral mechanism to spur green co-operation and climate-oriented reform of bodies such as the UN and World Trade Organization. Working in concert, these three powers have the clout to galvanise reform of global governance and move markets to adopt climate-friendly technologies and standards.

If all this sounds like a fairytale, remember that there is an alternative ending to the story. If we do not harness its cohesive potential, climate change will become a destabilising, geopolitical ""risk multiplier"". It will aggravate stress on societies and institutions by exacerbating demographic pressures from climate migration, and will open new areas for rivalry, from Arctic waterways to climate-adaptive technologies and the minerals that enable them. Climate change could also increase the risk of future pandemics by damaging natural habitats and raising the risk of zoonotic transmission.

Clearly, the chance of a green revival of multilateralism hinges on the outcome of the US presidential election in November. And, to be clear, multilateral consensus on climate change will neither stop global rivalries nor solve all the world's problems.

Nevertheless, it will be an important start. As the UN's second general secretary Dag Hammarskj√∂ld famously remarked, the UN's purpose is not to get us to heaven but to save us from hell. "

CLIMATE CHANGE CONCERNS NEAR 'TIPPING POINT' FOR FAMILY INVESTORS
BY ALICE ROSS

ust months after the 2015 Paris climate change agreement was sealed, Giorgiana Notarbartolo decided it was time to talk to her family about money.

JFollowing the historic pact that committed its almost 200 signatory countries to limit global warming to less than 2C above pre-industrial levels, 36-year-old Notarbartolo decided it was time to consider how her family office's wealth should be invested with environmental and social issues in mind.

Descended from Gaetano Marzotto, who in the 19th century began the expansion of the family wool mill in north-east Italy into what would become a fashion empire, Giorgiana's family now consists of more than 100 people with ""significant wealth to be steered"".

When she first gave a presentation to the family on the then novel phenomenon of impact investing, she pointed out that fashion was the second most polluting industry after oil and gas.

This did not go down well with every member of the family. ""When you bring in something that can be as personal as values into money, it's a bit of an explosive combination,"" she says.

Some relatives were defensive, pointing to the good things the family had done. Notarbartolo was sympathetic: the next generation can sometimes give the impression they know better, or patronise their elders. But overall, the reaction was positive. By 2018, the family office had an environmental, social and governance screen in its portfolio and now takes an active interest in voting at shareholder meetings of its portfolio companies.

Notarbartolo is not alone. As climate change becomes an ever more urgent concern, younger members of wealthy families are putting pressure on their family offices to review their investments.

Max Kunkel, an investment strategist at UBS, the Swiss bank, who works with family offices, says that until recently most owners of family offices tried to separate investing for financial return from supporting the causes they most cared about. Their wealth was often divided between assets earmarked for philanthropy and those for investment.

""The next generation has understood these two increasingly can be combined,"" he says. Nearly two-fifths of family offices ‚Äî 39 per cent ‚Äî plan to allocate the majority of the portfolios sustainably within the next five years, UBS found in a poll of 121 investors. ""In our view we are nearing this tipping point when it comes to the adoption of sustainability by family offices,"" says Kunkel.

This is not only because of the views of younger heirs ‚Äî millennials and Gen-Z members are frequently characterised as more environmentally and socially aware than their elders. It is also down to a heightened awareness of the impact of climate change risks on long-term investment portfolios ‚Äî something family offices, with their objectives of preserving wealth for future generations, are particularly concerned about.

The Blue Haven Initiative, the USbased family office owned by Liesel Pritzker Simmons and her husband, Ian Simmons, focuses on impact investing that looks for competitive financial returns from companies addressing social and environmental challenges. Last year Pritzker Simmons did something that is still relatively new in the investment world: she assessed the climate risk of her portfolio. As well as looking at the carbon footprint of each company, she also probed how the company itself might be affected by climate change: a real estate company in Florida, for example, or an insurance company exposed to Californian wildfires.

Assessing the climate risk of portfolios is an important concern among regulators and institutional investors. Some highprofile institutions, such as Japan's government pension investment fund, have pledged to reduce the ""temperature"" of their portfolios.

Others are taking similar steps. Sam Bonsey, executive director of The ImPact, a global network of family offices committed to impact investing, supports families in engaging their private banks to help them assess climate risk. Bonsey says that members of The ImPact ""are both interested in investing in climate change solutions and increasingly concerned about climate risk to their entire asset base"".

Ditte Lysgaard Vind, a Dane whose family wealth comes from shipping, has a much more agile family office. It comprises just her, her brother and her mother, thereby reducing the need to win over multiple generations when changing investment strategy.

She has focused on the circular economy ‚Äî ways to minimise and reduce waste to improve energy efficiency. Of course, such investments, particularly in early-stage companies that have a higher rate of failure, can be risky. Lysgaard Vind's waste-battling investments, she says, are all in private equity, either directly or through funds. The investment returns are fine rather than great, for now, she says, but is happy to bide her time as she believes the circular economy has significant growth prospects.

The wider family office portfolio remains in lower-risk investments. ""I can have the most effect by doing private equity deals where I take risk and help companies in the beginning,"" says Lysgaard Vind. ""I want to move as much of the traditional portfolio [as I can], of course, but I believe I can do the most by having low-risk and high-risk, rather than the middle ground.""

Pritzker Simmons is also interested in opportunities in climate investment. Many are in new technology, involving early-stage companies needing venture capital. ""One of the things that's tricky in looking at climate tech innovation is that it can often take longer than traditional capital investment but the impact can be really huge,"" she notes.

One of her investments is in Prime Coalition, a non-profit organisation that connects philanthropists and ""patient"" capital investors, many of whom are investing through family offices, with early-stage tech companies. Prime Coalition's portfolio includes Treau, a San Francisco-based start-up developing energy-efficient air-conditioning units, and Houston-based Quidnet Energy, which stores pumped water in underground wells instead of elevated reservoirs for hydroelectricity.

Other early-stage companies that address waste and lower emissions are attracting younger family office investors. Notarbartolo's personal investments include UK-based Ozo Innovations, whose cleaning products for the food industry help save energy and water, and Italian company Treedom, which uses technology for reforestation.

For family offices, investing with climate change in mind can involve some heated conversations. One question is how a family defines its values. Notarbartolo found that citing her 19th-century ancestor's sense of social justice resonated with relatives, helping them to think about how to apply those principles today.

Changing direction is not always straightforward for family offices. Many are conservatively managed. ""On the one hand, I think family offices have a tremendous ability to move capital quickly, but they can also be quite conservative depending on who is on the board and who the trustees are,"" says Abigail Noble, who worked closely with family office members during her time at The ImPact and now has her own start-up.

Some family office members despair of achieving change. ""There are people who say the right things, who know what to say at a cocktail party about being concerned, but they sort of count on the fact that they'll be fine,"" says one next-generation heir. ""The problem with this market and why nobody should be looking to us as saviours is that we are the most complacent group of people in the world in a lot of ways.""

Another complaint often heard in the investment world about climate-friendly investments is that, despite the massive interest in ESG in recent years, the range of types of investment, particularly for sophisticated investors who want to implement change across their entire portfolio, is still not wide enough.

""I would like to see more from an opportunity perspective; there's such a huge demand for climate solutions,"" says Lysgaard Vind. But family offices, with their patient capital and personalised approach, may be less bothered by this than other types of investors, such as publicly accountable pension funds. ""There are opportunities, but you have to get a little creative, which is what I like as an investor,"" says Pritzker Simmons. ""When things are inefficient and look hard, that's when you make your money."" "

Flooded Asia: Climate change hits region the hardest
Nithin Coca, contributing writer

A longstanding prediction for the world's most populous region is finally becoming a reality.

""There's a consistency in the models that climate change in Asia would translate into more floods, into more intense rainy seasons,"" said Homero Paltan Lopez, a water expert and researcher at the University of Oxford.

Such an alteration was expected to affect the vast area's seasonal monsoon, making rainfall during the wet season more concentrated with the dry season becoming longer. That is exactly what is happening and it is devastating many lives.

Nobiron, a 54-year-old widow living near the Brahmaputra river in northern Bangladesh, saw her home and all her belongings destroyed when floods swept through her village in June and July.

""I have never suffered such loss because of flooding in my life,"" said Nobiron, who uses a single name. ""My ancestral homestead went down the river with all the things that I managed to save in my entire life. I have nothing left.""

Bangladesh, a delta nation where monsoon flooding is endemic, has been hit especially hard this year. At one point, a full one-third of the country was under water.

""In recent years the frequency of abnormal floods in the country has increased substantially, causing serious damage to lives and property,"" said Kaiser Rejve, director at humanitarian organisation CARE Bangladesh. ""The recent flood events indicate increased frequency and intensity of flood risk and river erosion in Bangladesh in the coming years.""

But the phenomenon is regionwide. Since June, extreme rainfall has led to massive flooding in many parts of east, south-east and south Asia. In Japan, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Mongolia and India, millions have been displaced and hundreds killed.

The economic impact is greater in Asia than anywhere else. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute in August highlights the risk.

""By 2050, 75 per cent of global capital stock at risk from flooding will be in Asia,"" said Ruslan Fakhrutdinov, an associate with the institute. ""The Indian subcontinent, and coastal south-east Asian territories, they will be hit the hardest.""

Other data paint a similar picture. A study in science journal Nature Communications last year estimated that 300m people lived in places where climate-triggered flooding would probably occur by 2050, with most of the vulnerable in Asian countries such as China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam.

A study in July in Scientific Reports found that while flood risk is growing globally, Asia's population density and preponderance of coastal communities mean that the majority of the world's high-risk population in the next 80 years will be on the continent.

""The science is getting more and more precise,"" said Abhas K Jha, with the World Bank's urban and disaster risk management programme in east Asia and the Pacific. ""One thing that we know for sure is that wet places will get wetter, and dry places will get drier.""

In China alone, 2.7m people have been evacuated and an estimated 63m impacted in 2020 . A total of 53 rivers are currently at or near historic high water levels and dams in the Yangtze River basin are near or above capacity, making for the worst flooding in southern China since at least 1961.

Meanwhile, in south Asia, 17m people have been affected this year and the situation is likely to get worse as heavy rainfall is predicted for many parts of Asia this season.

While its numbers are not as dramatic, Japan, no stranger to natural disasters, has seen increasingly dangerous weather. Record rains in Kumamoto Prefecture on the island of Kyushu killed at least 65 people in July. Parts of Chiba Prefecture east of Tokyo are still reeling from a huge typhoon in September last year that damaged more than 70,000 houses and knocked out electricity that led to days of blackouts affecting tens of thousands.

Climate science and modelling have improved so that scientists are able to estimate with increasing confidence how much particular weather-related events are influenced by or have their impacts altered by climate change.

For example, when Hurricane Harvey flooded parts of Texas in the US in 2017, scientists could calculate the quantity of rainfall was at least 15 to 19 per cent higher due to climate change, which also increased the odds of such storms by three times.

While the risk of extreme rainfall may increase, it doesn't mean every year will see flooding.

""It's not just floods, but also a more variable or more unpredictable . . . water cycle,"" said Oxford's Mr Lopez, adding that decision makers shouldn't be surprised if there is less rain during next year's monsoon.

Currently, most global attention on climate focuses on mitigation - cutting greenhouse emissions - to reduce the long-term impact of climate change. Asia accounts for the majority of gross global carbon emissions, a proportion that is growing.

""When it comes to global mitigation, Asia is uniquely positioned given its share of the global economy, and investments in the power sector,"" said Mr Fakhrutdinov of the McKinsey Global Institute.

But for floods, in the short and medium-term mitigation has little impact as it is likely that historical emissions will result in climate change-connected intense rainfall and sea level rises - both of which make flooding more likely. There are also non-climate factors, such as migration and development, which affect the social and economic impact of floods.

""It's estimated that about a million people move to urban areas every week,"" said Mr Jha at the World Bank. ""That's explosive, and mostly unplanned"" as well as ""a big problem"", he added. Making it worse, he said, is the fact that it mostly occurs in small and medium-sized cities with the ""least capacity"" to respond.

Asia's decades-long economic boom has spurred such migration. In total, the region's cities gained 200m more residents in the 10 years from the year 2000. While that movement was most pronounced in China, increasingly it is Pakistan, Indonesia and India that are experiencing rapid urban growth. Thus, more people - and infrastructure - in high-risk regions will automatically make potential flooding more costly.

""Flood risk is also more people living in harm's way,"" said Charles Iceland, director of Global Water Initiatives with The World Resources Institute's Food, Forests, Water and the Ocean programme. ""Populations are growing, people are settling and building industrial infrastructure in likely locations where flooding could occur.""

Growth of cities, and the increasing number of Asians living alongside coasts or rivers, means the number of people in flood-prone areas has risen.

Other human-driven changes, such as the widespread destruction for aquaculture of coastal mangroves - which are known to reduce storm surges and the intrusion of seawater inland - are caused by sinking land due to excessive groundwater discharge. And the loss of wetlands and other natural water sinks means many Asian cities are more prone to flooding even without factoring in climate change.

But alongside growing confidence in connecting floods and droughts to climate change is a boom in other data that informs responses - something that, until recently, was lacking.

""The combination of remote sensing from satellites and more computation power to process all that data, it's allowing us to get this water and climate data in front of decision makers [and help them] see the crisis, see what's driving [it], and start to figure out what they can do to reduce the risk they are facing,"" said Mr Iceland.

But questions remain over whether massive infrastructure projects like dams are the solution. Some of the most intense flooding took place in the basin of the Yangtze River - which has some of the most massive water-management infrastructure on the planet, including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest.

""In China it's been a state policy for decades to intervene and control and mitigate floods in the Yangtze River catchment area,"" said Oxford's Mr Lopez. ""We have seen massive infrastructure, projects, dikes and dams, of course."" He called it ""surprising"" that floods are occurring in an area with such intense mitigation efforts.

Mr Jha would like to see a shift from what he calls ""grey infrastructure"" - dams, canals and large-scale water management - to more ""green infrastructure"" focused on increasing the ability of cities to absorb water through landscape management, while also restoring ecological systems such as flood plains, wetlands and mangrove forests.

""The problem often is even when cities try to address flooding, there is an overemphasis on grey infrastructure,"" he said. ""That's part of the solution but not the whole solution. We have to have this balance between green and grey infrastructure, or water sensitive urban design.""

How Asia responds to flooding could have grave repercussions for the future of economic growth in the world's most populous and increasingly wealthy continent.

The Manila-based Asian Development Bank estimates the cost of building grey and green infrastructure in Asia at a massive $800bn between now and 2030 - but the cost of inaction might be greater. China's floods alone have caused $25bn in damage this year, with no tally yet available for the rest of the region. And a study in Nature magazine says 12 to 20 per cent of global gross domestic product could be exposed to flood risk by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.

Countries are expanding fiscal measures to buttress growth amid the pandemic, with some focus on the environment. In July, South Korea revealed a Won73tn ($63bn) ""Green New Deal"" plan through 2025. Key objectives are decarbonisation in the power sector and investing in energy-efficient buildings.

While that is a good start, Mr Jha envisions a bigger effort.

""We would like to see much more,"" he said. "

 I Am Greta puppyish portrait of the climate change activist  Danny Leigh  How do you solve a problem  like I Am Greta ? Do we review the fearless young woman at its centre, climate change activist Greta Thunberg, resolved to battle the crisis still looming on the other side of the pandemic? Or the actual documentary itself, advertorially polite, slickly inessential? Director Nathan Grossman arrived at the project early, a friend of the family who captured Thunberg's first protests, the solo school strikes that quickly drew the attention of the world. But from there the film just tags along, blank and puppyish.  Mere proximity brings insights, of course: the sheer self-possession of the teenager compelled to act by the same scale of disaster that shrinks so many of us into inertia; the trial of her Asperger's, more of an anguish than has been revealed before; the grim glimpses of political leaders at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit in New York. (We are doomed, you conclude.) But the film is plain adulatory even as Thunberg begs us to panic, it assures us we can just let her keep doing it on our behalf. Like the rest of her generation, she deserves better.    "

LGIM plans to reprove businesses for lack of climate change action

Financials
ATTRACTA MOONEY

Legal and General Investment Management is set to warn 500 companies to do more to tackle climate change or risk being named and shamed, in an escalation of a long-running environmental campaign by the UK's largest asset manager.

The $1.5tn fund house has created publicly available climate ratings for over 1,000 companies, a more than 10-fold increase in the number of targets since LGIM started pushing its global warming engagement campaign in 2016.

When companies fall short of meeting its minimum standards, including lacking comprehensive disclosure of emissions or key sustainability certifications, LGIM said it would use its vote at annual meetings or potentially sell out of the stocks in some funds.

It is also calling for companies to set ""net zero"" targets to reduce carbon emissions.

'We want to help steer companies and our clients towards success in a low-carbon world',"" said Michelle Scrimgeour, LGIM chief executive.

Having ranked the 1,000 companies, LGIM is writing to the half that it has concluded are lagging on the question of addressing climate change.

A combination of its size and being an early advocate on the climate change issue, means LGIM wields significant influence with both publicly traded companies as well as rival asset managers who closely watching its strategy. Since LGIM first made its so-called climate pledge, a growing number of fund managers, including BlackRock, have also spoken out about the risks of climate change, partly because of concern that government efforts to tackle global warming could threaten those businesses that do not adapt.

At the same time, asset managers are keen to benefit from the wave of demand for environmental, social and governance investing, which sets moral as well as financial goals.

Despite the pandemic, assets in sustainable mutual funds across the world reached a record high of $1tn in the second quarter, up 25 per cent on the first three months of 2020, according to Morningstar, the data provider. In contrast, assets across all mutual funds globally increased 13 per cent to $35tn. Meryam Omi, head of sustainability and responsible investment strategy at LGIM, said the fund house had chosen 60 companies to focus on in particular over the next year.

""We are picking companies based on how influential they are and the ones that really need the nudge from behind,"" she said.

She added that LGIM was not just focused on the losers of climate change, but also companies that could benefit from the efforts to tackle global warming.

""We have seen a lot of inquiries from our clients on ESG,"" she said. ""It is not just about risks, but about opportunities. It is a trend that is only going to grow. People want to be exposed to the winners.""

Unlike those rivals who specialise in picking stocks, LGIM largely invests passively, meaning it does not have the option of easily selling out of stocks that it deems are failing to take climate change seriously. "

Royal Navy chief warns climate change creates new security risks
Helen Warrell in Portsmouth

Climate change is opening new shipping lanes that will allow Chinese warships a quicker route into Atlantic waters, the head of the Royal Navy has warned, as he set out emerging threats to British maritime security.

Tony Radakin, the first sea lord, told an audience on the Prince of Wales aircraft carrier in Portsmouth that melting ice in the ""High North"" was freeing the passage of ships through the Arctic, to the advantage of both China and Russia.

""Climate change is a concern for all of us, but it is opening up new maritime trade routes across the top of the world, halving the transit time between Europe and Asia,"" Adm Radakin said on Thursday.

""When China sails its growing navy into the Atlantic, which way will it come - the long route, or the short? And these routes skirt the coast of resurgent Russia. A Russia that is now more active in the Atlantic . . . than it has been for over 30 years.""

The Northern Sea Route - which runs along the north coast of Russia and the Nordic nations - is currently only passable between August and October, but may be more accessible if global temperatures continue to rise.

The Royal Navy has only one vessel, HMS Protector, which can operate in high polar regions. Britain is already working with the US, Norway and Canada on joint exercises to secure the Arctic region from hostile activity, but senior naval officers are keen to make the case for more ships with ice-breaking hulls ahead of this autumn's integrated defence and security review.

Western allies have been more aware of the threat posed by the Chinese navy after a Pentagon report revealed in September that Beijing had bypassed Washington to amass the world's largest naval fleet, with 350 ships and submarines. Mark Esper, US defence secretary, announced plans this week to expand the US navy with a range of unmanned and autonomous ships as well as a more potent attack submarine force to match China's capability.

However, Adm Radakin also warned of threats closer to home, pointing out that sensitive undersea cables carrying 97 per cent of the world's internet data were at risk from interference by Moscow. ""Our adversaries are already threatening these [cables],"" the first sea lord said. ""This is why the government is committed to developing new capabilities to protect those cables, standing up to this threat on behalf of everyone.""

Rishi Sunak, UK chancellor, described an attack on Britain's undersea cable network as an ""existential threat to [British] security"" in a paper published three years ago by the Policy Exchange think-tank. The paper, which was written before Mr Sunak became chancellor, highlighted Russia's record in disrupting communications infrastructure, as it did during the annexation of Crimea.

""The exact locations of these cables are both isolated and publicly available - jugulars of the world economy which are a singularly attractive target for our enemies,"" Mr Sunak wrote.

Big fossil fuel groups all failing climate goals, study shows
Anjli Raval, Senior Energy Correspondent

No major oil, gas or coal company is on track to align their business with the Paris climate goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2¬∞C by 2050, new research shows, despite net-zero emissions pledges.

A partnership between London School of Economics academics and investors that manage $21tn in funds, called the Transition Pathway Initiative, assessed 125 oil and gas producers, coal miners and electricity groups on their preparedness for a lower-carbon economy.

They were measured on ""carbon performance"", which factors in the carbon intensity of the products they produce and sell, emissions reduction targets and how they would fare under three models: should governments meet existing national emissions pledges, a scenario in which temperatures rise by 2C; and one where they rise by less than 2¬∞C.

Of the 59 major oil, gas and coal players assessed, only seven are on track to align with the emissions pledges governments made as part of the 2015 Paris Agreement - Royal Dutch Shell, Spain's Repsol, France's Total, Eni of Italy, Equinor of Norway as well as miners Glencore and Anglo American.

But even compliance with existing national pledges would leave the world on track for 3.2¬∞C of warming, according to the UNEP. Others say it could be even higher.

""Those pledges are widely regarded as insufficient to avert dangerous climate change,"" TPI said on Wednesday.

Only three oil and gas companies - Shell, Total and Eni - are getting closer to the 2C scenario although their emissions reduction targets and low-carbon investment plans are still not quite enough to bring them into line with that benchmark, let alone lower, TPI said.

Fossil fuel companies have been under pressure from investors and environmental activists to take greater accountability for their role in enabling climate change. Several European oil and gas majors, including Shell, BP and Repsol, have in recent months announced net-zero emissions pledges.

In the new report, BP was not cited as a leader in action on climate change, despite its announcement in August of ambitious plans to cut oil and gas production by 40 per cent over the next decade.

The TPI said the company's new emissions targets for its operations and production covered products made using its own and third-party crude but not those it trades, which made up more than half of everything it sold last year.

BP said its aims supported its net zero ambition, adding that its path was consistent with the Paris goals.

A growing divide also exists between those such as BP that prioritise the reduction of absolute emissions versus those including Shell and the TPI that focus on carbon intensity - which takes into account the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per barrel of oil and gas produced.

Critics of the intensity metric say the measure can fall even if companies continue to expand their production and generate higher absolute emissions, which is what ultimately matters for the climate. Others argue that a business's absolute emissions can fall through asset sales or a commodity downturn without it decarbonising.

ExxonMobil and Chevron of the US are doubling down on hydrocarbons rather than seeking to diversify into cleaner business such as their European counterparts.

In the electricity sector, 39 of the 66 utility companies analysed are aligned with the Paris pledges, while 22 are in line with the tougher benchmark of below 2¬∞C.

Investors urge Sunak to go beyond green finance plans

Climate change
SIOBHAN RIDING

Large investors are piling pressure on the government to take bolder action in the fight against climate change, despite green finance measures unveiled by the chancellor last week.

Following Rishi Sunak's announcement of plans to launch green gilts and require companies to make climate risk disclosures, asset managers are calling for additional commitments to the government's 2050 net-zero carbon target. The Investment Association, representing investors with ¬£8.5tn in assets, called for ""further action to consolidate the world-leading policy signalling that we have seen from the UK government"".

In a paper to be submitted to the Treasury, it called for ""pathway"" policies for different sectors of the economy to facilitate their transition to net zero.

""The UK is now at a critical juncture as we look to honour our [net-zero] commitment,"" said Chris Cummings, IA chief executive. Fund managers stood ready to work with ministers to realise the change and ensure the UK remained a global leader in sustainable finance.

The call underscores the pressure on policymakers to be more ambitious in the fight against climate change. The debate is likely to become louder ahead of the Cop26 international climate talks in Glasgow next year and as Brexit prompts the UK to review its rule book in areas such as green finance.

While welcoming the green finance plans, investors urged caution on some elements. Royal London Asset Management, which manages ¬£139bn in assets, warned that the green gilts could carry the risk of ""greenwashing"", depending on how they are structured.

In a letter to the chancellor, Piers Hillier, chief investment officer, pointed to the risk of the debt not being ringfenced and therefore being serviced by cash produced from other ""less environmentally friendly activities"".

The UK is keen to position itself as a world-leading green finance hub but other jurisdictions are also making strides to channel more private capital into sustainable projects, such as the EU's sustainable finance regulation.

While Britain has said it will develop a green classification system loosely based on the EU's sustainable ""taxonomy"", it has not committed to other parts of the EU package, such as sustainability disclosure requirements that will apply to European asset managers and financial advisers from next year.

The UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association, whose members manage more than ¬£10tn, has written to the Treasury asking it to set out its post-Brexit approach to green finance ""without delay"" or risk falling behind.

The Treasury said it understood the need for clarity on its post-Brexit policy and would set out further details in due course.

FT-2020-3.txt," US election: Biden would take on climate with bound hands Derek Brower, Myles McCormick and Gregory Meyer There is only one place to start this week: the US election, which is still not entirely settled. Joe Biden seems destined to be America's next leader, but with an unruly Congress to contend with. Mr Biden's election - presumed, but yet to be confirmed - is the subject of our first note. Our second item raises a quizzical eyebrow as it the claims of environmental, social and governance progress at Marathon Petroleum, the US's biggest oil refiner. A constrained Biden energy agenda Joe Biden is likely to be the next president of the United States. That is no shock to the world's energy industry, which has been expecting and preparing for that outcome for months. But his victory, if it is confirmed, will be far narrower than the polls predicted. What does it mean for energy? The short answer: at worst, congressional logjam hindering all the big imperatives around climate change. At best, incremental, not radical change; bipartisan climate policy; an all-of-the-above energy strategy; and a more significant role for federal institutions. sweeping popular Without a Senate majority and without the endorsement across the country, the radical clean-energy programme some Democrats hoped to see from a Biden administration is no longer on the cards. ""Even with a Biden win, the clean energy revolution is at best delayed because the Democrats failed to add seats in the House or win control of the Senate,"" said Dan Eberhart, head of oilfield services company Canary and a prominent supporter of Donald Trump. Progressive Democrats will seek to direct energy policy, but a green new deal of the kind espoused by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (which would have struggled even with a slight Democratic advantage in the Senate) is now politically impossible - it simply wouldn't get through Congress. ""A Red Senate could cap Biden's green ambition, but a big climate bill can't fit through a thin Democrat Senate majority, either,"" said Kevin Book, managing director of Clearview Energy Partners Even Mr Biden's more modest $2tn climate plan is also probably dead on arrival. And although Mr Biden will, if confirmed, rejoin the Paris climate deal the US officially left on Wednesday, this may not spark the swift policy reversals needed for the US to reclaim some global leadership on the matter. As Frank Maisano, a Washington lobbyist at Bracewell, told ES: ""Climate has just been pushed down the ladder of things to do."" Oil industry fears about Mr Biden shutting down fracking or ending tax breaks can probably be put aside. The fracking ban was always a canard - although it would be intriguing to know how many votes Mr Biden lost to this fantasy propagated by the Trump campaign. Adding taxes to oil companies is unlikely to get through Congress. Cross-party co-operation Bipartisan Joe will be the order of the day. Progressives in his own party will hate this. But energy legislation will see Mr Biden mustering the cross-aisle skills he's known for. As Mike Sommers, head of Big Oil's powerful lobby group the American Petroleum Institute, said of Mr Biden in an interview earlier this year: ""He's someone who wants to cut a deal and advance the country. And I expect that that's how he will operate if he's president of the United States as well."" A Biden administration forced to deal with oil and gas lobbyists on the Hill is also likely to be one accepting an ""allof-the-above"" energy policy: is, promoting clean energy alongside technology such as nuclear, hydrogen and carbon capture, while also allowing room for natural gas and oil. This was the strategy of the Obama administration in which Mr Biden served and which oversaw a huge surge in oil and gas output. Progressive Democrats will hate its revival; moderates, not least in some oil and gas states like Pennsylvania, will welcome it. Executive orders will remain within Mr Biden's purview, if he reaches the Oval Office. They could be used to swiftly rejoin the Iran nuclear deal and end sanctions on the country's oil exports, if Tehran complies with its terms - a potentially significant move for crude markets. Bob McNally, head of Rapidan Energy Group and a former adviser to President George W Bush, said Mr Biden could also use such orders to add new environmental regulations and other rules, increasing drillers' costs. But the Supreme Court that Mr Trump has successfully stacked with conservatives may be ""less tolerant of expansive interpretation of statute"", Mr McNally said. Key roles for regulatory bodies Less noticed, but also significant, is that Mr Biden may look to administrative avenues to execute some of his policy objectives. ""Given the fact that you're not going to have a compliant Senate to work with, don't look for him getting policy done through a reconciliation bill, or even an ambitious climate bill,"" said Eric Washburn, a Bracewell consultant and cochair of Sportsmen and Sportswomen for Biden, an environmental interest group. ""He's going to have to do what he's going to do to promote his clean energy and climate agenda administratively."" Three institutions are of particular note: the Federal Energy Regulatory Commis sion, Environmental Protection Agency and Securities and Exchange Commission. FERC: Mr Biden may look to use the Commission and a new Democratic chair to usher through goals such as decarbonising the power sector by 2035, making use of powers under existing laws. EPA: He could use an activist EPA to crack down on methane leaks, tighten restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants and restore a host of other Obama-era environmental rules. SEC: Financial regulators appointed by Mr Biden could constrain or raise the cost of capital for fossil fuel producers. They could also look to expand climate disclosure obligations, making corporate exposure to ESG risks much clearer. But, with all of the above said, the drama of the 2020 election campaign is not yet over - far from it. Mr Trump has vowed to take the matter to the Supreme Court, which will leave the US in a state of uncertainty for some time to come as the two candidates slog it out in the country's highest court. ""There is nothing graceful about a cage match between septuagenarians,"" said Mr Book. (Derek Brower and Myles McCormick) Marathon Petroleum's ESG 'journey' The largest US oil refiner by processing capacity made a case for its environmental, social and governance credentials as it reported dismal quarterly results this week. It's part of a broader trend of fossil fuel companies trying to raise ESG scores in the eyes of demanding investors. It also demonstrates the pliability of the ESG concept. Transportation - mostly powered by gasoline, diesel and jet fuel - is the largest energy-related source of US carbon dioxide emissions. Ohio-based Marathon sits on the board of a refinery trade association that supported federal changes to car fuel economy standards projected to dump 900m tonnes more carbon into the atmosphere - while raising oil consumption by 2bn barrels. The New York Times reported in 2018 that Marathon was a central participant in a campaign to roll back the standards. Marathon was also the first independent US refiner to declare a greenhouse gas target. The pledge covers emissions intensity - the amount emitted per barrel of oil equivalent - inside its operations. The company hopes this measure will decline 30 per cent from 2014 levels by 2030. The refiner made the commitment in March, just as the pandemic sharply curtailed global oil demand. The resulting drop in sales volumes pushed the company to a $1bn loss in the third quarter. It may also improve ESG scores: Marathon's decision in August to shut down two refineries in New Mexico and California will also reduce refining emissions by 8 per cent. ""By indefinitely idling two of our highest cost, least efficient facilities, we are becoming more cost efficient and lowering the carbon intensity of our operations,"" Marathon said in a climate report last month. The closed California refinery may be repurposed to make renewable diesel from animal fat and vegetable oil. fell 6 per cent compared with a week earlier, and was still 13 per cent lower than in the same week last year. Meanwhile, Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering data show new US coronavirus cases hit 84,000 on November 3 - the day millions of Americans cast their vote. ""We believe rising coronavirus cases could continue to hamper the recovery of US demand for refined products,"" noted analysts at Clearview. ""We look forward to continuing on our ESG journey and our commitment to stakeholder engagement with our people, business partners, customers and communities,"" Michael Hennigan, Marathon's chief executive since March, told analysts. (Gregory Meyer) Data Drill US oil and gas stocks rose yesterday, while their clean energy counterparts fell, as traders bet that Mr Biden's plans for a clean energy revolution would not materialise. Power Points Oil and gas companies were buoyed by the initial election results as the Democrats' likely failure to seize the Senate threatened Mr Biden's $2tn clean-energy revolution. Industrial metals including copper and aluminium also slid as the election looked set to dash hopes of a climate-focused stimulus package. Danish turbine maker Vestas - a big supplier of equipment to the US - also took a knock over worries about the future of tax credits. Saudi Aramco still plans to pay a bumper of $18.8bn despite a blow to its earnings. Endnote US petroleum demand remains well below its normal range. It may soon get worse, as coronavirus cases surge and states debate how to combat the spread. "

Johnson's green vision needs more than hot air

The UK government's climate pledge requires a coherent policy plan

Boris Johnson was back in bombastic form at the Conservative party conference, setting out a vision of Britain in which coronavirus is far behind us and the country has become a green and pleasant land. His vision is environmentally green, too ‚Äî predicated on a promise of clean energy that will at once help rejuvenate the economy and deliver on Britain's climate change goals.

There was plenty of bold ambition on other fronts as well ‚Äî a promise to fix the ""broken"" housing market; free training in vital skills for adults without A-levels; and a pledge to see through a hospital building programme. All in all, the prime minister vowed to defeat the virus, ""build back better"" and ""improve on the world that went before"".

Amid the flurry of sweeping promises, Mr Johnson's green ambitions were the most eye-catching. On paper, they are laudable ‚Äî and necessary. Last June's pledge by Theresa May's government to commit the country, by law, to cut its emissions to net zero by 2050, set Britain on a radical new course. The economic damage wrought by the pandemic has intensified the pressure on governments to use the crisis to promote a green recovery.

Mr Johnson yesterday promised as much, offering to invest ¬£160m in ports and factories to build the next generation of wind turbines. He also repeated a pledge to increase the country's 2030 target for offshore power generation from 30GW to 40GW. These actions, Mr Johnson promised, would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and mean that in 10 years' time offshore wind would be powering every home in the country. Britain, declared the buoyant prime minister, was to wind as Saudi Arabia was to oil.

The reality is somewhat more prosaic. Britain may already have the world's biggest offshore wind capacity, with about 10GW installed. But scaling up the country's green power capacity will require substantial investment. Analysts reckon that just to quadruple current offshore wind generation within 10 years will require about ¬£50bn in capital investment. More details are being promised in a green policy package at the end of this month but, more than a year after making its net zero pledge, the UK does not appear to have grasped the scale of the task.

What is missing is a coherent plan, one that sets out both immediate steps as well as longer-term ones, not least a date for phasing out the gas heating boilers that account for a sizeable chunk of UK emissions. In Europe, Germany has a recovery plan with an estimated ‚Ç¨40bn of detailed green measures, a far cry from what the British government has announced so far. France has offered funds towards a green aircraft.

The UK has so far shied away from targeted support measures but it could offer similar incentives. Companies should also be required to disclose their physical and financial climate risks; not only would this help to attract private capital for green investments but it would also help foster a change in attitudes. The government's positive noises on hydrogen as a source of power need fleshing out. A decision on whether and how to back new nuclear power plants needs to be taken.

Conference speeches are less about detailed policy than an overall direction of travel. Mr Johnson may have shown that he has his ""mojo"" back but he will need more than hot air to deliver on his promise of a green Britain. Next year's delayed UN climate summit in Glasgow offers a chance for the UK to show that it has the potential to lead the world on climate change. "

Super-rich start prepping to escape emerging health threats

Climate change
HANNAH KUCHLER ‚Äî NEW YORK

Wealthy individuals and concerned businesses are preparing to protect themselves from climate change and any new health emergency by tapping an increasingly bespoke range of personal services and snapping up private hideaways that are out of reach for ordinary citizens.

The deadly wildfires that have ravaged the US west coast and the prospect of a new disease outbreak that could outlast Covid-19 has spurred interest in a range of expensive concierge medical services, specialist real estate agents and crisis experts including Global Rescue, an evacuation response company.

Dan Richards, its chief executive, said he had signed up more clients in the past five months than in the company's 16-year history. He had been asked to draw up plans to transfer hundreds or even thousands of employees from cities should fires or civil unrest break out. ""They've got real risks and real hazards that 10 years ago weren't even on their radar,"" he said. ""We've been engaged more frequently to do things that I honestly have never contemplated.""

The destruction in California, caused by rising temperatures and lower rainfall, is among the most palpable signs of how climate change is impacting people's lives. The World Health Organization forecasts climate change will between 2030 and 2050 cause 250,000 additional deaths a year, including from heat stress and infectious diseases.

Elena Villalobos, at the WHO climate change and health programme, said the divide was not just between developed and developing countries, but between rich and poor in the same country.

While the poor lack the resources to flee or protect themselves, the rich are starting to take action.

High-end medical practices are creating personal preventive strategies for clients, from surveying homes to ensure they are sealed from smoke to monitoring their vital signs with wearables. Some refer clients to dermatologists for the effect of heat on skin, and therapists for the anxiety produced by disasters.

""Climate change is to the forefront of people's minds right now,"" said Abe Malkin, medical director at ConciergeMD. Legacy Partners, which sells properties in New Zealand for a global clientele looking to escape, said it had received interest from US customers concerned about wildfires, and wealthy clients struggling with smog that affects many Asian cities. ""We're doing all of these things to help, whether it's to protect themselves or enhance their life, to give them longevity,"" said Jim Rohrstaff, a partner at the company.

Some are thinking even more radically and approaching companies offering climate-controlled bunkers, such as the Vivos. Dante Vicino, executive director, said its complex of almost 600 ex-military bunkers in the Black Hills of South Dakota had been fitted with air filters ""on steroids"" ‚Äî which were put to the test when fires burnt in nearby Wyoming. ""Outside, man, you could smell the smoke,"" he said. ""But people inside their bunkers said they couldn't tell.""

The vast majority who are unable to afford such services, however, must stay and suffer the consequences.

Abdul El-Sayed, an epidemiologist and former health commissioner of the city of Detroit, said there needed to be investment to prepare everyone for the public health effects of climate change.

""When rich people exit a system, it's because it's not working for everybody. It's just that everyone else doesn't have the means to exit the system,"" he said.

Lisa Patel, a paediatrician at a neonatal unit in the San Francisco Bay Area, fears climate change is already taking a toll on children and expectant mothers. A study in Colorado found wildfire smoke increased the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. ""You have these premature babies who are born with premature lungs ... Now on top of it, they are breathing this toxic pollution,"" she said. ""This is our collective failure to prevent the effects of climate change.""

BlackRock ETF thrusts climate change into political sphere
Steve Johnson

BlackRock has launched a sovereign bond ETF designed to weight countries on their level of risk from climate change, thrusting the debate over sustainable investment into the political sphere.

Government debt from Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Ireland will be underweighted in the new ETF because of their higher greenhouse gas emissions or greater exposure to climate change risks.

""Climate change could significantly impact government finances. We have argued that there is a link between climate change and creditworthiness,"" said Scott Harman, head of fixed income product management at FTSE Russell, which designed the index behind the fund. He added that it was the world's first climate ETF to track sovereign bonds.

To date, the investment industry has largely focused on climate risk at the corporate level, with companies perceived as being particularly exposed to global warming seeing their equities and bonds shunned by those investing on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.

Mr Harman said there was a chronic lack of climate change and ESG solutions in the sovereign space, ""which is a big paradox because it's such a big market"".

BlackRock said 78 per cent of global fossil fuel reserves were owned by governments rather than private-sector companies.

""To date, investors have considered climate risk from an equity or corporate debt perspective, despite the average allocation to government bonds in client portfolios being around 17 per cent,"" said Brett Olson, head of iShares fixed income, Emea, at BlackRock.

""As a result, investors have overlooked the impact of climate change on their portfolios, without a robust solution to addressing climate risk within their government bond allocation.""

The iShares‚Ç¨ Govt Bond Climate Ucits ETF (SECD), which began trading on Frankfurt's Xetra bourse on Monday, is designed to help fill the void.

Each country's benchmark weighting in the new index is calculated using three climate-risk ""pillars"".

Transition risk reflects the work needed to be done by a country to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Centigrade; physical risk represents a country's economic exposure to the physical effects of climate change; while resilience encapsulates a country's preparedness and the actions it is taking to cope with its climate-related risk exposure.

FTSE Russell claims the index is 26 per cent better aligned to a 2 degrees Centigrade pathway than its equivalent plain vanilla eurozone government bond index, in which countries' weights are based on the size of their sovereign bond market. A portfolio built with the climate index would have 7 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions than the traditional one, it added.

Germany's weight in the climate risk-weighted index is only 12 per cent, compared to 18.7 per cent in the underlying benchmark. Hard coal and lignite, the most polluting grade of coal, accounted for 28.2 per cent of Germany's power production last year.

The Netherlands' share falls from 4.8 per cent to just 0.22 per cent, reflecting the low-lying country's vulnerability to rising sea levels and the small size of its renewable energy sector, a factor that also cuts Ireland's weighting from 2 per cent to 0.25 per cent.

Conversely France, with the continent's largest nuclear industry, sees its weight rise from 25.8 per cent in the underlying index to 34.9 per cent, while that of Finland, heavily reliant on nuclear and hydropower, almost triples to 4.2 per cent. Italy also scores highly.

Mr Harman said FTSE Russell had ""already had discussions with central banks keen to know their climate score"", given that it could start to feed into appetite for their national debt.

A separate climate version of FTSE's widely followed World Government Bond Index, not as yet tracked by any funds, underweights South Africa, Mexico, Poland, Australia and the US, while overweighting Scandinavian countries.

The development comes amid concerns that the fund industry's unwillingness to criticise governments is holding back the expansion of ESG investment to the market for sovereign debt.

However, Stephane Degroote, head of ETFs for the Emea region at FTSE Russell, said ""investors are recognising that climate risk will impact on the macro and country level, not just the corporate level"".

""Research shows that little climate-related risk is priced into current government bond valuations. This is unlikely to continue in the long term,"" said Mr Olson.

Climate diplomacy is winning its fight against a zero-sum mindset
POLITICS Camilla Cavendish

I s that the cavalry coming over the hill? As scientists and pharmaceutical companies charge in with the promise of a Covid-19 vaccine, another battalion may be stepping up to save the climate. Joe Biden's election as US president and China's commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060 bring hope that next year's UN climate summit might break with tradition and actually act to curb emissions. With Japan and South Korea joining the EU in pledging to reach net zero by 2050, that means two-thirds of the world economy is now in play.

Until now, climate diplomacy has battled a zero-sum mindset. Many countries have liked to sound green at summits, while delaying action and freeriding on others' efforts. But there is a growing realisation that climate action is an investment not a cost ‚Äî a vital insurance policy against wildfires, floods and other natural disasters.

If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, we all lose ‚Äî just as we all lose if the world fails to contain Covid-19. The Chinese Communist party appreciates that as much as Brussels, although it is not yet clear how China will wean itself off coal given how much it still intends to burn.

The pandemic was a reminder of how fatally linked countries are to each other, but it also showed that early unilateral action pays off. New Zealand didn't wait around to close its borders against the virus. For real progress to be made on climate, lofty long-term pledges must be converted into detailed plans for this decade.

Here, it is encouraging that Mr Biden wants to decarbonise US electricity by 2035; although his $2tn plan to achieve that looks likely to fall down in a Republican-controlled Senate. He can still exert some power through executive orders, which Barack Obama used to limit vehicle emissions. And of course individual states can go further: California has set a target that half its electricity must come from carbon-free sources within five years.

Beneath the partisan rhetoric in the US and Australia, climate action looks less and less divisive as markets unleash unstoppable forces. Despite US President Donald Trump's best efforts, the coal industry is shrinking, even in Republican states. Texas long ago became the wild west of wind power. Kansas, Iowa and North Dakota now generate enough renewable energy to meet more than half their electricity demand. Meanwhile, requirements on corporate disclosure of climate risk are making fossil fuels increasingly unappealing to some investors.

Even so, politicians will need to be brave. It is in this decade that tough actions must be taken that will disrupt daily life. Restructuring economies away from fossil fuels will mean ripping out boilers, insulating homes, phasing out the combustion engine and changing the way we farm to improve carbon capture in soil. Not all of that will be popular ‚Äî and leaders will seek safety in numbers, justifying their actions on climate by what others are doing, just as they did with Covid-19 lockdowns.

President-elect Biden has promised that the US will rejoin the Paris climate accord. His arrival in the White House will also save Boris Johnson from having to triangulate between Mr Trump's resistance and a world that needs environmental leadership. The British prime minister may have thought Mr Trump would be a stronger ally on trade. But the fact that the UK is hosting next year's climate summit gives Mr Johnson a platform from which to restore friendly relations.

To impress, the UK needs to rapidly get its house in order. The government has made some strong pledges on energy efficiency and offshore wind, and plans to become the first country to mandate climate disclosures from a range of large listed and private companies. But there is no comprehensive, economy-wide white paper or detailed strategy for the coming decade of the kind the host should be urging from every large economy. Nor is there a team to match the heft of the French staff who achieved the Paris accord in 2015. The UK has a huge asset in Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, who is advising on climate finance for the COP26 talks. But the business department and the Treasury seem to be working in separate silos.

Contradictions need to be ironed out.

The UK has backed ¬£3.5bn of overseas fossil fuel projects since signing the Paris agreement. This is the opposite of what we should be signalling: that poorer countries can leapfrog fossil fuel technology altogether.

How can nations keep each other honest? One way could be to make carbon emissions more central to trade. Mr Biden's trade policy includes a proposal for carbon adjustment fees, which would seek to make countries exporting to the US meet climate and environmental obligations. The EU has plans for a carbon border tax to stop industries relocating to countries with less ambitious climate policies.

Both proposals are fraught with complexity and could be self-defeating if they push countries out of the Paris accord. But even thinking this way may change the conversation by helping nations see how much is to be gained from collaboration. Tackling climate can be a win-win proposition, but time is running out. "

Resist alarmist and costly reactions on climate

Letters

Paul Massara's plea for a Marshall Plan for Climate Change (Letters, March 13) needs to be assessed on the basis of evidence, given the volume of public funds which would be spent for uncertain gains. There is no guarantee that a splurge of funds into preventive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would hold-off sea level rises indefinitely. In any case, if the geological record is anything to go by, such sea level changes would occur only gradually.

For instance, the inundation of the island of Doggerland in the North Sea, at the end of the last Ice Age around 8,000 years ago, is estimated to have taken place over a period of about 300 years, providing the settlers of the region time to migrate to upland areas. Save for an asteroid hitting the Earth, there is nso suggestion sea level rises will exceed this scale of change.

I often wonder if, in the climate change debate, there is a missing sense of the proportion of timescales, and that a one-directional ""we must do something!"" approach leads decision makers and the public towards taking initiatives which may provide little-tono economic return in the long run. Alarmist, knee-jerk responses ‚Äî which involve vast demands on public funds ‚Äî must be resisted. We have been here before with nuclear power; with the tax incentives for the sale of diesel cars.

Climate change tops agenda as UK voting season kicks off
VIEWPOINT Chris Cummings

The firing gun has started on one of the busiest periods of the year for investors. With more than 450 annual general meetings in the UK in the coming months, investment managers will be making their views heard and shaping the direction of corporate Britain. What will top the agenda? As climate change dominates the headlines with images of ferocious wildfires and widespread flooding, so too is it a focus for investors.

Investment management aims to provide sustainable returns for customers, sometimes over horizons of three decades or more, providing an important role in preserving the planet. Climate change will result in a significant loss of value for companies if risks are not properly managed.

That's why the UK's biggest companies will need to show investors exactly what they are doing to tackle climate change. Companies must explain the impact climate change will have on their business in their annual reports. And demonstrate how these risks are being measured to ensure the viability of their businesses. Only by reporting on climaterelated risks in a consistent, clear and comparable manner, can investors make informed decisions.

Alongside climate change, the perennial issues of executive pay and diversity remain centre stage.

Executive pay continues to see high levels of shareholder rebellion. This year is important as many companies will present pay policies for the first time in three years. Investors will be looking to see whether pay increases or changes in pay structures are truly warranted and if they are tracking company performance.

Pay also plays an important role in creating a cohesive and motivated workforce. Investors will be keeping up the pressure on executive pensions, calling for companies to bring those pensions in line with the majority of their workforce. Several chief executives of UK banks, including Lloyds and Barclays, have voluntarily cut their pensions.

The deadline that investment managers expect for companies to bring their pensions for their executive directors in line is 2022, so companies and senior leadership must take action now.

Similarly, investors have long been banging the drum for greater gender diversity. Although progress has been made in improving diversity on FTSE 100 boards, more needs to be done to tackle the lack of women in the FTSE 250 and on senior leadership teams across the FTSE 350. The Investment Association and the Hampton-Alex-ander review wrote to one-fifth of the FTSE 350 demanding action. All eyes will be on companies to demonstrate an improvement on gender diversity, with a number of managers pledging to vote against companies that fail to do so.

Audit quality is also in the spotlight this year. Investors rely on the audit in a company's annual report to make sound investment decisions and to hold companies to account.

This year, audit committees will be expected to better explain how they have judged the quality of the audit and show, when necessary, that they have challenged management judgments.

Companies that don't listen and take action this AGM season can expect to risk the ire of investors. "

Risk Management

Floods and clashes over coal spotlight climate threat

Environment Banks and insurers are under pressure on several fronts, writes Billy Nauman
Billy Nauman

B anks, insurers and asset managers face a growing threat from climate change, as the physical effects of global warming and the transition to a low-carbon economy pose unprecedented risks to the status quo. Banks have been quick to capitalise on rising demand for sustainable financial products such as green bonds, but slower to account for the danger of stranded assets and mispriced risk on their balance sheets.

The real estate and mortgage markets are an area of particular concern, the McKinsey Global Institute has found. In the US state of Florida alone, McKinsey estimates that increased flood exposure could knock $30bn to $80bn off residential property valuations by 2050. With increased flood risk and property devaluations comes the danger of mortgage defaults. Many homeowners have no flood insurance and will be exposed. Extreme weather and flooding can also affect people's livelihoods and ability to get to work and pay their debts.

""You could have a community breakdown and an infrastructure breakdown [where] roads are flooding more,"" says Hans Helbekkmo, partner at McKinsey. This also creates a higher chance of ""strategic default"", where homeowners walk away from a property once there is a significant fall in the price, he adds.

""The mortgage lending business would want to take a close look at this,"" says Mr Helbekkmo. Given that many mortgages are sold to governmentsponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae in the US, ""governments could end up holding the bag"".

Banks' commercial lending arms also face problems because of exposure to coal. The fuel is becoming economically unviable as natural gas and renewable energy prices drop. Yet many banks still lend to coal companies and are in danger of mispricing the risk, says Chris Hohn, the billionaire hedge fund manager.

Sir Chris has launched a campaign to compel lenders to disclose their exposure to coal. ""The risk of a coal loan is accounted for by banks and regulators as investment grade, when in fact they are high-risk in nature,"" he says. The campaign has threatened legal action if they do not accurately weigh coal risk. ""If you falsely mark a loan or risk weighting you can have breach of fiduciary duty.""

Banks including JPMorgan Chase have recently been targeted by environmental activists, which want companies to stop financing fossil fuel and have used tactics from filing shareholder resolutions to protests at bank offices. Insurers are also exposed, as they may be liable to cover legal penalties against coal companies held responsible for environmental damage, according to a research note by rating agency Moody's. ""Insurers could ... benefit from reduced exposure to potential environmental liability risks associated with thermal coal industries,"" the 2019 note said. More than 1,300 such lawsuits have been brought against companies and governments, according to activist group Unfriend Coal, which aims to make the sector uninsurable. In one instance, American Electric Power said last July that it would retire a 1,300MW unit at its power plant in Rockport, Indiana, to settle a lawsuit over air pollution.

So far a number of insurers have walked away from coal, especially in Europe, including Axa, Zurich and Swiss Re. Beyond fear of lawsuits, they have an incentive to try to mitigate harm of climate change however they can ‚Äî including making it harder to operate coal-fired power plants.

""As a global insurer we are impacted by climate change, in everything from increasing fire risk to flooding,"" Joseph Wayland, general counsel of Chubb, said in July when it became the first large US insurer to stop covering coal companies.

As the climate changes, the data and models used by insurers to set rates ""may well prove insufficient over time for the rising levels of risk"", warned McKinsey. The position of participants ""from insured to insurer to reinsurer to governments as insurers of last resort"", needed examination, it added.

Insurers also risk losing money on investments if they own shares in fossil fuel companies holding stranded assets. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers are also likely to be affected. As much as $900bn worth of fossil fuel reserves will be written off if governments take action to keep global warming under 1.5C, according to FT estimates in a Lex In Depth report.

Yet stranded asset risk may be the tip of the iceberg for investors. New research from BlackRock, the investment management group, suggests that shifting investor preferences are likely to drive up prices for ""sustainable"" companies and punish those that perform poorly on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

They also face mounting pressure from customers and activists to curb money going into fossil fuels, but many investors are hesitant to fully divest. Instead, many large investors are trying to engage with companies to push them to green their operations.

A number of investor groups are banding together to put pressure on boards and chief executives, such as Climate Action 100+, which recently added BlackRock to its roster. The group focuses on big emitters, and has signed up 450 investors with more than $40tn in assets under management. However, the results have not lived up to some activists' expectations.

""We would celebrate the day the Climate Action 100+ rises to the challenge ahead of us. The initiative has involved a lot of self-congratulation and paper agreements, and it is untied to realworld outcomes,"" says Brynn O'Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility.

""If it were to rapidly become more ambitious, transparent and consistent, it could be an extremely important initiative."" "

Australia's hottest year on record fuels wildfires

Weather patternsMeteorology data show 2019 temperature more than 1.5C above average
CAMILLA HODGSON ‚Äî LONDON

Australia experienced the hottest and driest year in its recorded history in 2019, which was a significant contributing factor to the devastating wildfires that continue to rage, said the country's meteorology bureau.

Data released yesterday by the climate monitoring body show Australia's mean temperature in 2019 was 1.52C higher than average, making it the warmest year since records began in 1910. Rainfall was 40 per cent below average, its lowest level since 1900, the bureau said.

""January last year was the warmest month Australia has ever recorded, while just a few weeks ago, in December, we saw the Australia-wide record hottest daily average maximum temperature broken multiple days in a row,"" said Karl Braganza, head of the meteorology bureau.

Bushfires have been ravaging large parts of Australia for months, growing more extreme in recent weeks and killing at least 24 people. The blazes have burnt across 12m acres of land, an area larger that Denmark, causing devastation to forests and wildlife. One estimate suggested that by the time the fires have subsided, 1bn animals could have died.

The blazes have sparked a fierce debate in Australia over whether manmade climate change is to blame. Critics have accused Scott Morrison, prime minister, and his government of playing down the severity of the fires and the role played by climate change, and prioritising the interest of the country's important coal industry.

Mr Morrison has defended his government's actions. ""Blame does not help anybody at this time and over-analysis of these things is not a productive exercise,"" he has said.

Mr Braganza said that the precise contribution of climate change to an individual weather event or fire season was hard to determine, but that the trend pointed to higher temperatures, lower rainfall and a longer fire season.

The country's climate had warmed by more than 1C since 1910, he said, meaning that very warm years such as 2019 were ""more likely to occur"". As a result of changing weather patterns in recent years, the fire season had extended by a month in some locations, and fires had become more severe, the bureau said.

Bob Hill, director of the Environment Institute at the University of Adelaide, who is not affiliated with the meteorology bureau, said the ""only long-term solution"" to worsening bushfires was to cut greenhouse gas emissions. ""This is a global catastrophe that has now hit Australia hard. There is no reason to believe this is an isolated event,"" said Prof Hill.

The fires have forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate the states of New South Wales and Victoria. As the crisis worsened this month, the government dispatched the navy to help stranded people escape tourist towns along Australia's east coast.

This week, fires also broke out in neighbouring New Zealand, some areas of which had already been cast into shadow by smoke that had drifted across the ocean from Australia.

Besides fires, the researchers pointed to other extreme weather events that occurred in Australia in 2019, including unusually late tropical cyclones in May, severe storms, large areas of flooding and widespread droughts.

Climate activists and scientists said such extreme weather should not come as a surprise, pointing to a government published report more than a decade ago that feared more severe bushfires.

The Garnaut Climate Change Review from 2008 warned that as result of climate change, ""fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020."" "

China's net-zero target is a giant step in fight against climate change
Adair Turner

X i Jinping's announcement last week that China would achieve carbon neutrality before 2060 was greeted with surprise. Few outside China expected this hugely important commitment so soon. But it reflects three motivations: awareness in China that climate change will cause it huge harm; a desire to be a responsible global leader; and growing confidence that technological progress can make netzero emissions attainable without interrupting China's path to prosperity. That confidence is justified by dramatic global changes over the past 10 years. Solar electricity costs have fallen by 90 per cent, wind by 60 per cent and lithium-ion battery costs by 87 per cent. Initial public subsidies have created such strong economies of scale and steep learning curves that the need for subsidies is diminishing fast. Over the next decade, the cost of producing green hydrogen via electrolysis will also fall significantly.

As a result, countries can now build zero-carbon electricity systems with total costs no higher than for fossil fuelbased systems. They should electrify as much of the economy as possible. In passenger road transport, that will be straightforward and cheap. In more challenging sectors, such as steel and cement, aviation and shipping, carbon capture and storage, bioenergy and hydrogen will also play a role.

As the Energy Transitions Commission's ""Making Mission Possible"" report shows, all sectors in developed economies could achieve zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äî and all developing countries by 2060. They can do so largely within their own operations rather than relying on ""offsets"" bought from elsewhere. The estimated cost, around 0.5 per cent of global gross domestic product in 2050, will be immaterial compared with the potentially catastrophic impact of uncontrolled climate change. Because China will by 2050 be a fully developed rich economy, its ""before 2060"" target should at some stage be advanced to 2050. Given its technological prowess and commitment to combat climate change, it almost certainly will.

More than 1,100 businesses and 45 of the world's biggest investors have already set net-zero targets. Those commitments will drive tech developments that reduce the cost of achieving them, encouraging others to commit. The chances that the global energy and industrial system will get close to net zero by 2050 are now high.

But the chances of avoiding seriously harmful climate change remain worryingly low. Zero carbon by mid-century is essential, but not sufficient. From January to June this year, Siberian temperatures were 5C above average; massive wild fires have ravaged Australia and California; exceptional heatwaves scorched northern India; and China has faced huge floods. By 2050, these effects could get far worse even with a zero carbon economy. Accumulated emissions over the next 30 years matter as much as the level in 2050.

The effects so far reflect global warming of just 1.1C above pre-industrial levels. To limit warming to 1.5C, we must not only achieve zero emissions by mid-century, but cut emissions 50 per cent by 2030 after an increase of emissions of 10 per cent in the past decade.

Achieving that latter cut will be more difficult than zero by 2050. With clear targets and strong policies, we can transform our energy and industrial systems over 30 years. But in the near term, the potential is constrained by capital equipment ‚Äî from internal combustion engines to coking coal blast furnaces ‚Äî already in place.

Action over the next decade is therefore just as crucial as mid-century targets. All growth in electricity systems should now come from zero-carbon sources, and all rich countries should close existing coal plants as fast as possible. Road transport electrification should be accelerated by early bans on the purchase of new internal combustion vehicles. And consumers have an important role to play: reducing car and air travel can cut emissions in the years before zero-carbon options are widely available.

But this will not be enough to deliver the 2030 target. So that means there is a major role for ""nature-based solutions"" ‚Äî preventing deforestation and sequestering carbon in soils by changing the way we use land. Countries and companies should therefore commit not only to reaching net zero by 2050, but to making big reductions by 2030, using purchased offsets to achieve faster progress than internal action can achieve.

Last week was a great one in the fight against climate change. Now we need commitments to the challenging objective of big emissions reductions over the next decade. "

BlackRock seeks to regain lost ground in climate fight
Attracta Mooney and Owen Walker

Larry Fink's annual finger-wagging letter to chief executives has become a feature of the corporate governance calendar, often setting the agenda for global companies and shareholders alike.

In recent years the head of BlackRock has railed against short-termism and political dysfunction, argued for US companies to repatriate overseas cash, and warned businesses they must contribute more to society.

His latest missive, sent on Tuesday morning, centred on climate change and its impact on investment risk. ""Awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance,"" the chief executive of the world's biggest fund manager wrote.

It was released alongside an open letter to BlackRock's clients which set out a series of changes geared at putting sustainability at the centre of its investment approach. These include increasing the number of sustainable funds it offers, removing some coal companies from its active funds and being more transparent over its engagement and voting at investee companies.

BlackRock will also ask the companies it invests in to disclose information in line with guidelines from two influential bodies, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.

How closely the $7tn company sticks to these goals - and whether its rivals follow suit - will be closely watched.

""This is pretty bold,"" said a BlackRock shareholder. ""The key will be that it is acted on within a clear and near timeframe.""

Why is BlackRock doing this?

BlackRock has been talking about the risks of global warming for years and issued a landmark paper in 2016, where it warned that investors could no longer ignore climate change. Yet critics argue that the world's largest asset manager has failed to live up to its own rhetoric.

A report by Majority Action, a non-profit, found that last year BlackRock supported just 12 per cent of climate change resolutions, which typically call on companies to disclose the risks they face from global warming or outline their plan for transitioning to a low-carbon world. The company's stewardship team discussed environmental issues with 316 companies in 2019, representing just 15 per cent of the businesses it met with.

Environmental activists have argued that if BlackRock took global warming seriously there would be ""rapid changes on climate change"" at a corporate level. Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside its London offices last October, while groups such as BlackRock's Big Problem have sprung up, accusing the asset manager of contributing more to climate change than almost any company on earth.

At the same time, BlackRock has faced growing calls from shareholders, clients and influential figures such as Al Gore and activist investor Chris Hohn to step up on climate change.

Pension fund clients in particular have piled on the pressure. The $1.5tn Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan withdrew billions of dollars from BlackRock last year as the world's biggest pension fund put environmental, social and governance concerns at the centre of its investment ethos.

Other shareholders have also become more vocal, with a coalition filing a climate change resolution with the asset manager ahead of this year's annual meeting.

BlackRock's announcement is an attempt to ward off some of this criticism and reposition itself as a responsible investor. As former senior executive at the company says: ""This is a determined effort to regain lost ground.""

""There has been a lot of internal debate and a feeling of missing the bus on climate change,"" they added. ""You have to conclude that the decisive factors were business and reputational risk.""

What are BlackRock's competitors doing?

Although there has long been a small group of fund houses who placed greater emphasis on environmental considerations, many big asset managers are now paying attention to the issue in response to pressure from politicians, the public and clients.

As Mr Fink acknowledged in his letter to company bosses this week, the priorities of millennial investors are driving change. According to data from research company Cerulli Associates, more than two-thirds of investors under 30 would prefer their investments to have a positive social or environmental impact.

Groups including Columbia Threadneedle, Pimco, Schroders, Aviva Investors and Axa Investment Managers have poured money into ESG in recent years. Several have ditched thermal coal, including BNP Paribas Asset Management and Candriam.

Legal & General Investment Management, the UK's largest asset manager, has sold out of oil major Exxon across some of its holdings, accusing it of falling behind on environmental issues. The ¬£1tn asset manager is also using annual meetings to vote against the chairs of businesses that fail to confront the threats posed by climate change.

Diana Best, senior strategist for the Sunrise Project, part of BlackRock's Big Problem campaign, said BlackRock's announcement ""raises the bar for competitors such as Vanguard and State Street Global Advisors"".

Many big US asset managers have been slow to respond to climate change. Vanguard, the world's second-largest fund house, has faced criticism over its lack of action when it comes to global warming, as has JPMorgan Asset Management. Both companies backed climate-critical resolutions at annual meetings last year just 10 per cent of the time, according to Majority Action.

Both Vanguard and JPM AM have said voting is just one element in how they address climate issues.

State Street Global Advisors, the world's third-largest asset manager, backed climate resolutions 27 per cent of the time, compared to 95 per cent of the time at BNP Paribas AM.

How big a change will this be?

The range of measures announced by BlackRock varies in significance.

It trumpeted its announcement that it would add companies generating more than a quarter of their revenues from thermal coal production to its investment exclusion list in the next six months. But the policy will apply only to BlackRock's $1.8tn of active funds. As a result, the divestment will affect just $500m of holdings out of BlackRock's total pot of $7tn, or 0.007 per cent of assets overall.

BlackRock's $135bn alternatives business will exclude such companies only for future direct investments, but will not make divestments in its current holdings.

The exclusion criteria fall some way short of what climate campaigners had been demanding, allowing BlackRock's valuable natural resources franchise to continue investing in the majority of fossil fuel companies.

For example, Glencore, the world's biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal and a big trader of it, derives just 6 per cent of its revenues from the commodity. Apart from a handful of producers, the biggest coal companies are private.

By comparison, Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said last year it would divest from miners producing more than 20m tonnes of thermal coal, a measure which includes Glencore, BHP and Anglo American.

""The world's biggest miners and polluters will not be losing any sleep over this,"" said Extinction Rebellion, the protest group.

However BlackRock's new approach to being more open about its voting at shareholder meetings and engagement with investee companies, as well as warning it will be ""increasingly disposed"" to vote against directors where companies have not made sufficient progress, was welcomed by corporate governance experts.

Natasha Landell-Mills, head of stewardship at Sarasin & Partners, said: ""I do think this is different. They go further than I've seen before, and the investment implications are clearer, so this a matter of fiduciary duty."" "
FT-2020-4.txt," Financial Times (web site) ‚Ä¢ 892 words Climate change turns up the heat for property owners 

Oliver Ralph 

The residents of Lake Charles, a city in southern Louisiana, have had a tough few months. In August Hurricane Laura smashed through the area with winds of over 130mph, causing billions of dollars' worth of damage. Just six weeks later Hurricane Delta visited with yet more strong winds, and more heavy costs. This year's Atlantic hurricane season has been a particularly active one, with a succession of storms causing severe damage. At the same time, wildfires have ravaged other parts of the world. Together, say climate experts, they are worrying signs of what is to come. ""What climate change is doing is exacerbating pre-existing risks and expanding them,"" says Robert Muir-Wood, chief research officer at risk modelling company RMS. ""Properties which were out of reach of hazard have the potential to become included. Flood risk and wildfire risk are the two which are showing the strongest signatures of climate change at this point."" Climate change will not necessarily make storms more regular, say modelling experts, but they will be more severe when they do happen, causing extensive flooding. And increasing temperatures make wildfires more likely by drying out forests and making them easier to burn. ""Wildfire is a slightly complicated peril,"" says Mr Muir-Wood. ""What drives it is how much fuel there is around. Past years of drought in California have killed more than 100m trees. A shorter, wetter winter produces more vegetation, while a longer, drier, hotter summer dries out that vegetation and turns it into fuel."" ""A longer, drier summer also means a longer fire season. A whole series of factors are interlinking and raising the risk,"" he adds. These wildfire risks have played out in the US this year. According to Aon, the consultancy, five of California's six largest fires since 1932 were recorded in August and September this year. In Australia, meanwhile, bushfires at the end of 2019 and start of 2020 are likely to cost companies over A$1.8bn ($1.3bn), according to Perils, a data provider. insurance Beware of the rural idyll In some cases, the risks to property from climate change have been increased by people moving towards problem areas rather than away from them. Florida, for example, is facing growing flood risk but US retirees are still keen to move to the state. Meanwhile in California, the growing popularity of rural living means that people are moving to forest areas where there is a greater risk of wildfires. A report from consultants McKinsey published earlier this year lays bare just how much property owners could be exposed to rising costs. In Florida, losses from flooding could wipe $30bn-$80bn, or 15-35 per cent, off the value of exposed homes. Across the world, in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, the cost of direct infrastructure damage from a one-in-100-years flood could rise from $200m-$300m today to $500m-$1bn by 2050. Mary Ludgin, head of global research at property asset manager Heitman, says that real-estate owners need to prepare themselves. The first step is to assess the direct physical risks to properties. ""Physical risk information is widely available and not particularly expensive,"" she says. ""That's changed in the past five years."" Once these risks have been assessed, it is possible to take measures to make properties more resilient. For example, owners can install flood barriers if the building is close to a river, or move sensitive equipment to upper floors. According to Billy Grayson of the Urban Land Institute, a think tank, these measures can pay dividends as resilient buildings are likely to be able to charge more in rent than those that are more vulnerable. ""We're seeing evidence that a good resilience strategy can pay off on top-line revenue,"" he says. ""There are tenants who care deeply about business continuity and are willing to pay more to be in a building that provides them [with that continuity]."" Paying the price But physical risks are not the only threat to property. According to Mr Grayson, owners need to look at ""transition risks"" as well. These include the cost and availability of insurance, the cost of local taxes, and the investment that local governments might need to make to mitigate the risks. According to campaign group the Center for Climate Integrity, for example, coastal communities in the US face over $400bn in costs over the next 20 years to defend themselves from rising sea levels. ""Over the long term [transition risks] pose a bigger financial threat to more regions,"" says Mr Grayson. Already, some of these costs are starting to come through. Insurance companies, which have paid out billions in recent years to cover the costs of floods, storms and wildfires, are starting to adjust their prices to reflect the bigger risks. ""Insurance companies are investing in risk knowledge to better understand, model and assess risks,"" says Michael Gloor, climate change lead at Swiss Re, the reinsurance company. ""In some cases that leads to a change in risk views and their reinsurance prices."" insurance or Rising premiums reflect a world where climate change is not a future contingency but a current fact. ""The insurance industry is not pricing in the long-term impact of climate change,"" Mr Gloor says. ""The insurance industry is interested in the extent to which climate change has already affected the risk landscape."" "

Letter: The IPCC's role is neutral and non-prescriptive

In response to Benjamin Zycher's contribution to your debate on climate change and Covid-19 ( Opinion, Head to Head, May 8), the role of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is to assess published scientific research in a neutral and non-prescriptive way to inform policymakers what we know about the science related to climate change. It is not a campaigning body. The IPCC does not advocate for carbon taxes - or anything else. Its job is to provide policy options.

Governments decided in the Paris Agreement in 2015 to limit global warming to well below 2C while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5C, and invited the IPCC to prepare a report on the impacts and related emissions pathways. The IPCC responded to this invitation in 2018 with ""Global Warming of 1.5C"", an IPCC report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty. It was approved and accepted by 195 governments.

The report provides evidence that the risks of climate change are less at 1.5 than at 2C. "

Australia faces legal challenge over risks to bonds from global warming

Fixed income
Jamie Smyth ‚Äî Sydney

The Australian government is facing a class-action lawsuit from investors who allege it failed to disclose the material risks from climate change to its bonds, in what is thought to be the first case of its kind.

Student Kathleen O'Donnell, 23, who owns Australian government bonds that are traded on the country's main stock exchange, filed the civil action in the Federal Court yesterday.

The suit is the latest in a series of innovative legal challenges by Australian activists, who are pressing the government, companies and investors to take more action to tackle climate change.

""I want the Australian government to tell the truth about the risks posed by climate change,"" said Ms O'Donnell, who lives in a bushfire-affected part of Victoria and witnessed the devastation caused by fires that killed 34 people this year. The severity of the blazes sparked a fierce debate over whether climate change is to blame.

""I don't want to look towards a future where these types of bushfires are a common occurrence,"" she told the Financial Times. Australia's reliance on fossil fuels and its support for coal mining and gas development mean it remains one of the most emissionsintensive economies.

Investors following environmental, social and governance principles have targeted listed companies with poor climate credentials with divestment campaigns.

In recent months, green campaigners have launched legal actions against Australian pension funds and state bodies to push for more climate action. The class action suit argues that Australia's economy and international reputation will be significantly affected by the government's response to climate change and alleges authorities have failed to disclose these risks to investors.

As a promoter of its bonds, the government ""owes a duty of utmost candour and honesty"" to investors about the country's climate change risks, the court filing says.

The action seeks a declaration from the government that it breached its duty of disclosure by failing to address Australia's climate risks in information documents on the bonds.

An injunction restraining the government from further promoting exchange traded bonds until it complies with its duty of disclosure should be granted, it says.

Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Centre for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said the legal action, which claims Canberra is in violation of securities law due to an alleged failure to disclose climate risks, appears to be a world first.

 Covering the climate change bill Flood funding 'Only thing worse than no insurance is bad insurance' 

 Floods were once considered too irregular to insure against profitably. Global warming and technology have triggered a change of mind. But who should pay for it ‚Äî governments, industry or households? By Robert Armstrong and Oliver Ralph  Robert Armstrong and Oliver Ralph  Pam Webb worked a usual day at Truffle Lodge, her spa business in the Yorkshire village of Fishlake, near the River Don. Floods were expected nearby, but an email from the UK's Environment Agency told her that Fishlake was safe.  The agency was wrong. At 9.30pm the water started pouring into the business and Ms Webb's home next door. ""It came in the front and back, it came up through the flooring in every single ground floor room,"" she says.

Economic dam- age worldwide from flooding last year was $82bn, the greatest of any natural peril, according to Aon. Just $13bn of that was insured.  Global warming means that flooding is likely to become more frequent, say nat- ural catastrophe modelling specialists. Warmer air holds more moisture, lead- ing to wetter and more frequent severe storms. Last year, Nasa used tempera- ture data gathered from space, to reveal that every additional 1C of ocean sur- face temperature increases the probabil- ity of severe storms by 20 per cent. Meanwhile, rising sea levels mean more coastal flooding, with some estimates suggesting that 230m people are at risk from storm surges, a risk amplified by steady migration towards conurbations near coasts and rivers.  Those numbers, combined with the lack   of cover, should be an attractive target for a global insurance industry that has abundant capital after low interest rates drew fresh investors seeking better re- turns into the sector. The risk consultan- cy Milliman estimates that the US mar- ket alone could generate $48bn of annu- al premium revenue for insurers.  Floods were once considered too irregu- lar to underwrite profitably, but sophis- ticated catastrophe models ‚Äî which can more accurately predict where floods might occur ‚Äî have changed that.  ""Reinsurance companies want the risk,"" says Nancy Watkins, principal and ac- tuary at Milliman. ""They have been the leaders, and have been running around trying to sell [flood reinsurance] for four or five years.""  Of the $125bn caused Harvey "" Yet, managing the increased flooding is go- ing to be very expensive. Insurance sys- tems and government programmes have developed haphazardly, and are ill-suit- ed to deal with the growing risks. This is prompting rethink over which risks should be held publicly, and which pri- vately.  ""The world has got enough People globe at storm 3% of the insurance capital to protect against flood risk,"" says Stephen Hester, chief executive of insurer RSA. ""It's a question of whether society wants people who live on flood plains to pay the right price for the risk, or whether there should be some sort of subsidy.""  Access to cover In the US the National Flood Insurance Program, the federal scheme that provides the overwhelming majority of US residential coverage, has about 5m policies providing $1.3tn of cover. The numbers look large, but only 15 per cent of US households have any  flood coverage at all. During 2017's Hurricane Harvey that hit Texas and Louisiana, 70 per cent of the estimated $125bn in damage was uninsured.  Flood insurance is mandatory for any- one in the US with a governmentbacked mortgage ‚Äî that is, most US homeown- ers ‚Äî if the home falls into a designated ""special flood hazard area"", defined as being at risk of inundation at least once every 100 years.  But the NFIP, established in 1968, was never designed or capitalised to operate like a private insurer. The idea ""was to price the product so more people would have it and it would [then] reduce the disaster costs to the government"", says David Maurstad, chief executive of the NFIP. By design, ""the government would make up the difference"" in above- average years for flooding.  This arrangement worked until about 20 years ago. Between 1978 and 2003, the NFIP paid out claims of under $500m a year. Since then, the claims have aver- aged $3.5bn a year. Premiums and fees have been inadequate to cover the pay- outs. In 2017, the federal government forgave $16bn in NFIP debt. Even so, the scheme owes $20bn to the US Trea- sury.  around the from about population That mandatory coverage areas are too small is only part of the problem, say critics. They also give the impression that flood risk stops at a line on a map. In fact, ""flood risk varies continuously both within that 100-year floodplain and be- yond"", says Carolyn Kousky, executive director of the Wharton Risk Center. Flood risk is not included in US home insurance policies, creating the impres- sion, say flood experts, that the risk is  incidental or secondary.  These are not the only distortions.  NFIP charges premiums that do not vary with the replacement cost of houses, so expensive houses pay belowmarket rates. It means taxpayers are effectively providing subsidies for luxury beach houses. ""The more expensive your house, the better deal you are getting from the NFIP,"" Ms Watkins says. The NFIP is not permitted to withdraw cov- erage once it is granted, so pays repeat- edly to repair and rebuild thousands of homes in high-risk areas. According to Pew Charitable Trust, such ""severe repetitive loss"" properties cost the NFIP more than $12.5bn up to 2016.  Private insurers hesitate to compete against a subsidised product. A warren of state regulations makes matters worse. In Louisiana, for example, rais- ing premiums because of an ""act of God"" ‚Äî defined as a storm or other nat- ural cause ‚Äî is forbidden. Several US states ban or limit the use of catastrophe models in setting premiums.  Various attempts to reform the NFIP and bring premiums into line with the risks have met resistance from coastal resi- dents, their representatives in Congress and the real estate industry. The latest effort, ""Risk Rating 2.0"", would have linked prices and risk more closely. Originally scheduled to take effect this year, it was recently pushed into 2021.  Industry-led initiative The UK has tried a different model.  Flood Re, the UK scheme, forces all home insurance buyers to chip in to sub- sidise the cost of cover in flood-prone areas. Homeowners pay about ¬£10 a year over their existing premium and, in   theory, insurance for people in risky ar- eas becomes more affordable.  it can't happen to you. If you have, you think it won't happen again.""  Flood Re was set up by the government in 2016. If it runs out of money, the industry has to top it up, but that has not happened yet. ""The political desire at the time [it was set up] was for it to be an industry-owned solution,"" says Andy Bord, Flood Re's chief executive. To discourage new development in flood prone areas, Flood Re does not ap- ply to homes built after 2009.  Flood Re is only supposed to last for 25 years. The intention was that it should act as a catalyst for better flood planning by the government, local authorities and homeowners, so that by 2039 insurance would be more affordable for people in vulnerable areas, even without the sub- sidy.  There is scepticism in the industry about whether this is achievable. But Mr Bord says ""four out of five people [in flood prone areas] have made a saving of 50 per cent or more on their home insur- ance"". China and Australia are among the countries interested in developing a similar scheme and have asked Flood Re for details of how it works.  Flood Re has yet to be fully tested. The years since 2016 have been relatively quiet for UK floods, although recent events such as Fishlake may prove a more rigorous test. It has only dealt with 1,100 claims in total since it was set up, Mr Bord told the Financial Times in Jan- uary, far short of initial expectations that it would deal with 2,000 a year.  $Average claims paid National Insur- ance' since But they have to avoid com- placency, says Mr Bord. ""People are tak- ing action, but not fast enough,"" he says. ""If you haven't been flooded, you think  The insurability question Flood experts agree that, in relatively wealthy coun- tries, the price of living near the water must better reflect the risks, to both stop overbuilding and encourage infrastruc- ture investment. Many also believe that private insurance ‚Äî the free market ‚Äî offers the best pricing mechanism.  Yet there is a reason that, as Wharton's Ms Kousky says, ""there is almost nowhere in the world with a fully pri- vate disaster insurance market"". Floods, she says, ""are concentrated and correlat- ed risks ... you have lots of quiet years and then a really bad year"". This re- quires insurers to hold lots of capital, and therefore charge high premiums.  In some areas high premiums would bring down the prices of prime real es- tate. In others, they would force out low- income residents. The political barriers to either are high.  Barry Gilway, chief executive of Citi- zens, a Florida-based property insurer, uses the example of Florida Keys. ""Without subsidisation no homeowner could really afford to live or build in Monroe County due to the extremely high costs of funding the risk.  ""After Hurricane Irma [in 2017] they had to rebuild to new building codes.  that  While absolutely appropriate, is very expensive. With no affordable housing and extremely high cost of the US Flood Program 2003 insurance costs, where do all the people in the ser- vice industry live?"" A few steps would make the public-private balance easier to achieve. Investment in detailed public flood maps would also help increase risk  awareness and improve underwriting.  The First Street Foundation, a nonprofit group, has begun work on this in the US, but public investment is required. ""We need an atlas of flooding,"" says Sti- jn Van Nieuwerburgh, a property econ- omist at Columbia University. Ms Kousky of Wharton recommends a sys- tem modelled on the way terrorism is in- sured in the US: a private market with insurers backstopped by the govern- ment.  ""We want to have some amount of risk- based pricing [but] that's perfectly do- able even with a government backstop at a very high level,"" she says.  Following the example of the UK, new buildings could be excluded from sub- sidy programmes. Alternatively, people could be given help to make their homes more resilient, so that future floods cause less damage and cost less to re- pair. Flood Re wants to be able to cover victims not just for the costs of repairing damage but also to ""build back better"".  ""Flood risk management cannot be done by the insurance industry alone,"" says Konrad Schoeck, a flooding specialist at reinsurance group Swiss Re. ""It needs to be the insurance industry, the govern- ment and private homeowners.""  It may be that the suffering caused by flooding is not yet enough to force hard choices. But with waters continuing to rise that is unlikely to remain the case.  ""As levels of risk rise, there will be more questions about uninsurability and what you do about it,"" says Arno Hilberts, vice-president at risk modelling compa- ny RMS. ""You will reach a threshold where insurance systems don't really work.""   of financing could help.  ""There is a challenge in the way the world pays for disasters, waiting for them to happen and then paying for them, rather than preparing in advance,"" says Daniel Clarke, the centre's director. Insurance can help but it has to be tai- lored to cover the right risks. ""The only thing worse than no insurance is bad in- surance that people rely on and then it doesn't come through.""  One of the challenges is to get three very disparate groups ‚Äî insurance compa- nies, governments and aid agencies ‚Äî to work together.

BlackRock criticised over drop in climate votes
Attracta Mooney in London

BlackRock backed fewer environmental votes at annual meetings this year than last, despite chief executive Larry Fink's warning in January that climate change represented a risk to markets unlike any previous crisis.

Many of its biggest rivals, including JPMorgan Investment Management and Wellington Management, hugely increased their support of environmental resolutions this year on the back of growing concerns that efforts to tackle climate change could hit investment returns.

But BlackRock supported just 6 per cent of environmental proposals filed by shareholders globally in the 12 months to June, down from 8 per cent in the previous year, according to figures from data provider Proxy Insight. These proposals often ask companies to report their emissions or set out a plan for a transition to a low-carbon economy.

Mark van Baal, founder of FollowThis, a group that files resolutions at oil companies, criticised BlackRock for not backing more climate proposals at annual meetings. ""As a shareholder, voting and divestment are the only ways to make your request evidently visible, everything else is just talk,"" he said.

As the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock has been under intense scrutiny over how it uses its influence to convince corporate boards to respond to global warming.

This scrutiny has intensified after Mr Fink pledged in January to put sustainability at the heart of BlackRock's investment strategy by dumping some coal holdings, launching new products and stepping up conversations with companies over issues such as global warming in the process.

But Diana Best, senior strategist at the BlackRock's Big Problem Campaign, a network of non-profits, said the asset manager was ""failing to live up to the climate promises it made in January"".

She added: ""BlackRock has to get serious about using its massive shareholder power to push for climate action across the corporate sector, and that includes voting for urgent and critical shareholder resolutions and voting off more directors.""

BlackRock pushed back against the criticism, arguing shareholder resolutions were just one option available to asset managers. The $7.3tn group said it had voted against directors over climate concerns at more than 50 companies so far this year - more than the total number of climate resolutions globally.

""We engaged [with] over 400 companies that face material financial risks in the transition to a low-carbon economy, and in voting against 55 directors and putting 191 companies on watch, we leveraged the widest range of stewardship tools in addressing climate risk on behalf of our clients,"" BlackRock said.

The New York-headquartered investment company is in the process of reviewing its so-called engagement priorities, following the recruitment of Sandy Boss as head of investment stewardship in May. As part of this, BlackRock is understood to be looking at how it votes on shareholder resolutions. It is expected to announce any changes in the coming months.

Ms Boss previously served as an external member of the Bank of England's Prudential Risk Committee, where she was focused on systemic risks including climate change.

The Proxy Insight data show that JPMorgan backed 38 per cent of environmental resolutions globally this year, up from 10 per cent previously. Wellington Management Company, which oversees $1tn in assets, supported almost 42 per cent, up from 8.5 per cent.

Jennifer Wu, global head of sustainable investing at JPMorgan, said investors could not afford to ignore global warming. ""Climate change is really changing the foundation of the real economy,"" she said.

Wendy Cromwell, vice-chair and director of sustainable investment at Wellington, said: ""We believe that climate change poses a material risk across sectors and geographies that also creates investment opportunities.""

ABP targets climate neutral portfolio by 2050

GLOBAL WARMING Dutch pension fund plans deeper cuts to coal-related holdings

CHRIS FLOOD ABP, the largest Dutch pension fund, is to cut its exposure to coal miners and companies that produce oil from tar sands as part of ambitious plans to protect its ‚Ç¨456bn investment portfolio from the threats posed by global warming.

The measures, which include a commitment to ensure that its portfolio is climate neutral by 2050, will be closely scrutinised by many other pensions funds as institutional investors face pressure to strengthen their sustainable investments. Pension funds in the Netherlands and Nordics have taken the lead globally in the fight against climate change, acting as the advanced guard for big investors worldwide in pressing companies to adopt higher environmental, social and governance standards.

""ABP wants to offer all our participanSts a good pension now and in the future ‚Äî one they can enjoy in a liveable world,"" said Corien Wortmann, chairwoman of the fund that looks after 2.9m government and education employees and retirees.

ABP plans to achieve a 40 per cent reduction in carbon emissions from its equity portfolio during the next five years compared with 2015 levels.

It will phase out its s investments in companies where coal mining accounts for 30 per cent of annual turnover and also in companies where oil production from tar sands accounts for more than 20 per cent of annual turnover by 2025.

Some progress towards meeting these targets has already been achieved as part of a previous scheme to reduce the carbon footprint of APB's holdings of listed equities by a quarter by the end of 2020. ABP said it had already reached a 30 per cent reduction in the carbon emissions of its listed shares.

It also intends to commit ‚Ç¨15bn by 2025 to sustainable and affordable energy projects, including green bonds, and to ensure that a fifth of its total assets are invested in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. About 14 per cent of ABP's assets are already devoted to meeting the SDGs. Meeting the new target would raise the investment from ‚Ç¨64bn currently to about ‚Ç¨100bn.

Ms Wortmann said that ABP planned to establish new criteria by 2025 to help it assess whether companies were making efficient and sustainable use of natural resources while also respecting human rights.

""We want it to be common practice for companies to have efficient and socially responsible natural resource supply chains,"" said Ms Wortmann.

The vast majority of institutional investors have so far shied away from selling out of companies that fail to meet ESG standards in favour of engagement with management.

Norway snubs green calls to leave oil reserves in the ground

Climate change
RICHARD MILNE ‚Äî OSLO

Norway will continue to pump oil as long as there is demand, the outgoing oil minister has said, resisting growing environmental calls for Europe's biggest petroleum producer to leave its substantial reserves in the ground.

More than 50 per cent of Norway's reserves are yet to be tapped and Oslo would continue to encourage companies to drill for them, said Kjell-Borge Freiberg, who resigned yesterday to be replaced by a politician known for her scepticism about climate change.

""We will be a supplier as long as there is demand for oil and gas ... There will be demand for oil and not least gas for a long, long, long time ahead,"" he said, speaking ahead of the 50th anniversary of the discovery of oil in Norway on December 23, an event he described as its equivalent of the moon landing.

""In the same way the Americans landed on the moon in 1969, so we in Norway found oil. It made us the nation that we are. It built this country,"" he said, adding that living standards had risen over the past half-century to exceed those of Switzerland.

With the centre-right coalition government pushing green policies such as greater use of electric cars and carbon storage, Oslo is facing increasing questions about its status as western Europe's largest oil producer. Environmentalists argue that to reach the Paris climate accord's targets of a big cut in global greenhouse gas emissions, much of Norway's oil must be left in the ground.

""Who should be the first movers in leaving oil in the ground? There's no country better equipped than Norway,"" said Silje Lundberg, the head of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature.

Norway's ""smart"" decision to plough its petroleum revenues into a $1tn sovereign wealth fund, which owns an average 1.4 per cent of the shares of every listed company worldwide, leaves it well placed for the future, she added.

Mr Freiberg rejected the idea. ""The answer is no,"" he answered. His replacement will be the controversial Sylvi Listhaug from the populist Progress party, who is well-known for her remarks in 2011 that man-made emissions do not lead to climate change. Still, with growing consumer concern about climate change, the political mood in Norway is shifting. The opposition Labour party has dropped a push to start an exploration study for petroleum around the picturesque Lofoten islands and has opened up the debate on Norway's generous tax regime for explorers. Mr Freiberg said that Norway was a ""relatively small"" oil producer with 2 per cent of the world's supply and that it would be ""consumers who determine how quickly energy use will change"", not producers. Its oil sector will also receive a boost in January when its largest field in three decades, the Johan Sverdrup project, opens officially with an expected lifetime of about 50 years.

Ms Lundberg said that Norway's insistence on maintaining its petroleum industry flew in the face of its commitments under the Paris pact.

Nuns attack BlackRock over climate change

Nuns lambast BlackRock over climate change
ATTRACTA MOONEY

Attracta Mooney A group of Catholic nuns has taken aim at BlackRock's record on climate change, adding their voice to a growing chorus including Al Gore that claim the biggest fund manager is not doing enough.

Mercy Investment Services, the investment programme of the Sisters ofMercy of the America.s, lambasted the $7tn asset manager's voting record on climate change resolutions at the annual meetings of companies inwhichit invests.

The sisters have filed a motion ahead of BlackRock's annual meeting next year, calling for the asset manager to review its voting policies related to climate change.Theresolution has been co-filed by more than 10 other BlackRock shareholders, including several religious groups.

Mercy Investment Services said that in 2019 BlackRock supported only six of 52 climate-related resolutions, such as requests for enhanced disclosure of carbon emissions or those calling for an adoption of greenhouse gas reduction goals. This is despite BlackRock's own research suggesting climate change poses a risk to investmentreturns.

In the resolution, Mercy Investment Services said that the asset manager's voting practices ""appear continued on page2 FTfm is taking a two-week print breakandwillbebackonJanuary6 inconsistent with its statements about climate change"", posing a reputational risk for the company with both clients and investors. ""Proxy voting practices that ignore climate change seem to ignore significant company-specific and economy-wide risks associated with negative impacts of climate change,"" the resolution said.

""We believe it is BlackRock's fiduciary responsibility to review how climate change impacts ‚Ä¶ portfolio companies, evaluate how specific shareholder resolutions on climate may impact shareholder value, and vote accordingly.""

A similar resolution was filed for the 2017 annual meeting, which was later withdrawn by shareholders after engagement with BlackRock. However, shareholders said there had been ""woefully inadequate progress"" since then on climate voting, leading to this new shareholder motion.

BlackRock said it would speak to the filers of the resolution. It added its stewardship team had ""engaged with 370 companies globally on a range of environmental topics"", including the business impact of a shift to a lower-carbon economy. ""Where companies have not responded to our engagement or where we do not see progress,[the] Black-Rock investment stewardship [team] continues to vote against directors and, where relevant, for shareholder proposals,"" the company said.

Tech titans find their climate conscience

New innovations can only go so far in tackling global warming

With the smoke still clearing from Australia's devastating wildfires, and thousands of British householders squelching through flood-ravaged homes, some of the world's richest companies and individuals are finding their climate conscience. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and the world's wealthiest man, this week pledged a $10bn fund to support ""scientists, activists, NGOs"" or ""any effort"" with a realistic chance of helping to protect the natural world.

His move followed last month's promise by Microsoft ‚Äî the world's most valuable company by market capitalisation ‚Äî to launch a $1bn innovation fund and to go ""carbon negative"" by 2030, with the aim of offsetting by 2050 all the carbon emissions it has made since its founding in 1975.

US business, including Big Tech, is waking up to the risks of climate change ‚Äî and trusting in science to find solutions. Donations such as these can give a vital boost to research into technology that could be transformative in the long-term battle to halt rising global temperatures.

Improving battery storage, for example, could transform the shipping industry. Technology to enable the cheaper production of environmentally-friendly hydrogen could lower the cost of clean energy generation, domestic heating and various modes of transport. Better carbon capture knowhow is vital to cleaning up the atmosphere. A true ""moonshot""-style approach would include grants to research into nuclear fusion, an elusive technology that has truly transformative possibilities. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates has long been a fusion advocate.

Yet there are dangers in being seduced by tech entrepreneurs' belief that innovation can find silver bullets. Even $10bn is a drop in the ever-rising ocean when it comes to the investments needed to tackle the climate challenge. Governments and the financial sector will have to mobilise resources on a vastly bigger scale to fund the creation of low-emission public transport networks, the shift to renewable energy sources and the insulation of homes and businesses. Their owners' philanthropic efforts should not distract from technology companies' need to change their own practices. While cyber space and the ""cloud"" may be ethereal concepts, the impact of data centres and computing on the physical world is very tangible. Information and communications technology is estimated to consume between 5 and 9 per cent of the world's electricity.

For all its technological sophistication, moreover, Amazon is still a retailer ‚Äî one that delivers 10bn items a year. Its supply chain relies heavily on diesel vans for door-to-door deliveries. It ordered 20,000 such vans from Mercedes-Benz in 2018 as part of its investment in faster deliveries for Prime members, though Mr Bezos told staff last year it was ordering 100,000 electric delivery vehicles due to enter its fleet in 2024.

The Amazon chief's generosity is also related to the power of employee pressure. More than 8,700 Amazon staff last April signed an open letter to the founder demanding the company cut its carbon emissions, end its use of fossil fuels, and stop providing ""custom solutions"" using its technology to help with oil and gas extraction and exploration. Mr Bezos responded with a range of efforts to cut Amazon's carbon footprint ‚Äî a day before thousands of employees staged a walkout to highlight their criticism of its climate practices. As popular anger builds, company bosses will find out that enacting eco-friendly policies is a business necessity rather than a branding exercise.

Democracies that failed the Covid test will struggle on climate change
Gavyn Davies

The writer is chairman of Fulcrum Asset Management

The second wave of the pandemic continues to gather pace in Europe and the United States, but the optimistic news about vaccines has trumped these worries in the minds of investors.

Because they see the global boost to economic activity from the vaccine as potentially larger than any loss of fiscal stimulus in 2021, the markets have interpreted the news as a demand shock, raising bond yields and damaging the relative performance of technology stocks versus cyclicals.

For now, this seems to be a rational response. But the persistent failure of governments in the major western democracies to control the pandemic has lessons for the future, particularly for our efforts to tackle climate change.

Public resistance to lockdown measures made early and strict restrictions, accompanied by effective test, trace and isolation policies, politically infeasible in most of Europe and the US all year. But aggressive restrictions and testing regimes have worked well in Asia and the Pacific.

The comparative results are stark. The cumulative Covid-19 death rate per million of the population is nearly 740 in the US, and 760 in the UK, compared with 3 in China and 15 in Japan, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Opposition to enforced lockdowns in the major western countries is to some extent based on a libertarian belief in economic freedom. This is a legitimate political choice that is usually fully justified but has proved costly in current circumstances. Furthermore, public support for strict measures has been eroded by serious operational failings.

Political opinion has also been moulded by the epidemiological and economic characteristics of this pandemic, which are particularly challenging.

Infectious diseases in their initial stages tend to grow at exponential rates. For example, if they double every three days, they will increase 1,000-fold within a month, unless slowed down by social distancing or herd immunity. But human beings struggle to grasp that idea, and instead tend to assume that the number of cases will grow by the same absolute number each day, leading them to underestimate the danger.

This exponential growth fallacy is a well known feature of human behaviour, including in people who are trained to avoid it. The natural time lag between cases, hospitalisations and then deaths further exacerbates the tendency to wait too long before announcing policy restrictions.

Another issue, very familiar to economists, is the pervasive role that externalities have played in the spread of coronavirus. When an infectious person fails to self-isolate, many other people are placed at risk of disease and thus bear the costs of this individual's decision.

This should present a watertight case for public intervention to enforce social distancing and isolation, especially after positive tests.

Further complicating the response for democracies has been the argument over how to weigh the health benefits of lockdowns and social distancing against the economic costs. Over short periods, the two do conflict, but economist Simon Wren-Lewis has persuasively argued that this is not true in the longer term.

That's because a decision to avoid lockdowns today is likely to lead to exponential growth in cases in the future, resulting in more stringent restrictions, and greater damage to businesses. Considered dynamically, both health and the economy eventually benefit from early and decisive virus control.

The failure of most western democracies to accept these arguments for early restrictions demonstrates the potency of the behavioural biases involved and their fundamental political belief in free markets.

The arrival of effective vaccines might mean that US president-elect Joe Biden will soon be able to focus beyond the virus. But it is obvious that the problems of market failure that plagued responses to Covid-19 also apply to his other big international focus, climate change.

The effects of climate change also increase exponentially, albeit over a much longer period than a pandemic. Time lags between cause and effect are very lengthy, making interpretation obscure to the public. Externalities are unavoidable, and apply across international borders, making them even harder to address. Human biases leave us systematically underprepared to address serious but remote risks.

The climate problem is therefore even less suited to free market solutions than Covid-19.

America's promised return to the Paris accord is the first and necessary step on a very long road. No one has thought of a magic bullet for global warming, equivalent to a vaccine against Covid-19. This problem will have to be solved the hard way.

FT-2020-5.txt," Financial Times ‚Ä¢ p. 6 ‚Ä¢ 440 words Washington retreat from Paris climate accord confirmed Environmental pact LESLIE HOOK ‚Äî LONDON KATRINA MANSON ‚Äî WASHINGTON 

The US has formally withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, two-and-a-half years after President Donald Trump announced plans to pull out of the ambitious environmental pact. The exit of the second-biggest global carbon dioxide emitter from the 189-nation accord is a milestone in a presidency that has pushed through a weakening of environmental regulations and voiced support for the fossil fuel sector. Mr Trump has described the pact as a deal that ""disadvantages the US to the exclusive benefit of other countries"". The US, under then president Barack Obama, played a central role in developing the 2015 accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C. The US exit, the culmination of a bureaucratic process that began a year ago, will be completed automatically and is not dependent on the result of Tuesday's presidential election. But if Democratic challenger Joe Biden becomes president, the US could rejoin the Paris accord quickly. He has said he would do so on his first day in office. ""If Biden wins, then the fact that the withdrawal became final on November 4 really won't matter,"" said Todd Stern, who was the top US climate negotiator during the Obama administration. The US is the only country that has formally left the Paris accord, although several other nations, including Brazil, have talked about quitting. Signatories include China, which announced in September that it would try to become carbon neutral by 2060. Japan and South Korea have also announced net zero targets in recent weeks. Mr Biden has promised a $2tn climate stimulus package and said he would introduce a target of net zero emissions for the US by 2050. He will also aim to make electricity generation emission-free by 2035, which would close coal and gas-fired power stations. Mr Trump has focused on loosening environmental regulations, including watering down vehicle emissions standards set by the Obama administration. ""If Trump wins, it is likely that not much will change regarding their stance on climate right away,"" said Sarah Ladislaw, director of the climate change programme at the Center for International and Strategic Studies. ""It is quite likely other countries with ambitious emissions reduction targets ... will try to influence US behaviour through cross-border carbon tariffs and a push to influence the global financial system to incorporate climate considerations."" Contentious issues for the next round of climate talks in Scotland next year include creating global carbon markets ‚Äî which a Biden administration would support ‚Äî and increasing climate donations from rich countries to poor.

Citizens' assembly on climate crisis to hold first meeting

Net zero
CAMILLA HODGSON

bly will begin in Birmingham on Saturday, where 110 UK citizens will gather to thrash out solutions for reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

A citizens' assembly for climate change, convened over two months at a cost of ¬£520,000, will discuss how to meet the government's legally binding goal. The participants, selected to reflect the make-up of the UK population, will aim to produce a series of non-binding recommendations for parliament about how to decarbonise sectors such as transport and housing.

""The citizens' assembly on climate change gives people a say on how the UK tackles climate change,"" said Rachel Reeves MP, former chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, one of the six House of Commons select committees that commissioned and part-funded the project. The first weekend is an educational meeting, where participants will learn about the climate crisis. Options for reaching net zero by 2050, such as taxing frequent flyers, will then be chosen by the participants from a range being drawn up by four experts.

The specific questions and potential solutions to be debated ‚Äî which will be considered by a 19-strong advisory panel and the six select committees ‚Äî will then be made public.

Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said the goal should be 2025. It said the assembly lacked teeth, since ministers can ""completely ignore"" the advisory report, due in April.

Of the 30,000 people invited at random to take part, 2,000 agreed. The final 110 assembly members were chosen by computer to reflect the population, based on age, gender, ethnicity, education, where they live and their level of concern about climate change.

Craig Bennett, outgoing head of Friends of the Earth, said the assembly ""could play an important role"" in decarbonising the UK, but should not ""delay things further"".

Rising water sparks climate change fears in the Great Lakes
Michigan Notebook by Patti Waldmeir

Lakefront property owners lose sleep over flood risks. High school students fill sandbags to protect the fragile coastline. America's Great Lakes, the largest body of fresh water on Earth, are at, or near, historically high levels.

That scenario sounds all too familiar to local residents: last month Lake Michigan, the most variable of the Great Lakes, hit its highest levels since records began. But actually, I'm describing 1969, when I was one of the high-schoolers happy to be let off lessons to break my back on lugging sandbags, rather than my brain on trigonometry. There was ample angst then, too, about high water and the disappearing coastline. The difference was, no one blamed it on global warming way back then.

Today, climate change is everyone's go-to explanation. When I walk my dogs on lakeside paths turned to ice rinks by the overflowing water, other dog owners mutter darkly about global warming. When Lake Michigan's waves crash over Chicago's lakefront hiking trails, the radio anchor fingers climate change. When Lake Superior floods my camper van site in the wilds of the state's Upper Peninsula, a fellow camper assures me it's because ""Republicans don't believe in global warming"".

But is that really what's going on? In this presidential election year, and in the deeply liberal corner of the Midwest where I live, questioning the reasons for Great Lakes flooding can be seen as a political act.

Even the experts admit there are contradictory factors at play: ""It's a cycle. The Great Lakes have gone up and down forever and there's every reason to believe they will continue to do so,"" says Richard Norton, who works on Great Lakes coastal management at the University of Michigan's Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. ""The lakes go down just long enough for people to forget that they go up again."" While Prof Norton does not question the evidence of global warming, he confesses it is hard to predict its future effect on lake levels: ""In terms of overall water levels, who knows what the impact of climate change will be?"" he asks.

Some experts predict that warmer temperatures will lead to more precipitation, thus higher lake levels. They note that last month was the hottest January on Earth since records began, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Others predict rising temperatures will lead to more evaporation and thus lower lake levels. ""There is some reason to think that the fluctuations might come faster, and highs will be higher and lows lower, but even that isn't certain,"" says Prof Norton.

""One thing we know for sure is that the Midwest has seen an increase in precipitation of about 10 per cent over the past five decades,"" says Donald Wuebbles, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and lead author of a 2019 report into the impact of global warming on the Great Lakes. Prof Wuebbles, a former climate change adviser to Barack Obama, notes that much of that precipitation is coming in ever more violent storms, which have an outsized effect on Great Lakes coastlines.

""Is this going to be more the norm? We don't know yet. It's likely to be cyclic, as it's been in the past, but maybe it will weight to having higher lake levels. We don't have the definitive studies we need to know.""

""It sounds dramatic to say it's a 100-year high,"" says Prof Norton. ""But it's been high like that in the past and it will be high like that in future."" What is different now from my sandbagging days 50 years ago, he says, is the amount of property that has been built along coastlines since then.

""It's not so much nature that is changing but that we haven't paid attention to nature. There is a lot more property at risk than in the 1970s and 1980s."" What we call natural disasters only end up that way because we have ""moved too close and not paid enough attention to nature"", he adds.

So will my dogs soon be able to run along the beach that has disappeared since the summer? Will Chicago's Lakeshore Drive have to be closed again, as it was when it flooded in 1987? Will I be able to camp on Lake Superior next summer without my camper van floating away to Canada? It could go either way. "

Natural disasters focus minds on cost of climate crisis

Scientists urge action as rising temperatures, extreme weather, devastating wildfires and vanishing Arctic ice become more common
LESLIE HOOK ‚Äî LONDON

The worst wildfires in US history, Arctic sea ice trending towards a historic low, simultaneous hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean and the hottest summer in the northern hemisphere since records began: scientists say this year's sequence of natural disasters and record temperatures exceeds their worst fears.

""We were speculating 40 years ago about things that might happen, and I don't think that any of us expected that in our lifetimes we would see these things unfolding,"" said Chris Rapley, a professor of climate science at University College London. ""It has become a real problem of today, rather than a predicted problem of tomorrow."" The natural disasters have brought home the great economic and social costs of a hotter planet, which has warmed by about 1C over the past century.

The wildfires across the US west coast have burnt more than 5m acres, pumping an estimated 110m tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of the UK's entire power sector.

Smoke from the blazes, has travelled high in the atmosphere as far as northern Europe, according to satellite data from the EU's Copernicus atmospheric monitoring services.

""The scale and magnitude of these fires are at a level much higher than in any of the 18 years that our monitoring data covers,"" said Mark Parrington, a wildfire scientist at Copernicus.

In the US, the smoke has reached as far as New York City and Washington, tinting the sky with a visible haze.

While Donald Trump, the US president, has sought to blame the fires mainly on forest management, climate scientists disagree. ""All of these things that are happening are predicted consequences of climate change,"" said Philip Duffy, head of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Massachusetts.

""People ask if this is the new normal and I say no, it will keep getting worse as long as we keep adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."" Friederike Otto, head of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said record temperatures had meant that ""fire weather"" ‚Äî the dry conditions that cultivate wildfires ‚Äî had become more frequent and more intense. ""Where we really see the clearest and biggest sign of climate change is in extreme temperatures,"" she said.

New temperature maximums have been recorded across the world from California's Death Valley, which hit 54.4C, to the Russian Far East, where 38C was recorded inside the Arctic Circle. In Brazil the Pantanal, one of the world's largest wetlands, has been burning since mid-July following a drought. Prof Rapley compared California to the Sahara desert ‚Äî which underwent a big climatic shift and desertification about 6,000 years ago ‚Äî and said a similar change could be under way. ""The California wildfires have come on much more rapidly and are much more disastrous than we had anticipated."" Other researchers said the impact of global warming had been in line with scientific models but that the human and social cost had been much greater than expected. ""Our societies are really only adapted to a small range of possible weather,"" said Prof Otto. ""What 2020 shows is that 1C of warming, exactly what we expected ... already brings our societies toward the edge of what we are able to cope with.""

Fighting the blazes in the US this year has cost $2bn so far, while the total direct cost of fire damage could be as high as $50bn, according to Tom Corringham, an economist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography near San Diego.

""The scale is staggering,"" said Mr Corringham. ""These are not transient shocks to the economy. These are permanent reductions in growth associated with climate change.""

As if to emphasise the new pattern of extreme, weather-related events, while California's forests have burnt, scientists this week identified five simultaneous hurricanes and tropical storms in the Atlantic for only the second time on record.

Hurricane Sally, which made landfall on Wednesday in Alabama and Florida, has brought winds of more than 100mph. The US is forecasting an ""extremely active"" hurricane season.

Even so Tim Lenton, a professor of climate change at the UK's University of Exeter, said it was not in the US but in the polar regions that the signs of irreversible climate change were most concerning.

The area covered by ice in the Arctic Sea is tracking towards a historic low this year, and the Greenland ice sheet has also lost mass.

""It is not just this year's evidence but a decade of evidence that leads me to the view that we may have passed one or two tipping points already in the climate system,"" said Prof Lenton.

The reduction of Arctic sea ice creates a vicious cycle of warming. With less white ice on the ocean's surface to reflect the sun's heat, the water temperature rises, leading to even less ice reflecting even less heat, a key reason why the Arctic is warming more than three times faster than the rest of the planet.

""We know in the long run if we keep persisting in heating the planet up, not only do you risk losing this summer sea ice in the Arctic, but eventually you might lose it year round,"" said Prof Lenton. "

Companies are at last being called to account for climate risks
FINANCE John Plender

C ompanies have been promising for years to come clean about their exposure to climate risk. But 2020 may prove to be the moment that investors finally force them to do it. That will put the onus on auditors to step up and challenge the way managers assess ‚Äî or obfuscate ‚Äî the impact of decarbonisation on financial accounts.

As things stand, many big investors fear that companies in energy-intensive industries are failing to recognise the potential hit to asset values posed by climate risk.

Some utilities may be failing to depreciate thermal power plants quickly enough, given that many might need to be scrapped to help meet the 2015 Paris agreement target to keep global warming well below 2 degrees centigrade.

Energy groups may also be failing to acknowledge that fossil fuel prices will almost certainly drop in the transition to a low-carbon economy if governments require their use to be accompanied by expensive carbon capture and storage. This could lead companies to leave hard-to-extract oil and gas in the ground as ""stranded assets"".

A third concern is that companies are not setting aside money for contingent liabilities such as fines and litigation of the kind that forced Pacific Gas and Electric Corporation into bankruptcy after wildfires in California.

There are signs that auditors are starting to rise to the challenge. Most companies currently put their sustainability reporting in the management narrative at the front of annual reports. Much of it is unhelpful because there are so many standards and initiatives in this area that they confuse users of accounts and companies themselves, according to Hans Hoogervorst, chair of the International Accounting Standards Board. He also argues that greenwashing ‚Äî companies puffing their sustainability credentials ‚Äî is rampant. The extreme example is Volkswagen, which portrayed itself as a green model while cheating on emissions tests. The big oil companies also trumpet their green efforts while continuing to invest far more in fossil fuels than in renewables. They are cheerfully assuming there will be no punitive legislation on taxing carbon dioxide emissions.

IASB recently put out an important practice note explaining that climate risks are potentially very material for reported assets and liabilities, and therefore for future corporate profits and dividends. The note specifically addresses issues such as depreciation and stranded assets that have worried institutional investors. It emphasises that it is not sufficient for directors to make a quantitative impact of climaterelated risks. Auditors must also be on the alert for information that would influence a company's investors or creditors if it is omitted, misstated or obscured.

This matters because most big investors are anxious to minimise the risk of climate change on their performance. More than 370 investors with $35tn of assets under management have signed up to the Climate Action 100+ initiative that seeks to force the largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change. And environmental, social and governance funds are growing rapidly as an asset class. IASB has no powers to enforce its practice note and it does not apply to the US, which uses different standards. But the guidance will be influential across much of the global corporate sector and will provide a valuable lever for investors when they engage with companies. The European Commission is adding further impetus to improving disclosure with its plan to align the bloc's financial system with the Paris agreement's goals. It has set out a framework for companies to provide reliable, consistent data. Last month, the Spanish group Repsol became the first oil and gas company to set a target of net zero emissions by 2050: it will aim to capture as much carbon as it releases and sells. In doing so, it has revalued its assets on a basis compatible with the Paris agreement and taken an impairment charge of ‚Ç¨4.8bn. This will put pressure on other big energy companies to go for net zero emissions ‚Äî and Repsol's auditor, Deloitte, faces an issue of consistency as with the accounts of other energy clients including Total and BP.

Does this mean that more realistic accounting will soon permit markets to put a more realistic price on climate risk? Only in part. There remain huge uncertainties, especially with carbon pricing. The OECD estimates that today's carbon prices are far too low to make a material impact on global warming. Draconian policy measures may be needed to reduce emissions.

Making good judgments about the timing and potential impact of this on asset values, earnings and cash flows is extraordinarily difficult. But accounting has always been an imprecise art and where climate risk is concerned it is finally moving in a positive direction. "

Record Antarctic temperature met with sound of cracking ice

As continent experiences warmer weather this week, experts warn of accelerating glacial melt
LESLIE HOOK ‚Äî ESPERANZA BASE, ANTARCTIC PENINSULA

Brenda Zaccheo was weighing baby penguins when she noticed the unusually warm wind sweeping over the colony that lives on a rocky outcrop at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.

""We were wearing these work suits and it was really hot so we had to take them off,"" said Ms Zaccheo, an Argentine field assistant working at the nearby Esperanza Base research station. Thursday's ""strong and warm"" breeze ""reminded me of the wind in Buenos Aires,"" she added.

The temperature at Esperanza Base that day was 18.3C, the highest recorded in Antarctica. Surpassing the previous record set five years ago by 0.8C, it underscores how rapidly climate change is affecting the polar region, exacerbating fears about the devastating effects on its glaciers and ice caps. It reflects a warming trend across the Antarctic Peninsula, which is heating up much faster than the rest of the continent.

According to Lieutenant Captain Norman Walter Nahueltripay, chief of the Argentine base, the temperature at this time of year normally ranges between -5C and +5C. ""I think it's a product of global warming ... You really see climate change materialising here,"" he said. Next to the base, two huge waterfalls poured from a melting glacier, underscoring the processes at work.

""One thing we've seen recently is that it rains a lot, rather than snowing,"" Lieutenant Captain Nahueltripay added. ""If you talk to the old-timers who have spent a lot of time here, they're so surprised to hear that there's rain instead of snow.""

The Earth has warmed about 1.1C on average since pre-industrial times, but a phenomenon known as polar amplification has ensured that the Antarctic Peninsula warms more quickly. Temperatures in the peninsula rose by about 3C in the 50 years to 2000. While the rate of warming appears to have slowed slightly since then due to natural weather variations, the process is continuing.

One giant glacier near the Esperanza Base is covered with brown dust and soot, and has shrunk noticeably since the outpost was established in 1953.

""People who come back to visit who've been here before always tell us that the glacier used to be much larger,"" said Ms Zaccheo. The brown colour of the glacier's surface, due to the lack of fresh snow, makes it melt even faster.

""When bright snow and ice is melted and replaced by dark ocean and land, it absorbs rather than reflects the sun's heat,"" said Martin Siegert, a glaciology professor at Imperial College London. ""This means small temperature rises can have big effects.""

Esperanza Base consists of a cluster of bright red buildings ‚Äî including a caf√©, church and school ‚Äî and it is nearly overrun by penguins from the nearby colony.

In summer, the base is home to several dozen researchers gathering field samples, of everything from feathers to ice and bird vomit. The 38 current residents will remain there until March when they will be replaced by Argentine families who will spend the winter there with their children.

Esperanza Base also experiences unusual temperatures due to a local wind pattern known as a F√∂hn wind. This phenomena, triggered by strong winds blowing across a mountain range, causes warm air to form on the downwind side of the mountain. John King, professor of ice and climate at the British Antarctic Survey, said the previous record temperature at Esperanza Station had occurred at a time when those winds were present.

""F√∂hn winds over the Larsen Ice Shelf to the south of Esperanza cause extensive melting,"" he said.

The F√∂hn winds ""may have contributed to the loss of the northern sections of this ice shelf in recent decades"", he added.

Meanwhile, the unusually high temperatures, as well as accelerating the melting of the huge glaciers that cover the volcanic mountains, are also contributing to a reduction in sea ice, which is critical for the survival of many Antarctic animal species.

The melting ice of Antarctica, Greenland and other glaciated areas is leading to a sea level rise of about 3mm per year. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted that sea levels could rise by as much as one metre by the end of this century due to accelerating ice melt.

The sound of ice cracking and breaking up often echoes across Esperanza Base, residents say, and several noted how the ice had been noisier than usual in recent days.

""Many pieces fell off the glacier yesterday,"" said Ms Zaccheo. ""If it's even 1C [above zero] you can hear the ice crack.""

Reaction to outbreak can't ignore climate change

Letters

In his column on the urgent need for co-ordinated economic policy responses to the coronavirus threat, Wolfgang M√ºnchau criticises European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde for talking too much about green finance and climate change, and wonders whether this has become too much of a distraction from what he considers the more urgent task at hand. (""The eurozone is too complacent about the coronavirus threat"", March 9.) As much as I agree with his point that we need urgent policy responses to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus, the notion that climate change is something we can deal with another time is utterly wrong. Indeed, any crisis responses, be they fiscal or monetary, should be judged on their sustainability impact.

All countercyclical policy measures should be either carbon neutral or carbon negative. We have already missed the opportunity to implement sustainable crisis responses during the 2008-09 crisis. We should not waste another crisis. "

US investors say climate change is a systemic risk

NET-ZERO FUTURE Pension funds push Fed, SEC and CFTC to make policy shift
MATTHEW VINCENT

US investors managing nearly $1tn of assets have written to Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell and other regulators urging them to treat climate change as a systemic financial risk.

Multibillion-dollar pension funds including Calstrs and the Seattle City Employee Retirement System, as well as the New York State and New York City Comptrollers, called on US authorities ""to implement a range of actions to explicitly integrate climate change across [their] mandates"".

Among those receiving the demands were the Fed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, state insurance regulators, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

""It is more clear than ever that the climate crisis poses a systemic threat to financial markets and the real economy, with significant disruptive consequences on asset valuations and our nation's economic stability,"" investors warned. ""You lead a critically important agency that has a mandate to protect US market stability and global competitiveness. This carries with it a responsibility to act on the climate crisis right now.""

In addition to the investors, the letters are signed by five former members of Congress, several former financial regulators, venture capital groups, trade associations, and large philanthropic foundations.

Bob Inglis, the former Republican congressman for South Carolina who now leads republicEn.org, a group of conservatives focused on climate change, said the issue was no longer one for partisan debate. ""Climate change presents real financial risks to our economy, putting millions of lives and livelihoods at risk,"" he said. ""This is not a political issue. It's a scientific issue, it's a human issue, and it's a financial issue.""

The pressure to tackle the climate threat comes as president Donald Trump's administration seeks to make it harder for investors themselves to incorporate environmental concerns in their own strategies. Last month, the US Department of Labor proposed a new rule that would require pension administrators to prove they were not sacrificing financial returns by choosing investments based on environmental, social and governance principles. At the time, Eugene Scalia, the US labor secretary, said: ""Private employer-sponsored retirement plans are not vehicles for furthering social goals or policy objectives that are not in the interest of the plan.""

But the investors who have signed the letter to regulators say they back a ""transition to a NET-ZERO FUTURE"" in terms of carbon emissions. They also encourage authorities to consider the findings of a new report by advocacy group Ceres, which identifies more than 50 specific actions they could take immediately to address climate risk.

EU regulators are also being pressed to use their powers. Last month, a report by research body Finance Watch ‚Äî written by a board member at the French financial regulatorwho is also one of the EU's technical experts on sustainable finance ‚Äî warned that climate change posed a bigger threat than coronavirus.

Keep on climate path, urge investors
ATTRACTA MOONEY

Big investors h ave urged companies to maintain their focus on reducing carbon emissions, even as businesses grapple with the economic fallout of coronavirus.

Eight investment groups, including BNP Paribas Asset Management, DWS and Comgest Asset Management, told FTfm that tackling global warming must continue to be a priority for public companies, despite unprecedented pressure on businesses globally after government measures to tackle the pandemic left whole sectors unable to operate.

The investors said businesses would be given leeway when it came to climate change this year, but warned against backtracking on targets to reduce carbon emissions.

""We will be quite vigilant that companies do not use this to cancel or postpone some commitments they have already made,"" said S√©bastien Thevoux-Chabuel, a portfolio manager at Comgest, the French asset manager.

""What is happening now is what we could see with climate change ... with a lot of supply and demand falling.""

Michael Herskovich, head of corporate governance at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said the ‚Ç¨440bn fund house continued to discuss climate change with the businesses it invests in.

Over the past couple of years, big investors have pushed companies to tackle their carbon emissions, teaming up together through initiatives such as Climate Action 100+, amid growing concerns of an economic fallout from global warming. Partly in response to investor and customer pressure, businesses have begun making so-called net-zero commitments ‚Äî pledging to cut or offset emissions by taking an equivalent amount out of the atmosphere through carbon capture and other technologies.

Companies including oil major BP, British bank Barclays, food company Nestl√©, miner Vale and airline group IAG have all set net-zero targets, usually for 2050. On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell became the biggest global energy group to announce a net-zero emissions target. "

Central bank chiefs call for business to act faster on climate risk

Cop26
LESLIE HOOK AND MARTIN ARNOLD LONDON

Mark Carney and Christine Lagarde have urged companies, institutions and central banks to speed up climate risk assessment and disclosure, ahead of the Glasgow climate summit in November.

Addressing the heads of several of the UK's largest banks at the Guildhall in London yesterday, Mr Carney, governor of the Bank of England, called on more institutions to join the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, an initiative to get companies to calculate their exposure to climate risk and disclose it to investors.

he said. he hoped the standards would rCentral Bank, threw her weight behind calls for companies to provide much fuller disclosure of their exposure to climate change risks.

Ms Lagarde cited the patchy level of information provided by the 26 biggest eurozone banks and insurers as evidence that ""we still have some way to go"". She added: ""Only five out of the 26 partially disclose the impact of their financial assets and none of them provide full disclosure.""

The central bank chiefs were speaking at the launch of a finance agenda for the UN climate summit, known as Cop26, in Glasgow.

""The objective for the private finance work of this Cop26 is simple ‚Äî to ensure that every financial decision takes climate change into account,"" Mr Carney said. ""Every company, every bank, every insurer will have to adjust their business models.""

Mr Carney said that working with other regulators who were undertaking climate stress tests would be a top priority, pointing out that 15 jurisdictions other than the UK had committed to doing so.

But the absence of the US ‚Äî which under President Donald Trump is preparing to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement this autumn ‚Äî will make global central bank action difficult.

Mr Carney, who is also UN special envoy for climate action and finance and is set to step down from the BoE in March, has made climate change risk a priority and last year launched the bank's first climate stress tests for large banks and institutions.

The Guildhall event highlighted that climate finance, and adapting the financial system to address climate risks, would be a big theme ahead of the Glasgow summit.

Ms Lagarde, who promised to make climate change risk ""a mission-critical priority"" when she took over as ECB president last year, said: ""Central banks need to devote greater attention to understanding the impact of climate change, including its implications for inflation dynamics.""

Some (the offices of PwC) used plain wooden boards; others (Givenchy) had stylish barriers that projected their logo. One (Theory clothing) even featured cheery flowers on the wood. All signalled three things: first, business leaders know the political climate is (sadly) creating profound new risks; second, many are braced for this to last; third, a few companies are putting a brave face on it and trying to adapt. Investors should learn from them. Even if there is a clear outcome to the US presidential election soon, this week's events are not an outlier this is the culmination of a zeitgeist shift that has been building for a dozen years. Investors must recognise this, since it will not be reversed whoever next sits in the White House. Think back to early 2007, just before the financial crisis. It was taken for granted by western business leaders and financiers or ""Davos man"" that globalisation, free-market capitalism, innovation and democracy were self-evidently good things that would only spread and deepen. No, that did not mean investors accepted the ""end of history"" idea pioneered by historian Francis Fukuyama. But there was an assumption that the world was moving in one direction. That fostered confidence to plan ahead with a vision of time and time horizons as consistent as Newtonian physics. No longer. Since 2008, faith in all four of those ideas has wilted. Globalisation is the most obvious case in point. As an annual metric compiled by DHL and NYU Stern Business school shows, the global integration of money and goods has slowed, even though the movement of people and information (via the internet) has remained more robust. And in the case of the US, the White House is almost certainly set to keep embracing America-first policies whoever wins. The only difference is that the version of ""patriotism"" from the Democrats' Joe Biden would sound cuddlier than Donald Trump's, embracing global climate change initiatives and promoting a strategy of localisation tightly enmeshed with pro-union policies. Free-market capitalism is also in retreat. That is partly because the US Federal Reserve has unleashed so many trillions of dollars of quantitative easing that financial market signals are being distorted. The divergence of equity prices from the real economy this year is one example of this. All this means the US has been sliding towards what the US military calls ""Vuca"": volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. This week's events are a symptom of this, not a cause. So how should investors respond? First, they should expect asset prices to be volatile. Second, they should remember that time horizons can change and are now shortening. Third, they should note that it pays to embrace businesses with a ""just-in-case"" mentality, rather than the ""just-in-time"" philosophy that dominated the expansion of global supply chains in previous decades. Last, they must realise that the environmental, social and governance trend, and stakeholder mantra, will remain whoever wins the election. That is not because ESG is a tool of activism; the key issue is that it is also a tool of risk management. In a Vuca world it pays to be resilient, and companies can only do so if they track the ""externalities"" that used to be excluded from economists' models such as income inequality or climate change. it another way, Or to put investors should take a leaf from the book of those Manhattan store owners: batten down the hatches; accept that uncertainty will last; embrace lateral vision, not tunnel vision. Then adapt with some metaphorical flowers. gillian.tett@ft.com aid government But remember, too, that even under Mr Trump, politicians have been willing to provide during Covid-19, be that for households or selected industries, such as coal. Meanwhile, the late 20th-century mantra of shareholder capitalism is on the retreat in the US and European business worlds. That appalls fans of Milton Friedman, the economist who laid out this shareholder mantra 50 years ago. However, Friedman's acolytes should remember this: shareholder-first ideas were developed in the 1970s, when it was assumed that businesses could rely on the US government to solve societal problems, because the latter seemed competent. This is no longer the case. Innovation is also contentious. The 2008 crisis made unfettered creativity in finance seem dangerous. This decade has demonstrated the dark side of digital innovation: the internet is eroding privacy, social media is undermining democracy and a winner-take-all digital economy is exacerbating income inequality. Investors should brace for more techlash (which matters, given that Big Tech and communications accounts for 45 per cent of the S&P 500). now: headlines Then there is the fourth issue that dominates democracy. Thankfully, a Gallup poll suggests around two-thirds of Americans trust the judiciary, a level broadly unchanged in the last decade. But current events might yet undermine that. And even before the election sparked allegations of voter fraud, disenfranchisement and power grabs, only a third of voters told Gallup they trust the legislative branch sharply down.  "

Protests help activists recover from funding crunch

Extinction Rebellion. Legislative demands Coronavirus forced climate group into 'hibernation' while donations dried up
LESLIE HOOK AND ANNA GROSS

Extinction Rebellion, the climate protest movement that brought London to its knees a year ago, is calling on the government to consider new climate legislation, as it wraps up its first public demonstrations since lockdown.

The climate group, known as ""XR"", has emerged from its Covid-19 ""hibernation"" with 10 days of protests around the UK, including blockading several printing presses and repeated demonstrations outside parliament. However, the much smaller size of the protests this year also reflects a movement that is trying to find its feet again after the impact of the pandemic, the racial justice movement, financial difficulties and leadership conflicts. Gathering in Parliament Square, protesters chanted, cheered, heard speeches and ate vegan pasta from the back of a bicycle cart. But the crowd was just a fraction of what it was last year and flanked by a heavy police presence.

""There's certainly been a contraction in numbers,"" said Gail Bradbrook, one of the co-founders of the movement, speaking by phone ahead of the event.

Christine Glossop, a protester from Cardiff, said she was demonstrating because ""the government are doing nothing"".

She held a small sign that read ""Extinction Rebellion: Breaking the law in a very limited and specific way"", a reference to the government's statement on the Brexit withdrawal agreement. ""We are in a climate catastrophe,"" she said. ""We need to take drastic action.""

Ms Bradbrook said that despite the smaller numbers, XR's ""September Rebellion"" had been a great success. Shutting down the printing presses, a move criticised by government officials including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was ""an escalation tactic that had the impact one would predict"", she said.

Two weekends ago XR protesters blockaded three News Corp printing sites, impacting publication of physical newspapers including The Sun, The Times, the Daily Mail, and the Evening Standard. Some Financial Times sections were also affected ""We've tickled the nose of the tiger, the establishment are frothing at the mouth,"" she said.

After gaining prominence in 2019, XR gathered support from celebrities and society figures but had to pause its activities when coronavirus struck.

Last year the movement helped propel the UK to adopt a net zero emissions target for 2050. XR's demands also spurred six parliamentary select committees to form the UK's first citizens' climate assembly, which last week delivered its non-binding recommendations. But the group ran out of funding around the time that lockdown began in March, and donations dried up.

In April, XR had to stop paying about 150 members who had been receiving stipends of up to ¬£400 a week in ""volunteer living expenses"", according to finance team member Andrew Medhurst. ""We kind of went into hibernation.

It was a period of reflection,"" said Mr Medhurst. ""As we moved into February it was clear we were living beyond our means ‚Ä¶ This cash crisis meant that we had to tighten our belts.""

The protests in the past two weeks had been run ""on a shoestring budget"" compared with last year, he said.

Donations have started pouring in again since XR returned to the streets, with more than ¬£240,000 raised through a crowdfunding drive in the summer.

""When politicians are saying they are going to stop XR, that is a threat but it is also an opportunity, especially from a fundraising perspective,"" Mr Medhurst said, referring to reports that the government was looking to reclassify XR as an organised crime group.

""I think this week will definitely have buoyed the spirits of many rebels,"" said Farhana Yamin, an active XR member who led its political strategy team until last summer. ""I feel like, yeah, XR are back and that is a good thing, and I hope there is more funding that comes through. It is a very tough environment to get funding now.""

XR UK is asking the government to cut carbon emissions close to zero by 2025; to acknowledge the devastation of climate change; and to uphold recommendations of the citizens' assembly on climate action. It is also urging parliament to consider a new private member's bill, the climate and ecological emergency bill.

At the same time as dealing with the financial disruptions of Covid-19, the group has also been thrown off balance by the racial justice movement and Black Lives Matter protests.

XR UK, whose members are mostly white, has been debating whether to add a demand about justice ‚Äî including racial justice ‚Äî to its key demands. It has not done so, despite a poll showing twothirds of members would support this.

Tensions spilled into the open on Thursday in Parliament Square, when a man spray painted the Winston Churchill statue with the words ""is a racist"". He was taken away by police. A spokesman said it was ""not an XR action"".

The splintering of XR's top leadership and its decentralised, ""holacratic"" governance style have also been problematic, several leaders told the FT.

""One of the tensions in XR are people who want to slow down and be strategic and then people who think it's an emergency, let's get out on the street now,"" said Ms Bradbrook. ""There have been conflicts and disagreements."" "
FT-2020-7.txt," Wednesday, November 4, 2020 ‚Ä¢ 12:00Z Financial Times (web site) ‚Ä¢ 1738 words US election: What it means for climate change and ESG 

Gillian Tett, Billy Nauman, Patrick Temple-West, Alex Newman and Oliver Telling 


Welcome to Moral Money. US election's impact on climate and ESG Today we have: EU looks to expand green taxonomy Trump admin guts anti-ESG pension rule UK companies' dilemma over dividends Climate and ESG on the ballot We may not know who won the US election yet, but we do have a good idea of what either outcome would mean for US climate policy and ESG investing. Here's what we know. If Donald Trump stays in office, it would be terrible news for climate change. As Martin Wolf wrote: ""The coming decades will determine whether the threat of damaging and irreversible change is averted, or not. Without active US engagement, success seems inconceivable."" Under a second Trump term, it is safe to assume the US will not engage at a federal level. That's very bad. But (at risk of sounding Pollyanna-ish), things could be worse. deteriorating status as a global hegemony. Europe has remained committed to decarbonisation through the pandemic. And as we have seen in recent weeks, China, Japan and South Korea have set their own net zero pledges. Sceptics have questioned the seriousness of these plans, but the direction of travel is clear. By dropping out of Paris, Mr Trump did not inspire other countries to shirk their climate responsibility but instead made Europe the de facto standard setter. There is still the problem of the US itself. It is the world's second-largest emitter and must transition away from fossil fuels. The rest of the world could try to push the US to clean up, but it is hard to see that having much effect. States such as California are taking steps to curb carbon that will have ramifications extending far beyond their borders (such as banning the sale of new fossil fuel powered cars). And Mr Trump's failed attempt to resurrect the US coal industry shows that there are limits to what he can do. But his deregulatory agenda, which has been calamitous for the environment, will probably only speed up under a second term. A Trump win would also likely impede bipartisan market-based climate plans such as a carbon tax (or dividend). For starters it is clear that Mr Trump's decision to back out of the Paris accord only served to further undercut the US's Under Joe Biden , it would be a different story. He has promised to rejoin Paris immediately and enact a sweeping climate plan that would earmark $2tn for new clean energy projects. He has also threatened to impose a federal drilling ban that would significantly curtail US oil production. National (or global) carbon pricing would also be on the table. But it is unclear how his administration would follow through on his campaign rhetoric or the degree to which Mr Biden would rely on market incentives or regulation to fight climate change. The Democrats also must win the Senate (which looks unlikely) if he is going to get anything done. As it stands now, the oil industry is not overly worried. A Biden win might make it ""conceivable"" that the world can avoid irreversible climate damage as Martin Wolf put it but it is no guarantee. A Biden presidency also would auger well for the sustainable investing industry. It is possible that a Democratic administration would set up some regulatory standards on environmental, social and governance disclosures similar to the EU's non-financial reporting directive and green taxonomy. This would be welcome for investors and companies. Regulation is a ""missing piece"" of the ESG puzzle right now, said Vikram Gandhi , professor at Harvard Business School. But even without regulatory oversight, US investors are already pushing for better, more standardised, so-called ""non-financial"" information disclosure and there's no reason to think that will stop. No matter what happens in the election it is unlikely that the growth of ESG would slow down. Despite hostility toward responsible investing in the Trump administration, it has done little to stop its expansion ( see Patrick TempleWest's piece below for more ). investing at ""I think people are starting to realise that ESG is simply the new quality factor,"" said Martin Jarzebowski , director of investment responsible manager Federated Hermes. ""When you're evaluating any of these different companies, and you're focused on what's relevant and what's financially material, it's just a natural extension of the primary research that any good active fundamental investors should be doing."" ( Billy Nauman ) UK companies' dilemma dividend payment Here's a moral conundrum for C-suites in the era of Covid-19: should companies that used furlough support schemes refund taxpayers before restarting dividends? Some believe they should. This week, London-listed kitchen supplier Howden Joinery committed to repay the ¬£22m it received from the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Shareholder pay will only be considered once the company has caught up on its local tax bills and deferred pension contributions. Howden Joinery joins a growing list of blue-chips including house-builder Taylor Wimpey , engineer Weir Group and bookmaker William Hill , whose improving fortunes have prompted them to return emergency funds taken during the pandemic's first wave. Others have taken a different tack. A review of public documents and comments by FT sister title Investors Chronicle found at least 10 FTSE 350 companies that accessed furlough support schemes during the pandemic have since declared ¬£877m or more in dividends despite keeping (or only partially repaying) the wage subsidies' economic benefit. Advertiser WPP , listed private equity firm 3i and building materials company CRH are among the dividend-paying multinationals that have not paid back all furlough support claimed by their businesses subsidiaries. or wholly-owned In doing so, the companies have not broken any conditions attached to the wage subsidies, though the UK government has now said it expects large employers to renounce dividend payments when using its new job support scheme. That highlights the challenge for businesses eager to take all available state help amid a second round of lockdowns all while keeping civil society and long-term dividend investors onside. ( Alex Newman and Oliver Telling ) An EU rainbow taxonomy? Europe's green taxonomy might soon embrace more colours, given the hints emerging from European Commission officials. On Tuesday Marcel Haag , head of the commission's directorate for growth, jobs and investment, told the Financial Times that social factors would soon be incorporated into environmental reporting. ""The success of the climate transition depends on our ability to make this a just transition,"" he told the FT's Investing for Good summit in Europe. ""ESG is not limited to environmental issues. We created it starting out focusing on green economy and environmental objectives, but now is the time to look into the social dimension."" Mr Haag added that the commission has asked its 50 stakeholders to play a role in factoring ""social aspects into our taxonomy"". This shift might make some critics wince, given how hard it is to define let alone measure social factors compared with, say, carbon emissions. But ever since the gilets jaunes protests in France against fossil fuel tax hikes, European politicians have been worrying about how to balance issues of equity and social inclusion with environmental reform. The Covid-19 recession is intensifying this. Expect to hear a lot more about this winter; whether or not it sparks a multicoloured taxonomy. ( Gillian Tett ) transition"" ""just Trump's ESG rule: More bark than bite Asset managers scored a win at the US labor department on Friday over a regulation aimed at limiting the scope of ESG investing in private pension plans. The final version of the widely criticised rule removed ESG language specifically, and broadly requires pension advisers to select investments based on financial factors something they are largely required to do already. With the final rule, the labor department (headed by Eugene Scalia , pictured above ) opted ""to no longer focus on ESG funds at all,"" said Joshua Lichtenstein , a partner at Ropes & Gray. Another lawyer following the rule put it more bluntly: the labor department ""gutted its own rule"". Still, the rule has a chilling effect and will discourage companies from adding ESG funds to their retirement savings plans. Only a tiny number of US compa Smart reads that China's announcement it will be carbon neutral by 2060 is one of the most important climate stories of the year, but a closer look at the country's coal ""addiction"" raises questions about how it will actually achieve its goal and whether its government can be trusted as a climate leader.

We can avert irreversible climate change 
 Martin Wolf

 Economics Action is both essential and affordable ‚Äî but it demands the co-operation of leaders around the world  A renewed presidency for Donald Trump is likely to be nowhere more consequential than for climate change. The coming decades will determine whether the threat of damaging and irreversible change is averted, or not. Without active US engagement, success seems inconceivable. Even with it, it would be unlikely. But, crucially, it would be conceivable. We know what to do and we know, too, that it is affordable. What is unaffordable is not to do what we need to do. But will we? That is the question.  It is indicative of the shift in the perspective of the global policy establishment that a chapter of the IMF's October World Economic Outlook focuses on ""mitigating climate change"" ‚Äî that is, preventing it ‚Äî via ""growth-and-distribution-friendly strategies"". In brief, the IMF insists that humanity can have its cake and eat it: both higher incomes and a safe climate.  As a result of rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, global average temperatures are already about 1C above pre-industrial levels. On present trends, this could reach around 1.5C in a decade and 2C half a decade later. At that point, warn climate scientists, dangerous and irreversible tipping points in the climate are likely to be passed. Most governments do at least  pretend to agree. Thus, in the Paris accords of December 2015, they committed themselves to keeping temperatures below these levels, even if their promises fell short of what was needed to achieve this. (See charts.) As the IMF notes: ""Sizeable and rapid reductions in carbon emissions are needed for this goal to be met; specifically, net carbon emissions need to decline to zero by mid-century."" If this is to happen, emissions need to fall sharply this decade and keep on falling thereafter. That would represent a huge turnround from previous trends.  What sort of programme might deliver this outcome? The answer, suggests the fund, is a combination of frontloaded green investments, aggressive funding of research and development, and a credible long-term commitment to rising carbon prices. This is in line with other studies, notably Making Mission Possible: Delivering a Net-Zero Economy, a September 2020 report from the global Energy Transitions Commission. The latter also emphasises complementary regulation, to accelerate changes in behaviour. Compensation of poorer losers against the higher fuel prices will be needed as well.  Is a move towards zero net emissions by 2050 affordable? The answer is: surprisingly so, particularly given the economically depressed post-Covid starting   point. The IMF estimates that achieving this aim might lower world output by 1 per cent, relative to its ""baseline"" under unchanged policies, once one adds in the benefits of damages avoided. Even so, this must be put in the context of expected cumulative global growth of 120 per cent over the next 30 years. It also ignores the benefits of far lower local pollution.  Some estimates suggest that temperature increases of as much as 5C by 2100, in the absence of mitigation, might lower global output by 25 per cent. This does not take account of the massive non-economic disruptions to humanity, indeed all life, to be expected from such an unprecedentedly rapid upheaval in the climate.  Given these estimates of the modest short-term cost of mitigation against the far greater long-term costs of failure to do so, the argument for action is overwhelming. It becomes more so when one allows for the scale of the uncertainty created by unmitigated climate change, as well as its irreversibility.  Taking action might make sense even if the costs were many times as large as now expected. So why is it not happening? One explanation is that it involves changes in lifestyles, which we dislike. Another is that it requires thinking in decades, which is unnatural. But the most important explanation is that it requires long-term co-operation, which we usually find impossible.  Co-operation among five players ‚Äî China, the US, the EU, India and Japan ‚Äî would deliver a huge part of what is needed. Unfortunately, this hardly looks likely right now. A shift in the US presidency towards someone sane would be a  big help. Without that, sanctions against the US might be necessary. But a more aggressive shift by China than planned will also be essential.  If needed policy shifts are to happen soon enough, it will take statesmanship of a high order indeed. Domestically, programmes must compensate the most vulnerable losers, which is a good reason for using a carbon tax. Internationally, leaders must co-operate far more effectively than they did even on the Paris accord. If they are to do what is needed, leaders must overcome two other obstacles to wise action: the fossil-fuels-forever resisters; and the ecological fanatics, who argue in favour of a revolutionary overthrow of capitalism and the end of growth ‚Äî by tomorrow, please.  The only realistic hope is technocratic problem-solving and co-operative policies. These must be guided by moral purpose, but not infused by fantasies of revolutionary transformations. Cries of ""repent, for the end of the world is nigh"" will not solve this emergency. Humanity is at its best when it uses its head. Climate is at bottom a crisis of technology and behaviour; it can be tackled only by changing incentives throughout the system.  As I have argued before, this is now extremely urgent. If we want to prevent a dangerous shift in the planet's climate, we need to act far more decisively than hitherto. We are drinking fossil fuels in the earth's last-chance saloon. The time has come for humanity to sober up.  Is a move towards zero net emissions by 2050 possible cost-wise? The answer is: surprisingly so particularly given the economically depressed post-Covid starting point. The IMF estimates that achieving this aim might lower world output by 1 per cent, relative to its ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù under unchanged policies, once one adds in the benefits of damages avoided.

On a mission to save the climate with legal knowhow

Camilla Hodgson

When the dotcom bubble burst 20 years ago, Susan Mac Cormac, a corporate lawyer at US law Ô¨Årm Morrison
& Foerster, was asked by her mentor to devise a plan to generate new business.

Mac Cormac, who had recently made partner at the tech-focused Ô¨Årm, pitched an idea inspired by people
she had met through her husband, who worked at San Francisco's Presidio national park.

""My plan was helping companies become more environmental. And [my mentor] looked at me and said 'I
don't see any money in that',"" says Mac Cormac. But she made a convincing case that the effects of climate
change would ""fundamentally impact business"", and was soon pursuing the idea.

Early efforts were pro bono projects for non-proÔ¨Åt organisations. But the number of paying clients gradually
picked   up,   and   Mac   Cormac   has   built   a   career   around   helping   investors   make   greener   decisions   and
integrating sustainability into corporate deals. She chairs two practices: energy, and social enterprise and
impact investing.

Until recently, however, ""most people viewed my focus on climate and sustainability as 'good stuff that I did
on the side', not 'real' corporate law work,"" she says, speaking from her home in San Francisco. ""Now, almost
all mainstream companies want to focus on it.""

There have never been so many opportunities to work at the intersection of climate and the law. As well as
the growing number of lawsuits aiming to hold governments and companies to account for environmental
damage,   lawyers   can   play   key   roles   in   designing   innovative   funding   models   for   green   projects,   adding
climate-related conditions to deals, and helping companies develop sustainability policies.

At the same time, law Ô¨Årms and legal teams - and professional services groups, generally - face growing
scrutiny from activists, potential clients and employees about their own climate-related responsibilities. With
banks and asset managers under pressure to divest from the fossil fuel industry, law Ô¨Årms will increasingly
have to consider the work they take on.

A growing cohort of lawyers is ""deeply uncomfortable with the profession's role in facilitating the expansion
of   the   fossil   fuel   industry,""   says   Brynn   O'Brien,   a   former   corporate   and   human   rights   lawyer,   and   now
executive   director   of   shareholder   advocacy   group   the   Australasian   Centre   for   Corporate   Responsibility
(ACCR), based in Australia. Law Ô¨Årms that are not prepared to grapple with the issue risk losing ""the best and
brightest junior lawyers"".

Litigation is the most visible legal avenue for tackling climate-related problems. In 2019, the Dutch Supreme
Court upheld a landmark ruling that the government of the Netherlands had a legal duty to prevent climate
change, and ordered it to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. Similar cases Ô¨Åled against other governments
followed, and a growing number are being brought against businesses for their role in adversely affecting
climate.

Kristin   Casper,   interim   general   counsel   and   senior   legal   counsel   for   strategic   litigation   at   Greenpeace
International, says it is only a matter of time before a company is successfully sued for its role in contributing
to climate change.

""There will be one soon,"" says Casper, who is based in Boulder, Colorado. She started out as an environmental
activist before going to law school to gain another ""tool"" for bringing about change. ""In 2021, we're going to
see the targets of this litigation expand beyond fossil fuel companies"".

There are also wide ranging opportunities in corporate law, as Mac Cormac's career shows. She focuses on
late-stage Ô¨Ånancing and helps facilitate ""impact investing"" - which aims to do good alongside generating
returns   -   and   she   says   she   has   developed   creative   ways   to   channel   investor   money   to   climate-friendly
projects.


One examples is designing housing investment funds that include philanthropic capital, to facilitate the
construction of low-income, energy efÔ¨Åcient homes. Another is helping The Nature Conservancy, a non-
proÔ¨Åt organisation, create ""pop-up wetlands"" by paying farmers to Ô¨Çood their Ô¨Åelds, off-season, in California's
Central Valley.


Mac Cormac has also advised clients on changing their corporate structure to enable them to balance
Ô¨Åduciary duties against a social or environmental purpose. Recently, she has developed and adapted that
work to help small businesses access funding after the Covid-19 pandemic Ô¨Årst hit in 2020. Morrison &
Foerster has dedicated more than $1m in pro bono work to the California Rebuilding Fund.

Shareholders can also use corporate law to push for change. O'Brien started out as a commercial lawyer at
Mallesons Stephen Jaques, which gave her an understanding of ""the system and the language [of corporate
law],"" and how it could be used to hold companies accountable.

Her work at the ACCR has included using shareholder resolutions to press companies to break ties with
lobby groups, such as the New South Wales Minerals Council, that many argue stand in the way of climate
progress.

But when it comes to law Ô¨Årms' own actions on tackling climate risk, who they should work with is not a
straightforward question.

Lawyers' 'stewardship role'

Mac   Cormac   says   lawyers   should   help   companies   transition   to   cleaner   business   models,   but   must   be
transparent and selective about the work they accept. They should not, for example, help companies avoid
making climate disclosures.

Greenpeace's Casper says everyone is entitled to legal representation, but law Ô¨Årms should advise clients ""to
do the right thing"" for the environment - which would help them avoid future climate-related litigation.

O'Brien adds that lawyers, like institutional investors, have ""an important stewardship role"". Law Ô¨Årms should
outline clear rules about what they are prepared to do for heavy polluters, and how climate objectives can be
incorporated into their operations, she argues.

""Were I a law Ô¨Årm managing partner, I would absolutely be looking to differentiate myself in that way . . . I
hope that some young lawyers read this and think, 'I can have this conversation with my managing partner.'""

Germany urges new outreach to Moscow on climate
change

Michael Peel in Brussels

Germany has called for greater co-operation with Russia on climate change in a contentious new effort to
restore frayed EU ties with Moscow.

The European bloc should develop a ""concrete and detailed strategy"" on global warming as part of a broader
attempt to ""selectively engage"" the Kremlin, according to a document drawn up by Berlin ahead of EU
leaders' talks on Russia this month.

The German proposal highlights deepening EU internal divisions over how to handle Russia. The detention of
poisoned opposition activist Alexei Navalny has put further strain on a relationship hobbled since Moscow
annexed Crimea in 2014 and the European bloc retaliated with economic sanctions.

While some EU capitals including Paris have favoured engaging with Moscow, a growing group of member
states including the Baltic countries and Poland see it as unrealistic and unwise in the face of the Kremlin's
behaviour.

""While a fundamental change in Russia's foreign policy appears unrealistic in the short term, managing our
challenging relationship with Russia must remain a key foreign policy priority of the European Union,"" states
the new German document, which has been seen by the Financial Times. ""At the same time, the EU has to
forcefully seize opportunities to push Russia towards taking more responsibility for global goods such as
security, conÔ¨Çict resolution, climate, environment, health, trade or migration.""

The German proposal is an unsigned and undated ""non-paper"", which EU countries use to air ideas without
having to take formal responsibility for them. A German ofÔ¨Åcial said the government did not comment on
alleged leaks as a matter of principle.

The document accuses Russia of violations of international law, a clampdown on civil society, and campaigns
to inÔ¨Çuence neighbouring states and use propaganda and cyber attacks to ""divide Europeans"".

But it also notes that Russia has an ""indispensable"", if ""often difÔ¨Åcult"", role in various global policy Ô¨Åelds,
meaning   the   EU   had   a   ""vital   interest""   in   stable   and   predictable   relations.   Scope   exists   for   possible
engagement with Moscow on conÔ¨Çicts in the Middle East and north Africa, global environmental and health
problems,   and   economic   themes   such   as   digitalisation,   hydrogen   power   and   the   Russian-led   Eurasian
Economic Union alliance, the document states.

The EU should seek, in particular, to ""develop structured, concrete and detailed strategy on how to engage
Russia in multilateral efforts to Ô¨Åght climate change"", according to the Ô¨Årst of three points for immediate
action proposed by the document. The other two are to start high-level EU-US consultations on Russia and
to set up a Russia civil society fund to Ô¨Ånance projects involving non-governmental groups in the country,
the EU and the six nations in the European bloc's ""Eastern Partnership"" initiative - Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Moldova.

""While so far not a policy priority for Russia, environmental disasters and climate change effects felt in its
territory become increasingly relevant for Russia's population and thus for the government,"" the document
states, adding that the European bloc should approach Moscow ""at a time of our own choosing"".

The hopes for greater co-operation contrast with the EU's imposition of new sanctions on Russia last week
over the Navalny case and an ofÔ¨Åcial crackdown on street protests against his treatment. The Kremlin also
triggered an outcry in Brussels and some European capitals last month over its expulsion of three European
diplomats and its aggressive posture during a trip to Moscow by Josep Borrell, EU foreign policy chief.

Critics of Berlin say its policy towards Moscow is compromised by its participation in the almost-complete
Nord Stream 2 project to pipe gas from Russia to Germany.





The German document carries echoes of a controversial 2019 proposal by Markus Ederer, EU ambassador to
Moscow, for ""enhanced co-ordination"" with Russia in areas from 5G mobile communication to personal data
protection to combat China's growing inÔ¨Çuence in Eurasia.

Keep fossil fuel shares, minister tells pension funds
Climate change

Josephine Cumbo

Pension funds should not dump holdings of fossil fuel companies despite the growing pressure on asset
managers to divest ""planet-wrecking"" stocks, a government minister has said.

Guy Opperman, pensions minister, said the funds managing the retirement savings of millions of investors
would impede broader efforts to tackle climate change if they ofÔ¨Çoaded shares in companies with high
carbon footprints, such as oil and gas suppliers.

""I massively believe that it is perfectly appropriate for trustees to hold stocks in the likes of Shell or BP; I do
not want them to divest,"" Opperman said in an interview with the Financial Times.

""What we want is a partnership between trustees, asset managers, and the companies as these companies
transform themselves into clean energy companies and Ô¨Ånd the solutions that we all need for net zero.""

A number of ethical investment products, marketed as ""fossil fuel free"", have launched in the UK, often
holding technology and Ô¨Ånancial stocks rather than those of fossil fuel companies.

""Merely selling your stocks that make you look bad from a fossil fuels standpoint is a reverse greenwashing
because it doesn't actually Ô¨Åx the problem,"" said Opperman.

The minister's comments come as pressure grows on some of the UK's largest public sector pension funds to
drop ""planet-wrecking"" stocks.

Analysis released this week by campaign groups Platform and Friends of the Earth found that British town
hall pension plans held ¬£9.7bn of investments in fossil fuel companies in the 2019-20 Ô¨Ånancial year.

""If the government is serious about showing leadership on climate ahead of COP26 [the UN climate change
conference in November], it needs to stop fooling itself that continuing to invest in fossil fuel companies
offers any solution to the climate crisis,"" said Rianna Gargiulo, divestment campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
""All this talk of engaging with fossil fuel companies to help them change for the better ignores the vast sums
of money they pump into political lobbying and further extraction, and their stated commitment to burning
all of their reserves.""

Some private sector retirement schemes have outlined plans to rid their portfolios of the most harmful fossil
fuel holdings. Scottish Widows, which has ¬£170bn of funds under management, said in November it would
divest at least ¬£440m from companies that had failed to meet its ethical investing test, including those that
derive more than 10 per cent of revenue from thermal coal and tar sands.

""Scottish Widows strives to engage with and inÔ¨Çuence companies it invests in to drive positive change,"" the
company said. ""Its exclusions focus on companies it believes pose the most severe investment risk due to the
nature of their businesses.""

ShareAction,   the   campaign   group,   said   it   ""largely""   supported   Opperman's   approach   but   said   pension
schemes should not fear dumping stocks.

""A credible escalation strategy has to include the possibility of divestment when all else fails,"" said Catherine
Howarth, its chief executive.

Watchdog asked to probe potential conÔ¨Çict of interest
Climate advisory committee

CAMILLA HODGSON

The environment adviser to former prime minister Theresa May has asked the government watchdog to
examine a potential conÔ¨Çict of interest involving the head of climate change at power group Drax, who is also
a member of the climate advisory committee.

Lord Randall has asked the National Audit OfÔ¨Åce to consider a formal investigation into the positions held by
Rebecca Heaton, the Drax executive who is also a member of the Climate Change Committee that advises
the government.

Heaton has been on the committee since 2017, when her appointment drew criticism from climate activists.
The issue has been raised by Randall as Drax attempts to realign its business to focus on an emerging
technology, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs).

The CCC has identiÔ¨Åed the technology as a potential solution for managing the most difÔ¨Åcult aspects of
avoiding carbon emissions. Drax has said its development will require government Ô¨Ånancial support.

""Given the signiÔ¨Åcant commercial interests of her employer, Drax, in the policies on which these committees
are advising government, I believe that there may be a real or perceived conÔ¨Çict between her role with Drax
and her ability to offer impartial expert advice on such policies,"" Randall wrote in a letter to the NAO.

Heaton is also a member of the CCC's audit committee, which advises the group on its own governance.

Randall said the NAO should examine whether Heaton's roles allowed Drax to gain ""an unfair commercial
advantage through the inÔ¨Çuence its employee may be having on the advice and formulation of policy in an
area in which Drax operates"".

Drax is one of the world's largest producers of biomass, material including wood pellets and other plant
matter, which is burnt to generate energy. Its biomass operations are reliant on UK government subsidies
due to end in 2027.

The company is working to reduce costs so that these operations remain viable, and also betting on the
Beccs technology, which involves capturing and storing the carbon emissions generated by burning the
biomass.

Deploying Beccs at scale will require an ""investment framework"" from the government, Drax states on its
website.

The government has pledged up to ¬£1bn to support the development of a carbon capture sector, which
could include new Beccs subsidies.

Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, said Heaton was ""excluded from all relevant discussions on bioenergy
and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage"" in its deliberation for the sixth carbon budget.

Drax said: ""Dr Rebecca Heaton does not advise the CCC on bioenergy. This ensures there is no conÔ¨Çict of
interest.""

Public information campaigns can help Ô¨Åght the climate
crisis
Letters

The subtitle to Pilita Clark's excellent article (""Climate warriors"", Books Essay, FT Weekend, February 27)
claims ""global warming has made environmentalists of us all"" and ""debate still rages over what is the best
solution"". The Ô¨Årst is true only until we have to pay more, as evidenced by the UK fuel duty, frozen since 2011.
On the second, there is near-unanimity ‚Äî excepting Jonathan Franzen's presumption of failure ‚Äî that the
goal   is   net-zero   emissions,   and   that   piecemeal   policies   or   individual   do-gooding   are   no   substitute   for
effective,   broad   collective   action   such   as   carbon   pricing.   No   serious   expert   would   disagree   with   the
usefulness of a rising carbon price. Yet policies for next year, rather than the next decade, are timid and
inadequate, for fear of tabloid campaigns or gilets jaunes.

As Clark states, ""more political will"" is needed, and in a democracy this in turn needs the space created by
more   public   acceptance   of   the   necessary   measures.   But   as   fuel   duty   shows,   our   ""environmentalism""   is
currently disconnected from an understanding of what is needed to realise it.

This apparent impasse is Ô¨Åxable, and government has the means to Ô¨Åx it.

Governments have spent liberally informing us about the dangers of Covid-19 or Aids. Why should they not
do   so   for   the   vastly   greater   threat   of   climate change?   All   preconditions   are   given:   a   real   danger;   the
government in possession of better information than most of the population; and a debate which, left to
itself, is regularly distorted by vested interests.

While   no   cure-all,   a   concerted   communication/engagement   campaign   can   only   increase   public
understanding and acceptance of meaningful policies, and hence create more political space. Ministers'
current inaction is costing us dearly, by preventing more effective and cost-effective climate policies. James
Denman Berlin, Germany

Bank of England's climate mandate has global resonance

Gillian Tett, Billy Nauman, Patrick Temple-West and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson

With the days growing longer, the brutal winter temperatures starting to abate and vaccination rates ticking
upwards, change is in the air here in New York. For the Ô¨Årst time in a while it is becoming easier to feel more
optimistic about the future.

There is also cause for hope for sustainable investing advocates. After years of sidestepping the issue, the US
Securities   and   Exchange   Commission   is   charging   ahead   with   a   plan   to   put   environmental,   social   and
governance (ESG) disclosures under the microscope. And in the UK, the new Budget laid some important
groundwork to help Boris Johnson turn the City of London into a hub of green Ô¨Ånance. Read on for more.
(Billy Nauman)

Green bond news in Sunak's red box

Boris Johnson has been keen to paint the UK as a sustainable Ô¨Ånance leader as the UK prime minister looks
to set an example before hosting November's COP26 climate summit. He also needs to convince the world
that the City of London can remain a major Ô¨Ånancial hub post-Brexit.

This week's Budget saw the UK double down on that ambition, with two big green announcements in
chancellor Rishi Sunak 's red box.

First, the Bank of England's mandate is being updated to include the Ô¨Åght against climate change, which
means it will start buying green bonds and purging its books of bonds that fund big polluters.

And second, the UK plans to issue ¬£15bn of green bonds this year.

Climate activists were unimpressed, criticising the plans for a lack of speciÔ¨Åcity and urgency. Their scepticism
is warranted: full details of the green bond offering are not expected until June, and the Bank plans to
change its approach to corporate bond buying ""before its next scheduled round of investments, in the fourth
quarter of the year"".

In any case, the UK has been rather slow to join the green bond market, reports the FT's Joshua Oliver .
""Poland issued the Ô¨Årst such bond in 2016, while France made its debut in 2017."" Germany launched‚Ç¨11.5bn
worth of green Bunds last year.

However, it is still worth noting the importance of the UK's plan. The ¬£12bn to be raised through the green
gilt offering may not meet activists' expectations, but it will help fund the 10-point climate plan Johnson set
out last year.

And it is impossible to ignore the symbolic signiÔ¨Åcance of the BoE becoming the Ô¨Årst major central bank to
make climate change an ofÔ¨Åcial part of its mission.

This move builds on the climate work done by former BoE governor Mark Carney and could serve as a model
for other central bank members of the Network for Greening the Financial System.

Karen Ward , JPMorgan Asset Management's chief market strategist, told the FT that investors ""should not
underestimate"" the reform's potential impact on sustainable investing.

""This could tilt the preference of the central bank's asset purchases and involve considerable regulatory
change to encourage private capital to do likewise,"" she said. (Billy Nauman)

US watchdog seeks greenwashing whistleblowers

The   US   Securities   and   Exchange   Commission   has   created   an   enforcement   unit   to   hunt   for   possible
misconduct in companies' climate risk and ESG disclosures - an unprecedented move that suggests there
might be abuses that have gone unaddressed.



The unit will focus on misstatements or vagueness in companies' climate change risk disclosures under

 existing rules, the agency said on Thursday. The agency will also be investigating investment advisers and
funds'   ESG   strategies,   and   encouraging   tipsters   to   bring   information   about   potential   climate   or   ESG
misconduct to its whistleblower ofÔ¨Åce.


ESG became an SEC examination issue for investment advisers for the Ô¨Årst time last year. But now, with a
dedicated enforcement task force, ""it shows the regulator means business"", Doug Davison , a partner at
Linklaters, told Moral Money.

Although   a   ""message""   is   all   bark   and   no   bite,   companies   must   take   the   SEC's   action   seriously.   Lazy
disclosures can no longer be tolerated. (Remember Billy Nauman 's 2019 article about Vanguard's ""green""
funds?).

""It is particularly interesting that the SEC's alert is calling out reviewing proxy voting policies and records as
well here,"" said George Raine , a partner at Ropes & Gray. ""Asset managers with ESG-oriented products will
want to review their advertising and other documentation.""

The announcement also brings the US into line with Europe. Esma in February 2020 announced a new
strategy to combat greenwashing. Moral Money will keep hunting for greenwashing and developments from
the SEC's new task force. Watch this space. ( Patrick Temple-West )

FedEx looks to Yale to help deliver net-zero package

As we wrote recently, there are reasons to look warily on many companies' pledges to cut their emissions to
""net zero"" by some distant date, and few such announcements stand out from the crowd at this point. But
one of them is FedEx, which this week not only set a 2040 goal for making its operations carbon-neutral but
detailed $2bn of planned investments to hit it.

Most interestingly, $100m of that sum will go to fund a new ""centre for natural carbon capture"" at Yale
University. It is a revealing reminder that, for many companies, the scientiÔ¨Åc advances required to reach their
net-zero aspirations simply haven't been developed yet.

FedEx's 200,000 delivery trucks are not the problem, chief executive Fred Smith tells Moral Money: falling
battery costs and initiatives such as its recent partnership with GM have put it on track to convert that Ô¨Çeet
to electric vehicles by 2040 while yielding a return on its investment.

The problem is that FedEx also operates the world's largest cargo airline, and sustainable aviation fuels still
cost 5-7 times what jet fuel does, making them ""absolutely non economic"", he said. The airline could have
offset its emissions, but Smith likened the buying of carbon credits to the trade in papal indulgences. ""A lot of
these offsets and carbon credits have been one step from being a sham.""

So FedEx concluded (despite some NGOs' scepticism about carbon sequestration) that sequestration was its
best hope of cutting its net emissions and Smith, a Yale alumnus, knew the university had a strong record in
environmental areas including carbon pricing.

Ingrid Burke , dean of the Yale School of the Environment, tells Moral Money the funding will accelerate
research into questions including how to make forests grow faster and how to store CO2 in carbonate rocks
or turn it into building materials and fuels.

Yale president Peter Salovey says such corporate funding is essential because federal funds for such ""high
risk, high reward"" research have become ""very, very hard to get"". He expects to see more such partnerships in
the coming years.

As for FedEx, Smith points out that it hopes the investment will pay for itself by cutting its fossil-fuel bill
substantially. ""This is not from a FedEx standpoint a virtuous signal,"" he notes. (Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson
and Gillian Tett)

Antimicrobial resistance emerges as ESG concern

In December, the FT hosted a discussion on antimicrobial resistance, noting that while there have been
advances in combating the problem, urgent action is needed to develop new drugs. It is troubling, if not
surprising, that coronavirus has diverted attention from this crisis.

Big investors started raising concerns late last year and are pressuring companies to make changes.



On Wednesday, Yum! Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and other fast-food chains, agreed to

 



publish a report on the systemic effects of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in its supply chain by the end of
the year. Yum is the Ô¨Årst company to disclose this information, said the Shareholder Commons, a US non-
proÔ¨Åt that Ô¨Åles shareholder resolutions. The organisation withdrew a petition at Yum as a result of the
company's announcement.


The   agreement   requires   that   Yum   disclose   its   Ô¨Åndings   about   how   antibiotic   use   in   animal   husbandry
threatens global health and shareholder interests. The report should also discuss optimal scenarios for the
food   industry   to   eliminate   or   internalise   antimicrobial   costs   and   describe   how   lobbying   and   political
expenditures affect the realisation of those scenarios.

Yum ""recognises the need to limit the use of antimicrobials in order to preserve their efÔ¨Åcacy"", said Rick
Alexander , chief executive of the Shareholder Commons. Now he hopes to convince McDonald's to consider
a similar pledge. ( Patrick Temple-West )

Grit in the oyster

This week, the short sellers at Hindenburg Research took aim at another green company.

The group's report last year on electric truckmaker Nikola led to the departure of its CEO and an inquiry from
the   US   justice   department.   On   Monday   it   levelled   a   series   of   accusations   at   Ormat,   a   NYSE-traded   US
geothermal power company.

Ormat denied the allegations, and pointed out that, as a short seller, Hindenburg stood to proÔ¨Åt from a drop
in its share price. But shortly after Hindenburg made its case, Ormat's chief compliance ofÔ¨Åcer and a board
member (who were both named in the report) stepped down.

So far, it looks like investors have not quite worked out what to make of Hindenburg's Ô¨Åndings. Ormat's stock
was already headed downward after its latest earnings report and stayed pretty Ô¨Çat the day the report came
out. But regardless of how this story shakes out, it is a good reminder for responsible investors to take a close
look at their holdings and not automatically assume all ""green"" companies are immune to hostile scrutiny.

Smart reads

""The ESG stock frenzy of today, however egregious, may yet translate into a better tomorrow,"" writes the FT's
John Thornhill. ESG could well be in bubble territory, he says: ""Financial markets have bet on a greener future
and   begun   funding   the   technologies   needed   to   bring   it   to   life.   But,   just   as   in   previous   technological
revolutions, politicians must now play their part in shaping a productive result.""

Watchdog asked to examine potential Drax conÔ¨Çict on
climate advisory arm

Camilla Hodgson

The environment adviser to former UK prime minister Theresa May has asked the government watchdog to
examine a potential conÔ¨Çict of interest involving the head of climate change at power group Drax, who is also
a member of the UK's prestigious climate advisory committee.

Lord Randall has asked the National Audit OfÔ¨Åce to consider a formal investigation into the positions held by
Rebecca Heaton, the Drax executive who is also a member of the Committee on Climate Change   which
advises the government.

Heaton has been on the committee since 2017, when her appointment drew criticism from climate activists.
The issue has now been raised by Randall as Drax attempts to realign its business to focus on an emerging
technology, known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (Beccs).

The CCC has identiÔ¨Åed the technology as a potential solution for managing the most difÔ¨Åcult aspects of
avoiding carbon emissions. Drax has said its development will require government Ô¨Ånancial support.

""Given the signiÔ¨Åcant commercial interests of her employer, Drax, in the policies on which these committees
are advising government, I believe that there may be a real or perceived conÔ¨Çict between her role with Drax
and her ability to offer impartial expert advice on such policies,"" wrote Randall in a letter to the NAO.

Heaton is also a member of the CCC's audit committee, which advises the group on its own governance, and
a   council   member   of   the   Natural   Environment   Research   Council,   which   is   the   leading   funder   of   UK
environmental science, including research into carbon capture technologies.

Randall said the NAO should examine whether Heaton's roles allowed Drax to gain ""an unfair commercial
advantage through the inÔ¨Çuence its employee may be having on the advice and formulation of policy in an
area in which Drax operates"".

Drax is one of the world's largest producers of biomass, material including wood pellets and other plant
matter, which is burnt to generate energy. Its biomass operations are reliant on UK government subsidies
due to end in 2027. The company is working to reduce costs so that these operations remain viable, and also
betting on the Beccs technology, which involves capturing and storing the carbon emissions generated by
burning the biomass.

Using Beccs, ""we expect to play a major role in delivering the UK's legally binding objective to achieve net
zero carbon emissions by 2050 and support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions,"" Drax said in its 2020
annual results, adding that the CCC had indicated ""a growing commitment to"" the technology.

Deploying Beccs at scale will require an ""investment framework"" from the government, Drax states on its
website.

The government has pledged up to ¬£1bn to support the development of a carbon capture sector, which
could include new Beccs subsidies.

Phil MacDonald, chief executive of Ember, a climate and energy think-tank, said Drax was ""hunting for their
next big subsidy and Beccs is going to be important for that"".

In its latest carbon budget - or advice to government about the volume of greenhouse gases the UK can
emit over a Ô¨Åve-year period - the CCC said technologies such as Beccs ""will be required to permanently
remove carbon from the atmosphere, in order to offset remaining residual emissions in the UK and achieve
net zero by 2050"".

The nascent technology could be used to sequester 45m-95m tonnes of CO2 every year by 2050, said the
report. That compares to an estimate of 43m tonnes a year outlined in the Ô¨Åfth carbon budget, which placed

 





less emphasis on Beccs and was published before Heaton joined the CCC.


The CCC's most recent sixth carbon budget published in December also stated that the UK ""has plans to
deploy large-scale carbon removal through Beccs over the 2020s and beyond,"" citing Drax's plans.

Randall said the NAO should question whether the CCC's most recent advice on greenhouse gas removal
technology could be ""considered to be impartial and in the public interest"".

Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, said: ""Heaton was appointed by ministers in 2017 to provide a business
voice on the committee."" He said she ""stands back from committee discussions on bioenergy"" and was
""excluded from all relevant discussions on bioenergy and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage"" in its
deliberation for the sixth carbon budget.

The government assessed the CCC's processes for managing conÔ¨Çicts of interest in 2019 and found it to be
""robust"", he added.

Drax said: ""Dr Rebecca Heaton does not advise the CCC on bioenergy - this ensures there is no conÔ¨Çict of
interest.""

Aviva chief warns insurers on 'forked tongue' over climate
change

Oliver Ralph

Aviva chief executive Amanda Blanc has warned that the insurance industry cannot ""speak with forked
tongue"" on global warming by doing one thing with its investment portfolios and another with the products
it sells.

More insurers are promising to focus their often vast investment portfolios on those companies committed
to cutting carbon emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement. But in an interview with the Financial
Times, Blanc said the industry's efforts to curb global warming also needed to be reÔ¨Çected in how it sold
insurance.

""The underwriting needs to catch up with the investments,"" she said. ""We need to be having conversations
with corporates around our ability to underwrite something which is no longer sustainable.

""We can't be saying we want to take the premium but we're not going to invest in these organisations. That
would just be incoherent"", said Blanc, who has run Aviva since last July.

The warning came as Aviva pledged not to sell insurance to companies which make more than 5 per cent of
their revenue from coal or other heavily-polluting fuels such as oil sands, unless they have signed up to
climate targets.

The promise was part of a wider set of climate commitments announced by the UK insurer. Aviva said it
would be a net zero carbon emissions company by 2040, a decade earlier than many other Ô¨Ånancial services
companies have promised.

The plan includes cutting carbon emissions from its own operations and supply chain by 2030, and from its
investment portfolio by 2040.

""We're really stretching ourselves here,"" said Blanc. ""This is the most demanding target set by any major
insurer in the world . . . this will be the biggest challenge we've probably ever faced as a business.""

Aviva has already indicated that it is prepared to take a tough line as an investor. Last month it warned it
would sell its stakes in 30 of the world's largest oil, gas, mining and utilities companies unless they do more
to tackle climate change. It has given them two years to sign up to a transition plan.

Mark Versey, chief executive of Aviva's investment business, said that the reaction from the companies had
been ""generally very positive"".

""They are all thinking about this but it is not easy for them and we understand that. We are here to help
them as much as we can,"" he said. ""If all the companies we invest in sign up to net zero by 2040, then a lot of
our work will be done by then,"" Versey added.

Some of Europe's largest insurers, such as Axa, Allianz and Zurich, have already promised to stop selling cover
to some heavily-polluting companies, such as coal miners and coal-Ô¨Åred power stations. But the trend has
been slow to spread around the world.

Blanc said that the industry's efforts to protect the environment needed to move beyond the realm of
commercial insurance.

""We need to make it attractive for people to buy electric vehicles from an insurance perspective,"" she said.
""As we're building up our experience of electric vehicles . . . we'll become more sophisticated in the way we
are able to price [cover].""

Shareholders push SEC for tougher climate regime for US
oil

Myles McCormick in New York

Activist groups are calling on the US Securities and Exchange Commission to make it easier for shareholders
to   table   climate   resolutions   at   oil   producer   annual   meetings   in   another   early   test   of   the   Biden
administration's efforts to tackle climate change.

During Donald Trump's presidency, campaigners say, the SEC made it easier for companies to throw out
shareholder proposals on spurious grounds rather than put them to investor votes.

""In the last four years, there were a lot of surprising developments and I think it's fair to say that many
shareholders   felt   like   it   was   an   adverse   decision-making   environment   for   shareholder   proposals,""   said
Sanford Lewis, a lawyer and director of the Shareholder Rights Group.

""It was broadly considered a corporate-friendly environment in the last administration.""

The number of shareholder resolutions the SEC ruled as inadmissible jumped under the chairmanship of Jay
Clayton, whom Trump appointed in 2017.

Companies were allowed to reject about 15 per cent of environmental and social proposals in 2018, compared
with 9 per cent in 2016, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, an independent investor advisory
group.   That   jump   could   have   been   higher   had   there   not   been   a   surge   in   shareholders   withdrawing
resolutions.

Joe Biden has promised to make tackling climate change a core pillar of his presidency. But a narrow
majority in Congress will leave him depending on regulatory bodies such as the SEC, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to push his agenda.

The SEC is independent from the government but the president appoints its chairman and commissioners,
who determine its direction.

Activists'   biggest   gripe   is   the   broadening   of   the   deÔ¨Ånition   of   ""micromanagement""   during   Clayton's
chairmanship. Previously this rule allowed companies to reject proposals that delved too deeply into the day-
to-day running of a company, but the expanded deÔ¨Ånition meant any proposals that prescribed particular
outcomes could be excluded.

In a letter to the SEC last month, the SRG - alongside fellow investor advocacy groups Ceres, the Forum for
Sustainable and Responsible Investment and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility - asked the
SEC to repeal the new interpretations ""to re-enable shareholders to ask their investee companies to improve
disclosure and performance on climate change"".

Shareholder proposals were responsible for sparking a shift in attitude by European oil groups in recent
years, said Mark van Baal, director at Dutch shareholder group Follow This, which has submitted resolutions
calling on oil groups Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Occidental and Phillips 66 to set targets for cutting carbon
emitted by the burning of their products (so-called Scope 3 emissions).

""Oil majors have only promised to reduce product emissions after investors voted for shareholder proposals,""
said van Baal. ""We saw this Ô¨Årst at Shell and then at BP and Equinor.""

Gary Gensler, the former Goldman Sachs banker Biden has picked for his SEC chairman, is widely anticipated
to take a tougher line against companies on ESG matters. The number of resolutions rejected through ""no-
action"" letters from the SEC will probably drop, analysts said.

""The interpretations of the grounds for admission under the 'no-action' process tend to go in waves, up and
down, depending on what administration is in place and the chair of the SEC,"" said Patrick McGurn, head of
strategic research and analysis at ISS.

 





With Gensler yet to be conÔ¨Årmed to the position, any change in policy will take time, and will probably be too
late for the 2021 AGM season. Still, analysts said John Coates, a Harvard academic who has been installed as
acting head of the commission's corporate Ô¨Ånance division, could already be exerting some inÔ¨Çuence.


In a promising sign for campaigners, the SEC on Friday denied ExxonMobil's request to block a shareholder
proposal   asking   the   company   to   report   how   its   political   lobbying   activities   align   with   climate change
concerns. The proposal was Ô¨Åled by France's BNP Paribas Asset Management, which in 2020 Ô¨Åled a similar
petition about climate change and lobbying at Chevron. The Chevron proposal won majority support from
investors, including asset management giant BlackRock.

""InsufÔ¨Åcient information is available to evaluate how ExxonMobil ensures that its lobbying activities, directly,
in the company's name, and indirectly, through trade associations, align with the Paris Agreement's goals,
and how misalignments are addressed,"" BNP said.

The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.

Architects take on climate change in For Those That Wish
to Exist

Ludovic Hunter-Tilney

In an ironic reversal of the moral panic it inspired in the 1970s and 1980s, heavy metal has become a bastion
of morality. The battle between good and evil is its core topic. Even the bands espousing evil, of whom there
are admittedly a fair few, implicitly acknowledge the existence of goodness. The genre is policed by ethical
notions of integrity and not selling out. There is a strong attitude of kinship among fans. A code of duty and
honour prevails.

Architects' new album For Those That Wish to Exist applies the titanic struggle between good and bad to the
issue   of   climate change.   ""Are   you   fanning   the   Ô¨Çames?""   singer   Sam   Carter   demands   in   ""An   Ordinary
Extinction"" amid Ô¨Çayed drums and scorched-earth riffs. The question invites self-interrogation while the
music has an excoriating intensity. It wants to get at the truth.

The musical style belongs to a sub-genre called ""metalcore"", which emerged in the 1990s from US hardcore
punk and extreme metal. It has its own moral traditions. Architects, from Brighton in the UK, are drawn to
the ""straight edge"" philosophy that US hardcore bands such as Minor Threat advocated in the 1980s, based
around   abstinence   from   meat   and   intoxicants.   Their   environmentalism   chimes   with   that   of   pioneering
metalcore band Earth Crisis, whose 1995 album Destroy the Machines delivered a bludgeoning message of
ecological and animal rights activism.

For Those That Wish to Exist is the ninth Architects album. During the course of their career, they have risen
to become one of the biggest bands in metalcore. Their new record tackles its subject matter with discipline
and seriousness. The music is loud but not chaotic. It is played with control, a carefully arranged assembly of
interlaced guitar parts and drumming, topped by vocals that vary between harsh screaming and tuneful
singing. Intelligibility is prized over brute force. Melodic choruses open up emotional spaces in songs.

Themes of death and grief in the current age of species loss are fused with feelings of personal bereavement.
Former guitarist Tom Searle, who founded the band with his drumming twin brother Dan Searle, died in
2016. ""It's all in parallel,"" Carter sings on opening track ""Do You Dream of Armageddon?"" as electronics skitter
around him and a big blockbuster of a drumbeat hammers away. String arrangements add an imposing
extra dimension. It signals that a grand endeavour is under way.

The album's 15 songs last almost an hour. Guests include Winston McCall of Australian metalcore band
Parkway   Drive,   who   contributes   a   Ô¨Åerce   vocal   part   to   ""Impermanence"".   Mike   Kerr,   vocalist   with   fellow
Brighton band Royal Blood, appears on ""Little Wonder"". Guitarists Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton
make for a well-attuned partnership, while Searle's drumming and Alex Dean on bass are a formidable
rhythm section. Carter moves coherently between different vocal modes. But the overall results are solid
rather than impressive.

Efforts are made to challenge the band's usual sound, a necessary act of adaptation considering the album's
portrait of a world hurtling to disaster unless it changes its ways. ""Dead ButterÔ¨Çies"" and ""Flight without
Feathers"" hint at expansive prog-rock balladry, while ""Little Wonder"" has a taut electro-rock spine. But the
metalcore formula of brutal riffs and singsong choruses prevails. Its Manichean dialogue between forces of
violence and harmony carries a moral charge but also a sense of stuckness.

Climate warriors
Essay | Global warming has made environmentalists of us all. Yet debate still rages over what
is the best solution. Pilita Clark looks at three differing views on how we could be tackling
climate change

Pilita Clark looks

A professor all write a book about climate change. That may sound like the start of a joke but it is not,
especially for philanthropist Bill Gates and author Jonathan Franzen . Their books have come out just as
Michael E Mann, one of the world's best known climate scientists, has published a book accusing each of
abetting new forces of inactivism slowing efforts to tackle climate change.

It is hard to think of another time the publishing world has delivered such an engaging spectacle. As raging
wildÔ¨Åres and deadly Ô¨Çoods drive a new sense of urgency, the debate about how to curb global warming has
spread far beyond the scientists, economists and activists who once dominated the Ô¨Åeld. We are all, as it
were, environmentalists now.

Yet the scale of the climate problem makes it hard to know what constitutes a meaningful response. Is it
enough to give up meat and Ô¨Çying? Do we need a slew of technological breakthroughs? Or is disaster now
inevitable and any sort of action too late?

These three books address all these questions, but none so comprehensively as Mann. The Pennsylvania
State University professor has had an unusually vivid view of the battle to cut the world's dependence on
fossil fuels.

He was still in his early thirties in 1998 when he and two colleagues published what has been called the most
controversial chart in science: the hockey stick. At a time of widespread denial about climate change, their
simple graph showed global temperatures had varied little for centuries, but shot up after fossil fuel burning
took off after the industrial revolution. In other words, the world was warming at a rate unseen in modern
history and humans were causing it.

Mann faced a blistering effort to discredit his work ‚Äî and even death threats. In the US, Republicans in
Congress, many of them recipients of fossil fuel industry donations, accused him of inaccuracy, fraud and
worse, as he recounted in his 2012 book, The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars.

Nearly a decade later, the science behind the hockey stick remains robust. Yet Mann makes a convincing
case that the Ô¨Åght against climate action continues ‚Äî under different terms of engagement. ""Outright
denial of the physical evidence of climate change simply isn't credible any more,"" he writes in The New
Climate War. The war on the science has ended, he says. But in its place has come a war on climate action, or
""a softer form of denialism"" in which ""inactivists"" deploy a mix of deception, deÔ¨Çection and distraction to
delay cuts in emissions.

Many readers will be surprised to learn that one of Mann's chief complaints concerns Ô¨Çight-shaming, vegan
diets and other types of individual behaviour widely thought to be central to tackling climate change.
Personal actions can help, and often set a sensible example. But, as Mann writes, they cannot rival broad,
systemic measures such as carbon pricing or ending fossil fuel subsidies. For all the scrutiny of Ô¨Çying, it
currently accounts for about 3 per cent of global carbon emissions.

Worse, some research suggests a focus on personal behaviour creates an illusion of progress that can erode
support for more effective collective policies. One study found the more people switched off lights and
scrimped on household energy use, the less likely they were to support a carbon tax.

Dwelling on individual behaviour is also a ""particularly devious"" deÔ¨Çection strategy, Mann argues, because it
breeds   divisive   Ô¨Ånger-pointing   among   campaigners   and   attempts   to   render   leaders   as   elite   hypocrites.
Celebrity climate activist Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance, is often lambasted for Ô¨Çying in a private jet. After Al

 





Gore released his 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, claims emerged that his home used 20 times
more energy than the average American house.


Mann shows attention on personal action did not occur in a vacuum. Oil companies were early promoters of
the personal carbon footprint calculator and there is a well-thumbed playbook for industries seeking to
divert attention from their own activities to individuals using their products. The US gun lobby claims ""guns
don't kill people, people kill people"" to fend off tougher laws; beverage groups back campaigns against
roadside litter created by their own bottles and cans.

Some of Mann's other examples of soft denialism are even more insidious because they are promoted by
green activists themselves. Exhibit one: what he calls climate ""doomists"" who promote the idea that all hope
is lost and action is fruitless, which is where Jonathan Franzen comes in.

The best-selling US novelist is no climate denier. But in 2019 he caused an outcry with an elegantly written
New Yorker magazine article titled ""What if We Stopped Pretending?"" which argued climate disaster was all
but certain and it made sense to focus on how to use Ô¨Ånite resources to deal with it. His new 70-page
booklet bears the same title and includes the article, along with an interview Franzen gave a German
journalist to expand on his views. ""All-out war on climate change made sense when only as long as it was
winnable,"" says Franzen. Human nature has made meaningful climate action almost impossible and ""a false
hope of salvation can be actively harmful,"" he argues. Preparing for Ô¨Çoods, Ô¨Åres and refugees might be more
pertinent. The essay reads at times like an elegiac counsel of despair. For the pugnacious Mann it is far worse.
He devotes nearly four pages to what he calls ""one of the most breathtakingly doomist diatribes"" ever
written. The fundamental problem with the article, Mann rails, is that it attempts ""to build a case for doom on
a Ô¨Çimsy foundation of distorted science"".

Mann argues that it is still possible to avert 2C of warming and that every bit of carbon that is not burnt
prevents additional damage. ""There is both urgency and agency,"" he says. Social and political changes also
give him cause for cautious optimism. Apart from the fact that outright denialism is fading and that climate
action advocates such as Joe Biden are being elected, he is buoyed by the youth climate movement and the
rise of investors rethinking the risks of fossil fuel investments.

In addition, he thinks the Covid crisis has reawakened appreciation of science, while pandemic recovery
plans have opened opportunities for green investments. ""We appear to be nearing the much-anticipated
tipping point on climate action,"" he writes.

Yet the urgency of the problem remains, which is what leads Mann to cite Bill Gates on several charges of
climate inactivism.

The Microsoft co-founder is not an obvious target. Unlike other billionaires bent on reaching Mars or the
Moon, Gates has spent vast sums to improve the lives of the poorest on this planet. He warned of the need to
prepare for a global pandemic years before the current crisis and is now leading vaccine efforts to defeat
Covid-19. He is also a lavish backer of technologies to avert what he says is the very real threat of global
warming, as he details in his book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster .

Yet Gates has long irked many climate campaigners. He has raised doubts about using green energy in
developing countries (a form of inactivism for Mann) and scorned the idea of fossil fuel divestment, telling
the FT in 2019 it had ""zero"" impact on emissions.

In his new book, Gates reveals he actually divested his direct holdings in oil and gas companies in 2019. He
still   supports   what   Mann   calls   ""non-solution   solutions""   offering   the   illusion   of   climate action,   such   as
geoengineering schemes to offset warming carbon emissions. Gates has long been among the largest
funders of research into such efforts, which can range from directly capturing carbon dioxide from the air to
shooting sulphate particles into the atmosphere to mimic the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions.

For Mann, these schemes come under the heading of ""dangerous techno-Ô¨Åxes"" that appeal to free-market
conservatives ‚Äî by suggesting government regulation is unnecessary ‚Äî but entail hugely risky ""tinkering""
with complex Earth systems we do not fully understand.

Gates   acknowledges   such   concerns,   admitting   that   unproven   geoengineer-   ing   concepts   raise   ""thorny
ethical issues"". He adds that his funding for such efforts is ""tiny"" compared to his other climate Ô¨Ånancing. But
he still thinks the approach is worth investigating ""while we still have the luxury of study and debate"".



The idea that there is time to develop meaningful climate solutions underpins a central theme of the book,
namely   that   existing   green   technologies   are   not   enough   and   must   be   augmented   by   big   innovation

 



breakthroughs. ""We have some of what we need, but far from all of it,"" he says.


This puts Gates on one side of a debate between those who think the climate problem will be solved by
technology, versus those who believe the technology needed is here and what is required is more political
will and policies to deploy it.

Mann belongs to the latter camp. ""Sorry Bill Gates, but we don't need a miracle,"" he writes, pointing to
academics who showed years ago that existing renewable energy and storage technologies could meet up
to 80 per cent of global energy demand by 2030, and 100 per cent by 2050.

The framework Gates uses to support his view is based on his idea of the ""green premium"", or the extra cost
of   zero-carbon   technologies   compared   with   fossil   fuel   alternatives.   The   average   cost   of   a   gallon   of
conventional jet fuel, for instance, is $2.22, while jet biofuels cost about $5.35, so the green premium adds up
to $3.13.

He argues that clean technologies should only be deployed if they have a low or zero green premium, which
by his analysis excludes all but a handful of options, such as home air heat pumps in some cities which in
certain cases can actually be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. That is, he admits, partly because fossil fuel
prices do not reÔ¨Çect the damage they inÔ¨Çict, and meaningful carbon pricing will be ""crucial"" to eliminating
green premiums.

This analysis is useful. So too is his accessible description of what needs to be done to tackle climate change:
bring the 51bn tons of greenhouse gases typically emitted globally each year down to zero.

Some readers may Ô¨Ånd his folksy tone, and occasional fart joke, more agreeable than Mann's punchier work.
Others may wonder how Gates managed to write an entire book on climate action that scarcely mentions
the powerful political forces bent on thwarting it.

Either way, his approach leads him down some curious paths, especially when it comes to the state of
existing renewables. Readers in the UK, who have been getting more than 10 per cent of their electricity
from offshore wind farms this year, will be surprised to see Gates describe offshore wind as a green idea
""currently in the proof phase"" of market development, along with lowcarbon cement.

Likewise, Gates is oddly dismissive of the idea that emissions should fall fast this decade, despite UN science
reports showing global emissions should halve by 2030, and reach net zero by 2050, to avoid 1.5C of warming.
""Making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero,"" he claims.
We might, for instance, replace coal power plants with gas-Ô¨Åred ones that have carbon capture equipment
but   still   emit   greenhouse   gases.   Theoretically,   that   is   a   risk.   But   so   is   waiting   years   for   innovation
breakthroughs that do not arrive.

Ultimately, Gates and Mann probably agree more than they disagree. Each wants action to curb warming
emissions that pose a dire threat to the climate and, considering the torrid state of climate disputes in very
recent history, that is a welcome relief.

UN rebukes 75 nations over climate failures
Global warmingReport says countries are falling 'far short' of goals to cut greenhouse gases

CAMILLA HODGSON

Climate plans laid out by 75 countries responsible for a third of global emissions ""fall far short"" of what is
needed to meet the goals of the Paris accord on global warming, a Ô¨Ånding that must serve as a ""wake-up
call"" for all governments, the UN said.

In a stark warning delivered ahead of an international climate summit in November, Patricia Espinosa, the
UN climate change executive secretary, said the combined efforts were woefully inadequate and appealed to
the world's biggest emitters to ""step up"" with ambitious greenhouse gas reduction plans this year.

The updated plans from countries including the UK and Australia and the EU submitted by December
demonstrated that ""current levels of climate ambition are very far from putting us on a pathway that will
meet our Paris Agreement goals"", she said.

Signatories   of   the   Paris   Agreement   pledged   to   limit   warming   to   ""well   below""   2C,   compared   with   pre-
industrial   levels,   by   2100.   They   were   asked   to   submit   ambitious   emissions   reductions   plans,   known   as
Nationally Determined Contributions, by the end of 2020.

The 75 countries that met this deadline account for about 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. If
those nations' new targets were implemented, the UN said in its latest report card, their combined emissions
would fall just 0.5 per cent by 2030, compared with 2010 levels. That is drastically lower than the 45 per cent
fall in global emissions needed to limit warming to 1.5C, or ""far short of what is required"", the UN said.

All countries, including those that had already submitted new plans, had to urgently ""look at how they can
increase their ambition"", said Espinosa.

Just one of the world's four largest greenhouse gas emitters had submitted its plan in time to be included in
the analysis ‚Äî the EU group of 27 countries. New commitments have yet to be put forward by China, the
largest global emitter, the US and India.

Niklas H√∂hne, partner at NewClimate Institute, a non-proÔ¨Åt group that tracks action on climate change, said
more ambitious targets were expected from those three nations. ""We have a huge gap, we are totally off
target. But I'm hopeful that we see more movement in the course of this year.""

US president Joe Biden has made action on climate a priority and moved to rejoin the Paris Agreement on
his Ô¨Årst day in ofÔ¨Åce after former president Donald Trump left the accord. China has pledged to be carbon
neutral by 2060.

H√∂hne said the UN analysis should draw attention to those countries that had not raised their targets and
simply resubmitted their original plans.

Japan, South Korea, Russia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Australia all delivered plans that failed to improve
on their 2015 target. Brazil's climate plan lacked any goals to cut emissions by 2030.

Without naming speciÔ¨Åc nations, Espinosa rebuked those countries: ""It's incredible to think that just when
nations are facing an emergency that could eventually end human life on this planet ... many nations are
sticking to their business-as-usual approach.""

Letter: Plastic straws and the climate change camel

I disagree with Bill Gates that to stop buying plastic straws is not a worthwhile behavioural change for
individuals seeking to support responsible consumption (""Bill Gates: My Green manifesto"", Life & Arts, FT
Weekend, February 20).

This response exempliÔ¨Åes an inherent bias in the ongoing global discourse that has resulted in net zero
carbon emissions being equated to (or seen as a substitute for) the much wider objective of sustainable
development.

This is not to argue that net zero is not a critical goal, but its dominance of the sustainability narrative will
end up doing incalculable harm to the cause of other equally important sustainability challenges facing the
world.

For   instance,   environmental   pollution,   plastic   waste   and   water   stress   may   be   much   more   localised
challenges and thus not able to command the same global attention as climate change. But their impacts
can be equally damaging and far more immediate.

India's top six cities had more than 120,000 deaths in 2020 attributed to elevated levels of PM2.5 pollution, the
particles which are about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair and can penetrate deep into the lungs.

More than 6bn tonnes or 80 per cent of all plastics produced in the world has been dumped into landÔ¨Ålls or
the natural environment, including oceans.

A quarter of the world's population is already facing extreme water stress, according to World Resources
Institute.

What we need, therefore, is an ""all of the above"" approach to achieve the 17 targets forming part of the UN
sustainable development goals framework.

The correct response from Gates would be to wholeheartedly encourage responsible consumption, including
not using or buying plastics straws.

Gulf Stream system at weakest in a millennium due to
climate change

Leslie Hook in London

The Gulf Stream system has weakened to its slowest pace in more than a thousand years, according to
scientists, as global warming makes the powerful ocean current that controls much of the Atlantic Ocean
slow down.

Two studies published this week reveal climate change is slowing down the ocean current, which carries
warm water to Europe, more dramatically than previously expected.

Using sediment data and temperature records to map historical trends, a study in Nature Geoscience found
the Gulf Stream system, also known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is travelling at
its slowest rate in the last millennium.

""This is highly likely to be caused by our greenhouse gas emissions, because there is no other plausible
explanation for this slowdown,"" said Stefan Rahmstorf, one of the authors and head of earth system analysis
at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. ""It is exactly what the climate models have been
predicting for decades.""

The Gulf Stream is a huge ocean current that carries warm water from the tropics up the east coast of North
America. The current - which carries more than 100 times the Ô¨Çow of the Amazon River - then cools and sinks
down around Greenland, carrying cooler water back south in the deep layers of the ocean.

It has already slowed by 15 per cent in the last century, and Rahmstorf said this was starting to affect weather
patterns, such as more frequent heatwaves in southern Europe.

The Amoc not only carries warm water to Europe - it is responsible for the mild winters in the UK - but it also
inÔ¨Çuences storm development.

The Ô¨Åndings of the new study are ""worrying"", Rahmstorf said. ""If this continues, we might be closing in slowly
to a tipping point, where this circulation could destabilise altogether.""

One reason the Amoc system is slowing down is due to melting ice in Greenland, where large volumes of
cold fresh water are entering the ocean, and altering the current's natural sinking mechanism.

Increasing rainfall in North America, causing more fresh water to enter rivers, streams and the ocean, and
warmer ocean temperatures that reduce the temperature gradient between the tropics and the pole, are
also contributing to the slowdown.

Andrew Meijers, oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the research, said the
study ""reveals that prior to the era of human-induced climate change, the Atlantic overturning circulation
was relatively stable and stronger than it is now"".

""This indicates that the slowdown is likely not a natural change, but the result of human inÔ¨Çuence,"" he added.

Other scientists have pointed out that there was still a high degree of uncertainty about how the Gulf Stream
inÔ¨Çuences European weather.

""There are many other drivers for variations in European weather, including atmospheric chaos,"" said Tim
Palmer, professor of climate physics at Oxford, who was not involved in the study. ""This is an interesting study
and one that needs continued investigation. However, it shouldn't be overinterpreted.""

A separate study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that if the pace of
global warming accelerates, this could cause the Gulf Stream to shut down entirely.



Johannes Lohmann, lead author of the study and a physics postdoc at the University of Copenhagen, said it
was ""not that likely"" that the current would reach this point within the next 100 years, unless global warming

 



accelerates.


""There is still quite a debate about whether a tipping point of the Amoc is imminent,"" said Lohmann. ""There
is strong evidence from climate changes in the past, that the Amoc has switched from a state that is similar
to the present day . . . to one where the Amoc was shut off.""

""There is a self-reinforcing feedback which could lead to the Amoc shutting itself off, in a runaway effect,"" he
said.

UK companies face greater scrutiny on climate risks at
upcoming AGMs

Attracta Mooney

British companies that fail to thoroughly report the risks they face from global warming will come under
intense scrutiny during the upcoming annual meeting season after an inÔ¨Çuential investor lobby group said it
would issue ""amber warnings"" for climate laggards.

The Investment Association, the UK's trade body for asset managers with ¬£8.5tn under management, said it
will Ô¨Çag for the Ô¨Årst time when companies in high-risk sectors fail to report under the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures, the framework spearheaded by former Bank of England governor Mark Carney.

Companies that are deemed to be falling short will be issued with so-called amber tops by the IA's Ivis proxy
advice service, which is widely used by asset managers ahead of annual meetings. An amber top, which
indicates   a   signiÔ¨Åcant   issue   for   investors   to   consider,   could   lead   to   shareholders   voting   against   either
directors or the accounts.

The IA said fund managers needed companies to report on ""climate-related risks in a consistent, clear and
comparable manner"" to ensure investors can make better informed long-term investment decisions and
understand how prepared businesses are for the transition to a low-carbon economy.

""As stewards of the economy, investment managers have an important role to play in supporting companies
transition   to   a   more   sustainable   future,""   said   Andrew   Ninian,   director   for   stewardship   and   corporate
governance at the IA.

""Having clear and consistent data on the climate-related risks faced by companies is vital to achieve this, and
investors will now be placing additional pressure on those that fail to provide this information.""

He added that the UK was at a ""critical juncture"" as the country looked to rapidly cut its carbon emissions.

Under plans from the UK government, all businesses will have to report under the TCFDs by 2025 while
groups with a premium listing will be required to do so on a comply or explain basis from next year. But the
IA says it wants companies to provide this information for the upcoming annual meeting season.

The investment body also warned that even when companies reported climate risks, many were not doing a
thorough job. According to its analysis the number of FTSE 100 companies saying they are using the TCFDs
more than doubled last year to 77, but only half reported under all four pillars of the framework - governance,
strategy, risk management and metrics, and targets.

Research from the UK's Financial Reporting Council last year found a similar problem, with only a quarter of
the 60 UK-listed companies it sampled making any reference to climate change in their Ô¨Ånancial statements
and their disclosures generally not going beyond existing accounting standards.

The IA's focus on the TCFDs is being echoed by individual asset managers, including BlackRock and Aviva
Investors, which are also piling pressure on companies to report in line with them. Aviva Investors warned last
month   that   it   would   divest   from   companies   that   failed   to   show   they   were   preparing   for   a   low-carbon
economy, including reporting under the framework.

According to the TCFD, 1,500 organisations globally - including more than 1,340 companies with a market
capitalisation of $12.6tn - have said they support the initiative. But it warned last year that asset managers
were not providing enough information about climate risks at the companies they invest in to enable clients
to make informed choices.

Climate graphic of the week: Polar vortex sends Texas into
deep freeze

Leslie Hook and Steven Bernard

As freezing temperatures descended across Texas this week, scientists were trying to answer one central
question: had this event been made more likely by climate change?

From an atmospheric point of view, the Texas deep freeze was caused by a giant bend in the jet stream, the
fast-moving band of air 10km above the earth's surface that plays a central role in the weather of North
America and Europe.

The jet stream separates the cold polar air of the north from the warmer air of the tropics, and when it gets
wavy the cold air can end up farther south than usual (or warm air can end up farther north).

Tim Woollings, professor of physics at Oxford university, says that the jet stream has been behaving in
unusual ways this winter in the northern hemisphere.

""The jet this winter has been quite disturbed and has moved around a lot, and one of these meanderings is a
direct cause of what happened in Texas,"" he said. ""It is kind of unexpected. The seasonal forecast for this
winter didn't really predict this kind of thing.""

However, Woollings added it was not clear that the Texas freeze had been made more likely because of
global warming.

""Freak weather events will happen, and they are not all necessarily linked to climate change,"" said Woollings,
who is also the author of the book Jet Stream: A Journey Through Our Changing Climate.

One topic of great debate among scientists of the atmosphere is whether the jet stream is becoming weaker
and wavier as a result of global warming, or whether the opposite might be true, making the jet stream
stronger and pushing it further north.

Woollings said that more evidence had been building in recent years behind the theory of a stronger jet
stream, but also noted that the matter was still far from decided. ""[The Texas freeze] is not part of a direct
trend, not an example of the jet becoming wavier in general,"" he said.

One reason for the disturbed jet stream could be an earlier disruption in the stratospheric polar vortex, a
mass of cold air that sits more than 30km above the earth's surface in the arctic region, he added.

The term ""polar vortex"" is also used to refer to the cold air that sits on the poleward side of the jet stream, in
the troposphere, which is the lowest layer of the atmosphere.

Philip Duffy, president of the Woodwell Climate Research Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, said that
climate change was causing more extreme weather in the continental US.

""It is wrong to view climate change as simply a gradual warming process,"" he added. ""In some cases weather
becomes more variable, with more extremes in both directions."" He pointed to the example of extreme
winter snow in the eastern US, which has increased over the past century, according to data from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Detention stokes fear among India's young climate change
activists

Amy Kazmin in New Delhi

Inspired   by   the   teenaged   activist   Greta   Thunberg,   Indian   environmentalist   Disha   Ravi   has   campaigned
against climate change, led tree planting drives and fought development projects in fragile ecosystems.

Ravi, 22, is now being held in a New Delhi jail on suspicion of sedition, a crime punishable by life in prison. Her
alleged   misdeed:   collaborating   with   Thunberg   on   a   social   media   campaign   to   support   Indian   farmers
opposed to new agricultural marketing laws.

Ravi's detention last weekend, for what New Delhi police claim is an ""international conspiracy"" against India,
reÔ¨Çects the increasingly aggressive tactics that the government of prime minister Narendra Modi is prepared
to employ against dissent, as it confronts growing public resistance.

It has sent shockwaves through India's expanding network of young environmental activists, and stoked
anxiety among parents about the price their children could pay for speaking out.

""Her arrest is certainly disheartening for all of us,"" said Joel Kyndiah, 18, an activist from the town of Shillong.
""We've always been peaceful and democratic in how we pursue the problem of climate change.""

Critics said the arrest reÔ¨Çects the government's particular antipathy towards young campaigners - especially
educated, tech savvy and globally connected youth who talk about issues that resonate internationally such
as the environment.

""The youth don't show fear and the government doesn't like that,"" said Nityanand Jayaraman, 53, an activist
with the Chennai Solidarity Group, an environmental justice collective. ""They think young people should
study, work hard and obey, not question the state.""

The Modi government set its sights on environmentalists soon after taking power, after an intelligence
bureau report - leaked to the public - called foreign-funded NGOs ""tools"" of western governments seeking to
thwart India's economic progress.

In 2015, an Indian campaigner for Greenpeace was barred from Ô¨Çying out of the country to London, where
she was to speak publicly about a planned coal mine in a sensitive forest area. Greenpeace India's bank
accounts were frozen.

Since then, New Delhi has moved steadily to dilute India's environmental rules and regulations, and diverted
protected lands for industrial uses while boasting to businesses about its accelerated speed in granting
permission for projects in sensitive habitats.

""They have tried to dilute every law for one purpose - the ease of doing business,"" said Claude Alvares,
director of The Goa Foundation, an environmental group. ""They have openly declared that business is more
important and the environment is not important any more.""

Yet the drive for development in ecologically sensitive areas - such as plans to expand a railway line, roads
and power lines through a protected national forest in Goa - has stoked resistance from young people, who
are inÔ¨Çuenced by global trends and adroit at mobilising via social media.

Among them was Ravi, a farmer's granddaughter, who launched the Indian arm of Fridays for the Future, the
movement inspired by Thunberg, while a college student in 2019. Today, FFF India has chapters in around 40
cities, while Ravi gained prominence as a global voice in the movement.

Yet FFF India came under pressure last summer as the authorities sought to overhaul the environmental
impact assessments process to reduce the role of public inputs, including from independent experts, in
decision-making.



 



Activists of FFF and two other groups, Let India Breathe and There is No Earth B, mobilised a campaign to
bombard the environment minister with emails opposing the changes. New Delhi responded by blocking
the groups' websites and threatening arrests under draconian anti-terrorism laws, which allow suspects to
be held without charge for lengthy periods.


The government did not follow through on its threats. But Ravi's efforts to bring global attention to farmers'
protests, which are seen as the biggest threat to the Modi government since he came to power in 2014, drew
the full force of Indian state power.

The furore began after Thunberg tweeted a message of solidarity with the farmers, sharing a ""tool kit"" for
mobilising support for their protests. The document, which Ravi allegedly helped prepare, suggested such
non-violent   actions   as   tweeting,   demonstrating   in   front   of   Indian   embassies,   and   putting   international
pressure on New Delhi.

After Thunberg's tweet, Delhi police, who answer to Modi's trusted home minister Amit Shah, Ô¨Åled a criminal
complaint, calling the document ""a call to wage economic, social, cultural and regional war against India"".

Ravi was  arrested from  her home  in Bangalore  and Ô¨Çown  to New  Delhi, where  she has  been held  for
interrogation although she has not been charged. Two other climate activists, a lawyer and engineer, have
been named by police as suspected co-conspirators.

While the arrest has stoked fears, many young activists insist they will not give up their cause.

""We will not be intimidated or dissuaded from going forward,"" said Kyndiah, the Shillong activist. ""We're
doing our best to make parents understand, that your children aren't going against the country in any way.
We're Ô¨Åghting for a future in which we can all have decent, liveable lives.""

Another young campaigner, who requested anonymity because of concern for her safety, said Ravi's arrest
stemmed from a government ""that doesn't approve of citizens using their democratic rights"".

""They're trying to intimidate and scare every other young environmental activist,"" she said. ""But we're not
interested in anything except a future where we can breathe.""

UK summit 'last, best hope' of hitting climate goal, says
Kerry
Munich Security Conference

LESLIE HOOK

US climate tsar John Kerry warned that the upcoming UN climate summit in Glasgow was ""our last, best
hope"" to get the world on track to limit global warming to 1.5C, as he underscored the security challenges
posed by climate change.

""Climate change is a threat multiplier,"" he said, in his Ô¨Årst speech on the international stage since taking up
his role as President Joe Biden's special envoy for climate. ""When tensions are already high somewhere ... the
embers of conÔ¨Çict just burn brighter.

""Climate change is among the most complex security issues we have ever faced,"" he told Nato leaders at the
Munich Security Conference.

Kerry   said   the   world   had   just   nine   years   to   put   in   place   the   policies   that   would   help   avert   the   worst
consequences of global warming. ""There is no faking it in this moment,"" he added.

The   US   formally   re-entered   the   Paris   climate   accord   yesterday,   30   days   after   Biden   asked   to   rejoin   by
executive Ô¨Åat on the day of his inauguration. ""I'm sending a clear message to the world: American is back,"" he
told Nato leaders yesterday after a wide-ranging discussion between G7 leaders.

""This is a global existential crisis, and we will all suffer the consequences if we fail,"" Biden said. ""We have to
rapidly accelerate our efforts to curb emissions, and hold one another accountable for meeting our goals,
and increasing our ambitions.""

The US return to the Paris accord, just over 100 days after its exit last November, means the US will need to
announce a new emissions target ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. The existing
US target, set by the Obama administration, is to cut emissions by at least 26 per cent by 2025, relative to
2005 levels.

The COP26 summit, hosted by the UK, may help to solidify a common tie on climate change between the US
and the UK.

Boris Johnson, prime minister, said he was ""delighted"" that the US had rejoined the Paris climate agreement
and praised Biden's leadership.

""The UK's aim will be to rally as many countries as possible behind the target of net zero emissions by 2050,""
said Johnson.

The Paris climate accord aims to limit global warming to well below 2C, ideally to 1.5C, and has been ratiÔ¨Åed
by 190 countries. The US is the only signatory to have ever withdrawn.

The US, which is the world's second-largest emitter after China, pulled out of the Paris accord last November
under then president Donald Trump.

Bill Gates: My green manifesto
Many of us feel powerless in the face of the climate crisis. Here the billionaire philanthropist
and Microsoft co-founder offers four bold ideas to help business take on the challenge Bill
Gates: My green manifesto

In the conversations I have about climate change, one question comes up more than any other: ""How can I
help?""

Sometimes it's an individual who simply wants to know whether to stop buying plastic straws. (Answer: it
doesn't do much for climate change, but it helps the environment in other ways.) Just as often, though, the
question comes from someone working on a larger scale ? for example, a chief executive who wants to know:
""What can my company do that will really make a difference?""

Unfortunately, even the most dedicated climate change advocates have struggled to Ô¨Ånd satisfying answers
to that question. But there are in fact things businesses can do to make a measurable difference for the
climate. They will not come easily, though. Avoiding a climate disaster requires a different way of doing
business, the courage to take on risks that many CEOs are not used to taking ? and that investors are not
used to rewarding.

It   took   me   years   to   come   to   this   point   of   view.   I   became   interested   in   climate change   not   as   an
environmentalist, but as an advocate for global health and development. Since the early 2000s, my wife
Melinda and I have been funding efforts to improve health and Ô¨Åght poverty in lower- and middle-income
countries. A few times a year, I would travel abroad for the chance to see the work in action. Often, I'd Ô¨Çy into
a country at night and be struck by the immensity of the darkness. A billion people, I learnt, did not have
access to reliable electricity. Around half of them lived in sub- Saharan Africa. (Today the global number is
about 860m people.)

It became obvious that it would be virtually impossible to make real inroads on disease and poverty when
more than one in 10 people on Earth did not have reliable access to all the beneÔ¨Åts of energy ? lights for
schools and health clinics, transport between work and home, fertiliser for crops, even air-conditioning to
withstand rising temperatures.

But achieving a modern lifestyle depends on fossil fuels. And the problem is simple: we can't afford to release
more greenhouse gases. In fact, we need to stop releasing them altogether, and do it by 2050. Think of the
climate like a bathtub that's slowly Ô¨Ålling up with water. Even if we slow the Ô¨Çow of water to a trickle, the tub
will eventually Ô¨Åll up and water will spill all over the Ô¨Çoor. To stop temperatures rising and avoid disaster, we
have to turn off the tap entirely ? we have to get to zero greenhouse gas emissions.

I wrote my new book to propose a practical plan for eliminating emissions and developing and deploying the
tools we need to so. While I'm optimistic that we can do that, it's going to take a lot of effort from the only
groups capable of operating at a global scale ? governments, non-proÔ¨Åts and businesses.

How hard will it be? In the course of writin'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, I developed away to answer that
question.   I   call   it   Green   Premiums   ?   the   differences   in   cost   between   a   fossil-fuelbased   way   of   doing
something and the clean, non-emitting way of doing the same thing.

Green Premiums tell us how much it will cost to zero-out emissions in all the sectors of the economy where
fossil fuels are involved ? including producing electricity, manufacturing, agriculture, transportation, and
heating and cooling. Armed with these Green Premiums, we can see which zero-carbon tools are practical
now, and which ones we still need to improve or invent.

In my research, I found some pleasant surprises. For example, in the US, switching to a clean electricity grid
using current technology (wind, solar, hydropower and nuclear) would raise electricity prices by about 15 per
cent over current retail rates. That's a relatively small hike for many people ? roughly $18 a month ? though
we'd need to make sure that lower-income families wouldn't be burdened by it. Europe, with its abundant

 





sources of renewables, is in a similar position.


Unfortunately, many countries don't have as much wind and sunlight as the US and Europe do. In those
places, the Green Premiums on electricity will be quite a bit higher, and they'll need innovation to close the
gap. In fact, the relatively low Green Premiums for electricity in the US and Europe are the except- ion, not
the rule. For a large majority of activities that cause emissions ? everything from making cement and steel to
Ô¨Çying jetliners ? we don't have clean options that are remotely as cheap as their conventional counterparts.

For example, cargo ships run on a fuel that costs about $1.29 per gallon in the US. The clean versions of this
fuel cost from $5.50 to $9.05 per gallon, depending on how they're made ? an increase of 300 to 600 per
cent. No shipping line is going to voluntarily increase its fuel costs by such a huge margin.

Why are most of the Green Premiums so high? Because green products face stiff competition from their
polluting counterparts. Fossil fuels are readily building the infrastructure to extract, process and move them
around the world. In addition, their prices don't reÔ¨Çect the damage they do to people or the environment.
And they do their job very effectively ? a single litre of petrol contains as much energy as 34 sticks of
dynamite. Virtually all the clean alternatives are less powerful.

This is why we need energy innov- ation. Clean tech has to be so cheap that everyone adopts it.

It   is   hard   to   overstate   the   magnitude   of   this   challenge.   Energy   is   a   $5tn-a-year   business,   and   it   is   not
accustomed to rapid change. It will take time to achieve the scale of change we need, so we should get to
work now on creating the policies, technologies and market structures that will make it possible.

The good news is that there is growing interest among the groups best suited to drive this change ?
corporations and governments. The bad news is that right now we don't have the economic structures to
allow them to have an impact, and so they often do things that may look good on paper but don't actually
help solve the problem.

Planting trees, for instance. It sounds like a simple Ô¨Åx and it has obvious appeal for all of us who love trees ?
but its impact on climate change is overblown. Although trees absorb some carbon, they can never take in
enough   to   offset   the   damage   from   our   modern   lifestyle.   To   absorb   the   lifetime   emissions   that   will   be
produced by every American alive today ? just 4 per cent of the global population ? you'd need to plant and
permanently maintain trees on more than 16bn acres, roughly half the landmass of the world.

Yet if you're a business leader looking to do something about climate change, planting trees looks like an
attractive Continued on page 2

Continued from page 1 option. That's not a failure on your part ? it just means the world hasn't given you a
way to do something that has more impact.

So what can you do that will have impact? There are four areas where companies can make a practical
difference. Not all of them will apply to every business, but there is something on this list for most of them.

The Ô¨Årst area involves mobilising capital to reduce the Green Premiums. For some products ? like wind, solar
and electric cars ? the Green Premiums are already low, but will go down even further if more companies
buy them. In other cases, such as low-carbon steel and fuels for shipping and aviation, the Green Premiums
are prohibitively high. These are the sectors where we need to invest the most money and effort.

In practice, this means companies need to be willing to Ô¨Ånance innovative low-carbon solutions where the
Green Premiums are highest. Investors, for instance, can lower the cost of capital for these technologies and
make Ô¨Ånancing easier for them as they get to large-scale demonstration projects.

In some cases, investors may need to accept lower returns too. This is inherently risky ? I've already lost more
money on battery companies than I ever thought I would. But pooling resources and investing together
instead of individually will lower the risk for any single investor. By providing low-cost capital and other
Ô¨Ånancial   concessions   along   multiple   stages   of   a   technology's   deve-   lopment,   you   can   help   promising
innovators navigate the obstacles that keep them from getting their ideas out of the lab and into the market.
You can also mentor clean energy entrepreneurs, sponsor pilot projects and put money into innovative funds
that prioritise climate impact.

The second way your company can have an impact is through the products it buys. If your company runs a
Ô¨Çeet of vans, for example, you can commit to buying electric vehicles. You'll not only meaningfully reduce
your company's emissions, you'll also send a signal to auto manufacturers that there's a growing market for

 





electric vehicles, which will in turn drive competition and push prices down. Procurement is a powerful tool
to start building markets for other products too, such as hydrogen fuels and greener alternatives to steel and
cement.


Another example of using procurement to drive down Green Premiums involves the airline industry. Your
company can offset the emissions from employees' travel by buying sustainable aviation fuel for the miles
they Ô¨Çy. That creates demand for clean fuels, attracting more innovation in that area, and it makes travel-
related emissions a factor in your company's business decisions. Microsoft and Alaska Airlines signed a deal
like this for certain routes last year. Other businesses are putting a price on the carbon emitted by all their
divisions, forcing each team to consider its emissions. Swiss Re recently imposed a cost of $100 per tonne
emitted by each of its divisions.

There are many other examples of companies making a measurable difference by paying for early-stage
techno- logies that reduce or offset emissions. Some, including Stripe, are supporting carbon capture, a
promising technology that needs investment to scale up. Through the Hybrit project, some steel companies
are   integrating   clean   hydrogen   into   their   production   methods.   And   utility   companies   are   buying   long-
duration storage solutions for clean electricity, as Great River Energy recently did with Form Energy.

The   third  area   is  expanding   research  and  development.   Consider   Impossible   Foods,   one   of  the   leading
producers of plant-based meat, in which I was an early investor. (Cattle are a major producer of methane, a
greenhouse gas.) In 2020, Impossible announced plans to double the size of its R&D team with a goal of
reducing the price of its burgers and expanding market share. Last March, its products were available in just
150 grocery stores. Today they're available in more than 15,000.

The Ô¨Ånal way you can help drive down the Green Premiums is to help shape public policies. You can make it
clear that governments need to invest in public R&D for clean energy, and call on ofÔ¨Åcials to give the private
sector incentives to innovate in this area and to help clean energy compete by putting a price on carbon or
setting minimum requirements for the use of clean energy.

Working in these four areas will not always be comfortable. If your bank loans money to a company that goes
under, your bottom line will take a hit. If you assign your best researchers to a clean-energy project, they
might end up going down a dead end. Time spent talking to a politician about climate policy is time you
could spend discussing your core business instead.

But these are the short-term costs required of every business leader who wants to do more than pay lip-
service to climate change. It takes courage for CEOs to bear these costs ? and patience for board members
and investors to reward them for it. Yet in the long run, these risky steps will be good for business. The Green
Premiums will come down, and consumers will remember which companies were serious about helping
avoid a climate disaster. Of course, governments have to play an essential role too. Like the business leaders
who are taking this seriously, policymakers need to factor climate change into many of the decisions they
make. For example, they need to dramatically increase funding for clean energy research and development ?
in the US, a Ô¨Åvefold increase would put energy on par with federal health research. That level of funding
would demonstrate that governments are committed to solving the toughest climate problems.

They   should   also   use   their   procurement   power   to   drive   up   demand   for   lowand   zero-carbon   products.
Governments   buy   huge   numbers   of   products,   from   ofÔ¨Åce   supplies   to   airplanes,   and   are   especially   big
customers   in   many   of   the   sectors   that   are   hardest   to   decarbonise,   such   as   cement   and   steel.   Major
commitments to buy green will send a clear market signal that there's demand for these products.

Governments should also eliminate unproductive policies that prevent new technologies from emerging.
And   they   should   level   the   playing   Ô¨Åeld   for   clean   technology   by   adopting   policies   such   as   clean   fuel
standards, expanding tax credits for the technologies we need to develop, and raising the cost of emitting
greenhouse gases through a price on carbon.

Finally, those of us who can make big individual commitments also have a responsibility to step up. As
someone who has a large carbon footprint, I wanted to Ô¨Ånd the most effective way to address my family's
emissions. I'm buying enough clean aviation fuel to offset emissions from any Ô¨Çights my family and I may
take. I'm also buying offsets through a direct air-capture company and supporting a non-proÔ¨Åt that installs
clean-energy upgrades in low-income housing in Chicago.

Although I think this approach is effective, it's far too expensive to be scalable. (Most offset programmes cost
about $10 for each ton of carbon averted. I'm paying about $400 per ton.) We need programmes that allow
lots of people to contribute ? which will drive down the per-ton cost ? and direct their resources toward

 





funding the breakthroughs that will have the most impact. I'm working with partners on creating such a
programme.


In my experience, it's rare to have a cause in which the entire world wants to participate. I'm used to working
in global health, where rich-world governments and companies occasionally need to be reminded why they
should care.

Not so with climate change. People around the world from all walks of life want to do something meaningful
about it. Now, after years of uncertainty, we are Ô¨Ånally seeing what meaningful action looks like for business
leaders. It is having the courage to take risks.

'How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need' is published by

Federal Reserve zeroes in on climate risk

Billy Nauman and Kristen Talman

Good morning from New York. It has been a relatively quiet week around the (virtual) ofÔ¨Åce because many of
our colleagues have been on holiday with local schools closed for winter break. But the world of sustainable
Ô¨Ånance stops for no one. And we are here on duty bringing you the latest, including an important update
from the Federal Reserve on climate change, a look at what's next for the UK activists at Extinction Rebellion,
an examination of cryptocurrencies' ESG failings and some news on a couple of huge, new sustainability-
linked loans.

Fed's Brainard backs mandatory climate disclosure

A lot has changed in the month since Donald Trump left ofÔ¨Åce and Joe Biden took over as US president. This
is perhaps most evident in the Federal Reserve's approach to climate change.

After years of silence on the topic, the Fed has started to put climate issues centre stage. Shortly after Biden
won the election, the central bank highlighted climate change as a threat to Ô¨Ånancial stability and moved to
join the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of central banks dedicated to supporting
the goals of the Paris climate accord.

Now with Trump out of ofÔ¨Åce and the Biden administration pushing hard to make up lost ground in the
climate Ô¨Åght, Fed ofÔ¨Åcials are speaking out more explicitly about climate risk and how they intend to take
action.

""Financial institutions that do not put in place frameworks to measure, monitor, and manage climate-related
risks could face outsized losses on climate-sensitive assets caused by environmental shifts, by a disorderly
transition to a low-carbon economy, or by a combination of both,"" said Federal Reserve governor Lael
Brainard, at the Institute of International Finance's inaugural climate Ô¨Ånance summit yesterday.

This might sound underwhelming to our European readers, but for the central bank of a country that has
been led for the past four years by a man who claimed climate change was a Chinese hoax, it represents
major progress.

The change in tone is not just coming from the Fed, either. John Coates , the newly appointed acting
director of corporation Ô¨Ånance at the Securities and Exchange Commission, also spoke at the IIF event and
made it clear that climate denialism is not on the agency's agenda.

""Personally I'm going to do my part to help the SEC policy keep pace with developments that are affecting
investors and public companies and capital markets . . . And in case anybody had any doubts [that] means
respecting science and evidence and reality,"" he said.

And Rostin Behnam , acting chairman of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), said he
was looking to ""narrow the focus on what the CFTC can do"" to support carbon markets and the transition to
a low-carbon economy.

The Ô¨Ånancial sector is also signalling it is on board. The IIF, which represents more than 450 global Ô¨Ånancial
services institutions, joined up with 10 other Ô¨Ånancial industry trade groups to publish a framework for how it
believes the US transition to a low-carbon economy should take shape.

A signiÔ¨Åcant issue highlighted by all of these parties is the lack of consistent data, and the Fed's Brainard
indicated that the US should consider making climate disclosures mandatory for companies.

""Current voluntary disclosure practices are an important Ô¨Årst step, but they are prone to variable quality,
incompleteness, and a lack of actionable data,"" she added. ""Ultimately, moving towards standardised, reliable
and mandatory disclosures could provide better access to the data required to appropriately manage risks.""



There will be a lot of political hurdles to clear if US policymakers are to try to implement something like the
EU's  green  taxonomy,   or   New  Zealand's  mandatory   Task   Force   on   Climate-related   Financial   Disclosures

 



(TCFD) reporting requirements.


But Brainard's comments are a strong indicator of the way the wind is blowing, and that should catch the
attention of every executive in the country.

Even   without   mandatory   disclosure   requirements,   there   are   still   ways   regulators   can   help   Ô¨Åx   the   data
problem.

With   a   growing   number   of   institutional   investors   demanding   ESG   information   from   companies,   these
disclosures are becoming mandatory by default, the SEC's Coates said. And when companies ""volunteer"" this
information, they are legally obliged to tell the truth, which gives regulators an opening to get involved.

""If   companies   are   making   voluntary   disclosures,   for   example   in   sustainability   reports   .   .   .   they   can't   be
misleading the market in a material way, even in those non SEC-Ô¨Åled documents,"" Coates said. ""And I worry
sometimes   that   the   people   involved   in   the   production   and   consumption   of   those   documents   don't
remember that.""

We're willing to bet it will be easier for companies to remember that obligation after being hit with their Ô¨Årst
climate disclosure-related lawsuit. And we will be anxiously watching to see how the US regulators take
action. (Billy Nauman)

Sustainability-linked loan market soars with AB InBev, Carlyle deals

All the talk out of Washington and the IIF is just one sign of the growing prominence of sustainable Ô¨Ånance -
there were also some pretty substantial deals struck this week.

Anheuser-Busch   InBev,   the   maker   of   Budweiser   and   Stella   Artois,   yesterday   inked   the   largest-ever
sustainability-linked loan - a $10.1bn revolving line of credit that will be more expensive if the brewer fails to
meet a set of ESG goals linked to water use, plastic recycling, clean energy and emissions reductions.

Private equity company Carlyle this week also announced a $4.1bn loan with terms tied to diversity and
inclusion. It will receive a discount on borrowing costs if it hits its goal of having women and minorities make
up at least 30 per cent of the board members of the companies it controls.

These   deals   represent   a   major   surge   in   sustainable   lending.   As   of   January   31,   only   $8.6bn   worth   of
sustainability-linked loans had hit the market this year, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.

It is noteworthy that both of these loans are replacing existing lines of credit, and both are tied to ESG goals
already set by the companies. In theory, this shows how banks (most of which have set ESG goals of their
own)   can   promote   wider   responsible   business   practices   through   their   lending   operations,   and   how
companies can use sustainable Ô¨Ånance to make sure they stay on track with their sustainability goals.

Proponents   of   sustainability-linked   bonds   and   loans   also   point   out   that   these   instruments   have   an
advantage over green bonds and loans (which companies use to fund speciÔ¨Åc environmentally oriented
projects) because they incentivise company-wide ESG improvements.

But for any of this to work, the goals being set need to be ambitious, and the carrots and sticks that come
with these loans need to be substantial. Otherwise, the potential for greenwashing (or ESG-washing) is a
problem.

Neither AB InBev nor Carlyle would provide speciÔ¨Åcs on just how much of a penalty they would face if they
did not hit their goals. Both companies assured Moral Money that the incentives were meaningful, but
without more information, it is impossible to judge from the outside.

As more of these deals roll in, it is clear why data and transparency are top priorities in the ESG world. (Billy

These climate activists want you to dish dirt on your company

This month, some FT Weekend readers in the London area received an unauthorised insert in their February
6-7 edition of How To Spend It. In it, was a call to ""whistleblow for the planet"".

Behind the insert was Extinction Rebellion, or XR for short - an activist group pushing for climate action from
governing bodies and companies. The group solicited FT readers to out corporate climate misdeeds on its
new platform, TruthTeller.Life.



 



The move is part of XR's plan to get back on its feet this year after its Covid-19 ""hibernation"", which made it
difÔ¨Åcult to organise and raise funds. The environmentalist group struggled to gain traction amid 2020's
competing crises of climate change, the pandemic and wider racial injustice - all while it battled leadership
conÔ¨Çicts within its ranks.


Now the group is targeting potential whistleblowers as a core part of its new strategy as it works to redeÔ¨Åne
activism in the Covid-19 era. In addition to targeting FT readers, XR is also using LinkedIn ads calling on
workers at companies such as Shell, Exxon, HSBC and HS2 to share ""what they know"".

But in an age of high unemployment, leaning on employees to be the curtain-revealing stakeholders might
be a bold move.

If you received a copy of ""How to Save It"" or have been targeted with XR's LinkedIn ads, we would love to hear
your   thoughts.   As   always,   email   us   at   moralmoneyreply@ft.com   ().  (Kristen

Cryptos' ESG problems go far beyond climate

Last week we wrote about Tesla's big bitcoin purchase and asked whether or not it had diminished the
electric car company's green credentials. Cryptocurrency mining, of course, consumes a lot of energy and
scientists have estimated the emissions tied to the industry rival those of nations such as Sri Lanka.

But greenhouse gas emissions are only one of cryptos' ESG issues. As Martin CW Walker , director of banking
and Ô¨Ånance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, wrote in a piece published by the London
School of Economics, cryptocurrency also has big problems with ""S"" and ""G"".

On the social side, Walker concedes that crypto may have some privacy beneÔ¨Åts, but he claims those are far
outweighed by the fact that cryptocurrencies ""facilitate criminal activity including tax evasion and evasion of
exchange controls"".

He   also   dismisses   arguments   that   crypto   promotes   Ô¨Ånancial   inclusion   and   highlights   the   consumer
protection problems created by those who manipulate crypto prices by publishing ""demonstrably false""
information that would be ""illegal if provided by those offering other classes of assets for investments"".

As fund managers promoting ESG start dipping their toes into the crypto market, it will be interesting to see
how   their   clients   and   sustainability   advocates   react.   As   Walker   sees   it,   the   issue   is   cut   and   dried:   ""Any
mainstream fund manager or pension fund seeking to place a portion of their portfolio in crypto risks
severely undermining their ESG credentials."" ( Billy Nauman )

Chart of the day

The push to increase renewable energy in the US is not just about switching away from fossil fuels. There is
also a need to upgrade the infrastructure to make sure that the green power that is being generated can get
where it needs to go. And that is sparking a Ô¨Åght as people object to ""stringing the land with ugly wires"" and
""hefty corporate rivals"" aim to prevent green power companies from seizing market share.

FT-2021-81.txt," Financial Times (web site) Tuesday, November 23, 2021 - 14:54Z 1052 mots  Dancing on the edge of climate disaster Martin Wolf  How are we to assess the outcome of COP26 in Glasgow? It would be reasonable to conclude that it was both triumph and disaster - triumph, in that some notable steps forward have been taken, and disaster, in that they fall far short of what is needed. It remains very doubtful whether our divided world can muster the will to tackle this challenge in the time left before the damage becomes unmanageable.  Climate Action Tracker has provided a helpful summary of where we are: on current policies and actions, the world is set for a median increase in temperature of 2.7C above pre-industrial levels; with the targets for 2030 alone, this would fall to 2.4C; Full implementation of all submitted and binding targets would deliver 2.1C; and, finally, implementation of all announced targets would deliver 1.8C. Thus, if the world delivered everything it now indicates we would be close to the recommended ceiling of a rise of 1.5C. (See charts.)  Scepticism is fully justified. According to Climate Action Tracker, only the EU, UK, Chile and Costa Rica now have adequately designed net zero targets. Announced improvements in nationally determined contributions (NDCs) since September 2020 will lower the shortfall in the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases required by 2030 by just 15-17 per cent. More than half of this reduction in NDCs comes from the US, whose future policies are, to put it mildly, uncertain. New sectoral initiatives will lower 2020's shortfall in the reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2030 by 24-25 per cent. Announced reductions in methane emissions and deforestation would be particularly significant, if delivered. But the reduction in deforestation is doubtful. In any case, the shortfall stays large.  Nevertheless, the picture is not entirely bleak. Net zero commitments now cover 80 per cent of total emissions. The 1.5C ceiling is also a clear consensus. Another good signal is a joint declaration between the US and China, since nothing can be achieved without these two countries. The final declaration also includes a commitment to ""accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"". This is far too little. But it is a first in climate agreements.  Yet, if the world is to make the recommended reductions in emissions by 2030, much more needs to happen. One possibility is new commitments in the follow-up COP, which will be in Egypt next year. This is to be the first of a series of annual high-level meetings in which countries will be asked to improve their promises.  Another possibility is a more active private sector. On this, the main news is the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). According to Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England, its aim is to ""build a financial system in which every decision made takes climate change into account"".  GFANZ consists of the world's leading asset managers and banks, with total assets under management of $130tn. In principle, the allocation of such resources towards the net zero objectives would make a huge difference. But, Carney notes, $100tn is the ""minimum amount of external finance needed for the sustainable energy drive over the next three decades"". This is daunting.  Needless to say, while it is possible to prevent businesses from doing profitable things, it is impossible to make them do things they consider insufficiently profitable, after adjusting for risk. If they are to invest at the necessary scale, there must be carbon pricing, elimination of subsidies to fossil fuels, bans on internal combustion engines and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. But there must also be some way of getting vast amounts of private investment into the climate transition in emerging and developing countries, apart from China.  GFANZ calls for the creation of ""country platforms"", which would convene and align ""stakeholders - including national and international governments, businesses, NGOs, civil society organisations, donors and other development actors - . . . to agree on and co-ordinate priorities"". A big and controversial issue will be risk-sharing. The public sector should not take all the risks and the private sector all the rewards from the energy transition.  Much attention is devoted to the failure of developed countries to deliver the promised $100bn a year in finance to emerging and developing countries. This is symbolically important. But, as Amar Bhattacharya and Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics note, it is small change: ""Altogether, emerging markets and developing countries other than China will need to invest around an additional $0.8tn per year by 2025 and close to $2tn per year by 2030"" on climate mitigation and adaptation and restoring natural capital. About half of this must come from abroad, mainly from private sources.  Yet the official sector, too, must do more. In this context, it is a real pity that greater advantage is not being taken of the recent issuance of special drawing rights. Of the total allocation of $650bn, some 60 per cent will go to high-income countries that do not need it and a mere 3 per cent to low-income countries. It is planned to on-lend $100bn of this from high-income to developing countries. This should be far more, in order to help deal with the legacy of Covid and the climate challenge.  In sum, if we compare the global discussion today with that of a decade ago, we have come a long way. But if we compare it with where we need to be, there is still a frighteningly long way to go. It is too soon to abandon hope. But to be complacent would be absurd. We need to act powerfully, credibly and quickly and, not least, we must agree to do so together. The task is great and the hour late. We can no longer sit and wait. "
FT-2021-82.txt," Financial Times Features, Tuesday, November 23, 2021 582 mots, p. 2  Eurozone lenders told to improve climate change risk plans  European Central Bank LAURA NOONAN ‚Äî LONDON  The European Central Bank has asked banks to ""urgently"" improve plans to protect their businesses from climate change risk after a review found widespread shortcomings in lenders' approach to environmental challenges. The ECB, which has directly supervised the biggest banks across the eurozone for seven years, has completed its first assessment of banks' preparedness to deal with increased climate and environmental risks. It found that no bank under its watch was close to meeting the ECB's expectations.  The central bank said lenders might ""eventually"" face higher capital demands as it integrated climate risk assessments with its regular work on setting individual banks' capital levels.  The biggest risks to banks comes from exposure to energy companies that do not pivot to more sustainable activities and energy-intensive sectors such as aviation, according to the assessment. Other risks include lending on buildings which are less energy efficient and therefore may have a lower resale value.  Although banks such as HSBC and  Bank of America have introduced their own net zero targets, scrutiny has increased in recent years of the sector's lending to carbon-intensive activities.  The ECB's study focused on 112 banks with combined assets of ‚Ç¨24tn. Half of those lenders said climate change would have a ""material"" impact on their businesses over the next three to five years. None of the banks that reported climate risks as ""immaterial"" had carried out sufficient analysis, wrote Frank Elderson, ECB executive board member and vice-chair of the ECB's supervisory board, in a blog post.  Other shortcomings highlighted by the ECB included a lack of stress testing to see what would happen to banks' businesses in various climate change scenarios, and poor planning for how they should make their business models more resilient in the face of climate change. The banks with the biggest shortcomings have been urged to fix them as part of the ECB's regular supervision.  ""Banks urgently need to set ambitious and concrete goals and timelines, including measurable intermediate milestones, to mitigate their exposure to current and future climate and environmental risks,"" Elderson wrote.  Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Denmark's largest pension fund PFA and a prominent environmental, social and governance investor, said he did not expect banks to make ""major improvements"" in their climate risk management strategies ""before they have seen financial losses [from lending to unsustainable industries]"".  He added: ""Banks are mirroring the real economy; the real economy is not sustainable so the way banks operate is not sustainable.""  The ECB did find some bright spots. Elderson said two-thirds of banks had made ""meaningful progress"" in factoring climate risk into their lending decisions, by carrying out extra due diligence on borrowers' climate risks or phasing out lending to some of the most exposed industries.  The ECB will publish a report on banks' climate risk disclosures in the first quarter of 2022 and is planning a broader review on banks' strategy, governance and risk management around climate change risk in the first half of next year.  The review will only announce results for the financial system, not for individual lenders.  In the UK, banks last month submitted data for the Bank of England's first climate ""stress tests"", which the BoE described as ""exploratory in nature"", with no bearing on capital requirements. Results, which will be presented as aggregate findings for the UK banking system, are scheduled to be published by May.  "
FT-2021-83.txt," Financial Times News, Monday, November 22, 2021 899 mots, p. 4  Polluters row back on emission targets upgrade  Environment. COP26 fallout US and Australia have called into question need to raise their climate ambitions LESLIE HOOK ‚Äî LONDON BENJAMIN PARKIN ‚Äî MUMBAI  Big polluting nations have cast doubt on whether they will upgrade their emissions targets next year, after agreeing at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow to ""revisit and strengthen"" them in line with the Paris accord.  The text agreed after marathon twoweek talks committed signatories to new greenhouse gas emissions targets by the end of 2022, three years earlier than originally agreed, to meet the goals of the climate deal signed in the French capital in 2015. Retaining the commitment in the face of opposition from countries such as China was billed as a key success of COP26.  But the US and Australia have already questioned whether they needed to upgrade targets known as ""nationally determined contributions"" or NDCs.  ""On NDCs, this COP has not seen what it should have,"" said Laurence Tubiana, head of the European Climate Foundation, and a key architect of the Paris deal. ""That's why it's really important that this meeting was finally able to obtain agreement to revisit them next year.""  With the world far off track from the Paris goals, the Glasgow pact sealed last weekend aims to encourage countries to improve their targets to limit warming to well below 2C, ideally to 1.5C. Existing 2030 emissions targets put the world on course for between 2.5C and 2.7C of warming by the end of the century.  But the ink was hardly dry in Glasgow when John Kerry, US climate envoy, left significant room for manoeuvre on whether the US would upgrade its NDC next year. Australia, which was criticised at COP26 for lacking a credible plan to reach ""net zero"" emissions, has said it will not update its target.  ""Not necessarily,"" Kerry said when asked about a new pledge. ""You don't automatically have to come back with a new NDC, you have to review it, and make a judgment,"" he said. ""We need to see what's do-able.""  Because the COP process has no formal enforcement mechanism ‚Äî and no punishment for countries that miss their targets ‚Äî its primary power lies in peer pressure and public scrutiny.  The COP26 deal also committed rich countries to double their levels of finance for climate adaptation, such as infrastructure to adapt to a warmer planet. They provided about $19bn in adaptation finance in 2019, which could rise to $40bn under the agreement.  However, for many of the countries that are most vulnerable to climate change, this does not go far enough. As the dust settled on COP26, Bangladesh accused rich countries of ""failing"" atrisk nations by not providing the necessary funding and technology transfers needed to combat climate change.  ""What we're seeing now from different developed countries, they're failing one after another on their commitments. This is very upsetting,"" said Zunaid Ahmed Palak, Bangladesh's information minister. Bangladesh chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum, which represents developing countries most at risk from climate change. The low-lying country is struggling with rising sea levels and a more erratic monsoon rain season, leaving tens of millions of its citizens at risk of displacement.  Palak said that COP26 did represent some improvement from previous years, particularly pledges of further negotiations and co-operation from the UK, US and Europe. ""We're not satisfied with the result of COP26 but the good thing is there are some hopes and positive assurances we got from different influential politicians.""  Scientists say COP26 did help lower the projected levels of global warming ‚Äî but still far from what is needed to limit warming to 1.5C. However, Johan Rockstrom, joint director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said he ""cannot celebrate despite significant progress, because the room for manoeuvre is so limited"".  ""If this was a COP meeting 20 years ago, I would have declared it a huge success because we'd have had time to get the laggards on board ... But now we've run out of time. We have only 10 years to cut global emission in half to have a chance to deliver 1.5,"" he said.  Under the Glasgow deal, the UN will conduct an annual analysis of emissions targets, and report next year about a new work programme to scale up emissions cuts. Negotiators say that the Glasgow pact would lay the groundwork for incremental improvements in the emissions targets, such as for countries to make ""add-ons"" to their existing emissions targets.  The pact is much more pointed, when it comes to countries that have not submitted a new emissions target at all, who are ""urged"" to do so ahead of COP27 next year.  Although India announced on the opening day of COP26 a target for net zero emissions by 2070, it has not yet submitted a new emissions target.  Another area of concern at COP26 is that several countries submitted new NDCs that were actually worse ‚Äî in terms of climate impact ‚Äî than their previous NDCs. These include Brazil, Australia, Ethiopia and Mexico.  'We've run out of time. We have only 10 years to cut global emission in half to have a chance to deliver 1.5C' "
FT-2021-84.txt," Friday, November 19, 2021 - 12:01Z 1073 mots  A small but mighty change to force US corporate climate reform Gillian Tett, Patrick Temple-West, Kristen Talman, Simon Mundy  Greetings from New York, where investors and policymakers are assessing the fallout from the COP26 meeting in Glasgow. It is clear that pressure on companies is rising: as we note below, one development that was overshadowed during the UN climate summit is an important shift in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules about shareholder activism. Another arena to watch is reporting and audit, as C-suites face growing demands to disclose ""scope three"" data - and parse the forthcoming International Sustainability Standards Board measures (I like to pronounce as ""Izzb-y"", not ISSB, to make it sound less dreadful).  Meanwhile, the IMF hosted a virtual forum this week on how to factor climate issues into economic data and public sector accounts. The IMF is responding to this by launching innovations such as a ""climate dashboard"". But Mia Mottley, prime minister of Barbados, called for a complete overhaul of the metrics used by international investors, in the face of the climate crisis.  ""It is nonsense to be using gross domestic product per capita . . . the statistics need to be completely remade,"" she told me in one panel that I moderated. Or as James Stock, Harvard professor, said: ""GDP has been useful, but it's limited. Since we tend to measure what we can manage . . . we need to rethink."" Do you agree? Let the Moral Money team know; perhaps after you have digested our story about how investors seem to be cooling on oat milk. ( Gillian Tett)  US financial regulator accelerates corporate climate reforms  After scoring mixed reviews for its COP26 performance, the US is under pressure to advance strong climate policies. Climate legislation in Congress is fraught with political peril, and the SEC's climate disclosure rules for companies are not expected to debut until early 2022.  But the agency has made one subtle change to force corporate changes.  Overshadowed by the news from Glasgow, the SEC during COP handed a win to environmentalists by saying certain climate change shareholder proposals should go to a vote at companies' annual general meetings.  Companies were outraged by the SEC's change. ""We call on the SEC to immediately reverse this decision,"" the US Chamber of Commerce said.  But some individual companies already appear to be grudgingly adjusting to the shifting zeitgeist.  This week, Costco, a wholesaler, dropped its fight against a shareholder petition calling on the company to adopt targets to cut carbon emissions. The petition will go to a vote at Costco's annual meeting in January, and comes as large asset managers - BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street - are supporting more environmental shareholder proposals.  The Costco petition ""will be the first of many opportunities for investors to vote on proposals directly requesting these ambitious [emissions] targets"", said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, which filed the petition.  Lawyers who followed the SEC's rule change quietly acknowledged that companies were more likely to negotiate and settle with environmentalists rather than face a shareholder vote, which could go badly for the firm. This leverage will allow environmentalists to ask companies for more climate specifics than they could have in the past.  While final SEC rules for climate disclosures are a long way off, the agency's tweaks on the margins can have a much faster - and meaningful - impact for companies going into 2022. (Patrick Temple-West)  Investors turn jittery over spilt (oat) milk  Oat milk and plant-based burgers have not been sitting well with investors recently. Once high-flying stocks selling alternative foods - as well as sustainability - Oatly and Beyond Meat saw their shares tank on weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings reports.  Oatly shares fell 20 per cent on Monday following an underwhelming earnings report. This month, Beyond Meat's shares tumbled 13 per cent after it forecast net revenues in the range of $85m to $110m in the current quarter, significantly lower than analysts' projections. The changes in fourth-quarter forecasts follow an already financially shaky third quarter.  Both companies pinned shortcomings on production and supply chain disruptions. However, other food companies have not suffered such a stark investor drubbing, and plant-based meat alternatives surged at the beginning of the pandemic. So, if nothing else, the developments are likely to fuel debate about whether green fashions are creating market froth - and whether such bubbles might burst.  Bank of America said that while it ""still believes in the viability of oat milk as a disrupter"", it expected Oatly to struggle with a broader expansion as US demand ""has continued to slow for plant-based protein"". And consumers will soon have to swallow higher prices; the Swedish producer is expected to pass the increased cost of ingredients, packaging and shipping on to its customers in most markets. Investors are not likely to stomach this change well either.  The long-term outlook for alternative protein, however, seems more promising. BCG found that the alternative protein market could account for as much as 22 per cent of the overall market by 2035, but the success would hinge on the introduction of carbon taxes (alternative proteins emit less carbon than animal-based protein) and improvement in texture and taste.  Right now, however, the stock market swings at Oatly and Beyond Meat are a reminder that a strong environmental mission is not enough to appease investors. (Kristen Talman)  Smart reads  When it comes to business and climate risk, it's good to focus on transparency - but not too much, argue Nadia Ameli and two fellow academics at University College London. Writing in our sister publication Sustainable Views, they argue that transparency on climate risk is far from enough to drive investment on to a more sustainable path. ""Mark Carney isn't alone in expecting disclosures to move investors away from carbon-intensive assets,"" they write. ""But the idea that they can effectively shift capital has serious flaws.""  A similarly iconoclastic message comes from the Columbia University history professor Adam Tooze, who took aim this week at ""blended finance"". Increasingly in vogue as a means of mobilising climate-related investment into developing nations, this involves public or multilateral institutions providing funding alongside private-sector entities. The approach, popular among the likes of BlackRock chief Larry Fink, ""is the logic of the 2008 bank bailouts expanded to the global level - socialise the risks, privatise the profits"", Tooze writes in The Guardian.

FT-2021-86.txt," News, Thursday, November 18, 2021 961 mots, p. 10  Delivering Healthcare  The climate crisis is also a health crisis  OPINION Andy Haines  T he warning could not be starker. ""The science is unequivocal,"" wrote the editors of over 200 international health journals in a simultaneously published call to action in September. ""A global increase of 1.5C above the pre-industrial average and the continued loss of biodiversity risk catastrophic harm to health that will be impossible to reverse.""  Preventing such a calamity is a task not only for the politicians who gathered in Glasgow for the UN's COP26 climate change conference, but also for the world's healthcare providers. It is they who are already having to deal with the immediate effects of climate change on human bodies and minds. But they must also recognise that they, too, have contributed to the problem ‚Äî because healthcare systems are significant carbon emitters.  Climate change threatens health along multiple fronts. Heat is the most obvious danger: a recent study estimates that over one-third of heatrelated deaths between 1991 and 2018 can be attributed to climate change. By the second half of this century, 1bn people could be living in locations where physical labour is hazardous, even in the shade. Wildfires are increasing in frequency and intensity in some regions, exposing large populations to toxic smoke.  Other risks are less direct. Crop yields could decline on average by 10 per cent or more from the 2050s, threatening food security, while greater concentrations of carbon dioxide could reduce the micronutrient content in crops. Meanwhile, higher temperatures and a greater incidence of flooding will encourage the spread of food- and waterborne infections, and of mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue and West Nile virus.  The World Bank estimates that, in the absence of effective climate action, more than 100m people could be forced back into poverty by 2030. Hunger could spur migration and conflict. And the toll will not only be physical: research published last year indicates that common mental disorders may persist for long periods following droughts, floods and wildfires.  Adaptation strategies offer some hope. The heat warning systems that some countries have adopted save lives while, in the Caribbean, climate- informed epidemic forecasting promises to protect people from dengue.  But health policymakers should beware of unintended consequences: increased use of air conditioning, for example, could overload electricity grids and add to greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution.  What is needed, above all, is greater effort to meet the Paris climate accord target of keeping the global average temperature increase to well below 2C ‚Äî and preferably less than 1.5C ‚Äî above pre-industrial levels. Current progress is seriously inadequate, yet the value of the health benefits alone could substantially offset the costs of mitigation. Faster replacement of fossil fuels by clean renewable energy, for example, could prevent about 3.6m premature deaths annually caused by outdoor air pollution.  Or consider the food system, which currently contributes about 30 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. The health and climate benefits of reducing red meat intake in high-consuming countries and increasing the consumption of fruit and vegetables are clear.  The EAT-Lancet Commission, a group of scientists whose report on sustainable eating came out in 2019, suggested that 10m-11m premature deaths a year could be prevented by mid-century with a switch to a predominantly plant-based ""planetary health"" diet.  Retrofitting houses with better insulation, draught-proofing and, where necessary, improved ventilation to reduce the build-up of household air pollutants could also reduce emissions and improve health.  Promoting public transport, walking and cycling can yield significant benefits through increased physical activity. Greater provision of green spaces in cities benefits physical and mental health.  Health professionals are already lobbying for progress in these areas: last year over 350 health organisations worldwide wrote to leaders of the G20 nations to urge them to put the environment at the centre of efforts to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.  Yet they also need to get their own houses in order. Research published by pressure group Health Care Without Harm in 2019 showed that the sector accounts for about 4.4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äî which, if it were a country, would make it the world's fifth-biggest emitter. Healthcare also inflicts other types of environmental damage, such as plastic pollution, a problem exacerbated by the pandemic.  NHS England has committed to net zero direct carbon emissions by 2040 ‚Äî through measures such as electrifying its fleet of vehicles ‚Äî and by 2045 for indirect emissions. It is already starting to work with suppliers to incentivise decarbonisation of their products.  All sorts of interventions can make a difference. Doctors can prescribe powder inhalers for asthma rather than those containing climate-active propellants, and avoid anaesthetic agents with big climate footprints such as desflurane. The Aga Khan Development Network has been building energy-efficient health facilities in low- and middle-income countries. Even before Covid lockdowns necessitated consultations via Zoom, research showed that telemedicine could cut carbon emissions from patient transport, but care must be taken not to increase inequities in access.  Amid the horse-trading over emissions reduction targets and financial obligations at COP26, it may be easy to lose sight of climate change's growing toll on human health. The fact is that the health of the planet and of its human population are intimately entwined. In the fight against climate change, health workers are on the front line. Andy Haines is professor of environmental change and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He co-chairs the Academy of Medical Sciences/Royal  Society working group on health and decarbonisation, whose report was published on October 14  A recent study estimates that over a third of heatrelated deaths between 1991 -2018 were due to climate change "
FT-2021-89.txt," Tuesday, November 16, 2021 - 14:18Z 700 mots  Technology will not solve the problem of climate change Julian Allwood  The writer is professor of engineering and the environment at the University of Cambridge  COP26 was a triumph for the high-emitting sectors, but a disastrous failure for the billions of people who will suffer, including from famine and starvation in countries around the equator, as a consequence of global warming.  The climate summit in Glasgow was a failure because it was predicated on the fiction that technology will solve the problem of climate change. Technology will not solve the problem because it cannot be scaled sufficiently in time. But basing the entire meeting on that assumption prevented any discussion of the real solutions which require specific restraints on a number of activities in rich countries and which can scale rapidly.  Every technological solution discussed at COP26 depends on just three resources: nelectricity (non-emitting electricity generated by hydropower, renewables or nuclear fission), carbon capture and storage (CCS) or biomass. The total demand for those resources required by the plans discussed at COP26 cannot be met.  Here are the numbers. Averaged over the world, we currently have 4kWh/day of nelectricity per person, growing at 0.1Wh/day annually. But the COP26 plans require 32 (range 16-48). We currently have 6kg of CCS per person per year, growing at 0.1kg/year annually, but the COP26 plans require 3,600 (range 1,400-5,700). We currently eat 100kg plant-based food per person each year, but producing enough bio-kerosene to fly at today's levels requires 200kg of additional harvest.  In the 28 years we have left to reach net zero emissions, there is no possibility that our supplies of nelectricity, CCS and biomass will scale to anywhere near the levels required by the plans discussed at COP26. And scale is the only thing that matters when we discuss plans for mitigating climate change.  COP26 was a failure because all the discussion was based on an entirely fictional, unrealisable solution to a real, pressing societal catastrophe. As the climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg put it, accurately, in a speech during the summit: ""We don't have a technology solution that will get anywhere even close.""  She later observed at a rally during the gathering in Glasgow that the goal of COP26 was to ""maintain business as usual"". Indeed, this was a great COP for the oil and gas industry, fossil aviation, emitting cement, blast furnace steel, fossil shipping and ruminant farmers. To reach net zero, all of their activities would have to cease completely within 28 years, but no one said so.  Thunberg also noted that ""our leaders are not leading, they are actively creating loopholes while we need immediate, drastic annual cuts"". The only agreements at COP26 were on future targets, with no specific commitments to implementation, yet, according to the UN's report on the ""production gap"", we must cut all emissions by 6 per cent year on year, starting now.  The UK government's leadership, trumpeted in a Net Zero Strategy published before COP26 and based on the loophole word ""ambition"" rather than ""commitment"", is undermined by its continuing support for expanding the fossil sectors, removing air passenger duty, lack of funding and denial about social participation.  No political or business leader at COP26 had climate mitigation as their primary goal. I am sure they and their advisers would respond to my criticisms by saying that they betray a lack of ambition. But it is hardly ambitious if a doctor advises an alcoholic to keep drinking because the government has plans to develop liver-repair technology in future.  One of Thunberg's claims should be nuanced, however. She said that ""we will fundamentally have to change our society"". Certainly we will need specific changes, but we can anticipate about 7kWh-10 kWh per day of nelectricity per person, which is much less than anticipated by the COP plans but still enough to substitute many emitting activities with existing, scalable technologies.  While we must embrace specific restraints on flying, shipping, cement and a few components of our diet, we can continue to enjoy all the things that make life worth living - our families, art, wonder and discovery - on a real and rapid path to net zero emissions.

FT-2021-90.txt," Tuesday, November 16, 2021 - 06:00Z 748 mots  Biden aims to speed up climate policy push after COP26 Leslie Hook in London and Lauren Fedor and Aime Williams in Washington  Joe Biden's administration is preparing to push key climate legislation in Congress as soon as this week, after vowing to speed up US climate policies at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.  The White House still faces an uphill battle in driving through its plans, however, after months of intraparty wrangling among Democrats that has already slimmed down the US president's ambitious climate-related agenda.  Biden on Monday signed into law a $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure bill that included some $100bn of investments into energy, power and water infrastructure, including relatively small investments in electric vehicles.  Attention in Washington is now shifting to a second ""Build Back Better"" bill, which contains much bigger climate provisions: $550bn to tackle climate change, including $320bn of tax credits for individuals and businesses that shift toward clean energy.  The White House had originally intended to pass both pieces of legislation at the same time. But the Build Back Better bill, with a total estimated price tag of about $1.75tn, was held up amid objections from more conservative Democratic lawmakers in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.  Even as the US made a big effort to show ""leadership"" at the COP26 summit, it was often on the defence.  While the US and China were able to make a joint declaration showing the two countries had found common ground on curbing climate change, the subsequent weakening of the agreement on the end of coal power by China and India undermined that effort.  The US delegation in Glasgow also faced awkward questions about how it would be able to implement its climate goals, if the Build Back Better bill does not pass soon. Senior lawmakers in Congress vowed to pass the legislation before the American Thanksgiving holiday later this month. But a handful of key lawmakers, including Democratic senator Joe Manchin, have suggested they are in no rush to do a deal.  Manchin, who represents the coal-dependent US state of West Virginia, has been a driving force behind stripping out many of the Biden administration's most ambitious climate proposals, including measures to allow tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles made by unionised US car plants.  The White House has remained outwardly optimistic. As COP26 concluded - and almost 200 countries agreed on the ""Glasgow Climate Pact"" - US climate envoy John Kerry declared that ""I am confident Congress is going to move on this"", referring to the legislation.  High-profile American appearances at the climate summit included President Biden, the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 10 cabinet members and former US president Barack Obama.  The Biden administration rejoined the 2015 Paris climate accord, which the US left under Donald Trump, and set a goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. But reaching that target will depend on congressional support for its clean energy policies.  In the House, Democrats are waiting on a cost assessment from the independent Congressional Budget Office before holding a vote on the Build Back Better package, which also includes large investments in early childhood education and additional public spending on healthcare for pensioners.  In the Senate, negotiations have been stymied by two moderate senators, Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who have taken issue with several White House proposals.  At the same time, reviews of the US role in the Glasgow Climate Pact were mixed.  Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the 2015 Paris accord, said the US had a ""really central role"" at COP26, particularly the part played by Kerry in shuttling around the globe in the months ahead.  ""The US has played a big role in re-mobilising climate diplomacy in a way that was lacking. And to make up for the lost years [under Trump],"" Tubiana said.  However, Jean Su, senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, a climate legal charity based in Washington, said US rhetoric at the summit was not matched by its actions at home.  ""One of the most disappointing pieces of the US agenda at the COP was their blockage of loss and damage finance for developing countries who have suffered the most, and contributed the least, to climate change,"" she said, referring to funding to help countries recover from disasters related to climate change.  ""What happened at COP26 was woefully insufficient,"" Su added. ""I think the public is really urging the US to take a far more aggressive stance on climate."" "
FT-2021-91.txt," Tuesday, November 16, 2021 - 00:30Z 909 mots  Global climate fight hinges on China's $6.5tn green investments challenge Edward White in Seoul  China needs to unleash $6.5tn in green investments and radically reorganise its economy if the planet is to win the fight against climate change, analysts say.  The warning comes after hopes that governments would commit to bolder decarbonisation targets at COP26 were dashed by India and China watering down pledges to end coal-fired power.  Hours after the Glasgow summit closed on Sunday, environmentalists and economists questioned whether Beijing was committed to such fundamental change.  ""It's just very difficult to break this relationship between energy consumption and GDP growth,"" said Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst at Bernstein in Hong Kong.  The battle against global warming mostly hinges on the efforts of a legion of policymakers in Beijing who have been tasked with weaning the world's biggest polluter off coal.  China, the world's factory, accounts for about 30 per cent of global greenhouse gases with fossil fuels comprising 85 per cent of the country's energy mix.  ""The bottom line is that . . . China is now taking decarbonisation seriously. But it remains to be seen how much stomach the government will have for the likely economic costs,"" Arthur Kroeber and Rosealea Yao, Beijing-based analysts from Gavekal Dragonomics, a consultancy, wrote during COP26.  China's success, they added, would depend on ""very stringent curbs on sectors that have been critical to sustaining China's economic growth over the past decade"".  According to Bernstein calculations, to achieve the 2060 carbon neutrality pledge made by President Xi Jinping, China faces a ""Herculean challenge"": $163bn will have to be spent annually on renewable energy and other decarbonisation technologies.  That figure is close to double the $91bn invested in 2019 and amounts to $6.5tn over four decades. But, Beveridge noted, the estimate might be conservative because it excludes related spending on areas such as electricity grid upgrades.  Xi's absence from Glasgow, coupled with Beijing's decision not to upgrade significantly its commitments from the 2015 Paris accord, rankled many, including Joe Biden, the US president.  While a rare US-China joint declaration to co-operate on climate change marked a thaw in ties between Beijing and Washington, it immediately drew sharp criticism from environmental groups because it lacked concrete commitments to detailed plans.  Li Shuo, a Beijing-based Greenpeace energy expert, said the US-China statement helped settle the mood in the COP conference hall but ""pales before our daunting climate challenge"".  China's U-turn on coal mining and coal-fired production cuts in recent months has stoked criticism of the country. Beijing's reversion to the fossil fuel to counter energy shortages that had crippled factories across the country were a warning of how the Chinese government might respond to the competing interests of economic growth and decarbonisation.  China's climate challenge would be complicated by mass urbanisation, said Priscilla Lu, who leads sustainable investments in Asia for DWS, Deutsche Bank's asset management arm. More than 100m people are forecast to move from rural areas to cities over the next 10 years, adding huge demand to the country's strained energy system.  Two unanswered questions, experts said, were whether China's state lenders could funnel an unparalleled and sustained torrent of cash towards renewable energy, and how Beijing would manage the decline of the sprawling fossil fuels industry.  Despite the scale of the challenge, Lu stressed that the ""consistency of the financing"" being directed by Beijing's state-backed lenders and oil and gas groups towards renewable energy industries was one of the most ""meaningful"" changes taking place.  ""We should give credit to China for its continued commitment to the original [climate] targets and, as importantly, by its implementation and actions which helped fund the massive deployments that have happened in solar and wind over the last seven to 10 years,"" she said.  Helping this cause, the People's Bank of China last week unveiled a long-awaited monetary facility to support decarbonisation projects. The facility provides low-cost funds to financial institutions by offering loan support at an interest rate of 1.75 per cent.  Boosting spending on renewables is only one piece of the puzzle in kicking the country's coal dependency and for Beijing to meet its target for emissions to peak before 2030. And analysts said the Chinese government had not explained how it would deal with legacy coal and gas companies, as well as their investors.  ""Over the next 40 years, China's power sector faces refinancing and stranded asset risks, higher costs of emissions and falling coal power profitability, but such impacts will be more significant in latter years,"" said Boris Kan, a senior credit officer at Moody's.  For its part, China has bristled at pressure from the US and other western governments over its responsibilities in responding to the climate crisis, frequently emphasising its status as a developing country.  China's environment ministry said on Sunday that addressing climate change ""should be implemented by all parties with different levels of responsibilities"".  Despite the acute financing and economic challenges, some analysts believe Xi's course has been set. In the days leading into COP26, the State Council, China's cabinet, outlined its plan to hit peak greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade.  Yun Jiang, a China expert at the Australian National University, noted that the policy document also linked China's carbon policy to ""national rejuvenation"", one of Xi's favourite themes.  ""It would be inconceivable for people in China, including local officials, to go against the major strategic decision that affects the sustainability of the Chinese nation,"" she said. "
FT-2021-92.txt," News, Tuesday, November 16, 2021 884 mots, p. 17  The UN climate process is designed to fail RSGLOBAL AFFAIRS Gideon Rachman  In a way, Boris Johnson was the perfect host for COP26. The British prime minister specialises in groundless optimism and empty pledges. The Glasgow climate summit produced plenty of both.  Ahead of the meeting, the informal slogan was ""keep 1.5 alive"". But to have a good chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C, global production of coal, oil and gas must start declining immediately and steeply. Nothing that came out of Glasgow suggests this will happen. Even some of the ‚Äî agreements signed at COP26 ‚Äî about restoring forests and cutting back methane emissions ‚Äî are little more than aspirations. As Ant√≥nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, observes: ""Signing the declaration is the easy part.""  "" It should not be a surprise that Glasgow was a disappointment. The UN climate process has been running for almost 30 yearsand over that time, carbon-dioxide emissions have continued to rise. There was no real reason to expect that COP26 would succeed where the previous 25 COPs had failed.  After Glasgow, it is time to recognise that the UN climate process does not work. This is not because the science discussed at the COP meetings is faulty. The problem is political. The world leaders at COP26 all endorsed the need for radical action. But the political pressures they are under are actually a recipe for inaction.  Domestically, politicians have good reason to fear that the cost of decarbonisation will be electoral defeat or social unrest. Every American president understands the political dangers of rising gas prices. The US has twice signed up to UN climate agreements ‚Äî inKyoto and Paris ‚Äî only to back out later. In China, the government is moving to head off energy shortages by opening scores of new coal-fired power plants. The Indian government knows how dependent its economy is on coal.  The international politics of COP are no easier. The process requires the unanimous agreement of almost 200 nations. In Glasgow, the objections of China and India forced a watering down of vital commitments on coal.  The repeated failures of the UN process have led many to denounce the current generation of world leaders as deficient or immoral. But different leaders, placed under the same pressures, would probably come up with similar results. Idealistic ""calls for politicians to ""embrace a global consciousness"" cannot wave away the fact that most politics remains local.  Pundits point to Opinion polls that suggest the public demands radical climate action. But many world leaders are understandably sceptical. When France's president, Emmanuel Macron, tried to raise petrol prices on environmental grounds, he sparked more than a year of social and political turmoil.  So what now? As the deficiencies of the COP process become ever harder to deny, the demand is likely to grow for another approach: geoengineering. That means efforts to alter or ""repair"" the climate, by reversing or reducing the processes that are leading to climate change.  One popular idea promoted by Gernot Wagner, author of a new book on geoengineering, is to reflect sunlight away from the Earth by injecting aerosols into the stratosphere. Another plan, championed by Sir David King of the Centre for Climate Repair at the University of Cambridge, is to refreeze the Arctic by encouraging white-cloud coverage over the region. The leading advocates of geoengineering all stress that their schemes are no substitute for efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They also frankly admit that there are big risks involved in geoengineering ‚Äî such as air pollution or unanticipated effects on the climate. But the bigger risk may be to continue to rely on the global climate talks.  Unlike the UN process, geoengineering would not require unanimous global agreement. Deploying remote-controlled ships to refreeze the Arctic would require the consent of the peoples in the region ‚Äî and a single wealthy state (or even individual) to spend the billions of dollars such a scheme would require. The fleets of planes that might be needed for solar geoengineering could similarly be mustered by any of the world's leading military powers.  But while the politics of geoengineering are easier than the COP process, they are still not straightforward. For a single nation or a ""coalition of the willing"" to take actions that change the climate of the entire planet would invite a global backlash. Two academics, Peter Irvine andDavid Keith, argue that the US is too widely distrusted to be able to take the initiative. Instead, they suggest that the lead on geoengineering should be taken by ""smaller developed democracies with strong records on climate action"".  In reality, small democracies will not have the power or the legitimacy to take action without the approval of the superpowers. By contrast, the US and China both have the power, arrogance and resources to take unilateral action. But they both also probably understand that acting alone would be controversial and risky.  The best geopolitical solution to geoengineering would involve joint action by the US and China. At present, despite warm words at the summit, Washington and Beijing lack the mutual trust to work together. But, as the growing dangers of climate change sink in, new and radical approaches will come to the fore. Desperate times may call for desperate measures. "
FT-2021-93.txt," Monday, November 15, 2021 - 04:30Z 985 mots  Exchanges sign up to boost climate funding and disclosure Jeremy Grant  When the 450 institutions that make up the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (Gfanz) told this month's COP26 climate conference they could deliver $100tn to help economies transition to green energy, attention was focused on the banks, fund managers, and insurers that had signed up.  But the signatories also included stock exchanges - signalling an increasing desire by the world's bourses to play a bigger role in pushing companies to decarbonise.  On the same day that Gfanz was touting its commitments, four exchanges - from South Africa, Mexico, Luxembourg and Hong Kong - signed up to the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance. This is a group of financial services companies committed to the goal of global net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, and part of Gfanz. Two other bourses, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Singapore Exchange (SGX) became founder members of the alliance earlier this year.  Mark Carney, UN special envoy on climate action and finance - and the driving force behind Gfanz - sees their involvement as key: ""Stock exchanges are critical market infrastructure that are essential for investors to manage the risks and seize the opportunities in the climate transition.""  So far, most of the focus on how to finance the transition away from fossil fuels has been on the sources of funding - such as the banks and asset managers that allocate funds to companies that they believe can deliver returns for tens of millions of pension-holders and other investors.  However, stock exchanges' increasing engagement with the issue is happening not only because they are the platforms on which companies, or issuers, raise some of that capital, but also because of their role in overseeing the disclosures that their listed companies make under regulatory requirements.  Such disclosures have long been financial but are now increasingly tied to sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.  Companies are increasingly reporting on their emissions under recommendations drawn up by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD), which provides a framework for companies to issue climate-related financial information.  ""The support of stock exchanges for climate related disclosures will help ensure capital is allocated in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" Carney has noted.  SGX, which made sustainability reporting mandatory for its companies in 2016, was the only exchange member of the TCFD when the body was first designing its disclosure framework. ""Having those early insights into how climate change and reporting would be shaped was helpful in how we approached our market,"" says Herry Cho, head of sustainability and sustainable finance at SGX.  Ultimately, pressure on companies to disclose climate data is coming from big investors, such as asset managers and pension funds - which are members of Gfanz. A recent survey by FTSE Russell, a stock index provider owned by the LSE, found that 84 per cent of asset owners globally are ""implementing or evaluating sustainable investment considerations"" in 2021, up from a little over half, 53 per cent, in 2018.  At an event hosted by the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE) at COP26 in Glasgow, Chiara Caprioli, senior business development manager at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, said: ""What we're seeing is an increase in mandatory disclosures so that investors can allocate funds to the most value-added opportunities - and that includes on sustainability performance and metrics.""  It was not always this way. When the SSE was established in Geneva in 2009 - under the auspices of Unctad, the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Investment and other UN bodies - its co-ordinator, Anthony Miller, recalls a slow start.  ""You could find lots of organisations like the standard-setting bodies and the UN engaged with sustainability, but there was sort of a deafening silence from exchanges"", he says. ""Yet issuers look to exchanges for guidance for everything, and we felt exchanges should be speaking to issuers on this topic. So, it was a natural role for exchanges to play.""  This prompted the SSE to come up with a template that exchanges could use to get started with the basics of sustainability reporting. Called ""model guidance"", it was issued in 2015.  At the time, less than a tenth of stock exchanges around the world were providing guidance on reporting ESG information. This year, 60 of the 114 stock exchanges that the SSE tracks - or 53 per cent of the total - had published ESG reporting guidance for their listed companies, using the model guidance in some form.  Last month, the LSE became the latest to do so. It issued guidance for its companies based on a version of the model guidance on climate disclosure that the SSE had produced in June, in line with the TCFD. This becomes mandatory for some UK companies next year.  Exchange executives acknowledge that there is a risk of fragmentation in the disclosure standards - echoing the concerns that many companies and investors already have about the acronym ""soup"" of ESG and sustainability standards.  But they believe that bourses can help by working together to drive the standardisation of data. ""We don't have to wait for the standard-setters,"" says David Harris, the LSE's group head of sustainable business. ""We have 'soft influence' that can be brought to bear on the process.""  Some exchanges in less-developed economies caution that local conditions in their markets must be given adequate consideration as the process continues.  ""Standards typically are crafted through a 'developed world' lens, and some social and other contextual factors such as the ones we have in South Africa get overlooked,"" says Leila Fourie, chief executive of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. She can trace the exchange's early engagement with sustainability back to 2005 when it became the first bourse in the world to launch a sustainability-linked stock index. ""We need standards that reflect a 'whole of world' approach when it comes to standard-setting,"" Fourie says. "
FT-2021-94.txt," News, Monday, November 15, 2021 1152 mots, p. 2  Relief and frustration as climate deal is done  COP26. Summit ends Agreement is signed despite falling short of Paris goals and clashes over fossil fuels LESLIE HOOK  The sweat was beading on COP26 president Alok Sharma's forehead after lastminute word changes insisted on by India and China, but nearly 200 countries agreed to a climate deal that will help the world avoid the worst impacts of global warming, although it stopped short of reaching the goals of the Paris climate accord.  At a time of mounting public frustration over the warming planet ‚Äî with protesters outside the venue every day ‚Äî the gathering in Glasgow at times appeared to teeter on the brink of collapse as countries clashed over the use of fossil fuels and the creation of new carbon markets, as well as damage payments from rich countries to poor ones.  They succeeded finally in overcoming their differences to agree on the rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord, which will enable the pact to become operational, for example with standards on how countries report their emissions.  But they still are not planning to cut emissions quickly enough to reach the temperature goals of the Paris accord, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2C since preindustrial times, and ideally around 1.5C. Temperatures have already risen 1.1C over that period.  Professor Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact research in Germany, said the summit was a ""step forward"" nonetheless. It helped to shift the world's trajectory from around 2.7C of expected warming, to around 1.8C or 1.9C, if all the national net zero targets were achieved, he told the FT.  ""This is probably the COP meeting, after Paris, that has been most constructive,"" said Rockstrom, pointing to the rule book and to the inclusion of ""real world"" pacts on the sidelines of the summit. ""On the other hand, as a scientist, I'm also disappointed. We came to Glasgow knowing the science, and every nation had to align to get to 1.5C, and we didn't get to that.""  The two-week summit, attended by more than 30,000 people from all over the world, was the biggest diplomatic event since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.  As around 120 national leaders including US President Joe Biden descended on Glasgow during the opening days, the first week was marked by leader speeches, pledges and side deals.  The most significant of these was the US-led ""Methane Pledge"", as more than 100 countries promised to cut emissions of methane, a potent warming gas.  But the critical technical negotiations became heated during the second week of the summit. For years the countries that signed the Paris accord have disagreed about how they should implement it, and failed to agree on those rules at previous COPs.  As the mood darkened during week two, some participants questioned whether the Glasgow COP might turn out to be similar to the failed Copenhagen summit in 2009.  Nations found themselves rehashing old disputes, for example about whether rich and poor countries should report emissions in the same way.  Signs of a breakthrough came on Wednesday evening, when the US and China signalled their intent to support a final deal as their respective envoys, John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua, joined forces with a joint declaration.  China's role was under scrutiny at the COP, after President Xi Jinping failed to join the other world leaders for the opening, having not left Beijing since before the pandemic. And in the final minutes of the summit on Saturday evening, India and China staged a dramatic intervention to weaken the language on coal and fossil fuels. A compromise was reached on a pledge to phase ""down"" rather than phase ""out"" coal, although many small island states were bitterly unhappy with the change.  The US defended the change on coal language as a necessary part of getting the deal done. Given the obstacles of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions, the summit was at times not expected to take place at all, after being delayed from 2020.  Laurence Tubiana, chief executive of the European Climate Foundation, and a key architect of the 2015 Paris pact, said the COP26 summit represented a ""step forward"".  Having the ""rule book"" for the Paris climate accord finally agreed was ""particularly positive"" she said, so that the pact could be implemented.  As the summit concluded, several vulnerable and small island nations expressed ""profound disappointment"".  Aminath Shauna, environment minister of the low-lying Maldives, said the deal did not ""bring hope"", adding: ""We have 98 months to half global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""  What they achieved The main points of the Glasgow deal  This is the first time the subject has been included in a final COP decision. The agreement asks countries to ""accelerate efforts towards"" phasing down ""unabated coal power"" ‚Äî referring to power plants that do not capture their CO2 emissions.  This caused eleventh-hour drama on Saturday night, when India and China watered down the coal wording from ""phase out"" to ""phase down"".  It also calls for an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies, though without specifying a timeline.  Loss and damage Countries seeking payments to help them cope with the effects of climate change they have already suffered are to start a ""dialogue"" about funding a new UN organisation to give them support. A standalone fund to help pay for loss and damage proposed by developing countries was rejected by rich nations. Climate finance The agreement notes with ""deep regret"" that rich countries missed their 2020 target of providing $100bn a year to help developing countries, and commits them to raise at least that, annually, until 2025. Adaptation Rich nations are asked to ""at least double"" their support for adaptation measures ‚Äî which will help developing countries prepare for climate change ‚Äî by 2025, compared with 2019 levels. This would imply that adaptation funding could be about $40bn annually, from $20bn in 2019. Carbon markets This is one element of the ""Paris rule book"" that has finally been closed. The rules will create a market for units representing emissions reductions that countries can trade, under so-called Article 6.  Although many of the loopholes that experts had been concerned about were closed, some legacy credits will be permitted for a limited time. These were created under the Kyoto protocol and considered to be of dubious environmental integrity. Mitigation By the end of next year, countries are requested to improve their 2030 national climate targets.

FT-2021-95.txt," Letters, Monday, November 15, 2021 641 mots, p. 20  COP26 made history but has still fallen short  MONDAY 15 NOVEMBER 2021\More ambitious climate plans are vital at next year's conference  COP26 was always going to struggle to meet the world's expectations. The conference has not shifted the planet decisively on to a path that will save it from the worst ravages of climate change, though decisions before it began had made that an unrealistic hope. This COP has nonetheless left the door open, by an inch, to restraining the overall rise in temperature to 1.5C ‚Äî provided countries heed a call to come back a year from now with more ambitious carbon reduction plans for the rest of what is a pivotal decade.  The conference president, Alok Sharma, briefly choked up at the close, apologising for a process that allowed India and China to water down a commitment in the final text for governments to phase ""down"" unabated coal power, rather than phasing it out as an earlier version had proposed.  Yet even the mention of coal by name was a breakthrough for such a conference ‚Äî as was a commitment to phase out ""inefficient fossil fuel"" subsidies. So was the meeting's expression of ""deep regret"" for the failure of rich countries to meet climate financing pledges made to poorer countries more than a decade ago, and a vow to at least double funding to help those nations adapt to a warming climate. These moves are welcome, as is the spate of COP26 side deals aimed at cutting emissions faster.  Yet delegates from the nearly 200 countries have left Glasgow with the same grim mathematical problem they had when they arrived.  All their climate plans and pledges for this decade do not yet add up to enough to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement: to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C from pre-industrial levels, and preferably the safer limit of 1.5C. Instead, analysts estimate the world is on track for about 2.4C of warming. A best-case estimate of a 1.8C temperature rise is only possible based on the heroic assumption that countries will meet all their 2030 promises, and pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 or soon after.  This outcome was largely inevitable, considering how many countries arrived in Glasgow with weak or substandard plans to cut their emissions. Yet COP26 was not pointless.  The meeting has bolstered the Paris agreement in important ways. First, it has recognised the primacy of its 1.5C goal, and the scientific consensus that reaching it will require global emissions almost to halve by 2030 and reach net zero by around 2050.  The final text requested countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their 2030 targets as necessary to be in line with the Paris goal, by the end of next year. Other gains included the unexpected acknowledgment from the US and China that the imperative of tackling climate change trumps the many disagreements dividing the two superpowers. The pair must now put their words into deeds. If emissions in China, which account for around 27 per cent of global greenhouse gas pollution, do not peak before 2030, that raises questions about whether the 1.5C goal can be reached.  In another encouraging step, western nations at COP26 announced an $8.5bn deal to help South Africa close its coal plants faster and move to a clean energy economy over the next five years. This concrete example of how a ""just transition"" from reliance on fossil fuels might be achieved should be replicated in other emerging economies.  Deals to cut methane, halt deforestation and phase out sales of new petrol and diesel cars have laid the groundwork for future COPs to spur more direct action. This, too, is good news, but not nearly enough. Egypt will host COP27 next year. Governments must ensure it does better than COP26. "
FT-2021-96.txt," Sunday, November 14, 2021 - 21:20Z 2303 mots  Executive pay and climate: can bonuses be used to reduce emissions? Andrew Hill in London  The greening of Schneider Electric started in 2005. The French electrical equipment group announced it would review its ""social and environment performance"" and set up a ""planet and society barometer"". In 2008 it even rebranded itself in lurid green.  ""If you measure it, it happens,"" Jean-Pascal Tricoire explained to Les Echos, the French business newspaper, in 2007, a year after taking over as chief executive.  Tricoire's own pay packet also has an increasingly green tinge. In recent years, his bonuses and long-term share grants have been tied to goals based on the barometer or its successor programme - such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions - plus the group's performance on environmental, social and governance measures across a range of external indices. In 2020, a fifth of Tricoire's total incentive pay - some‚Ç¨1.6m, including the value of shares from his long-term incentive plan - was due to his efforts to hit such targets.  As climate change has advanced up the boardroom agenda, so, inexorably, it has started to find its way into the incentives of senior executives. That has raised questions, not only about the clarity and solidity of the underlying goals and the ease with which chief executives might hit them, but about the purpose and effectiveness of monetary rewards as a way of changing corporate behaviour.  For now absolute numbers of companies using climate targets to calculate chief executives' bonuses and long-term incentives remain low: just 24 companies in the FTSE 100, and only 20 in the S&P 500, according to ISS ESG, the responsible investment arm of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services. But from a low base, the number of companies using climate pay targets more than doubled between 2019 and 2020. A survey by Deloitte in September suggested a further 24 per cent of companies polled expected to link their long-term incentive plans for executives to net zero or climate measures over the next two years.  ""We have not seen that sort of increase since TSR became the measure in vogue"" in the early 2000s, says Phillippa O'Connor, a partner at PwC, who advises companies on executive rewards, referring to total shareholder return, the metric of choice for tying executives' incentives to financial performance.  The push to integrate climate goals, and wider ESG targets, into pay plans has been led by consumer companies such as Unilever. Investors have also intensified the pressure on oil and gas groups such as Royal Dutch Shell to follow suit. According to ISS ESG, 39 per cent of energy companies in the world's biggest indices had incorporated climate targets into their chief executives' pay by last year, the highest proportion of any sector.  Harlan Zimmerman, senior partner at Cevian Capital, an activist investment group, sees the introduction of targeted pay as a ""forcing mechanism"" to change mindsets about climate change.  Others are more sceptical. Alex Edmans, a finance professor at London Business School (LBS), favours paying chief executives with shares that they must hold after they leave to nudge them to take decisions in the longer-term interests of the company. ""When you [set specific goals], you get this problem of hitting the target but missing the point,"" he says.  When earnings per share growth was popular as an executive goal, for instance, bonus-hunting managers tended to fixate on short-term expansion. Research also shows that when too many targets are added to incentive schemes, executives start to concentrate on the most obvious opportunities for reward - almost always financial growth, which carries the biggest weight in pay plans. Yet investors continue to add new items to their wishlist of targets.  Other studies have also suggested executives receive more generous payouts on non-financial targets than they do when judged on precise financial achievements, perhaps because they are often harder to measure and more subjective.  Climate targets also face an obvious snag not shared with shorter-term strategic goals. Companies' environmental goals often have an understandably long horizon - 2030, 2040, or even 2050 - but chief executives' tenure is much shorter. An S&P 500 chief executive holds office, on average, for less than 10 years.  ""Like everything to do with executive remuneration, it isn't easy to get this right,"" says Edward Mason of Generation Investment Management, the sustainability-focused fund company with $36bn of assets under management. ""There are risks of perverse incentives and easy remuneration that investors should be on the lookout for.""  'Meaningful, material, and measurable'  Some red flags are already flapping, according to pay analysts and investors. One is a concentration on tactical, short-term targets, such as operational efficiency, rather than more strategic, long-term goals such as emissions reductions. A second danger signal is a focus mainly on vaguer discretionary measures of progress, such as ""improving sustainability"" sometimes mixed with other qualitative goals. A third is the lack of transparency.  ""A lot of targets we are seeing are still quite vague,"" says Tom Gosling, an executive fellow in the finance department at LBS, ""and about 'making progress towards [a goal]', as opposed to pinning yourself to a final number.""  Honeywell, for instance, has committed to become carbon neutral by 2035 in its core activities, yet progress towards these commitments is not linked in detail to its executive pay plan. The US industrial group paid its chief executive Darius Adamczyk an annual bonus of $2.5m for 2020, of which 20 per cent was based on the remuneration committee's assessment of a raft of goals including driving ""a robust ESG programme"".  ASML, the Netherlands-based semiconductor equipment group whose shares are quoted on Nasdaq, has promised to cut its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from operations to zero by 2025 as part of the ""climate and energy"" criteria for executive bonuses. It benchmarks itself against other semiconductor companies in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. But it refuses to reveal actual targets and achievement levels, saying they are ""commercially or strategically sensitive"". It is reviewing its policy following challenges from investors to improve transparency.  Angeli Benham, senior global ESG manager at Legal & General Investment Management, which has $1.8tn of assets under management globally, is typical of many in calling for climate goals to be ""meaningful, material, and measurable"".  The two largest elements of performance pay are the annual bonus, and long-term incentive plan (LTIP), which typically runs for three years.  The level of enthusiasm within boards to attach more conditions to their chief executives' incentives varies. ISS ESG measured the highest impact of climate factors in pay at companies in the French and German benchmark indices, and the lowest in Asia and the US.  Not one of the attempts by US investors to tie executive pay to ESG measures attracted significant support at this year's annual meetings, according to Glass Lewis, another proxy adviser. It registered a drop in shareholder support for ESG targets in pay to 12 per cent, on average, compared with 17 per cent last year and 22 per cent in 2019.  Glass Lewis itself recommended support for just one proposal this year: that General Motors should report if and how the carmaker had met pay criteria laid down by Climate Action 100+, a network of investor organisations. Lila Holzman, from the lobby group As You Sow, told GM's board meeting that shareholders wanted chief executive Mary Barra and her team ""to focus their actions on achieving Paris-aligned goals during these next critical years when it matters, not some day in the future"".  Her plea to embed climate change performance measures in executive pay fell on deaf ears.  Defending itself in the proxy statement issued to shareholders ahead of its annual meeting, GM said it had taken its sustainability performance into account in setting pay since 2017 and added that it had ""highlighted our executives' key 2020 ESG achievements"" with a leaf symbol in its performance highlights. Even though Glass Lewis judged the GM proposal ""not to be overly burdensome"", given the carmaker's existing commitments to climate goals, it was rejected with only 16.3 per cent of GM shares voting in favour.  The GM case highlights that every company is different when it comes to tying climate targets to pay, making a blanket approach unworkable. But successfully adopting bespoke plans is arduous and complicated.  For instance, NatWest, the UK-based bank, has set conditions on its issue of stock to Alison Rose, chief executive, that include reducing carbon emissions from its direct operational footprint and increasing funding for clients' climate and sustainable finance initiatives. Helen Cook, NatWest's chief human resources officer, told a recent Deloitte webinar that introducing climate conditions into executive pay was ""a new frontier"".  She said she and her team ""probably had 10 iterations of conversations around climate before we got our first climate measures"". They had to revisit those at least twice after the bank's remuneration committee had discussed them, ""because people were trying to define and to discern what was measurable and importantly what is auditable"".  Small company syndrome  Advocates of linking climate targets to executive pay say, done well, it can pay off.  Dutch and UK investors have in recent years pushed Shell, for example, to clarify its path to carbon reduction. Before a Dutch court ordered the group to increase its emissions cuts in May - a decision against which Shell is appealing - the group had strengthened its pay policy in line with the aim of limiting rises in global average temperature to 1.5C. Chief executive Ben van Beurden's annual bonus, for instance, will in future link to its greenhouse gas abatement target, and 20 per cent of his long-term incentive payout will be tied to Shell's energy transition, up from 10 per cent in previous years.  Schneider Electric is another example. Its 2005 commitment to ""spotlight"" corporate responsibility had evolved by 2012 into formal ESG targets within chief executive Tricoire's bonus and long-term share awards. The weighting of the sustainability targets in his annual bonus increased in recent years from 5 per cent, to 6 per cent, and then in 2019 to 20 per cent, the same as for his long-term rewards. That helped to double the total value of incentives he received by working towards sustainability targets from‚Ç¨851,840 in 2018 to‚Ç¨1.6m in 2020.  During that time, the board responded to shareholder pressure by tying the long-term incentive plan's sustainability targets to external measures and simplifying the number of criteria used overall. The group says it hit or surpassed two of its four climate targets set in 2018, en route to its overall aim of becoming carbon neutral in its operations by 2025.  Tricoire is receiving a higher overall payout partly because the portion attributed to non-financial measures has increased and because Schneider Electric's shares have performed well. But in a sign of how difficult it was to meet those non-financial targets as they became more ""meaningful, material, and measurable"", the rate at which he achieved those goals actually dropped.  Shell, Schneider Electric, Honeywell, General Motors, Unilever, NatWest, ASML: these are large companies that attract the attention of big institutional investors. As significant emitters, Unilever, GM and Shell are on Climate Action 100+'s list of ""focus companies"" that account for 80 per cent of global corporate industrial emissions and whose governance and executive pay policies will be closely monitored and scrutinised against their environmental commitments.  The danger, investors acknowledge, is that smaller companies, or companies for which climate change is less immediately significant, will reward their executives by implementing less rigorous programmes with easy-to-hit targets.  Benham, from LGIM, says she expects most smaller companies to take the lead from the improving practice of their larger counterparts, but she admits: ""Our focus tends to be with the largest companies where we devote a lot more engagement time. So there may be a multitude of smaller companies that put anything in there and get away with it.""  A more fundamental criticism is that executive pay may not even be the right tool for encouraging this type of corporate change. Tax, regulation, and carbon pricing initiatives that can only come from governments, or, for that matter, high-profile court cases, could be more effective.  Investors argue, though, that challenges to executive rewards attract board attention.  US ""say on pay"" rules mandate a non-binding vote on remuneration. By using those rules to push for ESG targets in executive pay, investors say they can force the climate question on to the agenda of directors. Encouraging the incorporation of climate targets into senior executive pay also signals to more junior managers that it is important and trickles down to other staff. At Schneider Electric, 10 per cent of the bonus of all 58,000 staff has been tied to sustainability targets since 2019.  As for the criticism that traditional financial ambitions over-rule or contradict climate targets - which might, for instance, involve reducing output to cut emissions, Generation Investment Management's Mason says: ""Good management is about reconciling the short term and the long term and understanding where things run up against each other and finding a path through that.""  Gosling, of LBS, argues that if environmental measures - and, indeed, social and governance improvements - support longer-term shareholder value, there may be better ways to encourage executives than tweaking rewards. If, however, ESG initiatives conflict with long-term value, then ""executive pay will never be the solution"".  ""We're kidding ourselves if we say we can solve a climate crisis without changing the economic guide rails for companies at all; I'm very sceptical about using executive pay to set climate targets that are sufficient,"" he says. ""We hope for far, far too much from this intervention."" "

Conference president Alok Sharma fought back tears in the final minutes as he apologised to other ministers for watering down a clause on fossil fuels to appease India and China.  However, the summit marked the first time that coal or fossil fuels had been directly referenced in a COP agreement.  Countries also agreed on rules that will govern the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C since pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5C, and to increase funding to help countries to adapt to climate change.  Temperatures have already risen 1.1C in that period, and many nations have suffered the consequences.  In the final hours of the summit, a plan to approve the COP26 text was thrown off track when India and China objected to the phrase about the ""phase out"" of unabated coal power, referring to power plants that do not capture carbon dioxide emissions, as well as all fossil fuel subsidies.  After a huddle between the US, EU and China, a compromise was reached on a pledge to phase ""down"" rather than phase ""out"" coal.  But many vulnerable and small island nations objected to the weaker language, saying it would imperil their future by resulting in greater emissions and further global warming.  ""I wish to read into the record our profound disappointment with the change in the language on coal, from phase out, to phase down. We accept this change, with the greatest reluctance,"" said Tina Stege, COP26 envoy from the Marshall Islands.  ""We do so only, because there are critical elements of this package that the people of my country need, as a lifeline for their future.""  Switzerland expressed its ""profound disappointment as a result of intransparent process"".  ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C [limit to temperature rise] but make it more difficult to reach it,"" the Swiss representative at the summit said.  Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" about the way the conclusion had unfolded, but urged countries to approve the deal lest it all unravel.  The emotional moment was met with applause from the assembled ministers, who proceeded to approve the documents with the change.  ""Even after what happened, coal remains on the books,"" said US climate envoy John Kerry. ""You have to phase down coal before you can end coal,"" he added, defending the change.  ""Did I appreciate that we had to adjust one thing tonight in a very unusual way? No. But if we hadn't done it, we would not have had an agreement,"" he said.  In a statement on its website on Sunday, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment expressed support for international co-operation to combat climate change, but called for a system in which ""each country can decide on its contribution on its own"".  Given the obstacles of the pandemic and heightened geopolitical tensions, the summit was at times not expected to take place at all, after being delayed from 2020.  The rules for the Paris climate accord, which have derailed several previous climate summits, were finalised at COP26, including transparency regulations for how countries report their emissions.  Guidelines for a global carbon market, which will allow countries to trade carbon offset credits, were also approved.  Several negotiators said they were surprised and pleased that the rules had all managed to pass after years of acrimonious debate.  Even Saudi Arabia said it accepted the deal. ""It's as good as it can get,"" Ayman Shasly, head of the Saudi delegation and a former Saudi Aramco executive in China, told the Financial Times on the sidelines of the plenary session. ""It's all inclusive, it covers all elements aligned with the Paris agreement. All parties were happy with it.""  Sharma, speaking at a press conference, blamed fatigue for his emotional moment on the podium, but admitted that he had been ""disappointed"" by the last-minute change to the text. ""Anyone who has seen the footage can make up their own mind about how I felt,"" he said. "

GUA-2021-61.txt,"Banks pledge to fight climate crisis ‚Äì but their boards
have deep links with fossil fuels



7 avril 2021

US banks are pledging to help fight the climate crisis alongside the Biden administration,
but their boards are dominated by people with climate-related conflicts of interest, and
they continue to invest deeply in fossil fuel projects.

Three out of every four board members at seven major US banks (77%) have current or
past ties to climate-conflicted companies or organizations ‚Äì from oil and gas corporations
to trade groups that lobby against reducing climate pollution, according to a first-of-its-
kind review by climate influence analysts for the blog DeSmog.

One of the controversial projects those board members have chosen to back is the new
Line 3 tar sands pipeline, currently under construction in northern Minnesota. If
completed, the project would allow the Canadian oil giant Enbridge to double the amount
of high-polluting tar sands oil it transports through the region to 760,000 barrels per day.

Environmental groups estimate the new Line 3 would add 50 new coal plants‚Äô worth of
carbon emissions to the atmosphere every year for the next three to five decades. They say
it is incompatible with the Biden administration‚Äôs climate and environmental goals, and
they argue the project never should have been approved. They add that the Trump
administration didn‚Äôt independently review the risks of building a tar sands pipeline
underneath the headwaters of the Mississippi River, which flows all the way to the US
Gulf Coast.

Neither Biden nor the banks funding Line 3 have acknowledged these concerns, and time
is running out to halt construction. So in recent weeks, Indigenous water protectors in
Minnesota have resorted to physically chaining themselves to Enbridge equipment, while
activists across the country have been chaining themselves to the doors of the banks who
finance the pipeline.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a lot of complacency. People have been pursuing comfortable routes of
advocacy,‚Äù said Tara Houska, whose group Giniw Collective has led several direct actions
against Line 3. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to get the answers we need comfortably.‚Äù

Enbridge has seven active loans relevant to Line 3, totaling $11.5bn, according to the
Rainforest Action Network (Ran). In addition, banks have underwritten bonds to
Enbridge totaling $5bn since the autumn of 2019, the group said.

From the US, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have made
the project possible with billions of dollars in loans, although it‚Äôs impossible to tally
precisely how much they have financed for the pipeline specifically. Another five large
Canadian banks are also financing Enbridge, according to Ran.

Out of these nine North American banks backing Enbridge, six have recently published
net-zero climate goals, pledging to align their investments with the international Paris
climate agreement.

‚ÄúThe banks are gorging on doughnuts and then eating an apple afterwards,‚Äù said Richard
Brooks, the Toronto-based climate finance director for Stand.earth. ‚ÄúWe certainly can‚Äôt
rely on banks or the private sector to lead us into climate safety and lead us toward
emissions reductions. We need policy, we need regulation. We need government to act.‚Äù

DeSmog found Canadian banks have the highest percentage of directors with climate-
conflicted ties: 82%. That figure was significant in the UK and elsewhere in Europe as
well, at 78% and 61%, respectively.

In February, the group Stop the Money Pipeline began a campaign to demand that banks
withdraw their financial support of Line 3.

But despite numerous direct actions across the country, the effort has not been nearly as
successful as previous climate campaigns targeted at banks, like the campaign to end
funding for drilling in the Arctic national wildlife refuge.

The progressive Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar pointed to previous
environmental victories and said activists must keep fighting.

‚ÄúWe were able to stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline because activists
collectively organized in large numbers to oppose it ‚Äì we must use that same energy to
stop this pipeline from causing irreversible damage,‚Äù she said.

Juli Kellner, an Enbridge spokesperson, argued Line 3 was a safety-driven project because
it was replacing an older pipeline. She said it had received all its permits after a thorough
review process.

‚ÄúShutting down existing pipelines does not erase demand. It merely forces the transport
of essential energy by less efficient means such as ship, truck, and most notably rail,‚Äù
Kellner said. ‚ÄúIt is Enbridge‚Äôs responsibility to transport the energy people rely on daily by
pipelines - the safest, most efficient means of transporting energy. It is also our
responsibility to do what we can to address climate change. That is why we‚Äôve set a target
of net-zero emissions by 2050 and laid a credible path to achieving it, including tying
compensation of our executives to our performance in this area.‚Äù

Much of the US economy is built on fossil fuels, and people with enough experience to be
appointed to bank boards are likely to have some connection to climate-conflicted
organizations. But the DeSmog analysts said the heavy representation of industry on



boards shows a ‚Äúlack of creativity‚Äù in recruitment and is probably why bank policies aren‚Äôt
more environmentally progressive.

‚ÄúSome of these banks have pledges, but it‚Äôs about ensuring that they see them through.
We‚Äôre simply asking the question of: ‚ÄòWith this person on the board, what‚Äôs the likelihood
of them seeing them through?‚Äô‚Äù said Mat Hope, editor of DeSmog UK.

‚ÄúWhen it comes to the consumer holding their bank card, we want to put the information
out there that lets them know that these are the directors of the boards of the banks
they‚Äôre banking with.‚Äù

DeSmog reviewed the careers of board directors and flagged any connections with high-
polluting sectors, including fossil energy, agribusiness, steelmaking and mining. The
group also relied on indexes that measure polluting companies, such as the Climate
Action 100 list, which includes companies like Nestl√© ‚Äì which has contributed to
deforestation. And they reviewed links to trade groups, lobbying firms and thinktanks
that have opposed climate action.

JPMorgan Chase tops the list for directors with climate conflicts. All of its 10 directors
have current or past ties to companies or organizations contributing to the climate crisis.
Wells Fargo comes in second, with 12 out of 13 directors.

Most of the seven banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for
comment. Wells Fargo noted its net-zero commitment and its plans to disclose near-term
climate targets, as well as its taskforce on climate-related financial disclosures.

All seven of the banks have potential climate conflicts among at least half the directors on
their boards.

For example, Theodore Craver, a director at Wells Fargo, is also on the board of Duke
Energy, a power company that owns significant coal and gas generation. Duke has vowed
to reach net-zero carbon pollution by 2050, but environmental advocates have argued the
company‚Äôs plan still includes a large amount of gas. Craver is also the retired CEO of
Edison International, another energy company.

Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline. Good, but he doesn't get a climate pass just yet

Michael Neal, who is on the board at JPMorgan Chase, was vice chairman of General
Electric Company until his retirement in 2013.

Those kinds of connections could be significant obstacles to the Biden administration‚Äôs
hopes that banks will commit to climate-friendly finance, activists warn.

John Kerry, Biden‚Äôs climate envoy, wants banks to commit to more near-term goals,
according to Politico. But the White House has also met with environmental and
watchdog groups who want the administration to be more aggressive with banks.



The White House did not respond to requests to comment for this story.

Collin Rees, a campaigner for Oil Change International, said advocates have consistently
heard there is a desire within the White House to move forward on climate finance
regulation, to require banks to have capital requirements and pass stress tests, for
example.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the way we would like to see it approached,‚Äù Rees said. ‚ÄúTo talk about how we are
regulating Wall Street. And to also talk about the fact that they are not only potential
sources of clean energy investment, which is good, but also still driving the climate crisis.‚Äù

Last week, 145 organizations wrote Kerry a letter urging him to help end ‚Äúthe flow of
private finance from Wall Street to the industries driving climate change around the world
‚Äì fossil fuels and forest-risk commodities‚Äù. They asked Kerry to ‚Äúrecognize that Wall
Street is not yet an ally‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs long as US firms continue to pour more money into the drivers of climate change, they
are actively undermining President Biden‚Äôs climate goals,‚Äù they said.

In Alida, Minnesota, Jami Gaither, a resident, pointed to a wide trench in the ground that
will hold the Line 3 pipeline as the real-world effect of what banks are supporting.

‚ÄúThis is obviously not just for one pipeline,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow much longer can we keep up
this charade, this idea that we can keep going on developing fossil fuels? We‚Äôre building a
fucking tar sands pipeline at the end of the world.‚Äù

GUA-2021-62.txt,"Turnbull blames 'rightwing media' for dumping from
NSW climate change board



change-board

Adam Morton

6 avril 2021

Malcolm Turnbull claims the New South Wales Coalition government was influenced by a
‚Äúconcerted and ferocious‚Äù rightwing media campaign led by News Corp after it reversed
his appointment to lead a new climate change body.

The state‚Äôs energy and environment minister, Matt Kean, issued a statement on Tuesday
morning saying the former prime minister had been dropped as the chair of the Net Zero
Emissions and Clean Economy board.

The appointment had been approved by cabinet on Monday last week, but was publicly
questioned by the deputy premier, John Barilaro, after Turnbull backed a call for a
moratorium on new coalmines and mine expansions in the state.

John Barilaro attacks Turnbull over 'war on Coalition' and says NSW 'firmly committed'
to coal

On Tuesday, the Daily Telegraph newspaper splashed with an ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù story headlined
‚ÄúMalcolm‚Äôs coal war‚Äù that accused Turnbull of ‚ÄúNimby activism‚Äù against a proposed
expansion of the Mount Pleasant coalmine in the upper Hunter Valley.

It published three stories and an editorial critical of Turnbull‚Äôs appointment to the board
and his stance on coal. One included details of a submission from Malcolm and Lucy
Turnbull against the Mount Pleasant expansion. The Turnbulls have a farm nearby and
had been open about their opposition to the project.

Turnbull told Guardian Australia the government overturning his appointment followed a
‚Äúconcerted and ferocious campaign‚Äù against him by the Daily Telegraph and other
rightwing media. He said News Corp had worked up its story with ‚Äúnone other than One
Nation‚Äôs Mark Latham‚Äù, who was quoted saying Turnbull should not have the board role.

‚ÄúThis is essentially the Coalition continuing to be held hostage by the right wing, which is
sustained and empowered and amplified by the rightwing media,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this sort of rightwing climate change denying echo chamber, which speaks to a
lot of people who are National and Liberal party members and doesn‚Äôt really speak to a
big part of the community overall. It‚Äôs a feedback loop, and it‚Äôs dragged the Liberal and
National parties further to the right.‚Äù

Latham told the Daily Telegraph the Mount Pleasant coalmine expansion would create
400 ongoing and 500 construction jobs. Turnbull said this was ‚Äúcomplete and utter
rubbish‚Äù as demand for coal was declining, and any expansion would mean a loss of jobs
elsewhere.



‚ÄúNobody with an understanding of the situation in or outside government doubts these
facts,‚Äù he said.

Turnbull last week backed a report by the Australia Institute calling for a moratorium on
coalmine proposals and approvals, describing them as ‚Äúout of control‚Äù in the upper
Hunter. He said he was speaking in a personal capacity, and not as the board chair.

Turnbull said mines were devastating the landscape, shortening lives by reducing air
quality and, given the declining global demand for coal as the world move to tackle the
climate crisis, potentially leaving taxpayers with a huge environmental remediation bill.

Malcolm Turnbull backs moratorium on new coalmines in NSW

Asked about this on Tuesday, Turnbull said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt resile from anything I‚Äôve said.‚Äù

Barilaro last week issued a statement saying Turnbull had a ‚Äúdamaged ego‚Äù and needed to
‚Äúset aside his war on the Coalition‚Äù. But Turnbull said he had a ‚Äúvery cordial‚Äù and ‚Äúgood
humoured‚Äù conversation with Barilaro after his coal moratorium call.

‚ÄúThis [the board] was a part-time role which I was asked to do. I didn‚Äôt seek it. I agreed
because we need to move as quickly as possible to a net zero emissions economy,‚Äù
Turnbull said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately there are vocal forces in our country, particularly the fossil
fuel lobby and the Murdoch media, who are absolutely opposed to that.

The editor of the Daily Telegraph, Ben English, said he was ‚Äúsaddened to hear that
Malcolm Turnbull has once again decided to blame others for his own misfortune‚Äù. He
said the newspaper had ‚Äúdone nothing more than cover a story of importance to everyone
who lives in NSW‚Äù.

‚ÄúThis is nothing personal, even if Mr Turnbull would like to claim it is,‚Äù English said in a
statement.

The decision to drop Turnbull comes as the Coalition faces a battle to hold on to the state
seat of Upper Hunter triggered by the resignation of the Nationals MP Michael Johnsen.

On Sunday, federal Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon, a vocal coalmining supporter, tweeted a
photo with Barilaro and Latham at an NRL ‚Äúvoice for mining family day‚Äù in Newcastle.

Plenty of cross-party support for the Hunter‚Äôs coal mining industry at the @NSWMC round
today. Couldn‚Äôt quite get the same unanimous support for the @NRLKnights
#nrlknightsdragons #voiceformining @JohnBarilaroMP @RealMarkLatham


‚Äî Joel Fitzgibbon (@fitzhunter) April 4, 2021

Announcing Turnbull had been dropped from the role, Kean said it was important the
focus was on ‚Äúfacts, technology, science and economics‚Äù, not personality.



‚ÄúMalcolm Turnbull, AC, has contributed much to our country and I know will contribute
more into the future,‚Äù Kean said. ‚ÄúHowever, no person‚Äôs role on the board should distract
from achieving results for the NSW people or from the government‚Äôs work in delivering
jobs and opportunities for the people of NSW.‚Äù

Speaking at a press conference, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said Turnbull was
‚Äúa great Australian and a great contributor‚Äù but ‚Äúunfortunately for everyone‚Äù his
appointment was ‚Äúproving to be a distraction‚Äù. She did not directly answer when asked if
Turnbull would be replaced by a clean energy advocate, deferring to Kean.

Barilaro later told Guardian Australia that Turnbull had ‚Äúseverely misinterpreted‚Äù his role
as chair of the advisory board.

‚ÄúUnder no circumstances did this appointment provide him with a mandate to criticise
the mining industry and, as a result of his comments, the NSW government has decided
not to proceed with the appointment,‚Äù he said.

The deputy premier said he had ‚Äúcopped a lot of flak‚Äù for supporting the coal industry. ‚ÄúI
wear that proudly,‚Äù he said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúPeople try to slander us by calling us the
‚ÄòCOALition‚Äô. I am perfectly comfortable with that because I know how important this
industry is to the people of NSW and the wider Australian economy.‚Äù

There is a growing global push for countries to phase out coal. Thirty-six countries have
joined the powering past coal alliance, promising to end coal burning for electricity by
2030 in developed nations and reduce it by 80% globally. The UN secretary general,
Ant√≥nio Guterres, last month said phasing the fossil fuel out of power generation was the
single most important step to tackle the climate crisis.

The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, said the decision to appoint Turnbull was
‚Äúmonumental failure of judgment‚Äù.

On Twitter, she wrote: ‚ÄúHow on earth did it even come to this? John Barilaro backed
Turnbull‚Äôs appointment in cabinet. This should never have been a political appointment
and was always going to be divisive.‚Äù

How on earth did it even come to this? John Barilaro backed Turnbull‚Äôs appointment in
Cabinet. 
 
This should never have been a political appointment and was always going to divisive.

‚Äî Jodi McKay (@JodiMcKayMP) April 6, 2021

Kean said a new chair would be announced ‚Äúin due course‚Äù, and until then the NSW chief
scientist and engineer Hugh Durrant-Whyte would act in the role.



The board has been created to help oversee the delivery of clean energy legislation that
passed parliament with multiparty support in 2020 despite vocal opposition from One
Nation.

GUA-2021-63.txt,"China sandstorms highlight threat of climate crisis



Michael Standaert

3 avril 2021

Recent sandstorms that shrouded Beijing in a post-apocalyptic orange haze and intensive
droughts in other parts of the country are bringing into stark relief the challenges China
faces from rising temperatures induced by the climate crisis.

The widespread sandstorms that pelted the capital and spread as far as central China for
several days in mid-March and again at the end of the month were brought on by lower
than average snow cover and precipitation, as well as higher than normal temperatures
and winds across Mongolia and northern China.

The combination provides perfect conditions for creating sandstorms and could signal
more frequent dusty weather as temperatures climb in the region.

‚ÄúAlthough the sandstorms were mainly caused by natural factors, they remind us there is
only one Earth for mankind,‚Äù Liu Youbin, a spokesman for the environment ministry, told
a press conference in Beijing.

‚ÄúWe must give great importance to ecological protection and construction and strengthen
international cooperation,‚Äù he said.

Since 1978 China has been trying to combat encroaching sands from the Gobi Desert
region by planting a series of forest strips through its northern areas. This ‚ÄúGreat Green
Wall‚Äù has been somewhat effective at reducing erosion and slowing desert expansion, but
does little to knock down high-altitude dust blown in from afar.

‚ÄúHotter summers and shorter winters with less snowfall will likely lead to general declines
in moisture levels of the soil [across the region], making it more prone to being scoured by
winds and carried far away, and threatening China‚Äôs laudable tree-planting efforts,‚Äù said
Darrin Magee, a professor of environmental studies at Hobart and William Smith Colleges
in the US and an expert on China‚Äôs water resources.

‚ÄúClimate change will almost certainly exacerbate the sandstorm issue for north-east
China,‚Äù he said.

While the sandstorms are a natural occurrence, there are a number of human factors at
play that contribute to the intensity besides the climate crisis.

‚ÄúIn the places where the sand is originating from, both recent overgrazing and
desertification have contributed to the desertification of the grasslands of Mongolia,‚Äù said
Liu Junyan, a Beijing-based climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace East Asia.

‚ÄúI think one of the most important things is to stop overgrazing, and this is something the
Chinese government has done in the past two decades in parts of northern China,‚Äù she
said.



On Tuesday, China‚Äôs State Council released new guidelines for strengthening grassland
protection, aiming for a 57% rate of stable vegetation coverage in its grasslands by 2025 as
well as further efforts to deal with overgrazing or illegal grazing on protected grasslands.

For Magee, the impact of grazing from semi-nomadic herders in Inner Mongolia and
Tibetan areas is more overblown than other industrial factors that lead to depleted
groundwater and drying in the region.

‚ÄúA few thousand herders practising what herders have done for centuries are clearly not
the problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúContinued high rates of groundwater extraction for mining,
industry and agriculture in northern China don‚Äôt help, either, and unfortunately I find it
increasingly difficult to believe that climate change buffers, green belts or inter-basin
water transfers will really have an impact.‚Äù

Major water transfer projects such as the South-to-North series of canals and pipelines
are mainly for supplying water to heavily populated cities such as Beijing or increasingly
industrialised agriculture zones near those cities, and do little to restore depleted
groundwater.

Besides the sandstorms, parts of China have recently been hit by severe drought,
including the eastern coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, which were mainly dry
from October last year through February, with some respite in March.

Further south, China‚Äôs economic powerhouse of Guangdong province and the largely rural
province of Guangxi have also suffered under drought conditions since late last year, with
authorities here increasingly resorting to cloud seeding to induce rainfall.

The province where conditions are now the most severe is Yunnan, in the country‚Äôs far
south-west, where 82% of the province is experiencing drought, leading to water
shortages for people and livestock in the worst areas.

Liu Junyan hopes that the twice-postponed UN biodiversity conference known as Cop15,
scheduled to be held in Kunming, Yunnan, in mid-October, can highlight the interactions
between climate change, water resources and biodiversity.

According to studies of temperature increases across China, Yunnan is the province with
the most climate-related warming over the past decade and has been affected by frequent
droughts in recent years.

‚ÄúI was recently in Yunnan to check out the weather, and it‚Äôs even more horrible than in
previous years,‚Äù Liu said. ‚ÄúOn the whole, the government still doesn‚Äôt consider that
climate change has a big, big impact on biodiversity.‚Äù

GUA-2021-64.txt,"Early cherry blossoms in Washington DC point to
climate crisis



3 avril 2021

Spring has sprung in America‚Äôs capital, bringing with it a resplendent bloom of white and
pink cherry blossoms that is one of the city‚Äôs grandest annual traditions.

But this year, as Washington DC‚Äôs residents embrace a relative return to normal after a
tumultuous year marked by the coronavirus and civil unrest, the earlier-than-anticipated
bloom may point to yet another looming crisis: climate change.

Unusually warm weather in Washington accelerated the bloom cycle of the National
Mall‚Äôs 3,800 cherry trees, causing the blossoms to pop days ahead of schedule in what
experts say is a new normal that will make their arrival increasingly difficult to predict.

‚ÄúEmpirical data shows the peak bloom date for the cherry trees is occurring earlier than it
did in the past,‚Äù said Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service.

Washington‚Äôs cherry trees now reach peak bloom about six days sooner than they did 100
years ago. At the same time, weather station measurements in the US capital show the
temperature has increased by 1.6C (2.88F).

‚ÄúSince heat breaks dormancy in flowering trees, earlier cherry blooming is consistent with
heating caused by climate change, although research has not yet examined all of the
potential factors that could have caused the earlier blooming,‚Äù Litterst said.

The trees at the Tidal Basin reached their flowery peak on 28 March, according to the
park service, which defines ‚Äúpeak bloom‚Äù as the day when 70% of the Yoshino cherry
blossoms open. On 4 March, the park service predicted peak bloom would fall between 2
April and 5 April.

‚ÄúThe Yoshino cherry trees have reached peak bloom after temperatures well above
average for much of the last week sped us through the final stages of the blossom cycle,‚Äù
the agency wrote on Instagram. It added that the warm weather propelled the cherry
blossom buds through the final stages of their six-stage cycle, advancing them from
peduncle elongation ‚Äì stage 4 ‚Äì to peak bloom in just four days.

‚ÄúThe four days from peduncle elongation to peak is the fastest the trees have moved
through the last two stages in the last 30 years (matched in 2015),‚Äù the agency wrote.

Peak bloom often occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April, but
exceptionally warm or cool temperatures can shift the timeline. This year, peak bloom was
reached four days ahead of the 30-year-average date of 1 April.



In 2020, peak bloom arrived on 20 March, the earliest since 2012 when it also occurred
on that day. The blooms are tied for the third earliest on record. In 2018, peak bloom did
not arrive until 5 April following wicked windstorms and a late-season snow.

Washington‚Äôs bloom came just two days after the cherry blossoms in Kyoto reached peak
bloom on 26 March, the earliest in nearly 70-years of formal record keeping ‚Äì and
possibly ever.

‚ÄúWe can say it‚Äôs most likely because of the impact of the global warming,‚Äù Shunji Anbe, an
official at the observations division at the Japan Meteorological Agency, told the
Associated Press.

The annual spectacle in Washington typically draws as many as 1.5 million visitors to the
Tidal Basin, but the coronavirus pandemic has dramatically reduced crowd sizes for a
second year in a row. Local officials are urging visitors to wear a mask and practice social
distancing.

To discourage crowds, the park service limited access to the Tidal Basin during the bloom
and urged residents to avoid the area altogether and enjoy the blooms remotely. The Trust
for the National Mall is hosting a live stream of the cherry blossoms.

GUA-2021-65.txt,"Biden‚Äôs $2tn infrastructure plan aims to ‚Äòfinally address
climate crisis as a nation'



Oliver Milman

31 mars 2021

Joe Biden has said his new infrastructure plan will allow ‚Äútransformational progress in
our ability to tackle climate change‚Äù by bolstering investments in clean energy, electric
vehicles and building homes resilient to threats posed by the climate crisis.

The $2tn plan will make ‚Äúcrumbling‚Äù American infrastructure more robust to extreme
weather events, the US president said in a speech on Wednesday, while providing funds to
‚Äúbuild a modern, resilient and fully clean grid‚Äù.

Biden said that tax incentives should allow ‚Äúall Americans to afford clean electric vehicles‚Äù
and workers will be able to ‚Äúseize amazing opportunities in a clean energy future‚Äù.

Biden unveils 'once-in-a generation' $2tn infrastructure investment plan

Biden opened his White House term with a cavalcade of executive actions to begin the
gargantuan task of shifting the US to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and the
new $2tn package, known as the American Jobs Plan, is the first indication of the scale of
spending that will be required to reshape day-to-day life in order to avert disastrous
climate change.

As well as huge investments in crumbling roads and bridges, the Biden plan takes aim at
the emissions created by transport, currently the country‚Äôs largest source of planet-
heating gases. There‚Äôs $80bn for Amtrak and freight rail, $85bn for public transit, $174bn
to promote electric vehicles through various incentives, the electrification of school buses
and 500,000 new plug-in recharging stations within the next decade. The federal
government‚Äôs vehicle fleet will also be electrified.

Ports and airports will be upgraded, the plan states, while more than $200bn is proposed
to build, modernize and fortify housing for low-income people affected by the storms,
heatwaves and wildfires of growing intensity that are upending American lives and
threatening billions, if not trillions, of dollars in ongoing damages. A further $100bn will
be spent upgrading an electricity grid vulnerable to the sort of climate shocks that recently
shook Texas, as well as aiding the transmission of a glut of new renewable energy. In all,
40% of this spending will be aimed at vulnerable communities of color.

The scale of the investment, even in the wake of the giant Covid relief bill, is striking.
Biden made clear in his speech on Wednesday that this is the point when the US ‚Äúfinally
address the climate crisis as a nation‚Äù, according to an administration official.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot to like in this plan, it‚Äôs excellent in almost every way,‚Äù said Julio Friedmann,
who was a climate and energy adviser in Barack Obama‚Äôs administration and is now an
energy researcher at Columbia University.



‚ÄúThis is a generational commitment and it can only be applauded. The $2tn is half the
price tag of World War Two, it exceeds the scale of the New Deal, it‚Äôs wildly larger than
the Marshall Plan ‚Äì and appropriately so. This is the hardest thing we‚Äôve ever done.
People generally don‚Äôt understand how much construction and reduction is required.‚Äù

But even the administration‚Äôs allies concede further, longer-term spurs to remodel the
economy and alter behavior will be required on top of this plan.

The package includes a major boost to clean energy research and development, as well as
a proposal for a clean electricity standard ‚Äì a mandate for utilities to phase out fossil fuels
use across the grid to zero over the next 15 years that Friedmann said will be a ‚Äúvital‚Äù
element of eliminating planet-hearting emissions.

But these measures will, like the new spending, require congressional support that is far
from guaranteed. Republicans have recoiled from Biden‚Äôs idea of raising corporate tax
rates to help pay for the investments, with Mitch McConnell, the GOP‚Äôs Senate leader,
calling the plan a ‚ÄúTrojan horse‚Äù for climate measures the party doesn‚Äôt support.

‚ÄúIn an ideal world this plan would be part of a set of policies to lower emissions but with
American politics it‚Äôs not clear the rest of it will happen,‚Äù said David Popp, a climate
policy expert at Syracuse University. ‚ÄúInfrastructure alone won‚Äôt get you to net zero
emissions. The hope is that you build a green economy to the point where emissions
reduction mandates become more doable.‚Äù

Progressives, meanwhile, have complained that Biden‚Äôs plan does not meet the scale of
the climate crisis.

‚ÄúNeeds to be way bigger,‚Äù tweeted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic
representative from New York. Ocasio-Cortez and her allies back an alternative $10tn
plan, called the Thrive Act, that proponents say would create 15m new jobs and cut
emissions in half by the end of the decade. Rallies are set to be held across the US on
Wednesday by climate activists who support this plan.

Communities of color, which often suffer the brunt of the climate crisis, helped elect
Biden and ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to make sure that our government delivers a real recovery that
recognizes the harsh reality our communities continue to face on the ground,‚Äù according
to Elizabeth Yeampierre, co-chair of the Climate Justice Alliance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had enough
excuses, enough delays.‚Äù

The Biden plan is a ‚Äúbig opening gambit, a big down payment, but it‚Äôs not the totality
required,‚Äù said Friedmann. ‚ÄúIt focuses on what‚Äôs actionable quickly that yields big
emissions abatement. I would like more too, but it‚Äôs easy to throw rocks from the outside.
It‚Äôs a great start but, yes, we will ultimately need more. For the next 30 years, every week
is infrastructure week.‚Äù

GUA-2021-66.txt,"Rapid global heating is hurting farm productivity, study
finds



Oliver Milman

1 avril 2021

The climate crisis is already eating into the output of the world‚Äôs agricultural systems,
with productivity much lower than it would have been if humans hadn‚Äôt rapidly heated
the planet, new research has found.

G7 should double help for poorer countries to cut CO2 emissions,
says UN

Advances in technology, fertilizer use and global trade have
allowed food production to keep pace with a booming global
population since the 1960s, albeit with gross inequities that still
leave millions of people suffering from malnutrition.

But rising temperatures in this time have acted as a handbrake to farming productivity of
crops and livestock, according to the new research, published in Nature Climate Change.
Productivity has actually slumped by 21% since 1961, compared to if the world hadn‚Äôt
been subjected to human-induced heating.

With the global population set to rise to more than 9 billion by 2050, the UN‚Äôs Food and
Agriculture Organization has estimated that food production will have to increase by
about 70%, with annual crop production increasing by almost one 1bn tonnes and meat
production soaring by more than 200m tonnes a year by this point.

Meanwhile, global temperatures are rising at a rate that scientists warn is extremely
dangerous for human civilization.

‚ÄúThe impact already is larger than I thought it would be,‚Äù said Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, an
economist at Cornell University who led the research.

‚ÄúIt was a big surprise to me. The worry I have is that research and development in
agriculture takes decades to translate into higher productivity. The projected temperature
increase is so fast I don‚Äôt know if we are going to keep pace with that.‚Äù

The research measured productivity by inputs ‚Äì such as labor, fertilizer and equipment ‚Äì
and the output in food they produce, using a model to determine how climate change has
influenced this relationship.

While farming has generally become far more efficient in recent decades, it is increasingly
menaced by heatwaves that exhaust farm workers and wither certain crops. Extreme
weather events and drought can also affect the output of a farm, particularly smaller
operations in poorer countries.



In 2019, scientists who analyzed the top 10 global crops that provide the majority of our
food calories found that climate change is reducing the worldwide production of staples
such as rice and wheat. Again, less affluent countries are suffering worst from this
situation.

The intensification of farming to boost output has in itself caused major environmental
damage, through the deforestation of grazing land, loss of valuable topsoil, pollution from
pesticides and the release of vast amounts of greenhouse gases that contribute to global
heating.

‚ÄúUltimately we want to increase productivity in a changing climate but a bad way to do
that is by increasing inputs such as land and water,‚Äù said Ortiz-Bobea. ‚ÄúIf we were more
productive we could produce more with less of an environmental footprint.‚Äù

Weston Anderson, a researcher of food security and climate at Columbia University who
was not involved in the study, said the new research provides fresh insight into the
magnitude of the impact upon agriculture.

‚ÄúThe regions that this paper highlights as experiencing the largest reductions in
agricultural productivity ‚Äì Central America and the Sahel ‚Äì contain some of the least food
secure countries in the world, which is a real concern,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt means that populations that were already food insecure are shouldering the heaviest
burden of climate change, and highlights the importance of doing all that we can to
improve agricultural production in these vulnerable regions immediately.‚Äù

GUA-2021-67.txt,"Climate crisis 'likely cause' of early cherry blossom in
Japan



30 mars 2021

Japan‚Äôs famous cherry blossoms have reached their flowery peak in many places earlier
this year than at any time since formal records began nearly 70 years ago, with experts
saying the climate crisis is the likely cause.

Referred to in Japan as sakura, the blossoms used to reach their peak in April, coinciding
with the start of the new school and business year. Yet the blooms have been creeping
earlier, and now most years the flowers are largely gone before the first day of school.

This year, peak bloom was reached on 26 March in the ancient capital of Kyoto, the
earliest since the Japan Meteorological Agency started collecting the data in 1953 and 10
days ahead of the 30-year average. Similar records were set this year in more than a dozen
cities across Japan.

Some say it is the earliest peak bloom ever, based on records from historic documents,
diaries and poetry books from Kyoto. Osaka Prefecture University environmental scientist
Yasuyuki Aono, who tracks such documents, said the earliest blooms he has found before
this year were on 27 March in the years 1612, 1409 and 1236, although there are not
records for some years.

‚ÄúWe can say it‚Äôs most likely because of the impact of the global warming,‚Äù said Shunji
Anbe, an official at the observations division at the Japan Meteorological Agency.

The agency tracks 58 ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù cherry trees across the country, and this year 40 of
those already have reached their peak bloom and 14 have done so in record time. The
trees normally bloom for about two weeks each year from first bud to all the blossoms
falling off.

Cherry trees are sensitive to temperature changes and the timing of their blooming can
provide valuable data for climate change studies, Anbe says.

According to the agency data, the average temperature for March in Kyoto has climbed to
10.6C (51.1F) in 2020 from 8.6C in 1953. So far this year‚Äôs average March temperature in
Japan has been 12.4C.

Sakura have deeply influenced Japanese culture for centuries and regularly been used in
poetry and literature, with their fragility seen as a symbol of life, death and rebirth.

GUA-2021-68.txt,"UK criticised for ignoring Paris climate goals in
infrastructure decisions



Fiona Harvey

30 mars 2021

Prominent scientists and lawyers have said the UK government‚Äôs decision to ignore the
Paris climate agreement when deciding on major infrastructure projects undermines its
presidency of UN climate talks this year.

The experts ‚Äì including the former Nasa scientist Jim Hansen, the former UK
government chief scientist Sir David King and the economist Prof Jeffrey Sachs ‚Äì have
written to ministers and the supreme court about a recent ruling that the government
need not take the UK‚Äôs obligations under the treaty into account when setting policy,
made in a case concerning the proposed expansion of Heathrow airport.

Green campaigners took the government to court in 2019 over its decision to allow the
expansion of Heathrow, arguing that the increase in air travel it would enable was
incompatible with the UK‚Äôs obligations under the Paris agreement to try to hold global
heating to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.

The court of appeal agreed in February 2020 that the government should have taken the
Paris goals into account, but the supreme court reversed that ruling last December.

The UK is due to host the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November, regarded as one of the
last chances to put the world on track to meet the Paris goals.

‚ÄúThe highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed
even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our
collective survival depends,‚Äù says the letter, signed by more than 130 scientists, legal and
environmental experts.

‚ÄúIndeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to
consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that
undermine the UK‚Äôs status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It

and its implications for protest and dissent, amplified by the police and crime bill now
passing through parliament that could in effect outlaw most forms of public

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extremely worrying, as we pride ourselves in Britain on having developed a true

GUA-2021-69.txt,"UK criticised for ignoring Paris climate goals in
infrastructure decisions



Fiona Harvey

30 mars 2021

Prominent scientists and lawyers have said the UK government‚Äôs decision to ignore the
Paris climate agreement when deciding on major infrastructure projects undermines its
presidency of UN climate talks this year.

The experts ‚Äì including the former Nasa scientist Jim Hansen, the former UK
government chief scientist Sir David King and the economist Prof Jeffrey Sachs ‚Äì have
written to ministers and the supreme court about a recent ruling that the government
need not take the UK‚Äôs obligations under the treaty into account when setting policy,
made in a case concerning the proposed expansion of Heathrow airport.

Green campaigners took the government to court in 2019 over its decision to allow the
expansion of Heathrow, arguing that the increase in air travel it would enable was
incompatible with the UK‚Äôs obligations under the Paris agreement to try to hold global
heating to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels.

The court of appeal agreed in February 2020 that the government should have taken the
Paris goals into account, but the supreme court reversed that ruling last December.

The UK is due to host the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November, regarded as one of the
last chances to put the world on track to meet the Paris goals.

‚ÄúThe highest court in the UK has set a precedent that major national projects can proceed
even where they are inconsistent with maintaining the temperature limit on which our
collective survival depends,‚Äù says the letter, signed by more than 130 scientists, legal and
environmental experts.

‚ÄúIndeed, the precedent goes further still. It says that the government is not bound even to
consider the goals of an agreement that is near universally agreed. Not only does that
undermine the UK‚Äôs status as a champion of the Paris agreement just ahead of Cop26. It
also substantially reduces humanity‚Äôs prospects of maintaining that limit and hence
averting disaster.‚Äù

The letter urges the government and the supreme court to rethink. ‚ÄúWe remind the court
of its own obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 to safeguard the right to life.
That entails taking all reasonable measures to ensure respect for the entirety of the Paris
agreement.‚Äù

GUA-2021-70.txt,"UK urged to take lead in helping poor countries fund
climate action



Fiona Harvey

29 mars 2021

Boris Johnson‚Äôs government must take the lead in giving poor countries access to the
finance they need to tackle the climate crisis, to make vital climate talks a success, the
UN‚Äôs development chief has said.

Ministers from around the world will meet virtually this week at a conference hosted by
the UK to discuss the needs of developing nations struggling to cut their greenhouse gas
emissions, as their economies have been left reeling by the Covid pandemic.

The UK will need the support of more than 130 developing countries to make a success of
the Cop26 UN climate summit, to be hosted in Glasgow this November. But relationships
with poor nations have been hit by the government‚Äôs decision to slash overseas aid by
billions of pounds.

Achim Steiner, the administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), urged
governments to show the same will to tackle climate breakdown as they were showing
with the recovery from the pandemic. He said: ‚ÄúWe need to arrive at a mindset like the
Marshall plan, a bigger vision that we need to recover [from Covid-19] together, a new
investment paradigm for a global economy, not an aid or charity paradigm.‚Äù

Helping developing countries invest would reduce global emissions and benefit all
countries, said Steiner. ‚ÄúWhat will be critical [at Cop26] is to find a way to finance the
acceleration of climate action and higher ambition on emissions. This must be a collective
effort, a joint undertaking,‚Äù he told the Guardian in an interview.

Cop26 comes at a crucial time, as developing countries face key decisions on how to help
their economies recover from the Covid crisis. Many are under pressure to continue with
fossil fuels, but investments now in coal, oil or other high-carbon infrastructure will lock
in high emissions for decades to come.

‚ÄúIt is not in the interests of industrialised countries to wait another year [to assist
investment],‚Äù Steiner said. ‚ÄúGlobal climate action is dependent on being able to solve the
financial challenges and fiscal dilemma [over investing in fossil fuels or clean energy] that
countries will be confronted with at Glasgow.‚Äù

The UK‚Äôs decision to cut overseas aid from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5% a year will not directly
affect its spending on climate finance, which has been ringfenced at ¬£11.6bn from 2021 to
2025. However, many in the climate talks are concerned that it will provide cover for
other rich nations to cut spending ahead of Cop26.



Steiner said: ‚ÄúIt sends a very mixed signal, and makes developing countries very
concerned. It certainly does not enhance the confidence with which developing countries
come to the table.‚Äù

Poor countries are already concerned that a longstanding promise, made in 2009, that
rich countries would ensure flows of $100bn (¬£72bn) a year to the developing world by
2020, to help countries cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown,
have not been met. The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, told the Guardian in
December that having a credible plan to meet this target would be essential to agreement
at Cop26.

Steiner also wants to see the UK spearhead innovative ways for poor countries to cope
with their debt mountain, and raise capital for investment, for instance through ‚Äúgreen‚Äù
bonds.

Help from rich countries is needed because the cost of capital to poor countries is so high:
a 10-year Kenyan government bond trades at a yield of 12.6% compared with 1.6% for the
US, with other countries showing similar or higher rates. ‚ÄúThe harsh reality is that the
cost of borrowing is so prohibitively higher for a developing country,‚Äù said Steiner.

Debt repayment costs are also crippling developing economies. The World Bank recently
estimated that 2.5% of this year‚Äôs debt service payments for poor countries, amounting to
about $28bn, would be enough to vaccinate 2 billion people in the poor world.

The UN is pushing for debt suspension or forgiveness for some of the worst-hit
economies. Forthcoming research by the UNDP has found that 72 vulnerable countries
are facing $600bn in debt service payments from 2021 to 2025. Of these, 23 countries
with $387bn in debt payments owed are not covered by existing debt relief programmes.

‚ÄúThe debt issue is constraining them,‚Äù said Steiner. ‚ÄúWe are asking a lot from developing
countries [at Cop26] that are under great debt distress, when their cost of borrowing is so
much higher than industrialised countries.‚Äù

Separately, green campaigners have written to the UK government ahead of this week‚Äôs
ministerial meeting to call for the overseas aid budget to be restored, warning that failure
to do so would undermine the UK‚Äôs credibility as hosts of Cop26.

Amanda Khozi Mukwashi, the chief executive of Christian Aid, said: ‚ÄúIn the year of
Cop26, as host and significant emitter, all eyes are on the UK to lead the world in stepping
up ambition on climate action. Vulnerable countries on the frontline of a climate
emergency they did not cause need financial support. If the UK is to deliver a successful
climate summit, then this week‚Äôs meeting must restore the much-needed aid, ensure that
debts are cancelled, and commit the finance needed to help poorer nations adapt to a
changing climate.‚Äù

GUA-2021-71.txt,"Climate change: rainfall threatens spectacular
Northumberland carved fireplace



fireplace-cragside

Mark Brown

29 mars 2021

A race has begun to prevent one of the most spectacular fireplaces in the UK from
crumbling because of the increase in heavy rainfall brought about by climate change.

The drawing room fireplace at Cragside, Northumberland, is deliberately over the top, the
National Trust‚Äôs property curator, Clara Woolford, said. ‚ÄúIt is ridiculously extravagant and
is in stark contrast to the rest of the house, which was intentional.‚Äù

Carved from Italian marble and alabaster, the fireplace is 6 metres tall, floor to ceiling,
and weighs 10 tonnes. Many people find it flamboyant and gaudy, words that are arguably
an understatement.

Carr/National Trust Images

‚ÄúIt is definitely visibly spectacular and all our visitors are wowed by it. It gets talked about
and it is definitely one of the centrepieces of a visit to Cragside, but yes, it is not to
everybody‚Äôs taste,‚Äù said Woolford. ‚ÄúIt is very ostentatious.‚Äù

The fireplace was commissioned by the house‚Äôs owners, Lord and Lady Armstrong, and
was completed in time for a royal visit in 1884 by the the prince and princess of Wales, the
future king Edward VII and Alexandra.

Cragside is a pioneering and extraordinary place for many reasons, not least being the fact
that it was the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. Water also
powered unheard-of luxuries including a passenger lift and central heating.

Ironically, it is water that is the problem now. Woolford said: ‚ÄúWe noticed recently that
the fireplace was showing significant signs of salt efflorescence, which is when salts begin
to appear on the surface of the stone or plasterwork.

‚ÄúIt is caused by moisture moving through the stone and then evaporating. When the salt
builds up in the ‚Äòpores‚Äô of the material, it ultimately breaks apart.‚Äù

Woolford said the process was almost like a disease in that it starts in a small area and
spreads through the weaker sections of stone ‚Äì in this case the veins of the marble. If
untreated, the fireplace could quickly crumble.

Northumberland is no stranger to rain, but the nature of the rain today is causing the
problems. ‚ÄúThe Victorian drainage system doesn‚Äôt support 21st-century weather
conditions,‚Äù said Woolford. ‚ÄúWinters at Cragside are wetter and much longer, due to
climate change. We are more prone to significant bursts of rain and stormy weather.‚Äù

Trust Images/John Hammond

Conservation work to stabilise the fireplace has begun and will be followed by measures to
prevent the moisture from getting into the house.

‚ÄúIt will take a long time to draw out all the salts,‚Äù said Woolford, who is optimistic that the
fireplace can be saved. ‚ÄúBy removing the source of moisture and controlling the
environmental conditions in the room, we reduce the impact of the salts in the long term.
It will take years to fully dry out.‚Äù

William Armstrong, sometimes known as ‚Äúthe magician of the north‚Äù, is something of a
forgotten genius. Aged 24, he came up with the idea of hydraulic power while trout fishing
in the River Dee.

He created a business on the north bank of the Tyne that employed 25,000 people
building hydraulic cranes, ships and armaments. He built Newcastle‚Äôs swing bridge and
created the mechanisms that raise London‚Äôs Tower Bridge.

The home he created at Cragside, one of the most technically advanced of the Victorian
age, was full of gadgets ahead of their time, such as a dishwasher and a rotating spit in the
kitchen.

The house was designed by Norman Shaw and was meant as a show home to impress
clients of Armstrong‚Äôs armaments business. Guests at his palace of wonders included the
shah of Persia, the king of Siam and the prime minister of China.

The royal couple and their children stayed at Cragside during their northern tour because
they wanted to experience luxuries that were superior even to those in a royal palace.

What they thought of the fireplace is not recorded, but illustrations were made showing
them in front of it.

The National Trust said the important conservation work was happening thanks to a
donation from the Wolfson Foundation, a grant from the government‚Äôs culture recovery
fund and support from a private donor.

GUA-2021-72.txt,"Climate talks will test Biden‚Äôs pledge to make global
heating a priority



Edward Helmore

27 mars 2021

Joe Biden is doubling down on his reset of his predecessor‚Äôs environmental policies by
inviting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping of China to the first big
climate talks of his administration next month aimed at increasing cooperation to fight
global heating.

The Leaders Summit on Climate talks, scheduled to be held virtually on 22 and 23 April,
are an opportunity for the US to shape, hasten and deepen global efforts to cut climate-
wrecking fossil fuel pollution, administration officials told the Associated Press.

According to the White House, 40 invitations went out on Friday to leaders that
encompass a range of nations, some already affected badly by climate crisis, others on a
spectrum from relatively reformist to ultra-polluters.

‚ÄúIn his invitation, the president urged leaders to use the summit as an opportunity to
outline how their countries also will contribute to stronger climate ambition,‚Äù the White
House said.

Dizzying pace of Biden's climate action sounds death knell for era of denialism

Biden‚Äôs effort is an arena in which the US can display clear differentiation with the
previous Donald Trump administration, which had rejected the 2015 UN Paris climate
accords in favor of an America First energy policy that, among other contentious
initiatives, rejected improving energy-efficiency standards and promoted domestic
fracking to reduce foreign-energy dependence.

The talks are also designed to revive a US-convened forum of the world‚Äôs major
economies on climate that previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, had
allowed to lapse. They will also mark the first time a US leader has attended a major
international climate discussions in more than four years.

The summit is also a fulfillment of a campaign pledge and executive order by Biden
designed to launch in tandem with an anticipated multi-trillion dollar infrastructure
spending package designed both to stimulate the post-Covid US economy and sharply cut
emissions of greenhouse gasses from legacy fuel sources.

As a candidate in the 2020 election, Biden pledged $2tn in investment to help transform
the US into a zero-emission economy by 2050 while building clean-energy and technology
jobs.



Officials said they hope that by demonstrating US commitment to emissions cuts at home,
the US could encourage similar moves abroad, including encouraging governments to
reform transportation and power-generating sectors as well as broader consumer
economies to meet more ambitious environmental targets

But the talks will test Biden‚Äôs pledge to make climate crisis a priority among competing
political, economic, policy, pandemic and post-pandemic issues, according to AP.

Led by US climate envoy John Kerry, US officials have reportedly been emphasizing US
climate intentions during early one-on-one talks with foreign leaders. Biden reportedly
discussed the talks with British prime minister Boris Johnson on Friday, with both
leaders agreeing on the need to keep emissions-cutting targets ambitious.

A summary of the conversation provided by the White House said the pair discussed ‚Äúthe
importance of developing ambitious climate goals, noting the opportunities provided by
the Leaders Summit on Climate and the UK‚Äôs G7 presidency‚Äù.

But officials also told the AP the US is still deliberating on how far the administration will
go in setting more ambitious US emissions targets. The talks, they said, will be
livestreamed to encourage other international leaders to use it as a platform to showcase
their own countries‚Äô climate-crisis commitments.

However, despite the emphasis on global cooperation, early administration efforts to
reshape US relations with China got off to a problematic start last week during high-level
talks in Anchorage, Alaska that began with an exchange of insults.

Against that backdrop, the climate talks ‚Äì coming seven months ahead of November‚Äôs UN
global climate sessions in Glasgow ‚Äì will offer a deliberate test of whether, after four years
of isolationist and aggressive diplomatic non-compliance, the US still has power to shape
global decision-making.

Biden‚Äôs invitation list includes leaders of the world‚Äôs biggest economies and European
blocs. But it is not yet clear how Russia and China, both on the list of invitees, will
respond or if they are willing to cooperate with any US-led climate initiative.

While China lags the US in overall economic might, it is the world‚Äôs top emitter of climate-
damaging pollution, with the US second, India third and Russia at four.

‚ÄúChina is by far the world‚Äôs largest emitter. Russia needs to do more to reduce its
emissions,‚Äù said Nigel Purvis, who worked on climate diplomacy in past Democratic and
Republican administrations. ‚ÄúNot including these countries because they aren‚Äôt doing
enough would be like launching an anti-smoking campaign but not directing it at
smokers.‚Äù

Brazil‚Äôs rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, is also likely to be in the diplomatic
crosshairs for thwarting preservation efforts of the Amazon rainforest, a vital global
carbon sink.



Among those invited are leaders of countries under the most immediate ‚Äì and devastating
‚Äì ecological threat. They include Bangladesh and the Marshall islands, both threatened by
rising sea levels.

The invitation list is notable for other reasons, too: King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud,
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is invited. But heir apparent Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, subject to a diplomatic freeze out over what US intelligence agencies conclude
was his approval of an operation to ‚Äúcapture or kill‚Äù US-based journalist Jamal
Khashoggi, is left out.

GUA-2021-73.txt,"Joe Biden invites 40 world leaders to virtual summit on
climate crisis



27 mars 2021

Joe Biden has invited 40 world leaders to a virtual summit on the climate crisis, the White
House said in a statement on Friday.

Heads of state, including Xi Jinping of China and Russia‚Äôs Vladimir Putin, have been
asked to attend the two-day meeting meant to mark Washington‚Äôs return to the front lines
of the fight against human-caused climate change, after Donald Trump disengaged from
the process.

‚ÄúThey know they‚Äôre invited,‚Äù Biden said of Xi and Putin. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt spoken to either
one of them yet.‚Äù

The start of the summit on 22 April coincides with Earth Day, and will come ahead of a
major UN meeting on the crisis, scheduled for November in Glasgow, Scotland.

Biden‚Äôs event is being staged entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The president kept his campaign pledge to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on his first
day in the White House, after Trump pulled out of the deal.

The return of the world‚Äôs largest economy and second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide
became effective on 19 February and means almost all countries are now parties to the
agreement signed in 2015.

By the time of the summit, the US will have announced ‚Äúan ambitious 2030 emissions
target‚Äù, according to a White House statement, and it will encourage others to boost their
own goals under the Paris agreement.

Dizzying pace of Biden's climate action sounds death knell for era of denialism

‚ÄúThe summit will also highlight examples of how enhanced climate ambition will create
good-paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt
to climate impacts,‚Äù the White House said in a statement.

The US has invited the leaders of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate,
which includes the 17 countries responsible for about 80% of global emissions and GDP,
as well as heads of countries that are especially vulnerable to climate impacts or are
demonstrating strong climate leadership.

The US president has placed global heating at the heart of his agenda and has already
made waves domestically by pledging to make the energy sector emissions-neutral by
2035, followed by the economy as a whole by 2050.



He has also placed a hold on new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and offshore and is
expected to soon seek a $2tn infrastructure package from Congress that would serve as
the engine of future economic growth.

Biden dispatched his climate envoy, the former secretary of state John Kerry, to prepare
the ground for the summit in meetings with European leaders earlier this month.

The meeting comes as the world is lagging badly in its efforts to limit end-of-century
warming to 1.5C (2.7F), which scientists say is necessary to avoid triggering climate
tipping points that would leave much of the planet inhospitable.

In an assessment of pledges made in recent months by around 75 countries and the
European Union, UN Climate Change said that only about 30% of global emissions were
covered in the commitments.

GUA-2021-74.txt,"Planet Defenders: CBBC to air children's show on
nature and the climate crisis



climate-crisis

Tara Conlan

26 mars 2021

The BBC is airing a season of programmes for children about nature and the battle to save
the planet, beginning with a series featuring six young conservationists following in the
footsteps of Sir David Attenborough.

Called Planet Defenders, the show comprises six films presented by leading young natural
history film-makers from around the world, including Chris Packham‚Äôs stepdaughter
Megan McCubbin and World Wildlife Fund ambassador Jack Harries.

The show is made by the BBC Studios natural history department which has been
associated with Attenborough‚Äôs authored documentaries for decades, and showcases the
next generation of wildlife documentary presenters and film-makers.

In Planet Defenders each of the six conservationists explore an endangered species or
issue ‚Äúclose to our hearts‚Äù, McCubbin told the Guardian.

The six include Ashwika Kapur, an award-winning Indian natural history documentary-
maker who examines the plight of hoolock gibbons suffering the loss of their habitat;
American camera operator Erin Ranney, who investigates why rockhopper penguins have
declined by 80% since the 1930s; and Malaika Vaz, a 23-year-old National Geographic
Society explorer, presenter and wildlife film-maker from Goa who highlights the dangers
facing elephants.

According to the BBC, the show is ‚Äúabout hope‚Äù and inspiring young audiences to make a
difference.

Zoologist McCubbin, who appeared on BBC‚Äôs Springwatch with Packham last year,
explores the predicament of sharks off the coast of the UK. She said that the climate crisis
is ‚Äúdaunting and overwhelming‚Äù for many people, particularly youngsters, but there is
hope in Planet Defenders.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs honest storytelling and it‚Äôs talking about the solutions we have to put forward. We
have to have those hard conversations ‚Ä¶ ignorance is not bliss; if we turn our back on
what‚Äôs going on then we turn our back on our future.

‚ÄúWhen I was growing up I was always out and about and into nature. Now it‚Äôs no longer
enough to love nature; it‚Äôs suffering a severe decline ‚Ä¶ and we have to do something about
it.‚Äù

When asked about her future as a presenter, she said: ‚ÄúI love the job, getting to share
those stories [so] they reach new audiences. If I can get young people into natural history
and climate science through telling these stories then that‚Äôs great.‚Äù



McCubbin said also that ‚Äúthe mental health benefits watching natural history has have
been proven to be beneficial‚Äù, and she will often ‚Äúput a David Attenborough film on or
something similar ‚Ä¶ it provides that bit of escapism and you can lose yourself in it.‚Äù

In his episode, Harries examines rewilding projects in the UK.

Harries, 27, grew up in a film-making family ‚Äì his environmental activist mother Rebecca
Frayn makes documentaries, and his Oscar-nominated father Andy Harries is the
producer behind hits such as The Crown ‚Äì and began his career on YouTube, where he
has almost 4 million subscribers, before studying documentary-making at university.

He was inspired to make natural history films by Attenborough and two years ago
interviewed the renowned presenter for a behind the scenes film on the set of
Attenborough‚Äôs Netflix and WWF series Our Planet.

‚ÄúAround the world we are losing wild spaces and the creatures that live in them at an
alarming rate [but] there is reason for hope as an amazing movement is happening that is
working to preserve natural landscapes and bring back species that have been pushed to
the edge of extinction,‚Äù he said.

Another of the film-makers, Jahawi Bertolli from Kenya, agreed, saying: ‚ÄúIt starts with
little steps, you build, you build, you build, you can see what you can do in your local
environment. I‚Äôm so positive about the future ‚Ä¶ I think we really can do it, if we do it
together.‚Äù

CBBC senior commissioning editor Melissa Hardinge said Planet Defenders ‚Äúfeels like a
brand new way of bringing natural history to a young audience ‚Äì a fresh, diverse, global
team of passionate film-makers with a very informal, self-authored style, who invite the
audience along on their mission to help endangered species.‚Äù

The new series, which airs on CBBC and iPlayer from 26 March, is part of Our Planet
Now, a pan-BBC initiative to make programmes that explore the challenges nature is
facing. Planet Defenders also kicks off a special week of nature programmes on CBBC,
including a Blue Peter Green Badge project and a new series called Maddie: Plants and
You.

GUA-2021-75.txt,"Tough climate policies key to coalition deal, Scottish
Greens say



Severin Carrell

25 mars 2021

The Scottish Greens would demand far tougher climate policies in exchange for agreeing
to a coalition deal with the Scottish National party after the May election.

Senior SNP strategists have mooted offering a coalition deal to the Greens as a way of
forming a pro-independence ‚Äúsuper majority‚Äù at Holyrood for the first time since the
party won power 14 years ago.

That follows a sustained dip in SNP support in some recent opinion polls, which has
dented expectations Nicola Sturgeon will easily win an overall majority at Holyrood on 6
May.

If she fails to win that majority, a formal government deal with the Greens would allow
Sturgeon to argue Holyrood had a mandate to demand a second referendum. The Greens
have five MSPs and expect to win several more seats in May.

Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, told the National newspaper earlier this
month he was open to the idea of a formal power-sharing deal, but a Greens spokesman
said there had not yet been any contact on that between the two parties.

Any formal deal would be a ‚Äúnon-starter‚Äù, he added, unless Sturgeon cancelled the
Scottish government‚Äôs road-building plans, which include dualling long trunk roads, and
dropped support for taxpayer subsidies for North Sea oil and gas extraction and
exploration.

‚ÄúIf any party wanted to speak to us they‚Äôd have to get serious on the climate emergency.
They would have to seriously shift on climate if they were to give us any ministerial posts,‚Äù
the spokesman said.

Any offer would need to be ratified first by party members, he said. SNP politicians and
members could resist a deal that tied the party‚Äôs hands: despite running minority
governments twice since 2007, the SNP has never entered into formal coalitions.

SNP strategists argue that a coalition government with the Greens could bolster the
Scottish government‚Äôs credentials before Glasgow hosts the Cop26 global climate talks in
November. Sturgeon‚Äôs climate policies have come under repeated attack from the Greens
for being far too timid.

Sturgeon has shifted away from calling for an early independence referendum after the
same polls found falling support, and opposition parties accused her of prioritising
constitutional conflict above Covid recovery and domestic policies.



The yes vote hit a record high of 58% at the peak of the Covid pandemic, with more than
20 polls in a row giving independence a majority, as voters endorsed Sturgeon‚Äôs
leadership during the crisis.

But with the success of the UK government‚Äôs vaccinations strategy, and the Alex Salmond
harassment crisis, it has since dropped. The elections expert Sir John Curtice said the last
six polls put yes and no support at ; for the first time in a year, some show a clear
lead for no. Others show a minority of voters favour a quick referendum.

Sturgeon‚Äôs recent shift towards prioritising the Covid recovery, and suggestions the SNP
would delay a referendum for at least two years, has put Scottish Labour under pressure
to offer a clear alternative to the SNP at the election.

With Nicola Sturgeon safe, the battle for the union is back on

Katy Balls

Anas Sarwar, the new Scottish Labour leader, told reporters on Thursday,
as he launched Labour‚Äôs campaign, he believed Sturgeon‚Äôs pledge to put
Covid first was insincere.

‚ÄúWhilst the Tories and SNP can talk about recovery, they‚Äôre both
compromised. The Tories can‚Äôt deliver a recovery that works for everyone
because they would have us go back to the failed system and inbuilt inequalities we had
pre-Covid,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe SNP will try and talk about recovery, but it‚Äôs not credible to say we‚Äôre going to come
through Covid and straight into a referendum campaign which is going to pull our country
further apart.‚Äù

Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said denying the SNP a majority on 6 May would
stop their quest for a second referendum.

‚ÄúWe know from the referendum bill they introduced on Monday that is going to be their
top priority, should they be re-elected as a majority. And therefore we have to stop that at
all costs,‚Äù he said.

GUA-2021-76.txt,"'We want to be included': First Nations demand a say
on climate change



change

Lorena Allam

26 mars 2021

More than 100 traditional owners and leading scientists from across Australia met this
week to build a national First Nations voice on climate change.

From marine heatwaves and rising seas to bushfires and mass species deaths, climate
change is having a major impact on First Peoples, their country, health and culture.

Internationally, Indigenous people make up less than 5% of the world‚Äôs population, but
they manage and protect 80% of global biodiversity.

This week in Cairns, the CSIRO convened the National First Peoples Gathering on Climate
Change. One hundred and twenty traditional owners from more than 40 nations met with
climate scientists and Bureau of Meteorology experts to share insights about where, why
and how fast the climate in Australia is changing.

The gathering‚Äôs co-chair, Bianca McNeair, who is a Malgana woman from Gatharagudu
(Shark Bay) in Western Australia, said: ‚ÄúWe want to be included in the climate policy, not
just like ticking the box for an environmental program.‚Äù

Rio Tinto pledges to protect cultural heritage after Juukan Gorge disaster

McNeair said Aboriginal people are on the frontline daily, coping with the impacts of a
changing environment.

‚ÄúChanging climate affects our cultural practices, it‚Äôs changing our seasonal calendars,‚Äù she
said. ‚ÄúAll of those things are facing all our mob across Australia.

‚Äú[People here] are talking about how the birds‚Äô movements across country have changed,
so that‚Äôs changing songlines that they‚Äôve been singing for thousands and thousands of
years, and how that‚Äôs impacting them as a community and culture.

‚ÄúYou know, we are very resilient people, so it‚Äôs a challenge we were ready to take on. But
now we‚Äôre facing a situation that‚Äôs not predictable, it‚Äôs not part of our natural
environmental pattern.‚Äù

McNeair said Aboriginal knowledge holders and the scientific community at the
conference have agreed on guidelines for ethical and culturally appropriate partnerships,
which are essential to mitigation and adaptation.



On her homelands at Gatharagudu at Shark Bay, working with scientists, they‚Äôve begun
planting sea grasses for carbon sequestration.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre learning from the scientists how to plant the seagrass, which was not something
that was part of our traditional culture because we never really had to do that ‚Äì it was
managed through other means. We didn‚Äôt have this whole global warming, which is
raising the temperature of our water,‚Äù McNeair said.

‚ÄúWe were saying to the scientists, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs wrong with our dugong and turtles?‚Äô And they
were explaining about the marine heatwave, and how that‚Äôs all changing.

‚ÄúSo one of the things that I‚Äôve learned is what the [seagrass] seedlings look like, and how
to plant them.

‚ÄúFor me, as a saltwater person, that means I‚Äôm planting a tree in the ocean, and I‚Äôm
planting a tree that‚Äôs going to take in 10 times more carbon than a tree on land. That, to
me, is really exciting and it‚Äôs keeping our spiritual connection to country that keeps giving
us hope.‚Äù

The gathering is currently drafting a national statement on climate change, due to be
released soon.

‚ÄúAboriginal people manage 80% of the world‚Äôs biodiversity,‚Äù McNeair says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in this
position where we can make a big change, but we need to be listened to.

‚ÄúWhat we really need is to be able to get to the top levels of government and be heard and
be included in that discussion and developing those climate change policies.‚Äù

GUA-2021-77.txt,"Fears climate crisis could increase allergy season
severity by up to 60%



26 mars 2021

The climate emergency could increase future allergy season severity by up to 60%, a new
pollen forecasting system suggests, while a separate system could predict the severity of
grass pollen seasons months in advance.

Such tools could help health professionals prepare for an increase in hay fever cases, or
hospital admissions for allergy-related asthma. Seasonal pollen forecasts could also
enable some hay fever sufferers to avoid particularly severe seasons by, for example,
travelling abroad.

About a quarter of people in Britain experience pollen allergy or hay fever, with the
numbers increasing every year. Although daily pollen counts can be predicted based on
the next day‚Äôs weather forecast and the time of year, making longer-term predictions for
specific towns or regions is more difficult ‚Äì meaning there is no clear guidance on how
best to prepare for allergy seasons.

Whereas previous studies have predicted an increase in allergies as a result of the climate
crisis, they have usually involved extrapolating observations of increased pollen
concentrations in recent decades forwards. ‚ÄúThese studies are by nature retrospective and
do not predict what will happen 30 years from now,‚Äù said Carsten Skj√∏th, professor in
atmospheric sciences at the University of Worcester.

To address these gaps, Skj√∏th and his colleagues built two separate forecasting systems.
The first, which is designed for longer-term assessments such as the impact of the climate
emergency or mitigation scenarios, combined observations of how carbon dioxide affects
grass growth with data on how the weather affects pollen productivity.

‚ÄúHere we have a dynamic vegetation model that predicts ‚Äì and displays on a map ‚Äì the
expected increase in pollen concentrations in a future climate,‚Äù Skj√∏th said.

How urban planners' preference for male trees has made your hay fever worse

Assuming a doubling of carbon dioxide levels, this would translate into an increase in
future grass pollen allergy season severity of up to 60%, although how quickly this
happened would depend on the effectiveness of climate crisis mitigation strategies.

The second forecasting system combined measurements of air temperature, precipitation,
and pollen concentrations at 28 pollen monitoring stations in north-west Europe over
many years. Tests showed it could predict the severity of the grass pollen season based on
pre-seasonal weather patterns, which can affect grass growth and pollen production.



‚ÄúThis is a new type of information that can be used for long-term planning instead of day-
to-day planning, and importantly for planning before the season has started,‚Äù said Skj√∏th,
whose research was published in Science. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt give you a precise number, but it will
tell you whether the upcoming season will be particularly severe ‚Äì a bit like when the Met
Office releases its predictions in the autumn about whether we will get a wet or severe
winter.

‚ÄúIf we know in advance that we are going to get a very severe pollen season, it could
provide information about how much medication shops need to put on their shelves. It
can also help individuals to plan when to take annual leave, or even avoid the pollen
season by travelling to a different country.‚Äù

The new method could be combined with the latest generation of weather forecasting
systems, to create more accurate daily forecasts, he said.

Dr Rachel McInnes, science manager of air quality impacts at the Met Office, and a co-
author of the paper said: ‚ÄúFor sufferers, hay fever can be extremely debilitating and grass
pollen is the worst offender. So any insight into the likely severity of the forthcoming
pollen season across the UK will be truly welcomed.

‚ÄúUntil now it has been beyond the power of science to produce a long-range forecast,
partly because calculating the extent of pollen relies on meteorological as well as land-use
factors. But by combining land-use and weather models and monitoring results at a
number of study sites, the team has been able to make a breakthrough and provide the
tantalising prospect of long-range pollen forecasting.

‚ÄúFurther work is likely to include linking the team‚Äôs methods to atmospheric dispersion
models, and detailed maps of different individual grass species to provide increasing
sophistication.‚Äù

GUA-2021-78.txt,"'A bold agenda': hopes rise for US climate change
reversal as Deb Haaland sworn in



Dani Anguiano

25 mars 2021

After four years under an administration that denied the climate crisis, opened public
lands to oil and gas drilling and stripped protections from national monuments, the US
interior department will look radically different with Deb Haaland at its helm.

Haaland, the first Native American cabinet secretary in US history and a member of the
Laguna Pueblo, was sworn in to her post last week and has vowed to be a ‚Äúfierce advocate‚Äù
for public lands. Wildlife, parks and climate advocacy groups have hailed her
confirmation as a major win for public lands and say that under Haaland‚Äôs leadership the
interior department will renew its focus on fighting the climate emergency.

'I'll be fierce for all of us': Deb Haaland on climate, Native rights and Biden

‚ÄúShe was one of the first co-sponsors of the Green New Deal and really broadly has a bold
agenda for climate justice,‚Äù said Lily Gardner, a national spokesperson for the Sunrise
Movement. ‚ÄúThis is a huge and historic moment.‚Äù

Haaland is charged with managing natural resources and federal lands that comprise one-
fifth of the United States and are responsible for a quarter of the country‚Äôs annual carbon
emissions.

‚ÄúWhoever becomes secretary has an opportunity to combat climate change, to take this
25% carbon that our public lands are emitting right now and eliminate that,‚Äù Haaland
said in an interview with HuffPost before her confirmation.

As a US representative, Haaland backed the Green New Deal and sponsored a bill that
aimed to protect 30% of US lands and oceans by 2030, a commitment Biden later made
by executive order. In an opening statement at her Senate confirmation hearing, Haaland
said she would be an advocate for public lands, harness those lands‚Äô ‚Äúclean energy
potential‚Äù to create new jobs, and ensure interior department decisions are based on
science.

Bringing science back to the forefront is a crucial first step, said Kristen Brengel with the
National Parks Conservation Association, pointing to the National Parks Service, an
agency within the interior department.

National parks are warming twice as fast as the rest of the country, said Brengel, the
NPCA‚Äôs vice-president of government affairs. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing the effects, whether it‚Äôs
invasive species, wildfires, sea level rise or wildlife being pushed out of its usual habitat.‚Äù
These spaces must be protected, Brengel said, and there are encouraging signs that doing
so is a priority for the new administration.



The Biden administration has pledged to establish a Civilian Climate Corps to work on
‚Äúconserving and restoring public lands and waters and addressing climate change‚Äù and to
accelerate ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù development of renewable energy on public lands. The corps
established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s, by way of comparison,
put 3 million jobless Americans to work and helped create national park infrastructure.

In its first two months, the Biden administration has started to reverse some of Donald
Trump‚Äôs most controversial decisions, directing the interior department to review the
boundaries of the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments ‚Äì a step
toward restoring their protections ‚Äìand paused the sale of new oil and gas leases on
public lands. Biden has also asked the interior department to review that program.

The department announced last week that, as part of the review, it will hold a forum on
the oil and gas program, which will allow the public to provide input and include ‚Äúlabor
and environmental justice organizations, natural resource advocates and Indigenous
organizations‚Äù.

‚ÄúI think the encouraging thing is they want to do something and they‚Äôre being very
inclusive,‚Äù said David Willms, the senior director for western wildlife with the National
Wildlife Federation.

The review of the oil and gas program and the development of renewable energy on public
lands could help the administration reduce carbon emissions from public lands, Willms
said, but that needs to be done responsibly to ensure that frontline energy communities
and workers aren‚Äôt left behind. Haaland has pledged to work on behalf of these workers as
well as ranchers and farmers and communities harmed by pollution.

‚ÄúThe devil is in the details,‚Äù Willms said of the administration and department‚Äôs climate
agenda. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know exactly what they want to propose yet, but we know they
want to do something.‚Äù

The National Parks Conservation Association hopes to see the department move away
from the last administration‚Äôs energy dominance agenda, enhance water protections,
support more wildlife corridors and expand national park land. And Haaland is the right
person for the job, Brengel said.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better person in terms of looking for these opportunities than Secretary
Haaland,‚Äù Brengel said. ‚ÄúWe know she is dedicated ‚Ä¶ We think there is a hopeful future
here for addressing climate change.‚Äù

GUA-2021-79.txt,"The latest must-have among US billionaires? A plan to
end the climate crisis



By Oliver Milman, Dominic Rushe

25 mars 2021

The latest must-have for America‚Äôs ultra-rich isn‚Äôt another mega yacht or space program ‚Äì
it‚Äôs a plan to save the world from the climate crisis.

The race to zero: can America reach net-zero emissions by 2050?

Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and one of the richest people in the world, has pledged
$100m in prize money for technology that would best capture planet-heating carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder who tops the global rich
list, has vowed to give out $10bn to worthy climate initiatives. And Bill Gates, another
multibillionaire and Microsoft co-founder, has recently released a book on how to drive
emissions to zero.

Together, the three men have an estimated wealth of $466bn andsome of the biggest
personal carbon footprints on the planet. They are also emblematic of a Davos-centric
worldview that sees free markets and technological advancements as the answer to an
existential emergency already upending the lives of millions of people.

‚ÄúI think more like an engineer than a political scientist,‚Äù Gates declared in his new book,
urging measures such as a complete shift to synthetic beef. Musk has described the use of
fossil fuels as an ‚Äúinsane experiment‚Äù but has also called public transit an uncomfortable
‚Äúpain in the ass‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat excites these folks is technology and innovation,‚Äù said Bill Weihl, executive director
of Climate Voice who previously led clean energy and sustainability divisions at both
Google and Facebook. ‚ÄúThey compete with each other, if only subconsciously. The
mindset is to invest funds in a bunch of things and hope a few will really succeed.‚Äù

Fresh thinking will be needed to eliminate emissions from certain areas with few current
alternatives, such as steel-making and aviation, as well as to suck up CO  we have already
emitted. But, as Weihl points out, scientists have made clear humanity must urgently
slash emissions in half within the next decade to avoid disastrous global heating.

2

The mindset is to invest funds in a bunch of things and hope a few will really succeed

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a natural tendency to find the single silver bullet to a problem, but with climate
change it‚Äôs more like silver buckshot,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to deploy the heck out of
renewables and electric cars and heat pumps and everything else today, like crazy. We
don‚Äôt have time to only develop longer-term options.‚Äù



Climate campaigners have welcomed the interest and financial heft of the US‚Äôs wealthy
elite following a year when record wildfires and hurricanes pummeled a country suffering
the escalating consequences of global heating. But some also point out that the most
vulnerable Americans could benefit right away from less glamorous interventions, such as
more public green space and shade in cities to escape rising heat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great they are coming up with new ideas, but I think first and foremost we need to
ensure communities affected first and worst are resilient, rather than picking up the
pieces afterwards,‚Äù said Adrienne Hollis, an environmental justice campaigner at the
Union of Concerned Scientists. ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt exposed to something that many poorer
people and people of color are exposed to, you probably aren‚Äôt thinking about it as much.‚Äù

The billionaires will also have to garner broader societal buy-in to move their ideas
forward. ‚ÄúWhat they are doing is well-intentioned and impactful,‚Äù said Tom Steyer,
himself a billionaire and former Democratic presidential candidate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad they are
doing it. But we won‚Äôt succeed or fail based on just a few people. It will be because
everyone got on board, like in world war two.‚Äù

Elon Musk

What he‚Äôs doing: Musk‚Äôs day job is at the forefront of helping build a new low-
emissions world, with Tesla, maker of electric vehicles and home batteries, now the most
valuable car company in the world. The newly styled ‚Äútechnoking‚Äù also recently pledged
$100m to the winner of the X Prize for carbon capture, which he said would go to those
able to ‚Äúbuild real systems that can make a measurable impact and scale to a gigaton
level‚Äù. Teams will have to show how they can remove CO  from the atmosphere and
oceans and lock it away permanently. ‚ÄúWhatever it takes,‚Äù Musk said. ‚ÄúTime is of the
essence.‚Äù

2

Will it work? Scientists have made clear it will be extremely unlikely to bring emissions
down to zero quickly enough without some sort of ‚Äúovershoot‚Äù that will require emitted
CO  being removed from the atmosphere, either through a mass reforestation effort or
machines that are able to suck the gases directly from the air to be either buried
underground or put to some other use.

2

The problem is that such technology is relatively new and will need to be scaled up
massively to do the job ‚Äì one study found that limiting global heating to 1.5C above the
pre-industrial era will require capturing about 810bn tonnes of CO , equivalent to about
20 years of current emissions. Currently, carbon removal systems are fairly expensive and
require a lot of heat, and therefore emissions-causing energy, to operate.

2

‚ÄúElon Musk is a techno-optimist so it makes sense he‚Äôs going for carbon capture,‚Äù said
Andres Clarens, an environmental engineer at the University of Virginia who has
researched carbon capture options. ‚ÄúYou could create a new widget but scaling it up is the



real challenge; also, Musk also doesn‚Äôt touch on what to do with the CO  once you get it.
But if we can solve these things our toolkit to deal with climate will become far more
powerful.‚Äù

2

Bill Gates

Once one the world‚Äôs most ruthless businessmen, Gates has spent the last 20 years using
his fortune to tackle big issues including poverty, disease and climate change.

Breakthrough Energy, his investment fund, includes a bushel of billionaires in its backers
including Mike Bloomberg, George Soros and Mark Zuckerberg. It invests in high-risk,
long-term projects aimed a getting the world to net zero.

Among those investments is a plan to convert seawater into
microscopic particles to be sprayed into clouds, increasing their
whiteness and therefore their ability to reflect more sunlight back
into space, reducing global warming. The geo-engineering scheme
could fundamentally change the planet, whitening skies and
changing weather patterns and ocean currents. He also has
investments in new nuclear power plants and more traditional ‚Äúgreen‚Äù tech like solar and
wind.

His new book, How to Avoid a Climate Crisis, calls for tax changes and big investment
from governments to tackle what he calls the‚Äúgreen premium‚Äù, the cost difference
between a product that emits carbon and one that does not.

Will it work? Gates has many, many ideas and is a tireless advocate for the net zero
cause. But his big ideas may not pan out ‚Äì or prove politically acceptable. Even someone
of Gates‚Äôs wealth and influence may struggle to change the global political landscape. And,
again, his advocacy of the free markets that did so much to create the crisis we now face
undermines his legitimacy.

Yishan Wong

What he‚Äôs doing: Carbon removal systems already exist in nature, of course, in the form
of trees, soils and wetland. Yishan Wong, who was chief executive of Reddit, was inspired
by an academic paper he read on how mass reforestation could help stave off the climate
crisis. What if, he thought, he could aid an effort for the world to plant 1tn trees, which
would cover an area larger than the US and Mexico combined?

Four years later, Wong heads Terraformation, an organization that helps plan, nurture
and implement reforestation efforts. Starting in Hawaii, where Wong created the world‚Äôs
largest solar-powered desalination system to help sustain new stands of trees, the venture
has helped establish thousands of acres of new forest in countries as diverse as New
Zealand, Ecuador and Uganda.



‚ÄúWe are bringing a fusion of forestry expertise and Silicon Valley scalability,‚Äù said Wong.
‚ÄúOther solutions need that risk of R&D and then a prototype and then scale, whereas trees
have been around for a long time. They just need to be scaled. I thought about what could
I do best to help work at huge scale, with reliable components.‚Äù

Will it work? Trees, particularly the large, old growth individuals that have towered in
places such as California for hundreds of years, store a huge amount of carbon along with
soils that absorb them when they die and decompose, collectively holding about 80% of
all the carbon currently in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

An immediate priority, according to ecologists, is to prevent logging that is currently
rampant in crucial carbon stores such as the Amazon rainforest. Globally, an area of forest
the size of the UK is removed each year to make way for farmland, roads and
urbanization.

Planting 1tn trees would draw down a huge amount of CO , scientists have said, although
others have raised concerns ‚Äì over the vast amount of land needed, whether the type of
forests would actually support dwindling biodiversity and the decades it would take for
these trees to grow to a point where a significant amount of carbon is removed. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt
get to where we are now via natural processes and won‚Äôt get out of it via natural
processes,‚Äù said Clarens. ‚ÄúThe numbers don‚Äôt add up, there isn‚Äôt the land required for it.‚Äù

2

Wong said the land use issue can be solved by focusing on reforesting unproductive land
currently not used for anything else, as well as by irrigating barren, desert areas to
establish trees there. ‚ÄúIt appears we don‚Äôt have enough land but you can create additional
land by converting these areas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf we wait 100 years maybe this won‚Äôt be an
option but it is now, so let‚Äôs do it.‚Äù

Jeff Bezos

What he‚Äôs doing: In November, the Bezos Earth Fund doled out the first $791m in
grants to an array of conservation and climate solutions groups, in what Bezos said is just
the start of his giving to combat what he has called ‚Äúthe biggest threat to our planet‚Äù.

Bezos also established a climate pledge for Amazon where the delivery behemoth would
get to net zero CO  emissions by 2040, through a shift to renewable energy and the
purchase of 100,000 electric delivery vehicles. Dozens of other companies have vowed to
emulate Amazon‚Äôs target, perhaps the most high-profile being IBM.

2

Will it work? The sight of one of the world‚Äôs largest and most powerful companies
committing to climate action was welcomed by climate campaigners and has already
proved influential with other businesses. Others, however, have highlighted the lack of
detail in how Amazon will actually get to net zero emissions, while some of the company‚Äôs
workers are unhappy that Bezos refused to sever contracts that provide cloud computing
services to fossil fuel firms.



More broadly, the growing number of corporations making emissions reduction promises
is offset by a lack of political muscle, according to Weihl. A recent report found that the
US‚Äôs largest tech companies were spending comparatively very little on political lobbying.
‚ÄúAmazon was slow to get into the game but they are stepping up with the climate pledge,‚Äù
said Weihl.

‚ÄúBut these tech companies are letting big oil dominate the policy debate. Big oil is fighting
hard to weaken and delay policy while most other companies are sitting on the sidelines
rather than twisting arms. They need to lean in and make sure lawmakers know this is an
existential issue.‚Äù

GUA-2021-80.txt,"Rising risk of wildfires across UK from climate crisis,
scientists warn



24 mars 2021

Once-in-a-century weather extremes that pose the highest danger of wildfires could occur
every year in parts of the UK as the climate changes, scientists have said.

A study led by the University of Reading aimed to predict how the danger of blazes taking
hold would increase as a result of rising temperatures and less summer rainfall in the UK
in the coming decades.

It found parts of eastern and southern England may face the highest threat level ‚Äì
referred to as ‚Äúexceptional danger‚Äù ‚Äì on up to several days a year by 2080 if the world
continues to emit high levels of greenhouse gases. Today, those conditions occur once
every 50-100 years.

Days with exceptional danger would become more commonplace across the UK by 2080,
and those with a ‚Äúvery high‚Äù danger of wildfires could rise significantly, even in
traditionally wetter parts of the country.

The rise in fire danger is predominantly due to hotter temperatures, less rainfall, lower
humidity and stronger winds expected across the UK as a result of global heating, the
researchers said.

The findings highlight the importance of taking the threat of wildfires ‚Äì which can pose
environmental, health and economic risks ‚Äì seriously in the UK, as the problem is likely
to grow.

Prof Nigel Arnell, a climate scientist at the University of Reading who led the research,
said: ‚ÄúExtremely hot and dry conditions that are perfect for large wildfires are currently
rare in the UK, but climate change will make them more and more common.

‚ÄúIn future decades, wildfires could pose as much of a threat to the UK as they currently do
in the south of France or parts of Australia. This increased fire danger will threaten
wildlife and the environment, as well as lives and property, yet it is currently
underestimated as a threat in many parts of the UK.‚Äù

There are thousands of wildfires in the UK each year, which largely affect arable,
grassland, mountain and heath habitats rather than forests, but most are small, covering
less than a few acres or even just a few square metres.

Wildfires need a source of ignition, which can come from human activity and is hard to
predict. So the risk is measured by the likelihood that a fire would develop after a spark ‚Äì
a danger that is affected by weather conditions, the scientists said.



Their study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, calculated what the
fire danger might be in coming decades using the latest climate models for the UK. They
looked at a future with significant action to cut carbon emissions and one in which
pollution is high.

With high emissions, exceptional danger days would become more commonplace across
the UK, occurring up to nearly four days a year by 2080 in the worst-hit area, the east of
England.

The number of days with a very high danger of fire would increase significantly in all parts
of the UK. Southern and eastern England would be the worst affected, with the average
number of very high danger days more than quadrupling to 111 days in south-east
England and 121 days in the east of England.

But the West Midlands would also see the number of danger days rise, from 13 to 96, and
wetter areas could face soaring risk, including Wales (up from five to 53), Northern
Ireland (two to 20) and west Scotland (three to 16).

The study also found that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level that would curb
global warming to about 2C above pre-industrial levels ‚Äúreduces very substantially‚Äù the
increase in fire danger but does not eliminate it.

GUA-2021-81.txt,"Tory climate goals are all smoke and mirrors



25 mars 2021

Alok Sharma‚Äôs article (Time is running short ‚Äì but we can get a grip on the climate crisis,
18 March) confirmed that this government‚Äôs approach to the climate emergency is the
same as it is to all the other iniquities its ideology exacerbates, such as poverty, inequality
and homelessness. They announce a relatively small injection of cash and a couple of
initiatives, careful not to disturb the underlying practices causing the problems. If he and
his colleagues were serious and really followed the science, they would end all subsidies
to, and investment in, fossil fuel industries. They would also implement curbs to reduce
energy and resource consumption, direct and indirect, by the UK population. That would
be global leadership and would set a course for a just transition.

The government‚Äôs proposals are nothing more than a smokescreen to suggest we tried,
while baking in failure for our generation and horror for those that follow. 
 
Dave Hunter 
 
Bristol

Alok Sharma‚Äôs priorities are depressing in their lack of ambition. His first priority, global
net zero, even if achieved, simply establishes the already catastrophic status quo where
uncertain weather patterns will remain the norm. Net zero should be regarded as a
stepping stone towards the goal of reducing current levels of global temperature via
carbon drawdown, a reversal of global warming.

He overlooks a role for regenerative agriculture and diet both in achieving net zero and as
a valuable contribution to drawing down historic greenhouse gases from the atmosphere,
and he also fails to mention plans to prevent the search for new sources of gas and oil ‚Äì
obstacles which impede the aim of achieving net zero. In concentrating on coal, he gives
no attention to industry‚Äôs reliance upon both oil and gas, which continue to attract

Alok Sharma‚Äôs article was the usual high-sounding stream of aspirations and targets
without any recognition of the cost and efforts that will be needed to meet them. This is in
stark contrast, for example, to the report of the environmental audit committee on just
one aspect ‚Äì the cost of installing low-carbon heating is estimated at ¬£18,000 per home
and there are 19m of them. Add to that the replacement of fossil fuel cars by electric ones,
and the sums involved quickly become very challenging indeed.

I‚Äôm appalled that the president designate of Cop26 begins his article by detailing some of
his recent long-haul flights. Could he not instead have read reports, listened to people
from those parts of the world, watched the news or held online meetings?

The rest of his piece trots out the same old stuff about the ‚Äúworld beating‚Äù UK. It‚Äôs
obvious, and very depressing, that Cop26 will be just another session of trumpeting the
(rather few) British achievements in this critical field.

GUA-2021-82.txt,"At last I have good news on the climate crisis: all of us really can do something about it Zoe Williams   Like most people, I was daunted by the scale of the emergency, but I now think the lifestyle changes needed to make progress are not that difficult  A change is desperately needed. I know it and you know it, but someone in this citizenry ‚Äì most likely you ‚Äì isn‚Äôt ready to make a vast adjustment to their lifestyle. This is a common fallback position among progressives. I‚Äôve always felt comfortable in this territory and simultaneously aggravated by it. Nowhere is this position more routinely applied than in relation to the climate crisis.  The argument goes like this: people across the political spectrum broadly agree on the fundamentals and the urgency of the climate crisis, and yet we probably won‚Äôt do what we need to do because we‚Äôre just too useless. Society is too fractured for people to make altruistic choices; poverty is too endemic for many to be in a position to make changes; financialisation has subverted democracy, so even if the demos was able to make a good, collective decision, it would be thwarted. Even if, by some miracle, the UK managed to overcome these obstacles to make good on its net-zero pledges, the same problems would play out on a global scale to prevent other nations from doing the same.  But this year I changed my mind about this position. It wasn‚Äôt because of Cop26, which left most campaigners disappointed. It was because of what Cop26 couldn‚Äôt undo.  The first two components of reaching net zero are basically in the hands of the government: cleaning up the energy supply, and becoming more efficient in the energy we use. Throughout the 2010s, we assumed that both the major parties were equally committed to tackling the climate emergency and merely differed on whether the state or the market should pay for it. This seemed like a reasonable assumption ‚Äì the Conservatives in opposition, after all, were behind the Climate Change Act, an inspiringly strong piece of legislation ‚Äì except for the fact that it was plainly not true.  Conservatives committed to arresting the climate crisis wouldn‚Äôt have talked about ‚Äúgreen crap‚Äù. Nor would they have wasted five years on Brexit, or wanted to leave the EU in the first place. The price of entry to the grownups‚Äô conversation was to pretend that all politicians wanted broadly the same thing, by a different route. This was a peculiarly low point for common sense, and it squandered time, fostering a sense that even when those in power wanted to tackle the climate crisis, still nothing constructive could be achieved. Even as recently as September, when Rachel Reeves described at her party‚Äôs conference the state spending a Labour government‚Äôs green new deal would entail, it was still normal in climate policy circles for people to describe the parties as equally committed to constructive, large-scale change.  But it is no longer necessary to pretend that the Conservative government means well, keeps promises or has any long-term plan for tackling the climate crisis. Removing it from power has become more urgent than ever. Accepting these facts is now, paradoxically, less daunting than the effort of papering over reality. The third plank towards net zero has always been behavioural ‚Äì are people prepared to stop flying and eating meat, and change to bikes and electric cars? And even if you are personally committed to these things, what about those who don‚Äôt care, or can‚Äôt afford to make adjustments, and what about young people and their fast fashion, and didn‚Äôt Greta Thunberg once buy a salad wrapped in plastic? There is a tendency to respond to every climate aspiration with a darting list of the insufficiencies of humankind.  Yet the granular work done by the Climate Change Committee shows the lifestyle changes this crisis will ask of us are in fact pretty manageable. The most demanding will probably be the switch to battery-powered cars (60% of vehicles by 2035). Otherwise, the number of miles per driver will need to reduce by 4%; plane kilometres per person by 6%; meat and dairy consumption by 20%. Arguably, this is the time to start new conversations ‚Äì is net zero, in this time frame, ambitious enough? Can the disproportionate carbon usage of the affluent somehow be reflected in redistributive policy, so everyone has an allocation of plane miles and those who can‚Äôt afford to use theirs can sell them instead? Would it make sense to subsidise meat and dairy alternatives in the same way renewables were initially supported? Is it feasible to make a carbon budget, as a nation, that doesn‚Äôt take into account the footprint of your imports? (Not really.)  What is now unarguable is that all this is within our grasp. Radicals and progressives may maintain the longterm goal of bringing down capitalism and re-evaluating what life is for, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs nothing constructive that we can do in the short term. I‚Äôm not sure that I would make a different or more certain prediction of what life will look like in 30 years‚Äô time. But the idea that the changes required are too radical or the people who need to make them too timid, I‚Äôve completely put aside."
GUA-2021-83.txt," Nina Lakhani 22 d¬écembre 2021 Why the collapse of Biden√ïs Build Back Better would be a major blow to the climate fight theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/joe-biden-build-back-better-climate-crisis-consequences It would be almost impossible for the US to comply with its greenhouse gas reduction pledges without the $1.75tn package that Manchin refuses to support The collapse of Joe Biden√ïs Build Back Better legislation would have disastrous consequences for the global climate crisis, making it almost impossible for the US to comply with its greenhouse gas reduction pledges made under the Paris accords. Dire end to Biden√ïs first year as Manchin says no on signature bill The US president√ïs sweeping economic recovery and social welfare bill is in serious trouble after the Democratic senator Joe Manchin announced his opposition to the $1.75tn spending package that includes the country√ïs largest ever climate crisis investment. The shock move by the fossil fuel-friendly West Virginia lawmaker came after a year of record-breaking fires, floods, hurricanes and droughts devastated families across America, and amid warnings that such deadly extreme weather events will intensify unless there is radical action to curb greenhouse gases. The Build Back Better (BBB) legislation earmarks $555bn to tackle the US√ïs largest sources of global heating gasses √ê energy and transportation √ê through a variety of grants, tax incentives and other policies to boost jobs and technologies in renewable energy, as well as major investments in sustainable vehicles and public transit services. It is by far the largest chunk of federal funding for Biden√ïs climate crisis initiatives, without which experts say it will be impossible to meet the administration√ïs target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030. Globally, the US is the second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, and scientists warn that even halving emissions by 2030 may not be enough to avoid a catastrophic rise in atmospheric and oceanic temperatures. But BBB would be a major step forward towards the US meeting the goals laid out by Biden at last month√ïs UN climate talks in Glasgow, with no time to waste given the regression during the Trump administration. Without it, the Biden administration would be forced to rely on a web of new regulations and standards which could be overturned by future presidents.  Lawmakers, climate experts and labor groups have voiced intense anger and frustration over Manchin√ïs refusal to support the bill, which would leave the Democrats without the necessary votes to get it through the Senate. If we don√ït take that action, we√ïll look back at this moment as a decisive wrong turn in the life of our country Ra¬úl Grijalva, chair of the House natural resources committee, said the concentration of political power in a few hands had caused nothing but √ígridlock and frustration√ì. √íOur country has serious economic and environmental problems that demand government action. If we don√ït take that action, we√ïll look back at this moment as a decisive wrong turn in the life of our country,√ì Grijalva said in a statement. √íWho died and made Joe Manchin king, how is this a democracy?√ì said Mary Anna¬ïse Heglar, climate writer and co-host of the podcast Hot Take. √íThere√ïs been a dereliction of duty by politicians for decades who√ïve failed to make the case for climate action √â climate math won√ït reset just because the political math did.√ì Writing on Twitter, Jesse Jenkins, an energy professor at Princeton University who leads a group analysing the potential of BBB, said Manchin√ïs decision was √ídevastating√ì given the high stakes. √íPassing #BuildBackBetter would lower energy costs and secure both the US√ïs climate goals and its global competitiveness in some of the most important industries of the 21st century. Failure would cost Americans dearly.√ì BBB would build on a bipartisan infrastructure bill, signed into law last month, which contains important steps towards transforming America√ïs fossil fuel fired transport system by incentivizing zero emission public transit, a national network of electric vehicle chargers and a renewables energy grid. But BBB goes much further. For instance, homeowners would get incentives to install rooftop solar systems and insulate their homes. It also provides significant funding to address a range of environmental injustices which have led to Black, Latino, Indigenous and other marginalized Americans being disproportionately exposed to the harmful effects of fossil fuel pollution, ageing infrastructure like lead pipes, emerging toxins and the climate crisis. The bill includes billions of dollars in grants and other schemes to clean up pollution and create toxic-free communities, healthy ports and climate-resilient affordable housing, as well as research and development infrastructure at historically Black colleges and universities. So if Manchin move finally scuppers the BBB act √ê as is widely feared √ê frontline communities in the US, and across the world, would bear the brunt of the inaction.  √íBuild Back Better is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to combat the climate crisis and advance environmental justice through transformative investments that only the government can provide,√ì said Abigail Dillen, president of the legal non-profit Earthjustice. √íThe urgency couldn√ït be greater. As communities across our country are displaced by weather disasters and others breathe polluted air and drink poisoned water, political leaders like Senator Manchin cannot continue denying the crisis before us.√ì The climate crisis is undeniably causing havoc and misery across the world, with 2021 one of the deadliest ever years for weather disasters in the US. This year√ïs death toll includes at least 200 people killed by extreme heat in the Pacific north-west over the summer and 125 deaths caused by the extreme freeze in Texas in February. After years of scepticism, the majority of Americans now want government action to tackle the climate crisis but the majority of republicans √ê and a handful of democrats √ê continue to obstruct meaningful policy initiatives. Manchin, whose family profits from the coal industry in West Virginia, has already pushed out key climate policies during the BBB negotiations including a program to incentivize electricity utilities to use renewable power sources. Yet even some of Manchin√ïs core supporters are urging him to reconsider his opposition to the current bill, which includes several policies that would directly benefit large numbers of West Virginians including the state√ïs struggling coal miners. In a statement, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), which named Manchin as an honorary member last year, warned that benefits to coalminers suffering from black lung disease will expire at the end of this year unless BBB is passed. The union also supports the bill√ïs tax incentives that encourage manufacturers to build facilities on abandoned coalfields that would employ thousands of unemployed miners. Cecil Roberts, the union√ïs president, said: √íWe urge Senator Manchin to revisit his opposition to this legislation and work with his colleagues to pass something that will help keep coalminers working, and have a meaningful impact on our members, their families, and their communities.√ì"
GUA-2021-84.txt," 21 d¬écembre 2021 The Guardian view: help us to help those on the climate frontline theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/the-guardian-view-help-us-to-help-those-on-the-climate-frontline In August 1965, the German-born, Oxford-educated economist EF Schumacher published an article in the Observer. Titled √íHelp them to help themselves√ì, it criticised the prevailing model of aid to the developing world and proposed a new emphasis on regional planning and √íintermediate technology√ì. If the west would give up trying to impose the latest production methods, he argued, it could instead unleash the √ípower of self-help√ì. That article led to the creation of a charity today known as Practical Action. The approach it pioneered, of supporting local people to make incremental changes to improve their lives, lies at the heart of the Guardian and Observer√ïs 2021 charity appeal. All over the world, as our recent √íLiving on the frontline of global heating√ì series showed, climate breakdown is having disastrous consequences for the people and communities who (along with their ancestors) have contributed least to the problem of global heating. Practical Action and the other three charities that we are supporting cannot stop carbon emissions. But they can, and will, help people in some of the hardest-hit areas and communities to adapt, survive and thrive. Practical Action does this by supporting farmers √ê for example, by supplying climateresilient seeds and helping them to develop new practices. It also funds schemes that provide flood warnings, repair damage and develop clean energy. The Global Greengrants Fund UK, with whom we have partnered before, has overlapping aims, but a different focus: it identifies grassroots climate projects, including those led by indigenous people and focused on their rights, and awards micro-grants. In 2019, it channelled ¬£250,000 donated by Guardian and Observer readers to rainforest protection groups in the ecologically critical Amazon basin. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) campaigns for climate refugees, who lack status and protection in international law. In rich western countries, particularly those with temperate climates, we have so far been relatively protected from the most dangerous effects of the climate crisis. But all over the world, people are brutally exposed by environmental degradation, including deforestation, overfishing and water shortages. In the two decades since it was formed, the EJF has worked in some of the world√ïs leastaccessible countries, using film and other tools to shine a light on human rights abuses linked to environmental insecurity. Finally, Kew is famous for its stunning gardens and botanical collections √ê one in London, another at Wakehurst in Sussex. But the Royal Botanic Gardens also has an important presence in Madagascar, one of the world√ïs diversity hotspots, where Kew scientists have worked for 40 years. The island is experiencing terrible droughts and cannot afford to build the pipeline that it needs to protect both nature and livelihoods, as was highlighted by its environment minister in Glasgow. The Kew charity will use its share of this year√ïs  fundraising total to develop agricultural systems and restore denuded land (sometimes called rewilding) in such a way as to support people and protect their country√ïs extraordinary nature. The shortfall in the climate finance package promised by rich countries to poor ones is among the many grave failures of climate diplomacy. Our appeal cannot, of course, fill that huge gap. But thanks to the generosity of our readers, and despite the cancellation of last weekend√ïs telethon, we can make a meaningful difference to the lives of some of the people on the frontline of the climate crisis. As we approach the end of the year in France, we have a small favour to ask. We√ïd like to thank you for putting your trust in our journalism this year - and invite you to join the million-plus people in 180 countries who have recently taken the step to support us financially, keeping us open to all, and fiercely independent. In 2021, this support sustained investigative work into offshore wealth, spyware, sexual harassment, labour abuse, environmental plunder, crony coronavirus contracts, and Big Tech.

With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we can set our own agenda and provide trustworthy journalism that√ïs free from commercial and political influence, offering a counterweight to the spread of misinformation.

GUA-2021-85.txt," Campaigners lose court action over lawfulness of UK climate policies theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/21/plan-b-earth-campaigners-lose-court-action-uk-climate-policies- An environmental campaign group that challenged the lawfulness of the UK government‚Äôs climate policies has lost a high court fight. Plan B Earth argued that ministers had not taken ‚Äúpractical and effective‚Äù steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It wanted Mr Justice Bourne to give activists the go-ahead for a judicial review but he refused to grant permission. Plan B argued that the climate crisis and human rights legislation had been breached, and claimed ministers had failed to take practical and effective measures to adapt and prepare for the current and projected impacts of the climate emergency. Activists wanted a declaration that ministers‚Äô ‚Äúfailure‚Äù to take practical and effective measures to meet their climate commitments arising under the Paris agreement and the 2008 Climate Change Act breached the 1998 Human Rights Act. Tim Crosland, the director of Plan B, said: ‚ÄúWe are all witness to the devastating impacts of the current level of 1.2C warming [above pre-industrial levels]: deadly famines in Madagascar, east Africa and Afghanistan; wildfires and floods devastating communities and ecosystems around the world, including in the UK. ‚ÄúMeanwhile, the City of London continues to profiteer from financing a trajectory towards 3-4C warming, which is terrorism for the younger generation and terrorism for the global south. ‚ÄúYet, the high court has ruled that we cannot use the 1.5C Paris limit as the benchmark for the UK government‚Äôs legal obligation to safeguard life, despite the scientific and political consensus that maintaining that limit is vital to safeguard life. Given the UK government‚Äôs grandstanding over 1.5C through Cop26, the public will understand that for the legal sophistry that it is. ‚ÄúIf the courts are bound to ignore the scientific evidence of what is needed to safeguard life, then ‚Äòthe right to life‚Äô is no more than an illusion in a political economy which privileges the safety of short-term corporate profit over the welfare of ordinary people.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrosland added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll appeal to the court of appeal and, from there, to the European court of human rights.‚Äù"
GUA-2021-86.txt," Adam Morton 20 d¬écembre 2021 As the Coalition and Labor inch closer on emissions, are Australia√ïs climate wars ending? theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/20/as-the-coalition-and-labor-inch-closer-on-emissions-are-australiasclimate- wars-ending With big business backing Labor√ïs climate policy and net zero gaining bipartisan support, the climate battle is transitioning into a new phase ALP leader Anthony Albanese and PM Scott Morrison during question time. On the issue of the climate crisis, Albanese has accused the Coalition government of being √îfrozen in time while the world warms around it√ï. Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP If a week is a long time in politics, three years is a geological age. Long-held assumptions can change dramatically in that time. Just ask the Business Council of Australia. In 2018, before the last federal election, the lobby group representing 100 of the country√ïs biggest businesses described a Labor pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 as √íeconomy wrecking√ì. The Coalition√ïs more modest and less scientifically based goal of a 26-28% cut was deemed √íappropriate and achievable√ì. (To its credit, the business council has chosen not to delete its incriminating tweet.) Three years of worsening science news and a once-in-a-century pandemic later, the BCA has turned on its heel. It believes Labor√ïs new, fractionally reduced 2030 target √ê a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels √ê and the policies that support it are a √ísensible and workable plan√ì. Remarkably, given its history of opposing a national carbon price, it recently called on both major parties to do more. The BCA is not the only establishment heavyweight to have embraced greater ambition and offered support for Anthony Albanese and his climate change shadow minister, Chris Bowen, since the ALP emissions policy was released earlier this month. Labor√ïs climate plan can√ït fix 12 years of broken politics √ê but it√ïs a floor to what√ïs possible The Australian Industry Group √ê the country√ïs largest employer group √ê said Labor√ïs target could be delivered with √ísensible policy reforms, greater collaboration and a close focus on industry competitiveness√ì. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it offered √ía pathway to achieve the economic and technological transition towards a more sustainable future√ì. And the Australian Automobile Association said it was a √íwin for consumers√ì. This response is not a complete surprise. Most major corporates are persuaded the world will inevitably move on climate and that it is in their interests to do the same √ê or at least be seen to. But the support from business for Labor√ïs more ambitious stance reflects a sea change in the battle-weary world of Australian climate politics.  Some observers have wondered if this is how the √íclimate wars√ì end, having helped bring down multiple political leaders on both sides and held back policy for more than a decade. Political disagreements and attacks will continue, but will the potency of a dishonest campaign over emissions policy have diminished by the time next year√ïs election rolls around? √îThere√ïs no going back√ï Analysts mostly say: let√ïs not get ahead of ourselves. But they also say people should not underestimate what it means that the Coalition has promised the country will reach net zero emissions by 2050. Scott Morrison√ïs net zero plan, released shortly before the Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow, includes no new policies, largely relies on unproven technology and does not actually get the country to net zero, but the long-delayed decision to set the target means for the first time Australia√ïs major political parties agree on the destination. It narrows the scope for political attack. √íI think the war is over in the sense the fundamental differences about doing anything about climate change is over,√ì says Tony Wood, the energy program director with the Grattan Institute. √íThere is a rump of people on both sides who don√ït want there to be bipartisan support for climate change and who see benefit in differentiation, but I think the question is whether we√ïre now entering a stage of cold wars and skirmishes.√ì Frank Jotzo, professor of climate change economics at the Australian National University Crawford School of Public Policy, says the centre of debate has shifted and bipartisan support for a net zero target opened √ímany, many opportunities and really changes the tone of the debate√ì. √íThere√ïs no going back on that,√ì he says. √íNow that a conservative government that had a √îno-action√ï point of view supports a net zero target, there√ïs really no room for saying we shouldn√ït be doing anything. √íIf you went just by what business says and what civil society says, then you would say there√ïs really nothing that could hold back a shift to effective and sensible climate policy in Australia. Large parts of the spectrum now agree on the fundamentals √ê they want ambitious targets and meaningful policies of some kind.√ì Of course, things are not that simple. √íThis agreement doesn√ït necessarily translate into how elections are campaigned,√ì Jotzo says. √íThe preconditions for an end to the climate wars are there, but I think it√ïs too early to call.√ì Unanswered questions about the 2022 campaign include whether News Corp newspapers, which have run misleading campaigns against the cost of climate policies and attacked the scientific consensus, have moved on since launching a √ímission zero√ì series on climate before the Glasgow summit or will return to their old ways.  Scott Morrison during an aerial tour of the Snowy Hydro site near Tantangara Dam, NSW on 3 December. Photograph: Alex Ellinghausen/AAP To date, the response has been more muted than some in Labor expected. There have been news stories describing the ALP policy as targeting big emitters √ê which is true, with the important caveat that it is gradual and has the support of business groups. Others have raised doubts about whether it would create more than 600,000 jobs and the extent to which it would lead to a reduction in energy bills √ê though it was not disputed that they would be cut. The most aggressive media attack was on the front page of News Corp√ïs Brisbane daily, the Courier Mail, which quoted backbencher Matthew Canavan creatively describing a plan to use an existing Coalition policy √ê the safeguard mechanism √ê to start to cut emissions from big industry as √íLabor√ïs revenge√ì on Queensland. The animosity and ridiculous scare campaigns about climate change that we√ïve seen are unlikely to dominate this election Morrison and his ministers have not gone as hard and the initial attack was quickly over, but it√ïs early days, and campaign lines have been tested. The prime minister claimed Labor√ïs policy would be bad for coal regions and manufacturing, and several MPs described the promised changes to the safeguard mechanism as a √ísneaky new carbon tax√ì. In reality, Labor is proposing a more gentle use of the safeguard than promised by its architect, Liberal cabinet minister Greg Hunt, back in 2015. In response, Albanese said the Coalition was √ífrozen in time while the world warms around it√ì and that he expected the government to lie about Labor√ïs policy. Closing the climate policy gap Analysts expect Coalition criticism to be more targeted than in previous campaigns, reflecting not only the shared net zero target, but that the government is under pressure from climate-focused independents in heartland Sydney and Melbourne seats. A differentiated campaign √ê trying to convince inner-city residents the government is acting, while telling some parts of Queensland and New South Wales a Labor government would be devastating for them √ê is not impossible, but harder to land than in the past. Allegra Spender, an independent candidate who is running against Dave Sharma in the seat of Wentworth in Sydney√ïs east. Her message is that action on the climate crisis is an economic as well as an environmental imperative. Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian Labor√ïs policy was designed with this in mind. There is a gap between the parties on 2030 targets, but it is relatively narrow once the government√ïs rhetoric is factored in. The prime minister still backs a target set under Tony Abbott six years ago, but claims official  projections show the country would cut emissions by 35%. Whether you accept this or not √ê and there is reason not to √ê it leaves Labor promising just eight percentage points more than the Coalition. Albanese accurately described the ALP√ïs target as modest. Labor appears to be living in either fear or hope over climate policy Tristan Edis The gap between the parties on renewable energy is similarly difficult to exploit. The government forecasts that 69% of electricity in the national market will be zero emissions by 2030, largely due to the tumbling cost of solar energy and incentives offered by state governments. Labor says it would lift that to 82% just by bringing forward construction of transmission lines to planned renewable energy zones. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director for the Australia Institute, says Labor has gone out of its way to avoid any area where it was at risk of being wedged by the government or other opponents. √íIt means the animosity and ridiculous scare campaigns about climate change that we√ïve seen are unlikely to dominate this election,√ì he says. If this proves correct, it may leave the biggest battleground where those who believe the debate should be led by climate science say it should have always been √ê over what Australia has to do to live up to its global commitment to try to limit global heating to 1.5C. Politically, they include the Greens, who want a 75% cut by 2030 including a rapid phaseout of coal power, and some independent candidates. Merzian, a former diplomat representing Australia at climate talks, is among those who believe this is where the debate is finally headed, saying: √íThe battle will not be over until we have a decent climate policy that reflects the reality of what√ïs needed.√ì As we approach the end of the year in France, we have a small favour to ask.

GUA-2021-87.txt," Donald McRae 18 d¬écembre 2021 Alejandro Agag√ïs Extreme E is the first sport with climate crisis at its heart theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/18/alejandro-agag-extreme-e-first-sport-with-climate-crisis-at-heart-motorsport Motor sport with teams founded by Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg has noble goals but also stages races in Saudi Arabia Alejandro Agag laughs in his smooth and charming way when I read out a quote which suggests that, as the founder and chairman of Formula E and the driving force behind Extreme E, the new environmentally conscious motor sport venture, he is closer in spirit to Alan Sugar than Greta Thunberg. √íI appreciate the important message that activists like Greta Thunberg convey and it makes our life easier because they raise awareness,√ì Agag says. √íBut we are a different kind of environmentalist. They are the ones who say that change is needed. We are the ones who make change happen in the real world. You cannot make it in the idealised world.√ì I will soon ask Agag why his many laudable ambitions are linked to sportswashing in Saudi Arabia, but it seems appropriate to focus initially on Extreme E as it reaches the climax of its inaugural season in Dorset this weekend. Teams created by Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are in a battle to win the championship in a field which includes an outfit run by a third former Formula One world champion in Jenson Button. √íIt was not difficult to attract them,√ì Agag says of Hamilton, Rosberg and Button. √íWhen we showed them the project all three liked it a lot. As we combine motorsport and climate action, it was attractive for them. They also liked our pragmatic approach. We are not activists. We are pragmatic people worried about the environment.√ì Agag has the charisma to draw significant figures into a form of motor sport which, he says, √íis unique because Extreme E is a race which leaves no trace√ì. Apart from aiming to showcase Extreme E in locations which have been hurt by the climate crisis, their electric cars make zero emissions. Without any crowds, as events are televised and audience engagement is online, the carbon footprint of each race is negligible. But setting up a new sport in the midst of a global pandemic has stretched the 51-year-old Spaniard. A former politician, who at the age of 25 was the personal assistant to the Spanish prime minister, Agag admits: √íIt√ïs been a bigger challenge than starting Formula E [in 2014]. I√ïm fighting every day to survive. It√ïs incredibly difficult because sponsors are more cautious and executing the race is so complicated. In some places we need a million tests, a million forms, a million regulations.  √íIn Greenland we only got the permits to travel one day before and we already had millions and millions of euros of expenditure over there. We were begging to be allowed in. I didn√ït want to go through that again. I said: √îLet√ïs wait Covid out and find places where we are sure we can race.√ï Most of my day is spent putting fires out.√ì This final race of the season was meant to be held in Patagonia, with the cars shipped rather than flown across the world, but Covid forced a switch to Dorset. Agag suggests that Extreme E will raise awareness of biodiversity loss in Dorset alongside the sporting drama of whether Hamilton√ïs team, X44, can catch Rosberg√ïs drivers. Extreme E is the first sporting entity to place the climate emergency at its heart. This noble mission is deepened by the fact that every team features male and female drivers. So Jamie Chadwick, the 23-year-old British driver who recently won her second W Series, races against men of the calibre of S¬ébastien Loeb, the nine-times world rally champion who is part of Hamilton√ïs team. All this makes it even more disappointing that, in April, Agag staged the first Extreme E race in Saudi Arabia. The next races were held in Senegal and Greenland but the credibility of his entire venture was tarnished by a decision to gloss over Saudi√ïs human rights record in favour of huge financial benefits. What message did he offer female drivers such as Chadwick, and women in general, by accepting Saudi√ïs invitation? √íI√ïm a big supporter of Saudi, of the current Saudi change, and I always say nobody√ïs perfect,√ì Agag says. √íBut in Saudi they√ïre making big changes in favour of women. If you ask Saudi women how they feel about the changes happening in their country they are absolutely enthusiastic. The situation is not as we would like it in Europe but it√ïs definitely a huge change. Look, for example, at the fact women can drive now.√ì I remind Agag of how Amnesty International highlighted the case of Loujain al-Hathloul who fought for gender equality and women√ïs right to drive in Saudi. In May 2018 she was detained without charge and Hathloul has since spoken of the torture and sexual abuse she suffered. Last December she was sentenced to five years in prison. Hathloul has now been released, but she remains under a five-year travel ban, while other female activists are still detained. Amnesty reports that 10 of them have made allegations of torture. √íI agree with Amnesty and they make the same point about Guant¬ánamo,√ì Agag says. √íSo do I not travel to the United States anymore? If we mix sport and politics, we will have very few places where we can race. Of course it√ïs very difficult to keep them separate but positive change is happening in Saudi. Is it perfect? No. I accept all your arguments. I only make my additional argument √ê we need to change [Saudi]. And it is changing.√ì Extreme E emphasises the importance of education and speaking out against the climate crisis. Yet, in Saudi, Agag and his colleagues were silent about the abuse of human rights.  √íBut the first time that male and female Saudis were able to mix together without being with their families and the first time male and female Saudis were allowed to dance in public was at the first Formula E event with concerts by Black Eyed Peas, Enrique Iglesias and David Guetta,√ì he counters. √íYoung people in Saudi were coming to me with tears in their eyes thanking me for helping the country change.√ì How much did Saudi Arabia pay Extreme E to host their event? √íYou will understand I don√ït go into those details. We are not a charity.√ì What did Agag feel when, before the Jeddah Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton stressed he was uncomfortable being in Saudi? √íLewis has a very clear position on homosexuality rights. It√ïs perfectly right to express his views.√ì There are also public beheadings in Saudi √ê where feminism and homosexuality are regarded as √íextreme√ì and unacceptable. Does Agag have no misgivings in accepting money from Saudi? √íIt wasn√ït even financial. If I didn√ït believe the current regime is changing positively, probably we would not go to Saudi. For me, those young Saudis saying: √îWe never in our life thought we could dance in the streets in Saudi√ï makes it worthwhile. If we isolate them, we√ïre not going to help them. √íGo to Saudi and then we have the discussion again. I invite you to the race [next month] with Formula E. Go talk to young Saudis in the streets √â when I had my speech in Saudi I had 5,000 females applauding me. I√ïm not apologising. I am doing exactly what I want to do, which is to help change in Saudi.√ì Saudi Arabia is the world√ïs biggest producer of fossil fuels but Agag reiterates his √ípragmatic approach to environmentalism. We need an organised transition out of the fossil world and this needs lots of money. Who has the money? The big corporations. BP, Shell, Aramco. The Saudis. We need a clear decision to go towards that transition √ê and we need to include everybody. That means the oil companies and the oil-polluting states as long as they commit to the change.√ì Agag admits to being √ípuzzled√ì by Mercedes√ïs decision to leave Formula E at the end of next year in a strategy which follows the withdrawal of Audi and BMW. Mercedes remain committed to Formula One but they will cut ties with Formula E and focus their resources on developing their electric car for mass production. Cars pull away at the start of the Arctic X-Prix race at Kangerlussuaq, Greenland in August. Photograph: Sam Bloxham/Motorsport Images/Shutterstock √íOn the other hand,√ì he says, √íwe have great brands coming in that we will announce soon in Formula E. We still have Porsche and Jaguar and Nissan and other big manufacturers on board. I don√ït need to put out any fires in Formula E because it√ïs very strong.√ì Agag has ambitious plans to forge a bond with F1 which he knows is √íin a fantastic position√ì after the riveting season-long battle between Hamilton and Max Verstappen. √íI√ïm the only one to say this so far but, for me, the future is some kind of convergence  with Formula One and Formula E. We would still have separate championships but maybe we do some races together √ê maybe Monaco, Abu Dhabi, Miami? Maybe Saturday Formula E, Sunday Formula One? Why not?√ì Has be broached the possibility with F1? √íWe discuss it all the time.√ì Perhaps F1 feels it does not need Formula E? √íThere are different opinions within Formula One. Let√ïs leave it at that.√ì That wily politician√ïs answer chimes with Agag√ïs personal life. Having married the daughter of his old boss, the former Spanish prime minister Jos¬é Mar¬ía Aznar, Agag had Silvio Berlusconi and Tony Blair as witnesses at his wedding. He also once part-owned QPR in a consortium which included his old pal Bernie Ecclestone. Agag laughs when I say his friends, and the Saudis, all need some of his positive spin. √íI√ïm also friends with lots of people who have a very good image.√ì Extreme E and Formula E were the only sporting bodies at Cop26. But in terms of Extreme E√ïs current position, Agag agrees that √íwe still have lots of work to do. Extreme E is still in the baby phase. We had some good results and when people see it they like it a lot, but still they don√ït know when it√ïs on. Extreme E has huge potential and the purpose is even bigger. Christiana Figueres is the mother of the Paris climate agreement and she came with us to Greenland. If she believes in Extreme E then everyone should believe in us.√ì We almost end on that positive note but, just after we say goodbye, Agag shouts one last invitation: √íCome to Saudi with me, huh?√ì"
GUA-2021-88.txt," Karen McVeigh 17 d√©cembre 2021 ‚ÄòThis new snow has no name‚Äô: Sami reindeer herders face climate disaster theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/17/new-snow-no-name-sami-reindeer-herders-climate-disaster The Sami, the only indigenous people left in Europe, have more than 100 different words for snow. From sea≈ã√°≈°, a fluffy, grainy snow that moves easily, to tjaevi, flakes that stick together and are hard to dig, the names are based on its texture, depth, density, and the harsh conditions of the Arctic winter. But the Sami of S√°pmi, who are traditionally fishers, trappers and reindeer herders, do not yet have a word for what they are seeing more often on the ground. ‚ÄúThis new snow has no name,‚Äù said Lars-Anders Kuhmunen, a reindeer herder from Kiruna, Sweden‚Äôs northernmost town, near the Norwegian border. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it is. It is like early tjaevi, which normally comes in March. The winters are warmer now and there is rain, making the ground icy. The snow on top is very bad snow and the reindeer can‚Äôt dig for their food.‚Äù The Arctic is warming not twice as quickly as the rest of the world, as previously believed, but four times as fast, according to a paper published in Science this week. S√°pmi, an area that stretches over parts of four countries ‚Äì Sweden, Finland, Norway and Russia ‚Äì and is hemmed by three seas, recorded its hottest temperature for more than a century in July this year, hitting 33.6C (92.5F) during a summer heatwave. Kuhmunen and other reindeer herders, who spend their days and often nights tending the herds scattered across vast tundras, are on the frontline of the climate crisis. Their reindeer, a semi-domestic species that has adapted to the harsh conditions of the polar region, are being pushed to the limit by the changes, they say. The animals use their shovel-like hooves to dig for lichen, their main winter food supply, as well as other plants that grow under the snow. But finding food is increasingly difficult. Warmer than average temperatures mean the snow that was semi-permanent throughout winter turns to rain, which in turn freezes on the ground, trapping lichen under the ice, so the animals cannot reach it. Thick snowfall, which also happens more often, adds to the problems by making it impossible for the animals to find the lichen by smell. These freeze-thaw and rain-on-snow events happen naturally in the Arctic, but they are happening more often and on a larger scale. There have been mass starvations of reindeer, in 2013-14 in Russia and in 2018-19 in Norway, and the herders have to go much farther afield in the past few years to find grazing ground.  Kuhmunen, 43, a father of three, said the changing weather and shrinking grazing lands had made his job much harder. Speaking from the forest, six miles (10km) north of Kiruna, where he is following his herd, he said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to keep the herd together, so I have to work harder. They spread out more because they can‚Äôt find food. Now there are only four or five hours of daylight. When the polar darkness comes it will be harder.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúReindeer are losing their habitat, because of logging and mines. My father‚Äôs generation used to go on skis to the reindeer. We use snowmobiles because the distances are greater. I worry about it every day.‚Äù The herding of reindeer is already threatened by human expansion, with forestry and mining activities moving into traditional grazing grounds. One study in Norway found that in the last century, undisturbed reindeer habitat had shrunk by 70%, including grazing lands flooded for hydroelectric dams. The climate challenges faced by the Sami ‚Äì and the impact on their rights and livelihood ‚Äì have been researched and documented by the Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF), one of four charities in the Guardian and Observer‚Äôs 2021 climate justice appeal, as part of an international effort to lobby politicians to take climate action. The Sami portraits, film and stories were used in exhibitions in the European parliament, the National Theatre in London, and the international art exhibition Venice Biennale, reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers and provoking far-reaching discussions on climate policy. Aslat Simma, 42, a herder and former chief of the Lainiovuoma tribe, said: ‚ÄúThis is December. The temperature should be minus all the time. A normal winter has temperatures of -20 to -25C. Now the temperature can be zero or positive.‚Äù Increasing rainfall in the autumn also leaves the lichen full of water, making it less nutritious for the deer, he said. ‚ÄúWe are living with nature and we are dependent on the weather and the reindeer for all we do. But the reindeer are using up all their energy trying to find grazing land and to dig. They are living on the edge of how an animal can adapt. When the changes in climate come so fast, they can‚Äôt adapt. They have already adapted so much.‚Äù Henrik Blind, a member of a herding family from the town of Jokkmokk, said: ‚ÄúWhen you live so close to a creature, you see the world through their eyes. You see how hard it is to live in these conditions. Everything is upside down. ‚ÄúOur livelihoods depend on a planet that is not on fire. We are an Arctic people and our culture is written in snow. But climate change means the snow will get less and less. ‚ÄúWe must realise we can‚Äôt overconsume our planet. This is urgent. We need to listen to all the indigenous people in the world who know how to live in harmony with the planet.‚Äù  ."
GUA-2021-89.txt," Steven Morris 16 d¬écembre 2021 Good citizen award? No thanks, young climate campaigners tell Welsh council theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/16/good-citizen-award-pontypridd-young-campaigners Most youngsters chosen to receive a good citizen award would probably have welcomed the recognition and dutifully attended the ceremony and photocall with the local mayor. But members of Young Friends of the Earth in the south Wales town of Pontypridd, who have been campaigning for changes to address the climate emergency, weren√ït having any of it. They turned down the award from Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough council (RCT) on the basis that the local authority needed to do much more to tackle the very real environmental issues faced in their area, which was devastated by flooding last year. √íWe felt RCT wasn√ït doing enough about climate change,√ì said one of the members, Alice Hanks-Doyle, 13. √íIt would have been hypocritical of us to accept the award. The council says they are planning stuff to help but if a fire is burning, you don√ït say: √îI plan to do this tomorrow.√ï You don√ït sit in the flames, you sort it out. They are sitting in the flames. √íThe floods were horrible. I look out of the window and think in 10 years I may be next to the beach. The sea levels are rising, flooding is more frequent and people brush it under the carpet. I go outside after school and the air doesn√ït feel fresh. Can I have fresh air please? Not an award.√ì Young Friends of the Earth Pontypridd√ïs message to Rhondda Cynon Taf county borough council The group, which has a core of about eight members, was also savvy enough to know that it might get more publicity for its cause if it turned down the award. They viewed a YouTube clip of the moment in the film Brassed Off when band leader Danny turns down a prize to draw attention to the plight of ravaged mining communities and explains: √íUs winning this trophy won√ït mean bugger all to most people. But us refusing it √â then it becomes news.√ì Dan Wright, 12, said: √íIf we had accepted the award, we might have got in the local paper. More people now will know what we√ïve done. Perhaps they√ïll join us on a march or do their own research on the climate. When I first heard about the award I felt excited but then thought they were trying to greenwash themselves.√ì The council wrote to the group explaining that the good citizen awards were presented to √ía small number√ì of people. A time and place was given for them to pick up their certificate and have their photos taken by the council√ïs photographer.  The children wrote back politely thanking the council but said they were not impressed at what RCT was doing to tackle the climate emergency. The climate disaster is here √ê this is what the future looks like They flagged up that roads were still being built, suggested many more trees could be planted and expressed concern that pension funds have been invested in businesses that profit from fossil fuels. The children concluded: √íWe did not start protesting to get awards, but because the people in positions of power were not acting. Accepting would be saying that we think RCT council is doing enough to protect our future √ê and it scares us that you are not.√ì Andrew Morgan, the leader of the council, wrote back explaining the council had committed to being net zero by 2030. He set out a long list of measures that were being taken, explaining why it was still necessary to build some roads and how the council had worked hard to invest pension funds in more environmentally friendly ways. He also said they were exploring how trees and peat bogs could be used to capture and store carbon. An RCT council spokesperson said: √íThe council was disappointed to hear that Young Friends of the Earth, Pontypridd felt that they were unable to accept the mayor√ïs good citizen award. The award was granted in recognition of the hard work that they undertake, as they help to raise awareness and put climate change at the forefront of people√ïs minds. √íThe council understands that they are passionate about making a change and it indeed shares this passion and has recently launched its √íThink Climate RCT√ï campaign to support its commitment to Climate Change in RCT.√ì Another FoE campaigner, Rowan Moon, 10, was not swayed. He said he still felt traumatised by the floods. √íIt could happen again. We have to prepare.√ì Asked what he thought of RCT√ïs response, he echoed Greta Thunberg√ïs dismissal of global leaders√ï promises: √íBlah, blah, blah.√ì"
GUA-2021-90.txt," Graham Readfearn, Ben Smee 17 d¬écembre 2021 Adani is poised to ship its first coal √ê is this failure for Australia√ïs defining climate campaign? theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/18/adani-is-poised-to-ship-its-first-coal-is-this-failure-for-australiasdefining- climate-campaign Climate campaigners say Stop Adani has helped generate community enthusiasm to oppose fossil fuel projects more generally in Australia. Photograph: Darren England/AAP In 2010, an Indian mining company bought some tenements over a giant and untapped coal basin in the west of Queensland. That purchase, by the conglomerate Adani Group, kickstarted one of the most controversial and politically divisive resource projects in Australia√ïs history √ê the Carmichael coalmine and rail project. Before the year is out, and about eight years behind schedule, Adani says it will finally export its first coal, destined to be burned in a power station. The moment will be celebrated as a victory by its supporters, including many regional Queensland MPs and senators and conservative commentators. Australia√ïs resources minister, Keith Pitt, was at the mine site in October √ê about 300km west of Mackay √ê to record a video celebrating the first coal being dug. It would mean jobs and prosperity, he said. Earlier this week, Adani Australia chief executive Lucas Dow told the ABC that coal had already been delivered to the company√ïs port at Abbot Point as the company runs tests of new trains along 200km of new railway lines. √íWe√ïre very excited as the project is nearing completion,√ì he said. But for its opponents, including climate change activists and some traditional owners, the Carmichael project always meant danger and it became the focus of a campaign with an uncompromising two-word slogan: Stop Adani. So as the first coal waits to wind its way through the Great Barrier Reef√ïs shipping channels, what now for that campaign? √íWe would prefer to have stopped Adani when it went through approvals, or when it was looking for financing and then in construction. If we have to wait until the project is moving coal, then that√ïs what we√ïll do,√ì says Julien Vincent, executive director of Market Forces, a campaign group that has worked to remove Adani√ïs opportunities to finance and insure the mine. √íThere√ïs no asterisk or caveat or fine print. There√ïs no conditions. It√ïs just Stop Adani,√ì he says.  Carbon bomb The Galilee basin has an estimated 23bn tonnes of coal. When the first mine was proposed in 2012, Adani was one of about nine projects targeting the basin. At the time, Greenpeace estimated if all the mines went ahead, the burning of the coal would release about 700m tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere √ê almost one-and-a-half times Australia√ïs annual greenhouse gas emissions. But while Adani wasn√ït the first company to declare an interest, it is the only one to dig coal from the massive Galilee basin. Success for Adani could mean opening up the entire basin for coal development. Initial plans for the mine were to dig about 60m tonnes of coal a year, making it the biggest coalmine in Australia and one of the largest in the world. After almost a decade √ê and an almost eight-year delay to the initial schedule for extracting coal √ê the company now says it has downscaled the project to about 10m tonnes. But Adani still holds approvals for those higher levels. In some narratives, the Adani mine helped tipped the balance at the 2019 federal election. Final approvals from the state government were pending and Adani launched an advertising and letterboxing campaign criticising the Labor state government over its handling of the project. Central and north Queensland marginal seats swung heavily to the Coalition and within days of the election, state Labor moved to hand Adani its required approvals, in some cases despite concerns from the government√ïs own experts about threatened species management plans. Susan Harris Rimmer, the director of the Policy Innovation Hub at Griffith University, says the mine became emblematic of a broader debate about jobs and climate action in regional Queensland. √íPoliticians up there use strong binary language,√ì she said. √íThey√ïll keep doing it, because it worked. It√ïs the same with immigration or terrorism. It works [as a political strategy] so people will fall back on it. There is a playbook, they√ïll try it again.√ì Harris Rimmer said the anti-Adani convoy, led by the former Greens leader Bob Brown, became a flashpoint and helped spread √íus and them√ì rhetoric in parts of Queensland. √íI think that convoy became an image of people from the south, who lose nothing, making us [in regional Queensland] look like the villains.  √íThat√ïs what it looked like, I√ïm sure that√ïs not the way it was meant, but it looked like [people] coming to tell this stupid community not to do this.√ì √îA crap moment√ï In 2020, the Adani Group started to remove its own name from its Australian operations. First, the company renamed its Adani mining operations to Bravus. Then it changed the name of the Adani Abbot Point Terminal, north of Bowen, to North Queensland Export Terminal (the words Adani and coal don√ït appear on the corporate website). √íThat name change definitely gave the impression the name Adani was becoming an impediment,√ì says Vincent. √íIf you√ïre confident in your brand you don√ït change it to something else.√ì Vincent says the campaign has had other knock-on effects well away from the Adani mine. Quick Guide How to get the latest news from Guardian Australia Show √íIt√ïs been the catalyst for dozens of financial institutions around the world to rule out thermal coal projects,√ì he says. √íThe risk of being associated with large [coal] projects has become reputational kryptonite.√ì In May, fossil fuel producers complained to a parliamentary inquiry that campaigns against the industry were now making it harder to finance and insure major projects. Adani told the inquiry it had been refused loans and insurance, and contractors and business partners had walked away. In a submission, the company said √íthe boycotting of Australia√ïs thermal coal industry by Australian banks and insurance companies is misconceived and indifferent to the manifest damage their decisions will have on the industry√ïs ability to remain globally competitive√ì and it would impact Australia√ïs economy. Vincent says while the first coal being shipped is √ía crap moment for the campaign√ì, major financial groups continue to distance themselves from the project, joining scores of others. Last month one of the world√ïs biggest banks cut ties with the project saying the venture is incompatible with its environmental, social and governance rules. Activists continue to target the project √ê locking themselves on to rail lines and rolling stock and suspending themselves from cranes at the company√ïs port. Two protesters clambered aboard one of the project√ïs trains this week and spent a day allegedly  shovelling coal over the side. Separately, some Wangan and Jagalingou traditional owners have long opposed the project, saying it will destroy their cultural lands and risk the sacred Doongmabulla springs. The miner has a formal land-use agreement with the Wangan and Jagalingou people but the agreement is opposed by some traditional owners. Traditional owners have been carrying out continuous cultural ceremonies on the mining lease for more than 90 days. Adrian Burragubba, a traditional owner who has battled Adani for years, says Adani √íshould not be celebrating√ì. His family and other traditional owners are concerned cultural sites with √íliterally thousands of artefacts√ì are being disturbed. Burragubba says his son Coedy McAvoy has been on the land since 28 August performing ceremonies. √íHe declares he√ïll remain there,√ì says Burragubba. √íIt√ïs our duty to take care of the land and monitor what the mining company is doing.√ì Adani has been calling for the police to step in to remove McAvoy, as well as to take stronger action against different protesters targeting the railway. In October, police told McAvoy and others camped on the company√ïs mining lease they would not remove them √íat this time√ì. Litmus test The Australian Conservation Foundation, a member of the Stop Adani Alliance, successfully overturned federal approval for the mine√ïs water scheme earlier this year, with the issue still unresolved. The ACF chief executive, Kelly O√ïShanassy, said the campaign still had much to achieve. As insurers, financiers and contractors walked away, there were √ístill questions about the viability√ì of the project. She says the group will work √íincredibly hard√ì to stop the Galilee basin opening, but Stop Adani is a defining climate campaign. √íYour position on Adani indicated your position on climate, particularly politically. It became a litmus test. √íACF has been switching the focus to escalating the clean future and we couldn√ït have got people interested in that unless there was an end to coal and gas. I think we√ïve won the public argument on that.√ì  Since the campaign against Adani began, the world√ïs financial markets have shifted away from coal. At the Glasgow climate summit, more than 40 countries agreed to phase out coal power. √íIf we decide that in 2021 we cannot be adding more coal to the global market, then that√ïs a decision we have to hold ourselves to,√ì Vincent says. Over the course of the campaign, there have been scores of other fossil fuel projects that have been announced, developed and approved. Did the focus on Adani shift the campaigns √ê and the eyes of the public √ê to just one spot in north Queensland? √íEven a dark firmament needs its darkest stars,√ì says David Ritter, the chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific. √íThe scale of the Galilee Basin demanded that attention. √íBut the campaign drew attention to the overall issue and hopefully generated the kind of community enthusiasm to oppose [fossil fuel projects] everywhere else in Australia, not just at the Adani mine.√ì The Guardian asked Adani Australia when it expected to export its first coal from the Carmichael mine and requested an interview with its chief executive, Lucas Dow. A spokeswoman sent a short statement, saying: √íThe Carmichael Mine is on track to export coal in 2021.√ì"
GUA-2021-91.txt," Paul Karp 16 d¬écembre 2021 RBA warns cyber attacks and climate change could threaten financial system theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/16/rba-warns-cyber-attacks-and-climate-change-could-be-devastatingfor- financial-system Climate change risk and cyber attacks could have √ídevastating√ì consequences for Australia√ïs financial system, the reserve bank has warned. But in a speech to the Australasian Finance and Banking Conference online on Thursday, Jonathan Kearns, the RBA√ïs head of financial stability, said the climate risk to banks could be √ímanaged√ì because they were less exposed than other sectors in a transition to a low emissions economy. However, he warned that cyber attacks were now growing in frequency. The speech comes ahead of the release of a report into the climate policies of banks and insurers from a controversial parliamentary inquiry pushed by Nationals MP George Christensen and the resources minister, Keith Pitt. RBA says interest rate rise in 2022 unlikely despite inflation uncertainty The banks fear the inquiry could result in mixed signals, with most regulators urging them to reduce their exposure to emissions intensive electricity sources, but some in the government wanting to force them not to √ídebank√ì fossil fuel companies or their enablers. The banks told the inquiry they need to actively manage climate risk because governments and regulators require it, and because the investor community is √íincreasingly transitioning its focus towards a net zero emissions economy√ì. Kearns said climate risk consisted of both a √íphysical risk√ì from the reduction in a bank√ïs income or the damage to its assets and a √ítransition risk√ì due to losses resulting from changes in policy, technology and behaviours to achieve a low emissions economy. Climate change could harm banks by reducing their borrowers√ï income or assets due to drought, storms or policy changes affecting the value of a coalmine; by preventing them rolling over short-term funding because investors are concerned about exposure to climate change; or operational risks, such as Hurricane Sandy forcing banks to close in New York. Kearns noted banks in Australia now pay √ísubstantial attention√ì to climate risk, a fact that has also been acknowledged with respect to global markets by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Kearns said banks have difficulty √íquantifying and pricing the impact of climate change√ì due to insufficient data on their emissions exposure, the location of assets and √íuncertainty√ì about climate change policies.  Kearns said the RBA√ïs work on climate risk suggests there could be house price falls in regions most exposed to extreme weather but √íthe overall losses for the financial system appear to be manageable√ì. √íBanks are also exposed to transition risks from their lending to emissions-intensive industries which again exposes them to credit risk, although overall, Australian banks√ï portfolios appear to be less emissions-intensive than the economy as a whole.√ì Kearns said cyber-attacks posed considerable threat and were growing in frequency. The risk consisted of disruption, failure or misuse of IT systems including theft of funds or other valuable commercial or personal information, to disruption of services, or corruption of data, possibly for ransom. √íIt is difficult to assess the extent of cyber risk as firms don√ït tend to publicly disclose attacks and there isn√ït uniform or comprehensive reporting of cyber-attacks,√ì he said. √íBut everything points to cyber-attacks growing in frequency.√ì Kearns said these two risks could be systemic if the bank affected is large, if the risk is correlated across multiple banks, if there is a high degree of interconnection, if the effects are long-lasting and √íif it is realised when uncertainty or risk aversion is particularly high [eg during a global pandemic]√ì. √íThe financial risks from climate change are clearly systemic as climate change will affect the portfolios of all banks. √íCyber risk need not be systemic. It could affect only one bank, but if that bank is large and interconnected, or the cyber attack affects a critical node in the financial system, it could very well become systemic.√ì He said big banks √íhave substantial resources to deploy in their cyber defences√ì while smaller banks have difficulty maintaining equivalent defences. He noted the council of financial regulators planned to help banks by cyberwar games testing their defences by √ímimicking the tactics, techniques and procedures that are used in real cyber attacks√ì. √íIt is crucial that banks continue to adapt their risk management for these evolving risks, as those bank risks can morph into systemic risks that have the potential for dire consequences for the economy and people√ïs livelihoods.√ì"
GUA-2021-92.txt," Graham Readfearn 16 d¬écembre 2021 Matt Canavan says Labor√ïs climate plan is √îrevenge on Queensland√ï, but the facts tell a different story theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/16/matt-canavan-says-labors-climate-plan-is-revenge-on-queenslandbut- the-facts-tell-a-different-story Australia√ïs climate wars may not be over but, as key targets and policies from the two main parties are now out, there does appear to be a quietening of the political gunfire. But Queensland coalition senator Matt Canavan was still looking to fire shots, with a front page claim that Labor√ïs new climate policy constituted √írevenge√ì on his home state. In a story in the Courier Mail, Canavan claimed Labor√ïs policy would let √íother states off the hook√ì and leave the state √ímarooned√ì with its √íradical carbon cuts√ì. Last week the opposition announced it would cut emissions by 43% from 2005 levels by 2030 if it wins the next election. This compares to the Morrison government√ïs target of 26% to 28%. Canavan claimed Labor was looking to target 215 high-emitting facilities, and that almost one-third of those were in Queensland. This apparently equalled revenge for the state rejecting the opposition during the 2019 federal election. The Nationals senator said Labor√ïs √íradical carbon cuts√ì would cause √ímassive job losses√ì in the state. Coalition and Labor claim Australia√ïs ageing coal plants won√ït close early, but the figures don√ït add up Yet Labor√ïs proposal is based on a suggestion from the Business Council of Australia (BCA) to tighten a policy that was legislated in November 2014 by the Coalition, and came into force when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister. That policy is known as the safeguard mechanism, under which facilities such as mines and smelters that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent a year have to buy carbon credits if their emissions go above a predetermined cap. The BCA has also suggested the threshold for the mechanism be dropped below 100,000 tonnes, but Labor has said it will not do that. Labor does want to tighten this mechanism by reducing the caps each year, but hasn√ït decided yet exactly how the cuts will be distributed across the facilities. So the list of facilities Canavan says Labor is using to exact revenge on his own state, is in fact a list of companies compiled through the policy of his own government.  AngloAmerica√ïs Capcoal mine in the Bowen Basin, producing coal for steel-making, was top of a list of √íQueensland√ïs heaviest emitters√ì published in the Courier Mail, with emissions at 3.15m tonnes of CO2-equivalent a year. Capcoal√ïs owner, Anglo American, has a target to be carbon neutral across its worldwide operations, including its Australian mines, by 2040. Radical carbon cuts, anyone? But the Courier Mail√ïs list was not a rundown of Queensland√ïs heaviest emitters (and nor was it √îrevealed√ï as the newspaper claimed), but rather a list of the highest emitting facilities that are registered under the safeguard mechanism. Queensland√ïs biggest corporate emitter of greenhouse gases, according to federal government data, is actually Stanwell √ê the state-owned coal power generator that emits 17.1Mt of CO2e a year. Stanwell√ïs coal power units at Tarong alone emit 9.7Mt, but electricity generators are not currently covered by the safeguard mechanism. Off the hook? How about Canavan√ïs claim that using the safeguard mechanism lets other states √íoff the hook√ì? First, it should be no surprise that as the state with the highest emissions, accounting for almost a third of the nation√ïs entire footprint, Queensland will need to see greater cuts than elsewhere (the state√ïs 2030 target is still stuck on 30%). But in fact the state with the highest emissions under the safeguard mechanism is Western Australia, with 66 facilities generating 46.2Mt of CO2e last year, according to the Clean Energy Regulator√ïs data. Queensland had the second highest emissions, with 65 facilities generating 37.7Mt. There are 38 facilities in New South Wales generating 25.6Mt. Saying that using the safeguard mechanism to cut emissions allows other states √íoff the hook√ì isn√ït an argument that√ïs based on any objective reality. No hiding net zero There are fewer things more likely to get your audience angry than telling them something is really big and scary, and also that this big and scary thing is being hidden from them. No longer on Sky News and dropped from his Daily Telegraph column, Alan Jones √ê a longtime denier of climate change science √ê has a new streaming show Direct to the People that shuddered to a start this week. Jones told his new online audience that the world√ïs financial giants were being geared up for net zero, with $130tn of financial might signing up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for New Zero.  Jones asked his guest, Canavan, √íwhy aren√ït the public being told√ì and raged that banks were √íplaying this ideological game with our deposits√ì. √íThis is happening behind the scenes,√ì said Jones, adding that √íwe really have the makings of a financial crisis.√ì In reality, the shifting of global capital away from fossil fuels is motivated largely by avoiding a crisis where investments in dirty energy sources become stranded, sparking an actual financial crisis. Shareholders have been pushing major energy companies for years to transition their businesses to renewable energy. This apparently secretive deal that is being hidden from Australians is so clandestine that it has featured in news outlets across the world and is just the latest instalment in an issue that has been widely reported for years. The coalition has even led a parliamentary inquiry, due to report soon, on the issue of banks and insurers moving investments away from coal projects. Why are we not being told? The media release from the UK√ïs chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was presumably issued by mistake?"
GUA-2021-93.txt," Oliver Milman 16 d¬écembre 2021 The climate crisis is killing migrants trying to cross the US border, study finds theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/16/climate-crisis-sonoran-desert-killing-migrants-cross-us-border Undocumented migrants who attempt to cross the border from Mexico to the US are disproportionately dying in a harsh stretch of desert that is becoming deadlier due to the climate crisis, a new research has found. Climate crisis likely to fuel conflicts over water and migration, US analyses say Migrants and asylum seekers trying to enter the US are often forced to traverse the harsh environment of the Sonoran desert in order to avoid border patrols and fortified crossing points. This hazardous journey is putting many of them under severe physical stress, according to researchers, with many dying in the heat due to dehydration and organ failure. This risk will only intensify as the world heats up further due to human activity, with the research finding that in the next three decades migrants will become so dehydrated in the desert that they will have to carry 34% more water with them in order to survive. √íCrossing the border across these extreme environments is really dangerous for humans to do and in the next 30 years, with rising temperatures, it√ïs going to become even more extreme and push those levels to even further beyond what humans can actually sustain,√ì said Hallie Walker, a researcher at the University of Idaho and co-author of the research, published in Science. √íIt is incredibly dangerous.√ì In the year to 30 September, US border agents apprehended more than 1.7 million people attempting to cross from Mexico into the US. Many of those who avoid arrest do so by taking on the daunting journey across the Sonoran desert, a rocky, scrubby expanse of land in Mexico and the southwestern US that oscillates between scorching heat in summer to freezing conditions in winter and contains more species of rattlesnake than any region in the world. An estimated 350 people a year, many fleeing violence and persecution at home, die attempting this crossing, with some of these deaths due to suicide, exposure or car accidents. Researchers found, however, that a significant risk is the loss of fluids in a region where summer temperatures can reach 48C (118F). Using a model that factored in the physical toll of making a journey from Nogales, a Mexican border city and Three Points, Arizona, the study found that people can succumb to the conditions within just a few days, with migrants often ill-prepared for the journey. The stress is highest for pregnant women and children, with the research finding that a pregnant women needs nearly 12 liters of water a day to survive making the trek in June.  Many do not get the adequate water and rest required, leading to deaths. The study found a √ísignificant correlation between high levels of predicted evaporative water loss and the density of deaths√ì which √ístrongly implicate temperature and water availability as major contributors to broader patterns of migrant mortality during summer√ì. The loss of water can cause disorientation and hallucinations, before becoming potentially fatal. The research cites interviews with migrants who explain how their toenails fell off during long hikes over the desert√ïs mountains or how they lost their eyesight and suffered chest pains as they struggled onward. √íEssentially the US is funneling individuals into places that they experience such extreme physiological stress that I, as an evolutionary biologist, couldn√ït get approval from my university to put animals through the sorts of stresses that individuals are being put through,√ì said Shane Campbell-Staton, a researcher at Princeton and lead author of the study. √íThat√ïs how extreme these physiological stresses are.√ì Migrants crossing the US√ï southern border have become a political target in recent years, with Donald Trump instituting punishing detention and child separation policies, as well as a system known as √íremain in Mexico√ì, which expels people back to Mexico as their claim to stay in the US is considered. Joe Biden opposed this plan but recently reinstated it following a legal challenge from two states. This sort of deterrence is unlikely to completely halt people from seeking refuge in the US, particularly those increasingly fleeing intolerable conditions in Mexico and Central America that are being worsened by the climate crisis. A series of droughts and storms have wreaked havoc upon communities, particularly farmers, forcing them to seek livable alternatives further north. √íWe knowingly kill them at the border. And yet we ignore them once they√ïre here, when they√ïre doing the jobs that Americans don√ït want to do,√ì said Jason De Leon, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was also involved in the study. √íI think we were about to live in a climatic version of the book Children of Men, where instead of a fertility issue, we√ïre dealing now with a global climatic issue. We are seeing people having to leave their homes because of climate change,√ì he added. √íAnd I think that we can no longer disentangle those two things, that they√ïre intimately related and it√ïs only going to get worse, unfortunately for a lot of people around the globe.√ì"
GUA-2021-94.txt," Lisa Cox 13 d¬écembre 2021 Conservation documents for half of all critically endangered species don√ït mention climate change theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/14/conservation-documents-for-half-of-australias-endangered-speciesdont- mention-climate-change Conservation documents for more than half of Australia√ïs critically endangered species and habitats fail to mention climate change according to new analysis that argues there is a significant √íclimate gap√ì in the management of Australia√ïs threatened wildlife. The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) and prepared by the Australian National University√ïs GreenLaw project, which is led by students in the ANU√ïs law faculty. The analysis examined the extent to which conservation documents for Australia√ïs most imperilled wildlife discussed and addressed the threat of global heating. Lost, then found, then lost again: can we learn from the extinction of the paradise parrot? It found that for 178 out of 334 critically endangered species and habitats the threat of climate change was not mentioned in the government√ïs conservation information at all. When it was mentioned, the analysis found the information √ítended to be brief and generalised√ì and the recommended actions to mitigate the threat were limited. √íOur results demonstrate there is a significant climate gap in the management of Australia√ïs threatened species,√ì said GreenLaw chief executive and lead researcher, Annika Reynolds. The report argues that without such an analysis there was a risk that management of wildlife or decisions about developments affecting it would not factor in the impact of the climate crisis. √íIt means that the recovery actions that are meant to be happening are not going to be informed by the latest and most up-to-date information about the threat of climate change to those critically endangered species and communities,√ì said Brendan Sydes, the ACF√ïs biodiversity policy adviser. √íRecovery plans are supposed to inform recovery efforts, so if they√ïre not actually capturing the threats and the actions that are required to address them, there is a risk those actions could be misdirected.√ì When species and habitats are listed as threatened under Australia√ïs environmental laws, information is generally prepared that describes the level of decline, key threats and actions to help their recovery.  These conservation documents can take the form of either a recovery plan, which the environment minister is legally bound not to act inconsistently with; or, more commonly, a conservation advice √ê a similar document but which does not have the same legal force under national law. GreenLaw examined these documents for all species and ecological communities listed as critically endangered under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The group found in addition to some documents not mentioning global heating at all, there were others where the threat was mentioned but no actions that could be taken to address it were discussed because this was √íoutside the scope of the plan√ì. They found climate was omitted from some documents where there was scientific uncertainty about its likely impact for that particular plant, animal or habitat. But Reynolds said the information gap was also evident for some species that √íwere known to suffer from extreme heat and drought√ì, such as the short-nosed sea snake and the leafscaled sea snake. Documents for those species do not discuss climate change directly despite listing coral bleaching as a major threat. There were also other species that fell outside the scope of the analysis because they have a lower threat status but whose documentation excludes up-to-date information on the climate crisis. The conservation advice for the spectacled flying fox lists climate change as a √ípotential√ì and √ífuture√ì threat despite the animal being uplisted to endangered in 2019 after almost a third of its population was wiped out by a heatwave. The report found that conservation documents that had been written or updated in the past three years were more likely to include a detailed analysis of the climate threat. The ACF said the government needed to increase funding for threatened species recovery, including funds to update its scientific information about the impacts of the climate crisis on individual plants, animals and habitats. √íThere√ïs just a political commitment that√ïs lacking at the moment,√ì Sydes said. Recovery planning for species has come under the spotlight in recent years. Guardian Australia has previously reported that fewer than 40% of listed threatened species have a recovery plan. A further 10% of all those listed have been identified as requiring a recovery plan but those plans haven√ït been developed or are unfinished. Even more plans are out of date. In September, the government announced it would scrap recovery plans √ê in favour of a conservation advice √ê for almost 200 endangered species and habitats including the Tasmanian devil, the whale shark and the critically endangered Cumberland plain woodland.  A spokesperson for the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the minister had reviewed and made several new recovery plans and conservation advices that included new research, bushfire impacts and other factors. √íA number of plans are currently with states and territories, and are in the process of being updated to include multiple factors including climate,√ì they said. √íWhere relevant, information on climate change informs the development of conservation advice at the time a species is listed and in the development of any recovery plan.√ì The spokesperson added that the government√ïs $200m for bushfire recovery had contributed to significant scientific research on species affected by extreme weather. The new threatened species strategy for 2021 to 2026 had eight action areas, including one focused on climate change adaptation and resilience to √íreduce the impact of established pressures on threatened species and assist them to adapt to a changing climate√ì. "

Nations will be asked to return next year to strengthen their targets on emissions cuts, which are so far inadequate, and to accelerate the phase-out of coal power and fossil fuel subsidies. Make sure to follow along with all our Cop26 developments as reactions will no doubt continue to pour in. 14 Nov 2021 04:41 Summary of key developments and reactions After two long weeks of talks and negotiations, a deal has finally been struck that for the first time targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming, despite last-minute wrangling over coal objections. The goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C, the key threshold of safety set out in the 2015 Paris agreement, may still be within reach. Key talking points included provisions on phasing out coal, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and providing money to poor and vulnerable nations. The global community responded with both praise and disappointment as smaller island nations most vulnerable to the consequences of climate change fought to be heard and larger more developed nations agreed to take some compromises onboard. India defended its last-minute revision to reject a clause calling for the √íphase out√ì of coal-fired power. The nation√ïs environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the revision reflected the √ínational circumstances of emerging economies.√ì European Commission president Ursula don der Leyen declared the agreement √ía step in the right direction√ì. UK prime minister Boris Joh nson said √íserious breakthroughs√ì were made. European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said humanity must now √ílearn to live within planetary boundaries√ì while praising the ambitions made.  The UNsecretary general Ant¬ónio Guterres urged those who may be disappointed in the agreements made to √ínever give up√ì on the fight for climate action. √íI know you might be disappointed. But we√ïre in the fight of our lives and this fight must be won,√ì he said. Cop26 president Alok Sharma called the outcome of discussions √ía fragile win√ì while praising the √íhard work√ì and √ígreat cooperation√ì from negotiators, ministers and all the parties. US president Joe Biden said his administration√ïs Build Back Better framework √íwill be the largest effort to combat climate change in American history√ì. Amnesty International described the outcome a catastrophic failure and a betrayal to humanity. Canada√ïs minister of environment and climate change Steven Guilbeault pledged to do more with √ípublic and private sectors are accelerating their actions√ì in the fight against climate change. Fiji√ïs prime minister Frank Bainimaramacalled the outcome a √ícompromise√ì and said the 1.5C target leaves Glasgow √íbattered, bruised, but alive√ì. The leader thanked Pacific negotiators for their √íheroic effort√ì to secure a path away from coal and fossil fuel subsidies in the final deal. Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the countries in the world most vulnerable to climate change, described the deal as √ínot perfect√ì but acknowledged elements of the agreement are √ía lifeline√ì for the country. Updated at 5.02am GMT Uncertainty whether Australia will update 2030 emissions target as required under Cop26 deal Amy Remeikis A senior Australian minister has welcomed the summit outcome but sidestepped questions on updating the 2030 emissions target as required under the Glasgow Cop26 agreement and instead quoted Shakespeare. Greg Hunt has refused to say whether Australia under a Scott Morrison government will update its 2030 emissions target as required under the Glasgow Cop26 agreement and instead quoted Shakespeare. Australian foreign minister and emissions reduction minister Angus Taylor said in a joint statement on Sunday: √íAustralia√ïs 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets.√ì However, Hunt dodged a series of questions when he appeared on the ABC√ïs Insiders program. He said Australia √íwelcomed the outcome at Glasgow√ì as √íimportant progress for the world√ì but would not answer questions on whether Australia would update its 2030 target next year.  Greg Hunt won√ït say if Australia will update 2030 emissions target as required, instead quoting Shakespeare Australia 'let down our Pacific neighbours', climate council says Australia failed to rise to the challenge during Cop26 talks, the nation√ïs Climate Council, an organisation comprised of some of the country√ïs leading climate scientists, health, renewable energy and policy experts, has said. Dr Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the organisation, says 140 countries lifted their game at Cop26 but Australia wasn√ït one of them. √íThe federal government showed up empty-handed to a pivotal moment in the fight for our future,√ì he said. √íThey√ïve let down our Pacific neighbours, as well as Australians who do not deserve to endure more frequent and severe bushfires, floods, droughts and heatwaves. √íAs our allies and trading partners rise to the climate challenge, we√ïre stuck in a polluting past with a handful of countries including Russia and Saudi Arabia.√ì Updated at 5.08am GMT Mexico has voiced its disappointment at the new agreement, saying they were √ísidelined√ì in the deal. √íWe believe we have been side-lined in a non-transparent and non-inclusive process,√ì the nation√ïs envoy Camila Isabel Zepeda Lizama said in a statement to Reuters. √íWe all have remaining concerns but were told we could not reopen the text √â while others can still ask to water down their promises.√ì However, the north American country said they would let the revised agreement stand. India√ïs last-minute revision to reject a clause calling for the √íphase out√ì of coal-fired power has been supported by the nation√ïs environment and climate minister. Bhupender Yadav said the revision reflected the √ínational circumstances of emerging economies.√ì √íWe are becoming the voice of the developing countries,√ì he told Reuters, saying the pact had √ísingled out√ì coal but kept quiet about oil and natural gas. √íWe made our effort to make a consensus that is reasonable for developing countries and reasonable for climate justice,√ì he said, alluding to the fact that rich nations historically have emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases.  Tina Stege, climate envoy for the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the countries in the world most vulnerable to climate change, has described the deal as √ínot perfect√ì but acknowledged elements of the agreement are √ía lifeline√ì for the country. √íThis Package is not perfect. The coal change and a weak outcome on loss and damage are blows,√ì she said. √íBut it is real progress and elements of the Glasgow Package are a lifeline for my country.√ì Stege has pushed for stronger climate action by campaigning with the High Ambition Coalition (HAC), a grouping at the UN talks comprising many of the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries. √íWe are a small nation, but we have moral authority √ê our position on the frontline gives us that,√ì she said. √íWe need to raise our voice, as these changes will affect the whole world in time.√ì Tina Stege (@EnvoyRmi) 1/ This Package is not perfect.

The leader thanked Pacific negotiators for their √íheroic effort√ì at Cop26 to secure a path away from coal and fossil fuel subsidies in the final deal. √íThe compromise we√ïve struck will only count if nations now deliver,√ì he added. Frank Bainimarama (@FijiPM) The 1.5-degree target leaves Glasgow battered, bruised, but alive. Vinaka to our Pacific negotiators for a heroic effort at #COP26 to secure a path away from coal and fossil fuel subsidies in our final deal. The compromise we√ïve struck will only count if nations now deliver. November 13, 2021 The biggest achievements to come from the deal After more than two weeks of intense negotiations, here are the biggest achievements of the deal.  Governments have been urged to strengthen their targets to cut emissions of planetheating greenhouse gases by the end of next year, rather than every five years, as previously required. Targeting fossil fuels: The pact for the first time includes language that asks countries to reduce their reliance on coal and roll back fossil fuel subsidies. The wording was contentious, though, with India requesting that the deal call on countries to √íphase down√ì, instead of √íphase out√ì unabated coal. Payments to poor and vulnerable nations: The deal made some headway on the demands of poor and vulnerable countries that wealthy countries responsible for most emissions pay up. The deal, for example √íurges developed country Parties to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country Parties from 2019 levels by 2025.√ì It also, for the first time, made mention of so-called √íloss and damage√ì in the cover section of the agreement. Rules for global carbon markets: Negotiators also closed a deal setting rules for carbon markets, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for protecting forests, building renewable energy facilities and other projects to combat climate change. Companies as well as countries with vast forest cover had pushed for a robust deal on government-led carbon markets in Glasgow, in the hope of also legitimising the fastgrowing global voluntary offset markets. Under the accord, some measures would be implemented to ensure credits are not double-counted under national emissions targets, but bilateral trades between countries would not be taxed to help fund climate adaptation - that had been a core demand for less developed countries. Negotiators also reached a compromise that sets a cut-off date, with credits issued before 2013 not being carried forward. That is intended to ensure too many old credits don√ït flood the market and encourage purchases instead of new emissions cuts. Canada√ïs minister of environment and climate change has pledged to do more. √íWe know we need to do more and that the world needs to do more. Canadians gave us a mandate to go further and faster in our fight against climate change and there is no doubt that we have our work cut out for us,√ì Steven Guilbeault said in a statement. √íAs someone who has been at this for almost 3 decades, I will say that we haven√ït and won√ït be able to win every single battle in the fight against climate change. But I want Canadians to know that I have never seen more momentum or desire to beat climate change.  √íThe public and private sectors are accelerating their actions Canada is at the forefront and countries are working to keep 1.5C within reach. We can and we will pass down a planet to our kids and grandkids that is in better shape than how we found it. The fight continues in earnest and Canada will keep pushing.√ì Updated at 1.48am GMT What is √îloss and damage√ï and is it included in the final deal? The bitterly fought-over issue of compensation for poor countries over the destruction wreaked by the climate crisis, otherwise known as √íloss and damage√ì, did not make it into the final deal. Vulnerable and poor countries, which did little to cause the climate crisis, sought a commitment from rich nations to compensate them for this damage. Although the deal did make some headway on the demands that wealthy countries responsible for most emissions pay up, developed countries have essentially just agreed to continue discussions on the topic. The deal, for example √íurges developed country Parties to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country Parties from 2019 levels by 2025.√ì Activist groups respond, dismissing the deal as √íweak√ì and √ícunningly curated√ì. Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said: √íIt√ïs meek, it√ïs weak and the 1.5C goal is only just alive, but a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending - and that matters. √íWhile the deal recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade, those commitments have been punted to next year. Young people who√ïve come of age in the climate crisis won√ït tolerate many more outcomes like this. Why should they when they√ïre fighting for their futures?√ì Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: √íThis summit has seen the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C become the North Star guiding us all but a clear pathway is far from certain and we still have a long way to go.√ì Gabriela Bucher, international executive director of Oxfam, said: √íClearly some world leaders think they aren√ït living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity.√ì Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: √íThe road to 1.5 just got harder when these talks should have cleared the way to making it a whole lot easier.  √íThe UK government cunningly curated announcements throughout this fortnight so that it seemed rapid progress was being made ... Here we are though, and the Glasgow get-out clause means that leaders failed to phase out fossil fuels and the richest countries won√ït pay historic climate debt.√ì Updated at 1.19am GMT Greenpeace Australia Pacific CEO David Ritter said that while the final text of the agreement is far from perfect, the message to Australia and other fossil fuel producers is clear. √íThe momentum is in the right direction,√ì Ritter said. √íThe task ahead is relentless pressure on the fossil fuel corporations and reckless governments such as Australia√ïs.√ì"
GUA-2021-96.txt," Jeff Sparrow 17 novembre 2021 Neoliberalism wrecked our chance to fix the climate crisis √ê and leftwing statements of faith have changed nothing theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/nov/17/neoliberalism-wrecked-our-chance-to-fix-the-climate-crisis-andleftwing- statements-of-faith-have-changed-nothing Why didn√ït we nip climate change in the bud? Nathaniel Rich poses that question in an important article for the New York Times Magazine in 2018 (later published as a book). He notes that, for a brief period in the late 1980s, a consensus developed on the necessity for action. Back then, no one considered the science controversial and so a surprising number of mainstream politicians both acknowledged the threat facing humanity and pledged themselves to address it. √íThe conditions for success,√ì Rich says, √ícould not have been more favorable.√ì The opportunity was squandered because of a reluctance to sacrifice √ípresent convenience to forestall a penalty imposed on future generations√ì, something he attributes to human nature. The Canadian writer Naomi Klein rejects that part of the argument with a righteous fury. She insists that, in fact, the timing could not have been worse, since the late 1980s represented √íthe absolute zenith√ì of the neoliberal turn. Rather than human nature, the problem was that, just as √ígovernments were getting together to get serious about reining in the fossil fuel sector, the global neoliberal revolution went supernova, and that project of economic and social reengineering clashed with the imperatives of both climate science and corporate regulation at every turn√ì. Fanatically committed to the free market as a regulator of all human social interactions, politicians ruled out public spending or direct bans on emissions. The only measures deemed credible centred on creating trading systems that turned environmental outcomes into commodities on which global financiers could speculate √ê in essence, nominating the most venal people on the planet as the best bet for saving humanity. Unsurprisingly, corporate business continued as usual and the environmental disaster grew exponentially worse. We might complement Klein√ïs account by noting another way that the climate crisis emerged at a particularly inopportune moment.  The 1980s were, after all, also a decade in which progressive politics changed significantly. Many of the core assumptions of the left developed from the social movements of the 1960s and the 1970s. That was an era dominated by what in my book Trigger Warnings I call √ídirect politics√ì: a time of collective protests, of grassroots mobilisations with a focus on participatory democracy centred on workers, students and the oppressed. The advocates of direct politics drew connections between seemingly disparate issues (national liberation, black liberation, women√ïs liberation, gay liberation and so on) arguing that all manner of social ills required material social change, achievable only if the masses united against the small minority that benefited from the status quo. As the radicalism of the 1960s waned, the mass action of direct politics became more difficult to organise. Activist and historian Todd Gitlin notes that, from about the mid-1970s, the formerly prevalent commitment to revolutionary ideals gave way to what he calls √íthe practical pursuit of reforms√ì. Many ex-radicals managed to find professional outlets for their activism. Some became academics; others formed or joined non-governmental organisations, political parties, consultancies, charities and businesses. In the new climate of the 1980s, with protests, rallies and strikes smaller and harder to organise than before, leftists became accustomed to presenting arguments in the name of a constituency that no longer mobilised. Rather than the radical participation associated with direct politics, they embraced a √ídelegated politics√ì, in which activists √ê usually with some sort of institutional authority √ê advocated on behalf of a largely passive rank and file. That corresponded with different slogans. Instead of pushing for deep, structural change, they increasingly focused on symbolic or cultural reforms, centred particularly on places like university campuses. Though many of the demands associated with delegated politics were entirely valid, the new emphasis had profound consequences √ê and nowhere more so than in relation to climate change. Global warming is, after all, quintessentially material: a process resulting from the peculiar relationship capitalism mandates between humanity and nature. Al Gore √îdisappointed√ï Scott Morrison didn√ït cut Australia√ïs 2030 emissions target Yet the new propensity for activists to see politics primarily in terms of culture enabled corporations to shift the focus away from production and into the symbolic realm. Climate duly became a central front in the culture war that has raged more or less unabated since the 1990s, a conflict fought out largely at the level of representation.  Abandoning economics to the free market right, progressives sought to inspire change either through individual examples (recycling, bicycle riding, etc) or symbolic events such as Earth Hour. Politically, environmentalism often manifested in terms of belief rather than action. With conservatives pandering to climate scepticism, liberals voted for candidates who promised they √íaccepted the science√ì. Yet, on their own, such statements of faith changed nothing. Think of Barack Obama√ïs soaring speech at Cop26. Symbolically, his oratory could not be more different from the overt denialism of Donald Trump or the grudging acquiescence of Scott Morrison. Yet, during an impeccably neoliberal presidency, Obama had, as he later boasted, turned America into the world√ïs largest oil and gas producer. In terms of symbolism, Obama stood with progressives against the anti-science Republicanism who despised him. Materially, though, he only intensified the reliance on fossil fuels. Atmospheric carbon does not care about culture war. Neither should we. Global warming exacerbates every kind of inequality, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most oppressed people on the planet. In that way, it creates a tremendous potential constituency for direct politics, for a mass, participatory campaign to fundamentally reshape how humans relate to nature √ê and to each other. But to seize the opportunity, progressives need a quite different orientation. If we keep fighting in the realm of symbolism, our last, best chance to save the planet will slip through our fingers, too."

Temperatures are rising twice as fast as the global average, and with horrible inevitability the population is hit by extreme weather event after extreme weather event √ê droughts, especially in northern Afghanistan, floods, and avalanches. Springs are becoming drier, autumns wetter. Crop loss caused by drought means that the country is missing 40% of the wheat it needs this year and the United Nations reported that 22m Afghans will suffer from √íacute food insecurity√ì this winter. The Taliban takeover has meant a loss of international aid. Afghanistan had no official seat at Cop26. Australia Under the current government, Australia is seen as a climate dissident, the biggest exporter of fossil gas in the world and the second biggest of thermal coal, with a foot on the brake of the march to net zero. And yet, due to its geography, it is vulnerable to increasing temperatures, day and night. In 2019 there were 43 √íextremely warm days,√ì triple the number before 2000, this in term increases the length of the bush fire season. The horrendous fires of 2019-20 affected cricket with youth and Big Bash matches postponed, and players complaining of toxic air over the SCG. Rising sea temperatures are threatening the Great Barrier Reef while reduced rainfall threatens crops and river flow. Bangladesh Densely populated and low-lying, Bangladesh was ranked the seventh most climate-vulnerable country between 2000 and 2019 by the Global Climate Risk Index. Nearly 170m people live on the delta of two of the world√ïs biggest rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Rising sea levels increase salinisation, polluting local wells and reducing supplies of drinking water, as well as damaging crops and soil. It is estimated that by 2050 one in seven Bangladeshis will have been displaced because of rising sea levels. England and Scotland The UK has become 0.9 degrees warmer and six per cent wetter over the last 30 years. All of the top 10 hottest years have been since 2002 and infrastructure struggles once the temperature rises, with roads melting, rail lines buckling √ê twice, in recent years, Lord√ïs has allowed members to remove their jackets because of the heat. Increased flooding has cost cricket dearly both in terms of finance √ê the storms  of December 2015 caused more than ¬£3.5m worth of damage across 57 cricket clubs √ê and in terms of games postponed and cancelled, both in the recreational and professional game. IndiaCricket√ïs big beast is on the frontline of the climate crisis, hit by erratic monsoons √ê with less rain but at a higher intensity √ê flooding, landslides and heatwaves. This summer, the Lancet Planetary Health journal estimated that there are 740,000 excess deaths a year in India due to extreme temperatures related to climate change. Nor is cricket immune: pollution stopped play in the 2017 Delhi Test between India and Sri Lanka when players were sick on the pitch and IPL matches have been switched because of lack of water. Namibia An extremely climate-vulnerable country, one of the driest south of the Sahara desert. Rainfall is increasingly unpredictable, with knock-on effects for agriculture and livestock particularly for the poorest people. Higher temperatures and extreme heat are expected to increase evaporation and therefore aridity, as well as the incidence of disease, while rising sea levels will affect numbers of fish. Even if temperature increases globally were able to be kept to 1.5 degrees over the pre-industrial baseline, Namibia√ïs temperature is projected to increase by two degrees. New Zealand The majority of New Zealanders live on the coast and many on flood plains. Rising sea levels and increases in extreme rainfall will increase the risk of flooding and the potential for salt water to enter the freshwater systems. Of New Zealand√ïs 50,000 species, half are found nowhere else in the world and changing climate conditions puts them increasingly at risk, with 70 native plants likely to be at risk of extinction by 2100. Changing ocean chemistry is already affecting marine life. Pakistan Ranked the eighth most climate-vulnerable country between 2000 and 2019, Pakistan is threatened in all directions: from extreme heat, from the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, from more intense monsoons √ê nine inches of rain fell in a day in Karachi last August. Deforestation √ê from 33% of the country in 1947 to 4% today √ê mostly driven by illegal logging, has left a country with little protection against flooding and storms. South Africa The Cape Town drought of 2015-18 saw the temporary cancellation of club and school cricket as the population√ïs water was rationed and the country counted down to Day Zero. A year later the dams were 80% full, but the threat of water shortage hangs heavy over a country where temperatures are increasing and rainfall is decreasing. The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email. Sri Lanka Nearly half of Sri Lanka√ïs population live in low-lying costal areas, making them extremely vulnerable to sea-level rise. The rise in the number of days of extreme heat threatens particularly the poor, and those labourers working without protection from the sun. Increasing temperatures are likely to affect rice yields and add to food insecurity.  West Indies The prime minister of Barbados, Mia Motley QC, has been lauded for the most powerful speech at Cop26. √íThe pandemic has shown us that national solutions to global problems do not work,√ì she told the delegates. √íWhat must we say to our people living on the front line in the Caribbean, in Africa, in Latin America, in the Pacific, when both ambition and regrettably some of the needed faces are not present? What excuse should we give for failure? In the words of that Caribbean icon Eddy Grant, will they mourn us on the front line?√ì"
GUA-2021-98.txt," Nina Lakhani 16 novembre 2021 √îA death sentence√ï: Indigenous climate activists denounce Cop26 deal theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/16/indigenous-climate-activists-cop26-endangers-native-communities Schemes such as carbon trading favored by polluting nations lead to ecologically destructive projects like biofuels and dams Indigenous communities facing an upsurge in land grabs, water shortages and human rights violations as a result of the Cop26 deal have accused world leaders of sacrificing them in order to postpone meaningful climate action and shield corporate profits. The Glasgow deal creates a regulated global carbon trading market √ê a move widely supported by the world√ïs biggest polluters including the US √ê allowing countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying credits representing emission cuts by others. Critics warn that carbon markets incentivize countries and corporations to offset √ê rather than cut √ê emissions responsible for global heating by investing in so-called green energy projects like biofuel monocrops and hydroelectric dams, which are linked to environmental destruction, forced displacement, arbitrary arrests and even murder. In addition, such carbon credit schemes often rely on sequestering land, forests and rivers relied on by indigenous and local communities for food, water, medicine and spiritual traditions, and there is little evidence to suggest they lead to a genuine drop in emissions. In fact, global emissions have continued to soar since carbon credits were first incentivized under the voluntary Kyoto protocol in 1997, as have abuses against indigenous and rural communities defending land rights and natural resources. Now, indigenous communities fear what√ïs coming next as the scope and scale of the new global carbon market √ê introduced in article 6 of the Paris accords √ê is much wider. Far more countries and industries, including the US, Saudi Arabia and civil aviation, will participate. √íCop26 leaders signed an agreement that will entrench sacrificing Indigenous people √â [but] failed to include real solutions to meet the climate chaos that many of our frontline Indigenous communities are facing,√ì said Thomas Joseph from the Hoopa tribe, located in California. √íThe leaders pushing for market-based solutions and the commodification of our Mother Earth are signing a death sentence.√ì Andrea Xieu, a spokesperson for the Mexican collective Futuros Ind¬ígenas (Indigenous Futures) described the deal as an embarrassment that illustrated the murky influence of fossil fuel companies in Glasgow.  More than 500 fossil fuel lobbyists, affiliated with some of the world√ïs biggest oil and gas companies, were granted access to Cop26 √ê a larger number than any single country delegation. Meanwhile, indigenous people were mostly excluded, and their traditional knowledge on sustainable land and water management sidelined. √íIndigenous nations were not part of the negotiations despite the fact that 80% of the planet√ïs biodiversity survives in our territories. The problem is not only the blah, blah, blah of politicians, but the bang, bang, bang of greenwashing that will continue to destroy our lives and territories,√ì said Xieu. The problem is not only the blah, blah, blah of politicians, but the bang, bang, bang of greenwashing At least 1,005 environmental and land rights defenders have been murdered since the Paris accords were signed six years ago, according to the international non-profit Global Witness. One in three of those killed were indigenous people. The dead include the Lenca leader Berta C¬áceres, winner of the prestigious Goldman prize for environmental defenders, who was shot dead at her home in Honduras in March 2016 for opposing the construction of an internationally financed dam. Carbon trading is one of the so-called nature-based solutions to the climate crisis heavily promoted by big polluters at Cop26 as the silver bullet to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 with little pain for people in the global north. But critics say offsetting carbon is a false solution as it essentially allows polluters to keep polluting and thus net zero is not actually zero. √íNet zero is a scam. It is used as a smokescreen to avoid actual transition away from fossil fuels and carry on business as usual by relying on unproven carbon capture technologies and offsets,√ì said Sebastien Duyck, senior attorney from the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL) and an official observer. At the last minute, activists helped secure a handful of new safeguards for article 6 such as an independent grievance mechanism. But according to Duyck, carbon markets remain counterproductive and fundamentally harmful. Investors will still be able to qualify for incentives without complying with international treaties that require indigenous people to be properly consulted. √íArticle 6 creates a way for public and private investors to weaponize the Paris agreement for the sake of profits at the cost of local communities and indigenous people√ïs rights,√ì added Duyck. Another nature-based solution popular with polluters is the creation of carbon sinks through massive reforestation and afforestation programs.  While not part of the official Cop26 deal, according to some calculations countries collectively pledged to plant enough trees to cover a landmass the size of Australia. However, that threatens livelihoods, food security and sacred traditions of indigenous communities and small-scale farmers who use much of the land being earmarked for tree planting. √íNature-based solutions sound nice, but they won√ït solve the climate crisis even if you√ïre willing to sacrifice indigenous people and local communities,√ì said Sophie Grig from Survival International. √íNet zero is disingenuous and a diversion from doing what needs to be done now: stop burning fossil fuels and protect indigenous land rights.√ì Also gaining traction is the UN√ïs 30 by 30 initiative √ê a plan to conserve 30% of the planet√ïs land and seas by 2030 through conservation measures like doubling protected nature reserves, which Joe Biden has promised to implement as part of his climate strategy. Speaking in Glasgow last week, Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, said 30 by 30 would be the biggest planet grab in history, leading to millions of people being displaced. Tom Goldtooth, a climate and Indigenous rights leader, spoke to the Prince of Wales during the Cop26 summit. Photograph: Clarence House/PA Another big worry for indigenous communities is Cop26√ïs failure to help those on the frontline recover, rebuild and adapt to global heating. Rich polluting countries succeeded in obstructing the creation of a loss and damage fund to compensate communities who have already lost their homes and livelihoods from floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. After almost 15 years of discussion and delays on loss and damage, the Glasgow deal mandates further dialogue. √íThe results of this Cop are not a surprise, but they represent the state of the governments and their feelings, which are completely at odds with wider civil society demanding concrete actions and urgent measures,√ì said Calfin Lafkenche, a Mapuche organiser with the Minga movement, an indigenous solidarity network. In response to the acts and omissions at Cop26, the women of the Kichwa Indigenous People of Sarayaku, located in Ecuador, declared a state of emergency, citing the summit√ïs failure to address the existential threats posed to them by fossil fuel companies and the climate crisis. In a statement, the women said: √íIndigenous peoples resist the extraction of natural resources with our bodies, with our lives. Our contribution to tackling climate change must be recognized. Our solutions must be heard.√ì "
Guardian-2020-10.txt,"  The climate crisis looms as the Coalition Ô¨Åddles with fossil fuels Greg Jericho The government is like a smoker switching to low8tar cigarettes. Its energy policy is just a sop  

Sat 23 May 2020 21.00 BST

  We may be dealing with a health crisis, but the climate change crisis has not gone away, nor become any less urgent. In fact, the opposite.  A few conservative commentators have suggested Covid-19 shows what a real crisis looks like compared with, in their opinion, the hyperventilating over climate change.  What bollocks.  Nasa estimates that last month was the hottest April on record and the Ô¨Årst four months of this year are the second hottest start to a year.   The past seven months have all been 1C or higher than the 1951-1980 average (roughly around 1.3C above the pre-industrial average) ‚Äì tied with the longest streak set from October 2015 to April 2016. But unlike in 2015 and 2016 the Bureau of Meteorology records we are currently not in El Ni√±o.  That very much suggests the pace of warming is speeding up.  The linear trend of temperatures over the past 60 years suggests we will hit 2C above pre- industrial levels in 50 years; the trend of the past 20 years has it happening in around 30 years, but the trend of the past decade would see us hit that level in 2038 ‚Äìjust 18 years‚Äô time.  In 2018, the IPCC warned we had little time to keep temperatures below 1.5C above pre- industrial levels. If the trend of the past decade continues, we‚Äôll hit that temperature in 2025.  And no, the virus has not bought us more time.  A study published this week in Nature Climate Change estimates the annual global drop in emissions due to virus shutdowns will be ‚Äúcomparable to the rates of decrease needed year-on- year over the next decades to limit climate change to a 1.5¬∞C warming‚Äù.  That it took forcing people to stop their lives to achieve such cuts highlights just how big the job ahead of us is and how it cannot be done through individual action alone.  Cutting emissions without crippling the economy requires not everyone self-isolating, but changing industries and the very foundations of our economy.  We need to move away from oil, coal and gas to renewable energy.  And so it should be of great concern that the government is using the coronavirus as cover to push fossil fuels.  This week Adam Morton revealed that a manufacturing taskforce, headed by Dow Chemical executive and Saudi Aramco board member Andrew Liveris, is recommending to the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (itself headed by the current deputy chairman of Strike Energy, Neville Power) that ‚Äúthe Morrison government make sweeping changes to ‚Äòcreate the market‚Äô for gas and build fossil fuel infrastructure that would operate for decades‚Äù.  It comes oÔ¨Ä the back of Angus Taylor suggesting it is not government policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and the government giving in-principle support to recommendations made by a panel headed by a former CEO of Origin Energy, Grant King, to allow the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund projects involving carbon capture and storage.  Taylor also this week released a discussion paper for a ‚Äúframework to accelerate low emissions technologies‚Äù. While suggesting renewables are vital, it essentially pushes for the same energy mixes that were being advocated a decade ago ‚Äì more gas, the discredited carbon capture, as well as nuclear power.  The government is like a smoker who still thinks switching to low-tar cigarettes is a healthy approach.   It‚Äôs the wrong policy at precisely the wrong time.  As Morton has reported, organisations and governments around the world are advocating using economic stimulus measures to push towards a greener economy.  A report released this week by the Australian Conservation Foundation echoed the Grattan Institute‚Äôs recent ‚ÄúStart with steel: A practical plan to support carbon workers and cut emissions‚Äù report, arguing that we should see the virus as an opportunity to transform our economy and invest in renewable energy.  But no. It is clear the government remains wedded to a fossil-fuel based economy in which its climate change policy is merely a sop rather being designed to deal with a major crisis that is only becoming more urgent.

Guardian-2020-11.txt,"'Happy corals': climate crisis sanctuary teeming with
life found off east Africa



Karen McVeigh

15 d√©cembre
2020

Scientists have discovered a climate crisis refuge for coral reefs off the coast of Kenya
and Tanzania, where species are thriving despite warming events that have killed their
neighbours.

The coral sanctuary is a wildlife hotspot, teeming with spinner dolphins and boasting
rare species, including prehistoric fish and dugongs. Researchers believe its location in
a cool spot in the ocean is helping to protect it and the surrounding marine life from the
harmful effects of the climate crisis.

Tim McClanahan, the author of a study on the refuge published this month in Advances
in Marine Biology, has been looking for coral sanctuaries in the west Indian Ocean for
more than a decade.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited about it,‚Äù McClanahan said. ‚ÄúIt gives us something to hope for. Some
good news in gloomy times.‚Äù

Marine biologists are scouring the ocean to find and protect coral refuges ‚Äì areas where
reefs have the best chance to survive the climate crisis.

Deep-sea ‚Äògold rush‚Äô: secretive plans to carve up the seabed decried

McClanahan, the lead scientist for the  Wildlife Conservation Society, who lives and
works in Mombasa, Kenya, said he had an ‚Äúepiphany‚Äù when he realised why the reef was
so rich in wildlife. The coastline has the highest density of dolphins in east Africa, and
coelacanths, fish once believed extinct, swim in its deep waters. ‚ÄúI thought ‚Äòwhy are all
the animals here?‚Äô And I realised it was because of Kilimanjaro,‚Äù he said.

The coral refuge, which stretches from Shimoni, 50 miles south of Mombasa, in Kenya
to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, is fed by cool water from deep channels formed
thousands of years ago by glacial runoff from Kilimanjaro and the Usambara
mountains.

The cool water appears to protect the corals from episodic warming events like El Ni√±o.

McClanahan put temperature gauges along the coast and used satellite data to monitor
them. Then, when there was a warming event, which occur only every few years, he got
into the water to see its effects for himself.


‚ÄúIt turns out there is a long stretch from Kenyan waters into Dar Es Salaam where these
warm water events like El Ni√±o don‚Äôt penetrate. So the stress killing corals does not
penetrate. Outside that area, the corals are bleached and dying. But inside the area, of
around 400 sq km [150 sq miles] they retain their colour and their health. They are
reds and brown. My research partner likes to call them: ‚Äòhappy corals‚Äô.‚Äù

McClanahan said he has found three potential coral sanctuaries in the western Indian
Ocean, but only for this one is the available scientific evidence ‚Äúpretty strong‚Äù.

Part of his research was to examine whether ‚Äì if fisheries are better managed ‚Äì the
effects of global heating could be mitigated in the ocean.

‚ÄúOur study shows that while warming waters may devastate surrounding reefs, this area
could become an incredibly important sanctuary where marine species big and small
will flock to find refuge from climate change,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf well protected, this key
transboundary marine ecosystem will remain a jewel of biodiversity for the entire east
African coast.‚Äù

Unfortunately, however, the climate crisis is not the only threat to the area‚Äôs biodiversity
and the newly discovered refuge. Unsustainable fishing continues, and there are future
plans for coastal development, including a port in northern Tanzania.

Guardian-2020-12.txt," Climate change critical issue in Eden2Monaro byelection as six in 10 voters say more action needed by government About the same number would more likely vote for candidate who supported local publicly funded renewable energy projects, poll Ô¨Ånds 
Daniel Hurst

 Sun 24 May 2020 18.30 BST  

The Morrison government will come under pressure over climate change in the looming byelection in Eden-Monaro, with a new poll showing six in 10 voters in the seat believe the Coalition is not doing enough to tackle the problem.  The polling, commissioned by the progressive activist group GetUp, also illustrates the far- reaching impact of the summer of bushÔ¨Åres across the key New South Wales electorate, with nearly six in seven people surveyed saying they were aÔ¨Äected in some way.  The Liberals Ô¨Åred the starting gun on their campaign on Sunday as their newly preselected candidate, Dr Fiona Kotvojs, sought to emphasise her green credentials by saying she had solar   panels on her house and believed ‚Äúthat humans contribute to that changing climate‚Äù.  Kotvojs ‚Äì who narrowly fell short of winning the seat at the 2019 election ‚Äì has been criticised in the past for playing down the central role of humans in contributing to the climate crisis.  At a media conference in the town of Murrumbateman, Scott Morrison said the government was committed to lowering emissions and that Kotvojs ‚Äúknows how to get things done‚Äù.  She will be facing oÔ¨Ä against Labor candidate Kristy McBain, the former Bega Valley mayor, who has been campaigning without a major rival candidate for the past three weeks. McBain has sought to highlight gaps in the federal government‚Äôs support for local communities during the drought, Ô¨Åre and coronavirus crises.  A byelection date is expected to be conÔ¨Årmed in the coming days, with speculation it could be set for 27 June or 4 July ‚Äì just before the NSW school holidays.  The survey, conducted by uComms on behalf of GetUp, polled 879 residents across Eden- Monaro last Wednesday night. It found 59% of the sample agreed with the statement that ‚Äúthe government is not doing enough to address climate change‚Äù ‚Äì including 48% who strongly agreed.  About 27% of the sample disagreed with the statement ‚Äì including 12% strongly.  Roughly 59% of the sample said they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported publicly-funded renewable energy projects to create secure, full-time jobs in the local area, while 17% said they would be less likely to support such a candidate.  Of the 85% of the respondents who said they were aÔ¨Äected by the recent bushÔ¨Åre events, about 7% said they were aÔ¨Äected severely, 21% signiÔ¨Åcantly, 31% moderately and 27% slightly.  However, the sample was evenly divided on whether they were satisÔ¨Åed with the federal government‚Äôs response and support during the bushÔ¨Åre crisis. The poll‚Äôs margin of error was about 4 percentage points.  The national director of GetUp, Paul Oosting, said the poll showed people ‚Äúoverwhelmingly want real, urgent action on climate change‚Äù.  ‚ÄúPeople in Eden-Monaro won‚Äôt let politicians forget how their community was devastated by the bushÔ¨Åre crisis,‚Äù he said.  Oosting said GetUp had more than 6,000 members who lived in Eden-Monaro and they would be ‚Äútalking to their community about how we can recover better from the bushÔ¨Åres and create a safer climate future and sustainable jobs with investment in clean renewable energy‚Äù.  Robynne Burchell, a GetUp member from the southern NSW town of Delegate which was evacuated three times during the bushÔ¨Åre crisis, said the Ô¨Åres were still front of mind for most people as they saw it everyday when they drove somewhere.  The federal government has resisted calls to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, even though every Australian state has signed up to the goal and scientists say the world must reach   it around the middle of the century to achieve the Paris agreement aspiration of limiting global warming to 1.5C.  The energy minister, Angus Taylor, told Sky News on Sunday gas and coal would ‚Äúcontinue to play a really important role in our system for many years‚Äù.  Guardian Australia revealed last week that a group advising the government on the Covid-19 recovery argued Australian taxpayers should underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry.  On Sunday, McBain congratulated Kotvojs and said she hoped all candidates would ‚Äúrun a clean campaign, free of dirty tricks, focused on the issues that actually matter to people in Eden-Monaro‚Äù.  Declaring her central focus would be on jobs, McBain seized on the revelation the jobkeeper program would cost $60bn less than originally forecast to call on the government to expand its eligibility, including to short-term casuals.  It is unclear whether the Nationals will preselect their own candidate for the seat after John Barilaro, the NSW deputy premier, pulled out of the race a few weeks ago amid tensions with the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, and the Liberal state minister Andrew Constance, who also abandoned plans to run.

Guardian-2020-13.txt,"Climate change in deep oceans could be seven times faster by middle of century, report says Uneven heating could have major impact on marine wildlife, as species that rely on each other for survival are forced to move 

Graham Readfearn Mon 25 May 2020 18.30 BST 

 Rates of climate change in the world‚Äôs ocean depths could be seven times higher than current levels by the second half of this century even if emissions of greenhouse gases were cut dramatically, according to new research.  DiÔ¨Äerent global heating at diÔ¨Äerent depths could have major impacts on ocean wildlife, causing disconnects as species that rely on each other for survival are forced to move.  In the new research, scientists looked at a measure called climate velocity ‚Äì the speed at which species would need to move to stay within their preferred temperature range as diÔ¨Äerent ocean layers warm.   The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found diÔ¨Äerent parts of the ocean would change at diÔ¨Äerent rates as the extra heat from increasing levels of greenhouse gases moved through the vast ocean depths.  By the second half of the century, the study found ‚Äúa rapid acceleration of climate change exposure throughout the water column‚Äù.  The study used climate models to Ô¨Årst estimate the current rates of climate velocity at diÔ¨Äerent ocean depths, and then future rates under three scenarios ‚Äì one where emissions started to fall from now; another where they began to fall by the middle of this century; and a third where emissions continued to rise up to 2100.  Prof Jorge Garc√≠a Molinos, a climate ecologist at Hokkaido University and a co-author of the study, said: ‚ÄúOur results suggest that deep sea biodiversity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.‚Äù  At present, the world‚Äôs heating was already causing species to shift in all layers of the ocean from the surface to more than 4km down, but at diÔ¨Äerent speeds.  But even under a highly optimistic scenario, where emissions fell sharply from now, the ocean‚Äôs mesopelagic layer ‚Äì from 200m to 1km down ‚Äì climate velocity would change from about 6km per decade to 50km by the second half of the century. But over the same period, climate velocity would halve at the surface.  Even at depths of between 1,000 and 4,000 metres, climate velocity would triple current rates, even if emissions dropped sharply.  Prof Anthony Richardson, of the University of Queensland and the CSIRO and one of the study‚Äôs 10 authors, told Guardian Australia: ‚ÄúWhat really concerns us is that as you move down through the ocean, climate velocity moves at diÔ¨Äerent speeds.‚Äù  This could create a disconnect for species that rely on organisms in diÔ¨Äerent layers.  For example, Richardson said tuna lived in the mesopelagic layer between 200 and 1,000 metres deep, but they relied on plankton species near the surface.  He said because the planet‚Äôs oceans were so large and stored so much heat, ‚Äúwarming already absorbed at the ocean surface will mix into deeper waters.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now.‚Äù  Isaac Brito-Morales, the study‚Äôs lead author and a researcher at the University of Queensland, said: ‚ÄúBecause the deep ocean has a more stable temperature, any small increase will have an impact on species ‚Äì they‚Äôre more at risk than those at the surface.‚Äù  Richardson added it was ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù their results showed, as well as diÔ¨Äerent rates of climate velocity at diÔ¨Äerent depths, the direction that species would need to move wasn‚Äôt uniform either.   This could mean that marine park areas designed to protect diÔ¨Äerent species or habitats could become compromised as species moved out of the protected areas into unprotected areas. "
Guardian-2020-14.txt," Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow will be delayed by a year, UN conÔ¨Årms Date moved for Covid219 travel reasons, but fears raised over delay to green recovery plans

 Fiona Harvey environment correspondent 
Thu 28 May 2020 22.09 BST  

Global talks aimed at staving oÔ¨Ä the threat of climate breakdown will be delayed by a year to November 2021 because of the coronavirus crisis, the UN has conÔ¨Årmed.  The summit, known as Cop26, which 196 nations are expected to attend, will now take place in Glasgow from November 1 to 12 next year, as reports had anticipated, with the UK government acting as host and president. They were originally set to take place from 9 November this year.  Earlier dates were thought to be too diÔ¨Écult, as travel restrictions may still be in place in some countries next year and Ô¨Ånding a new date was further complicated by the scheduling of other major international environmental meetings, including global talks on the biodiversity crisis.   Alok Sharma, UK business secretary and Cop26 president, said: ‚ÄúWhile we rightly focus on Ô¨Åghting the immediate crisis of the coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change. We are working with our international partners on an ambitious roadmap for global climate action between now and November 2021. Everyone will need to raise their ambitions to tackle climate change.‚Äù  Cop26 is the most important international meeting on the climate emergency since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. Under the landmark accord, countries must come forward every Ô¨Åve years with revised plans on curbing greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris goal of limiting global heating to no more than 2C, and preferably no more than 1.5C.  Current national targets would take the world to at least 3C above pre-industrial levels, scientists warn, so countries are under pressure to come up with more stringent commitments.  According to the timetable, those emission-cutting targets ‚Äì known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) ‚Äì should be put forward this year, even though the meeting itself has been delayed. The UK has not yet submitted its NDC, but has pledged to do so before Cop26.  Many developing countries and civil society groups were supportive of the delay, but called for governments to bring forward plans for a green recovery from the Covid-19 crisis, to set the world on the right track to meet the Paris goals.  Patricia Espinosa, the UN climate chief, also linked the two: ‚ÄúOur eÔ¨Äorts to address climate change and Covid-19 are not mutually exclusive. If done right, the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable path.‚Äù  Sonam Wangdi, from the Kingdom of Bhutan, who chairs the Least Developed Countries group at the UN climate talks, said: ‚ÄúThe postponement of climate negotiations should not be taken as postponement of climate action. Climate action has been delayed long enough ‚Ä¶ To focus on recovering from the Covid-19 crisis while ignoring action to address the climate crisis would only lead to more devastation in the future.‚Äù  Poor countries are concerned that the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis and the global economic shock will mean less assistance is available to help them reduce carbon emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.  Janine Felson, Belize‚Äôs ambassador to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: ‚ÄúSmall island developing states are at the brink of economic collapse, with the major drivers of our economies at a standstill.

Guardian-2020-15.txt," BlackRock to Ô¨Çag climate concerns at ExxonMobil AGM Fund manager will vote against re4election of two directors and for splitting chair and CEO role

 Joanna Partridge Wed 27 May 2020 14.01 BST 


 BlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest fund manager, will lodge multiple votes against ExxonMobil at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday as it Ô¨Çags concern over the oil company‚Äôs failure to make progress on its climate change targets.  BlackRock will vote against the re-election of two directors and in favour of a shareholder motion that proposes splitting the role of chief executive and chairman.  The US investment Ô¨Årm is ExxonMobil‚Äôs second largest shareholder, with a stake of almost 5% in the company.  It will not back the re-election of Angela Braly, the chair of Exxon‚Äôs public issues and contributions committee, nor that of Kenneth Frazier, the board‚Äôs lead independent director.   The shareholder motion it will back proposes creating separate chief executive and chairman roles once the incumbent, Darren Woods, steps down.  Two US shareholder advisory Ô¨Årms have recommended to investors that they back the proposal, arguing that having a CEO who also leads the board can create a potential conÔ¨Çict of interest and lack of independence among a company‚Äôs directors.  BlackRock declined to comment.  In April the Church of England‚Äôs investment arm, the Church Commissioners, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund wrote a joint letter to fellow ExxonMobil investors asking them to vote against the re-election of the company‚Äôs entire board.  ‚ÄúAs the world, ExxonMobil‚Äôs peers and investors confront the climate emergency, ExxonMobil is carrying on as if nothing has changed,‚Äù the letter said. ‚ÄúIt is crystal clear to us that ExxonMobil‚Äôs inadequate response to climate change constitutes a broad failure of corporate governance and a speciÔ¨Åc failure of independent directors to oversee management.‚Äù  BlackRock manages assets worth $6.9tn (¬£5.3tn), including large holdings in oil producers such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil.  It announced at the start of the year that it would divest from holdings related to thermal coal and would focus on sustainability when making investment decisions. The Ô¨Årm has joined Climate Action 100+, an inÔ¨Çuential pressure group calling for the biggest polluters to reduce their emissions.  BlackRock‚Äôs chief executive, Larry Fink, wrote in his annual letter to chief executives in January that Ô¨Ånancial markets had been slower to reÔ¨Çect the threat to economic growth posed by the climate crisis, and added that the Ô¨Årm would vote against companies that were not making progress.  ‚ÄúWhere we feel companies and boards are not producing eÔ¨Äective sustainability disclosures or implementing frameworks for managing these issues, we will hold board members accountable,‚Äù Fink wrote.  Environmental campaigners have previously accused BlackRock of hypocrisy for routinely voting against shareholder motions directing boards to take action on the climate crisis.  Fink wrote in his letter that the Ô¨Årm preferred to vote against individual directors at annual shareholder meetings, a strategy it is pursuing at ExxonMobil‚Äôs AGM. ‚ÄúLast year BlackRock voted against or withheld votes from 4,800 directors at 2,700 diÔ¨Äerent companies,‚Äù Fink wrote.  A blogpost written by ExxonMobil‚Äôs vice-president of investor relations, Stephen Littleton, and published on the company‚Äôs website this month called the statements from the Church of England and the New York State Common Retirement Fund ‚Äúmisleading‚Äù.  The oil Ô¨Årm said it had been expanding its shareholder engagement, and it directed investors to a report on ‚Äúhow we are working to reduce emissions in our operations through eÔ¨Éciency gains and new technologies‚Äù.

Guardian-2020-16.txt,"The Morrison government subsidising dirty fuel amid the climate crisis beggars belief
Bill Hare

Angus Taylor seems to be wilfully ignoring Australia‚Äôs huge transport emissions problem 

The announcement this week by energy minister Angus Taylor that he‚Äôs putting together a major package to prop up oil refineries to preserve dirty fuel supplies to one of the dirtiest car fleets on the planet simply beggars belief.

This week we‚Äôve seen king tides and storms hitting Australia‚Äôs eastern coastline, changing the face of much-loved Aussie beaches, which were already feeling the effects of rising sea levels. This time last year, the country was on fire. In 2020 our Great Barrier Reef was bleached for the third time in five years, the most widespread event ever. We just had the warmest spring ever, 2C above average, which would have been ‚Äúvirtually impossible‚Äù without our greenhouse gas emissions.

We are facing an increased onslaught of climate impacts that will just accelerate unchecked without global action on climate to rapidly reduce emissions: a recent report showed Australia was the G20‚Äôs fourth-highest most vulnerable to climate risk.

The transport sector is the third-largest source of emissions in the Australian economy, after electricity and industry. In 2019, transport represented 18% of total emissions, an increase of 22% since 2005. According to Taylor‚Äôs own projections these are set to grow by 6% between 2020 and 2030, when they would be close to 21% of national emissions. Road transport accounts for the 85% of those emissions, and car emissions have grown 25% since 1990.

Australia is one of the few countries in the world with no emissions nor fuel-efficiency standards for light duty vehicles. The government has given no indication of any intention of introducing them, despite five years of deliberations in the ministerial forum on vehicle emissions.

And it gets worse. Australia‚Äôs fuel quality is among the worst in the OECD, with high sulphur content at levels banned in the EU 10 years ago. Last year the government allowed this to continue to 2027. One consequence, apart from health effects, is that many very efficient internal combustion engine vehicles that can only run on low-sulphur premium unleaded will not be sold in Australia.

It seems the government is poised to release a federal strategy around electric vehicles (EVs). A draft discussion document, which was leaked on Tuesday, contains no emissions standards, nor targets for EVs (nor any other new support for them), except an already-announced co-funding arrangement for charging stations. And a two-year electric car trial for the cars that ferry the likes of Taylor around. Why a trial is needed for EVs in 2020 is incomprehensible. And why an EV strategy should morph into a ‚Äúfuture fuels strategy‚Äù is very hard to explain.

The $72m for charging station co-funding clearly isn‚Äôt enough, because various states are planning road user charges on EVs to pay for them, a move likely to discourage and slow their uptake, at the very time the opposite is needed.

The resources seemingly earmarked in the leaked draft discussion document appear dwarfed by the planned $2.3bn subsidy to oil refineries.

Taylor seems to be wilfully ignoring Australia‚Äôs huge transport emissions problem.

The Australian fleet of 19.2m vehicles is one of the world‚Äôs most polluting and least efficient, far behind the US, China, Japan, India and the European Union. Their projected improvement means Australia will fall even further behind. Nearly 80% of new light-duty vehicles sold globally are subject to some kind of emissions or fuel-economy standard.

The International Energy Efficiency 2018 Scorecard for transportation rated Australia 20th out of 26 countries, with only countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia rating worse. In the absence of any such standards for vehicles in Australia, along with modern pollution standards, it‚Äôs increasingly likely that Australia will become the dumping ground for cars that cannot be sold in other markets.

This is a disgraceful track record of inaction and regressive outcomes, one that the minister should not be at all proud of, that effectively meets and beats the lowest motor vehicle and fuel standards in the OECD, if not the planet.

It doesn‚Äôt have to be like this.

The Climate Action Tracker has modelled a Paris agreement-aligned benchmark for Australian transport, which would require Australia to increase its share of electric (or emissions-free) vehicles in new vehicle sales from less than 1% today for personal cars to 95% in 2030, reaching 100% in 2035. This would translate into roughly 38% EV share in the total fleet in 2030 and a full decarbonisation of this fleet by mid-century.

But to achieve this, Australia needs stringent new standards for the CO2 emissions intensity of new vehicles, a target for EVs, incentives to support their uptake ‚Äì and of course strategies to increase the share of public transport.

EVs would require more electricity, and also when integrated with a modern grid providing important grid services. Tapping into the vast renewables resources available in Australia and getting the country on to a 1.5C Paris agreement compatible pathway would not only provide the renewable energy for an EV network, it would also provide literally tens of thousands of jobs for Australians, far more than the ones Taylor is seeking to protect with his fuel package."
Guardian-2020-17.txt,"'The human Ô¨Ångerprint is everywhere': Met OÔ¨Éce's alarming warning on climate Exclusively compiled data from the Hadley Centre‚Äôs supercomputer shows alarming climate trajectory 

Jonathan Watts Wed 27 May 2020 07.00 BST 


 The human Ô¨Ångerprint on the climate is now unmistakable and will become increasingly evident over the coming decades, the UK Met OÔ¨Éce has conÔ¨Årmed after 30 years of pioneering study.  Since the 1990s, global temperatures have warmed by half a degree, Arctic sea ice has shrunk by almost 2 million km2, sea-levels have risen by about 10cm and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by 60 parts per million (17%), according to Ô¨Ågures exclusively compiled for the Guardian to mark the 30th anniversary of the Met OÔ¨Éce‚Äôs Hadley Centre for climate science and services.   The data highlights how a young generation has grown up in a climate unprecedented in a millennium. Future projections suggest that by mid-century a 60-year-old Briton is likely to be living in a climate 1.2C warmer than when they were born.  Scientists at the Hadley Centre, which has been on the global frontline of climate monitoring, research and modelling since it opened in 1990, said early theories about fossil-fuel disruption have been proven by subsequent facts.  ‚ÄúThe climate now is completely diÔ¨Äerent from what we had 30 years ago. It is completely outside the bounds of possibility in natural variation,‚Äù said Peter Stott, a professor and expert on climate attribution science at the centre.  Margaret Thatcher, with Sir John Houghton, opening the Hadley Centre. She said the UK needed a world-leading climate centre to assess the ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù of greenhouse gas emissions. Photograph: Hadley Centre In the Hadley Centre‚Äôs early projections, he said, scientists forecast 0.5C of warming in the UK between 1990 and 2020 as a result of emissions from oil, gas and coal: ‚ÄúWe got it spot on.‚Äù  With new heat records being broken with increasing frequency, he said global temperatures were now above any level in the Met OÔ¨Éce measurements since 1850, or indirectly calculated through tree rings going back thousands of years. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere are also higher than anything seen in million-year-old ice cores. ‚ÄúWe are seeing an unprecedented climate,‚Äù Stott said. ‚ÄúThe human Ô¨Ångerprint is everywhere.‚Äù  The impact was less obvious in 1990, when the centre opened in conjunction with the publication of the Ô¨Årst report by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - both were overseen by the UK scientist John Houghton, who died earlier this year.  At the inauguration, the then prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, said the UK needed a world- leading climate centre to assess the ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù of greenhouse gas emissions. ‚ÄúWhat it predicts will aÔ¨Äect our daily lives. Governments and international organisations in every part of the world are going to have to sit up and take notice and respond,‚Äù she said.  Thatcher, who studied science at Oxford, needed little convincing, but she had to overcome a sceptical cabinet. Atmospheric physicists had been warning oil companies and policymakers about the dangers of fossil fuels for decades, but the ‚Äúgreenhouse eÔ¨Äect‚Äù was still a relatively novel concern for the broader public. Nobody felt a change. The world had already warmed by  about half a degree from pre-industrial levels, but this was low enough to be within natural variation.  Few people knew the diÔ¨Äerence between short-term ‚Äúweather‚Äù and the ‚Äúclimate‚Äù, which is usually measured over a much longer period of 30 years.  Back then, there was also considerable scepticism about the ability of meteorologists to forecast change, even on a daily basis. Memories were fresh of the BBC weatherman Michael Fish infamously reassuring viewers that fears of a hurricane were unfounded, just hours before the Ô¨Åercest storm in generations hit the UK.  ‚ÄúIt was unglamorous‚Äù recalls James Murphy, a science fellow who was posted to the Hadley Centre from the beginning. ‚ÄúBut the mood in the Ô¨Årst decade was one of great excitement, because it was a chance to do a lot of pioneering research in a growing Ô¨Åeld.‚Äù  As acceptance and importance grew, so did scepticism. Critics, often funded by oil Ô¨Årms, pushed back against climate science because they did not like its political and economic implications. Ahead of the climate summits in Kyoto (1997) and Copenhagen (2009), fossil fuel companies funded misinformation campaigns to cast doubt on climate models.  The Hadley Centre remained focused on science. Researchers expanded and reÔ¨Åned their models by incorporating new knowledge on biological carbon cycles and the likely impact of fossil fuels not only on temperature, but on Arctic ice, sea-level rise, Ô¨Çooding, storms, droughts and other atmospheric phenomena.  Supercomputer advances enabled much greater precision. Early models mapped the impact on grid cells of 300km on each side. Today that is down to 2.2km, which allows detailed predictions of which stretches of river basins and coastlines will need the most protection.  Researchers are discovering the impacts go far beyond the initial focus on average temperature. Heat records are being set with increasing frequency. Rainfall patterns are noticeably shifting beyond natural variation. Arctic ice is shrinking faster than expected. The rising seas have already left some places, such as Fairbourne in Wales, below spring-tide levels.  By 2050 ‚Äì the year the UK plans to achieve carbon neutrality ‚Äì the direct impact on Britain will be moderated by the surrounding ocean and there may be opportunities to plant new crops, but these beneÔ¨Åts will be dwarfed by trade disruption, migration, humanitarian disasters and shifting ecosystems.  ‚ÄúOverall it‚Äôs bad. The negatives outweigh the positives,‚Äù said Richard Betts, a Met OÔ¨Éce scientist who is leading scientiÔ¨Åc analysis for the next UK climate change risk assessment. ‚ÄúIt stands to reason that if the world keeps gets hotter and hotter, sooner or later we‚Äôll reach the point where it is Ô¨Årst uncomfortable and then hard to function. This won‚Äôt be seen in the UK, but in parts of the world that are already hot and humid it could increasingly get too hot to function.‚Äù  The Hadley supercomputer calculates myriad possible pathways depending on how much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases enter the atmosphere. The good news is that the worst-emissions scenario, known as RCP 8.5, is considered less likely than before because the global coal industry has not grown as feared. The bad news is current emissions   trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea- level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.  The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.  Even the current best-case scenario ‚Äì RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement ‚Äì would leave the world hotter than today.  ‚ÄúWhat stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We‚Äôll need to prepare and adapt,‚Äù says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley. He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception.  ‚ÄúAs a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I Ô¨Ånd myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.‚Äù  More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.  ‚ÄúThere are still dangers out there that we don‚Äôt fully understand,‚Äù said Stott. ‚ÄúMuch of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?‚Äù  Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 Ô¨Ånancial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre‚Äôs work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.  ‚ÄúReality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a diÔ¨Äerent emissions trajectory from where we are now,‚Äù Stott said.  ‚ÄúThe worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don‚Äôt fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue.

Guardian-2020-18.txt,"  Moving climate up the global political agenda  Readers respond to an article by Rebecca Willis in which MPs agreed to speak candidly about climate change 

Letters Thu 28 May 2020 17.52 BST 

 Rebecca Willis has done a great service in conÔ¨Årming that there has long been a deeply rooted socially constructed silence on climate change among MPs (‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to be seen as a zealot‚Äô: what MPs really think about the climate crisis, Long read, 21 May). However, there is a silence within that silence: namely the refusal of MPs who do engage with climate change to acknowledge it as Ô¨Årst and foremost a global issue, and not merely an international or even national one.  It is no longer tenable for the world to rely solely on individual countries such as the UK to blaze trails towards net-zero emissions in the hope that others will voluntarily follow at their own pace. World leaders need to wake up to the looming security threats from burning fossil   fuels (and forests) and start tackling them at their sources ‚Äì in the Ô¨Årst instance by setting enforceable controls on extraction of fossil fuels, akin to controls on nuclear arms.  Perhaps this is the ‚Äústory on climate change‚Äù that Rebecca Willis discerns to be lacking on the political right (although its few advocates so far seem to be on the left). It need not be in conÔ¨Çict with the left‚Äôs desire for a ‚Äúgreen new deal‚Äù, or any sane person‚Äôs wish for a sustainable world beyond the Covid-19 crisis. Hugh Richards Stroud, Gloucestershire  ‚Ä¢ Rebecca Willis‚Äôs excellent article portrays clearly why our government is unlikely to lead the  world by example during its presidency role for the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Ministers know that people will only vote for things that they want. With Covid-19, the public have willingly sacriÔ¨Åced many rights and liberties because the threat to their health and wellbeing has been repeatedly explained.  But the government consistently fails to explain that the world is headed for warming well in excess of the safe limit of 1.5 degrees which was identiÔ¨Åed in the IPCC special report in 2018.  We need degrowth, with regard to both population and all those non-essential indulgences that come with a signiÔ¨Åcant carbon footprint. Already the UK cannot sustain its growing population with its own resources. If told the truth, the public will be selÔ¨Çess and courageous. We cannot negotiate with physics, we cannot say: ‚ÄúHold on, we‚Äôre dealing with another crisis.‚Äù While the government continues to seek a return to business as usual, we are failing to set an example for other world leaders. An honest public awareness campaign, led by a cross-party emergency UK government and the media, would lead the way for the world at Cop26.  "
Guardian-2020-19.txt," Climate crisis making world‚Äôs forests shorter and younger, study Ô¨Ånds Rising temperatures, natural disasters and deforestation taking heavy toll, say scientists

 Damian Carrington Environment editor Thu 28 May 2020 19.00 BST  

Climate breakdown and the mass felling of trees has made the world‚Äôs forests signiÔ¨Åcantly shorter and younger overall, an analysis shows.   The trend is expected to continue, scientists say, with worrying consequences for the ability of forests to store carbon and mitigate the climate emergency and for the endangered wildlife that depends on rich, ancient forests.   The analysis of more than 150 previous studies found the death rate of trees has increased, doubling in North America and signiÔ¨Åcantly increasing in the Amazon, for example. The impact of forest destruction had cut the area of old growth forest by a third since 1900, the researchers said.   But rising temperatures caused by global heating also cuts growth and increases tree deaths by limiting photosynthesis and causing stress. Furthermore, high temperatures, drought, high storm winds and pests and disease aÔ¨Äect older trees more and are all on the rise.  Tom Pugh, a scientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, said: ‚ÄúOur study reviews mounting evidence that climate change is accelerating tree mortality, increasingly pushing the world‚Äôs forests towards being both younger and shorter.  ‚ÄúThey have been getting smaller and younger over the last century, primarily because of the eÔ¨Äects of human land use change, and disturbances like wildÔ¨Åres and insect outbreaks and droughts. These are things that are increasing in frequency and severity.‚Äù  There were exceptions, Pugh said, such as forests in high latitudes: ‚ÄúBut in a world that‚Äôs generally hotter, more of the world will be covered by forests that are generally shorter.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOver the last hundred years we have lost a lot of old forests,‚Äù said Nate McDowell, at the US Department of Energy‚Äôs PaciÔ¨Åc Northwest National Laboratory, who led the analysis. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been replaced in part by non-forests and in part by young forests. This has consequences on biodiversity, climate mitigation, and forestry.‚Äù  The research, published in the journal Science and including analysis of satellite data on land- use change, estimated that human felling of trees had cut total forest area by 12% since 1900. The proportion of old growth forest, more than 140 years old, fell from 89% to 66% in that time. Lack of data meant the researchers were not able to make a precise estimate of how much shorter the forests had become.  Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could increase tree growth but the researchers said this appeared to happen only in younger forests with abundant nutrients and water. However, most forests have limited nutrients and water, which drastically reduces the carbon dioxide beneÔ¨Åts to trees.  Pugh said the vast majority of forests in the UK and Europe were examples of unnaturally short and young woodlands. ‚ÄúThey are not of the stature that many of those forests would have been before humans fundamentally changed them by harvesting at regular intervals and planting new species, in some cases monoculture,‚Äù he said.  Prof Tom Crowther, at ETH Zurich University in Switzerland and not part of the analysis team, said the study was extremely important: ‚ÄúFor a long time, scientists have predicted that elevated CO  and warming will increase carbon storage in forests that will help to oÔ¨Äset climate change. But this study adds to a growing concern that these factors, along with human disturbance, may in fact be decreasing the amount of carbon stored in these ecosystems.  ‚ÄúBut it also suggests that, if we can protect the forests that we already have, and allow them to grow to maturity, there is a huge potential for them to capture a lot of additional carbon,‚Äù he said.  Prof Simon Lewis at University College London said: ‚ÄúBecause old-growth forest is being lost, then on average, across the globe, forests are getting shorter and younger. Yet, counter to this, and what the researchers don‚Äôt highlight is that within many old-growth forests the opposite is happening.    ‚ÄúThe world‚Äôs intact tropical and boreal forests are both globally important as carbon sinks, and are getting larger. The world‚Äôs forests currently slow climate change, and while future mortality trends could reverse this, the ideas in the new report don‚Äôt change what the world needs to do: stabilise the climate by quickly driving fossil fuel emissions to zero and protect the world‚Äôs forests.‚Äù  Pugh said the analysis of changing conditions across the world also had implications for protecting forests. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre thinking in conservation terms, it can be quite poignant,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou might be trying to preserve a [forest] ecosystem that fundamentally cannot continue to exist in the way that it has existed over the past.‚Äù   "
Guardian-2020-2.txt," Climate change is turning parts of Antarctica green, say scientists Researchers map ‚Äòbeginning of new ecosystem‚Äô as algae bloom across surface of melting snow Jonathan Watts Wed 20 May 2020 10.00 BST Scientists have created the Ô¨Årst large-scale map of microscopic algae on the Antarctic peninsula as they bloom across the surface of the melting snow, tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species. The British team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive. In some areas, the single-cell life-forms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications. Biologists from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation. The result is the Ô¨Årst large-scale algae map of the peninsular, which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially oÔ¨Äering sustenance to other species. They have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a community. This could potentially form new habitats. In some place, it would be the beginning of a new ecosystem,‚Äù said Matt Davey of Cambridge University, one of the scientists who led the study. He described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the Antarctic. It identiÔ¨Åes 1,679 separate blooms of green snow algae, which together covered an area of 1.9 sq km, equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the emissions of about 875,000 car journeys in the UK, though in global terms it is too small to make much of a diÔ¨Äerence to the planet‚Äôs carbon budget. Almost two-thirds of the green algal blooms were found on small, low-lying islands around the peninsula, which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world, with new temperature records being set this summer. The snow algae were less conspicuous in colder, southern regions. Scientists have previously observed a change in green lichen and moss, but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae. In future, they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be aÔ¨Äecting the heat-reÔ¨Çecting albedo quality of the snow. ‚ÄúI think we will get more large blooms in the future. Before we know whether this has a signiÔ¨Åcant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo, we need to run the numbers,‚Äù said Andrew

Guardian-2020-20.txt," UK infrastructure 'under threat from climate breakdown' Utilities, communications and transport at risk, government advisers warn 

Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Thu 28 May 2020 08.00 BST  

Britain‚Äôs vital infrastructure is under threat from the ravages of extreme weather and climate breakdown, unless ministers take swift action to protect against Ô¨Çooding, heatwaves and drought, government advisers have warned.  Energy networks and water utilities, communications, transport and other essential services are all at risk, said Sir John Armitt, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, which has published a new report on resilience.  But restoring the UK‚Äôs crumbling infrastructure could create new jobs as ministers seek to kickstart the economy after the lockdown. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the nature of this sort of area that it should be possible to build up a head of steam quickly [to create jobs],‚Äù said Armitt. ‚ÄúRoad maintenance, for example, is easier at the moment as fewer people are using the roads. Active maintenance reduces the need for capital expenditure. And you don‚Äôt need years of planning to get shovels   on the ground.‚Äù  Flood protection projects were another key area, alongside rail improvements and building broadband capacity, he said.  The coronavirus crisis showed the importance of preparedness, according to Armitt, but after the pandemic eases the existing threat of extreme weather, leading to Ô¨Çooding, storm damage, water shortages and other events, will continue to wreak billions of pounds of damage if ministers fail to act.  ‚ÄúClimate change remains the fundamental challenge,‚Äù said Armitt, in an interview. ‚ÄúThat has not gone away.‚Äù  Ministers must set out clear regulations with higher standards for construction as a matter of urgency, he said. They must also be prepared to invest in infrastructure or allow operators to charge the public more for their services to pay for the upgrades needed around the country. ‚ÄúSuppliers say, if you want more resilience, you have to charge more,‚Äù he told the Guardian. ‚ÄúMinisters have been loth to pick that up.‚Äù  Disasters such as Ô¨Çoods were treated as localised problems when they occurred rather than nationwide threats, he said. A fully formed national response to climate breakdown was needed. There should also be more discussion of the costs of nuclear power ‚Äì which he said would still be needed to ensure the UK‚Äôs energy supply while phasing out fossil fuels ‚Äì and of the beneÔ¨Åts of the HS2 rail project, of which he is a supporter, he said.  The government was supposed to publish a National Infrastructure Strategy alongside the Budget in March, but that was delayed as the new chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, decided it needed more time. The impact of coronavirus is likely to mean a further delay.  Thursday‚Äôs report urged ministers to set out full resilience standards every Ô¨Åve years. Infrastructure operators ‚Äì including energy, water and transport utilities ‚Äì should carry out regular stress tests to ensure their systems and services can meet those standards, it said.  By 2023, according to the NIC‚Äôs recommendations, regulators should introduce new obligations on infrastructure operators to meet new standards on resilience, undertake regular stress tests, and develop and maintain long-term resilience strategies.  Last year, the UK‚Äôs worst power cut for a decade ‚ÄúoÔ¨Äered a glimpse of the disruption that can happen when something goes wrong‚Äù, according to the report. ‚ÄúThe coronavirus outbreak has shown that signiÔ¨Åcant high-impact disruptions can and do happen.‚Äù  It was too early to say what the eÔ¨Äect of the coronavirus crisis would be, said Armitt. However, it showed government and the public how important it was to have clear plans in place for foreseeable crises, he said.  Some infrastructure had performed well during the lockdown. ‚ÄúEveryone was pleasantly surprised by the way our digital systems have stood up to a massive increase in demand from Zoom calls and so on,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut everywhere is going to face challenges from the behavioural changes [that might stick after the pandemic] and climate change. I can‚Äôt say we‚Äôve done enough.‚Äù    Ministers should have a clear discussion with the public about the challenges faced by the UK, to develop a consensus on how they should be tackled, he said. ‚ÄúThe government has been reluctant to get out all these issues, the pros and cons, and debate them. But without policy being thought through clearly, we‚Äôve seen targets not met and ministers having to eat their words when it proves diÔ¨Écult to deliver. Understanding fully the delivery challenge enables you to be more eÔ¨Äective in delivery, and satisfy public expectations.‚Äù   "
Guardian-2020-22.txt,"  Markets not paying attention to climate crisis, IMF says Firms should be made to disclose exposure to global heating, report suggests

 Larry Elliott Economics editor Fri 29 May 2020 17.27 BST  

Equity markets have generally ignored the increasing number of natural disasters over the past 50 years and tougher rules are needed to make investors aware of the dangers posed by the climate crisis, the International Monetary Fund has said.  Companies should be forced to disclose their exposure to climate risk because a voluntary approach does not go far enough, the IMF said in a chapter from its latest global Ô¨Ånancial stability report (GFSR).  The Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, an initiative led by Mark Carney, the former Bank of England governor, outlines how companies should calculate and disclose their exposure to climate risk to investors.  The IMF, however, said in a GFSR published on Friday that climate risk should ultimately be made part of international reporting standards.   ‚ÄúAn increasing number of Ô¨Årms have begun to voluntarily disclose climate change risk information, in line with the recommendations set out by the taskforce on climate-related Ô¨Ånancial disclosures‚Äù it said.  ‚ÄúHowever, going further by developing global mandatory disclosures on material climate change risks would be an important step to sustain Ô¨Ånancial stability. In the short term, mandatory climate change risk disclosure could be based on globally agreed principles. In the longer term, climate change risk disclosure standards could be incorporated into Ô¨Ånancial statements compliant with international Ô¨Ånancial reporting standards.‚Äù  The IMF functions as the global lender of last resort, bailing out countries in Ô¨Ånancial diÔ¨Éculty and issuing policy advice alongside its interventions. Its latest statement on the climate crisis expressed concerns that stock markets were ignoring the rise in global temperatures and its consequences.  Although stock markets fell sharply in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, this followed their best year since 2009 and the immediate aftermath of the Ô¨Ånancial crisis. A global index of share prices rose by 24%, and the FTSE 100 climbed by 12% despite uncertainty over Brexit.  Last year was also marked by a series of severe weather-related events, including Ô¨Çooding in the US and bushÔ¨Åres in Australia, but the IMF said this was part of a trend for the number of disasters to increase ‚Äúconsiderably‚Äù in the past few decades, from slightly more than 50 in the early 1980s to about 200 since 2000. It noted that Hurricane Kartrin devastated New Orleans in 2005, and Dominica suÔ¨Äered damage amounting to more than twice its GDP when Hurricane Maria struck in 2017.  The IMF said global temperatures were currently 1.1C above their pre-industrial level and were on course to rise by a total of 3C unless stronger action was taken.  ‚ÄúClimate change induced by this level of warming is, in turn, expected to adversely impact the world‚Äôs stock of natural assets, lead to a signiÔ¨Åcant rise in sea level, and increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather event,‚Äù the IMF said. ‚ÄúAs the frequency and severity of climatic hazards rise, the resultant socioeconomic losses could be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than in recent history.‚Äù  Even so, according to the GFSR there had been little indication that investors had become more aware of the potential losses they could face if global temperatures continued to rise, with only a modest impact on stock markets, shares in banks and insurance companies from large disasters.  ‚ÄúWhile projections of climatic variables and their economic impact are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, aggregate equity valuations as of 2019 do not appear to reÔ¨Çect the predicted changes in physical risk under various climate change scenarios‚Äù, the IMF said. ‚ÄúThis suggests that equity investors may not be paying suÔ¨Écient attention to climate change risks.‚Äù  The IMF said that preventing global heating from causing a run on share prices was not the only reason to take action.  ‚ÄúOf course, strong policy actions to mitigate climate change would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and future physical risk in the Ô¨Årst place, conferring beneÔ¨Åts to mankind that extend   well beyond the realm of Ô¨Ånancial stability. Yet, from a Ô¨Ånancial stability perspective, this transition to a lower-carbon economy needs to be carefully managed to avoid abrupt and unanticipated repricing of portfolios and economic dislocation.‚Äù     "
Guardian-2020-23.txt," The Ô¨Ånal farewell: Alan Jones signs oÔ¨Ä with climate change apology amid plaudits from celebrities An odd mix lined up to praise the shock jock on his way out of the studio, including Russell Crowe, Dame Edna and Delta Goodrem

 Amanda Meade  Fri 29 May 2020 21.00 BST 

One of the many celebrities who lined up to farewell Alan Jones this week had some  people scratching their heads. Why would tennis great Roger Federer record a personal video message for a shock jock who has a shameful history of verbal abuse of women in power and of vilifying Lebanese Muslims?  ‚ÄúHi Alan, it‚Äôs Roger here,‚Äù Federer says grinning into the camera. ‚ÄúI wanted to wish you all the very best for what‚Äôs to come and many congratulations on an amazing 35-year career in the media business, take care and all the best. Bye.‚Äù  The Federer message was mysteriously removed from the 2GB website and Jones‚Äôs Instagram account late in the week. Nine Radio has refused to explain why the audio highlight was   removed by the station, but the clip can still be seen on Sky News‚Äô YouTube channel.  But Federer is not the only high proÔ¨Åle person to apparently join in on the celebration of Jones‚Äôs 35-year career on commercial radio which ended on Friday with an orgy of self congratulation.  No less than the prime minister called in to wish him luck, and when his retirement was announced earlier in the month even Labor leader Antony Albanese paid tribute to the rusted on Liberal supporter.  These aÔ¨Äectionate words from public Ô¨Ågures are galling to people who‚Äôve followed Jones‚Äôs history of oÔ¨Äensive remarks about women and race and his refusal to accept the science of climate change.  But Jones is nothing if not divisive. To his listeners and celebrity friends he is a great broadcaster who helps a lot of people behind the scenes. To others he is someone who has abused his platform for many years and he won‚Äôt be missed.  His powerful friends from decades in the media and entertainment industry, and the political arena, are many, and they either don‚Äôt care about his record or they politely ignore it.  You would expect One Nation leaders Pauline Hanson and Mark Latham to gush over him as he steps down, and Tony Abbott to turn up to his farm where he recorded his last show, but it‚Äôs surprising that Australian actors Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe are happy to be associated with him.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt always agree with our politics,‚Äù Crowe told Jones, ‚ÄúBut the thing that I know about you, Mr Jones, is the size of your heart.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an incredible man, Alan. Thank you very much for all of the incredible things that you‚Äôve done.‚Äù  Jones‚Äôs co-host on Sky News, Peta Credlin, was an unsurprising guest. Jones will continue to appear with Credlin on the Murdoch channel as well as write for the media mogul‚Äôs newspapers.  ‚ÄúI want to say to your listeners, your support of this wonderful man has kept him going,‚Äù Credlin said.  ‚ÄúI tell you what listeners, you‚Äôve had his back.  ‚ÄúMany nights we‚Äôve come oÔ¨Ä air at Sky, he‚Äôs spoken about you like you‚Äôre family. You can hear it in his voice, he treats you with enormous respect.‚Äù  Hanson was perhaps the most egregious of his fans, telling him she was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù he was stepping down.  ‚ÄúMy release from prison in 2003 was because of you Ô¨Åghting for my justice,‚Äù Hanson said.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to be a great loss.   ‚ÄúFrom the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you for giving me the time.‚Äù  Jones clearly sees Hanson as an ally, telling her aÔ¨Äectionately ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been through a few battles together. But we Ô¨Ånished up on the other side.‚Äù  Listening to Jones‚Äôs Ô¨Ånal broadcasts there wasn‚Äôt even a hint of the controversy which has dogged his media career since the cash for comment scandal in 1999.  On top of all the farewell calls there were packaged highlights of interviews with prime ministers over the decades, and even a younger Donald Trump.  Sports stars Darren Beadman and Mark Bosnic called in on his last day and through the week there were many more well wishes from the world of show business, including actor and singer Hugh Jackman who said Jones was one of the ‚Äúkindest, most supportive‚Äù people he knows.  Others included Dame Edna, Elizabeth Hurley, Rod Stewart, Michael Buble, Barry Manilow, Olivia Newton-John and Delta Goodrem.  The Voice coach said Jones was her ‚Äúultimate motivator‚Äù and a great role model.  ‚ÄúThe impact of you,‚Äù Goodrem said, ‚Äúevery time, never missing a beat for me.‚Äù Each time he took the laudatory calls he sounded surprised, such is the theatre of live radio.  The only hint listeners got that there was any discord in Jonestown was the on-air correction he was forced to give by order of the Australian Communications and Media Authority.  Jones made it sound routine, and a casual listener may have missed the seriousness of the announcement, which corrected the assertion that biomass is a fossil fuel and the ‚Äúincorrect presentation of Ô¨Ågures‚Äù related to the percentage of solar and wind energy Australia and NZ use.  NSW One Nation MP Mark Latham (background) and former former prime minister Tony Abbott join Alan Jones during his Ô¨Ånal breakfast show for 2GB from his home at Fitzroy Falls in the Southern Highlands. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP The Acma found Jones breached broadcasting codes for decency in his use of ‚Äúviolent metaphors‚Äù about New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern and accuracy in his comments about climate change. It is the latest in a litany of broadcasting breaches.   Because he had already apologised to Ardern, he only had to mention his errors on climate change.  The now-infamous August 2019 broadcast ‚Äì in which Jones said of Adern ‚ÄúI just wonder whether Scott Morrison‚Äôs going to be fully briefed to shove a sock down her throat‚Äù ‚Äì attracted more than 125 complaints to Acma, which found it ‚ÄúoÔ¨Äended against generally accepted community standards of decency‚Äù.  It was this level of oÔ¨Äence, piled on top of other oÔ¨Äences against women over the years, in particular against Julia Gillard, that drove the social media campaign to target his advertisers.  ‚ÄúEvery person in the caucus of the Labor party knows that Julia Gillard is a liar, everybody,‚Äù Jones said at a Sydney University Liberal club dinner. ‚ÄúI will come to that in a moment. The old man recently died a few weeks ago of shame. To think that he has a daughter who told lies every time she stood for parliament.‚Äù  Appalled by the slur on Ardern, a Facebook group called Mad Fucking Witches, and activist group Sleeping Giants on Twitter, hammered Jones‚Äôs advertisers through emails and on social media every time they spent money placing an ad on his breakfast show.  By September the exodus of more than 110 brands forced 2GB management to write to advertisers promising a review of the Jones program.  But none of the remedial action, including an extra dump button, worked. While advertisers drifted back after withdrawing initially when he said Gillard‚Äôs father ‚Äúdied of shame‚Äù, this time they never came back.  The companies which pulled out late last year include RSL Art Unions, Bing Lee, Snooze, Bunnings, Volkswagen, Koala Mattresses, Anytime Fitness, Total Tools, AVEO, Lowes, Chemist Warehouse, Red Cross, OMG Mattresses, Hyundai, Sleeping Duck and Scali.  The station, now under the control of Nine Entertainment, was losing so much money they chose to pay out Jones‚Äôs contract to the tune of $4m rather than have him hang around.  Nine newspapers have reported the show lost as much as 50% of its revenue from the commercial backlash.  If Jones‚Äôs rhetoric was poison to the advertisers who pulled out of 2GB it didn‚Äôt seem to bother the celebrities who turned up to praise him on the way out. "
Guardian-2020-24.txt,"  Finally there is real movement on Australia's climate policy but time isn‚Äôt on our side Anna Skarbek If speed weren‚Äôt a factor, we could rely on the market to incentivise green technology at its own pace > but the clock is ticking 

 Sun 31 May 2020 18.30 BST 


 ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter whether a cat is black or white so long as it catches mice.‚Äù  The maxim attributed to Deng Xiaoping comes to mind in relation to the federal government‚Äôs technology investment roadmap discussion paper and its response to the King review.  If we look beyond the headlines, both interventions provide some reason for optimism.  As Frank Jotzo notes, the discussion paper acknowledges that Australia‚Äôs future lies with low- carbon energy, industry and transport. That‚Äôs a step forward ‚Äì and it should be acknowledged  as such.  Some have complained that, by surveying 140 technologies, the paper takes too broad a view.  Actually, the acknowledgement of a wide array of technologies for carbon abatement methods constitutes positive progress given Australia‚Äôs climate policy history.  In a report entitled Decarbonisation Futures, ClimateWorks modelled multiple pathways by which Australia might reach net zero emission by the year 2050, in accordance with the Paris climate agreement goal.  Those models show that decarbonisation won‚Äôt be the result of a single technology, but rather that diÔ¨Äerent solutions (from renewable power to sustainable transport to new forms of energy eÔ¨Éciency) will play important roles in particular economic sectors.  Fortunately, the priority technologies identiÔ¨Åed in Decarbonisation Futures all feature in the roadmap discussion paper.  Much commentary has focused on the government allowing the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to support loans for carbon capture and storage.  In the past, that technology was associated with proposals to extend the life of coal-Ô¨Åred power stations. With renewables becoming far cheaper, far more quickly than expected, we now know that CCS is not competitive in the electricity supply.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean that it can‚Äôt play a role elsewhere.  The Decarbonisation Future modelling identiÔ¨Åes CCS as necessary, not in power generation, but in harder-to-abate sectors like heavy industry, where it can help capture non-energy emissions such as fugitive methane from gas extraction and process emissions from cement. That‚Äôs a position accepted by both the International Energy Agency and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  If speed weren‚Äôt a factor, we could probably rely on the market to incentivise the uptake of green technology at its own pace. Battery costs per kilowatt hour are now 80% less expensive than in 2010; new renewables generate power more cheaply than fossil fuels, and this year the US will probably produce more electricity from renewable power than from coal for the Ô¨Årst time.  But time isn‚Äôt on our side. We have entered a crucial decade in the race against climate change, with the UN and scientists declaring that emissions must halve in the next 10 years, and halve again in the 10 after.  That‚Äôs why the actions arising from the roadmap need to accelerate the deployment of abatement technologies, stimulating the market so widespread deployment occurs, which both brings down emissions and brings down cost.  In an interview with the ABC‚Äôs AM program, Angus Taylor, the energy and emissions reduction minister, explained that the government would ‚Äúlove to achieve net zero by 2050‚Äù, before   adding that the target will ‚Äúdepend on the pathways of technologies to deliver ‚Ä¶ without damaging the economy‚Äù.  In fact, it‚Äôs precisely by setting targets that we can ensure decarbonisation and robust economic growth go hand in hand.  Research by ClimateWorks shows that incentives to use technologies matter as much as initial investment in their development, with deployment spurring improvements in price and performance.  Those incentives can take many diÔ¨Äerent policy forms. Investments of the kind discussed in the government‚Äôs technology roadmap paper can foster development and commercialisation of zero-emissions emerging solutions like renewable hydrogen and green steel for harder-to- abate sectors such as heavy industry, agriculture and land.  At the same time, commitments in government procurement might, for instance, scale up the deployment of emerging technologies, as might the establishment of industry standards in particular sectors.  By setting targets immediately, decision makers (in business as well as in government), can support technology development, demonstration and deployment, and capitalise on opportunities for investment.  Innes Willox of the Ai Group is right when he says, in his responses to the King review and to the technology investment roadmap, that we still need ‚Äúa clear long-term vision and strategy‚Äù.  Yet behind the government‚Äôs careful rhetoric, we can see the Ô¨Årst substantive movement on climate policy for some time.  The recommendations accepted by Taylor aim, for instance, to give industry greater incentive to embrace new climate solutions as they emerge, something demonstrably necessary for decarbonisation to proceed on track. Willox cautions ‚Äì correctly, I believe ‚Äì that the government must back its vision with ‚Äúadequate funding‚Äù. But if that funding materialises, along with clear signals of longer term demand for the technologies, it could spur the kind of response that rapidly drives down costs of emissions-saving technology.  In that respect, both the response to the King review and the new technology investment roadmap discussion paper provide a better basis for accelerating action than Australia has had for some years.  With the climate clock ticking, now the focus must be on the accelerant that is applied to these foundations. We can‚Äôt aÔ¨Äord to debate the colour of the climate cat.  It‚Äôs way past time to catch some mice.  ‚Ä¢ Anna Skarbek is the chief executive of ClimateWorks Australia, an independent not-for-  proÔ¨Åt organisation working within the Monash Sustainable Development Institute "
Guardian-2020-25.txt," Q+A: Matt Canavan grilled on climate change and family links to coal industry Labor‚Äôs Joel Fitzgibbon defends his call for ALP to adopt the Coalition‚Äôs target of 26?28% emissions reduction by 2030 

Elias Visontay Mon 1 Jun 2020 21.47 BST 


 The Nationals senator Matt Canavan has been grilled over his criticism of action against climate change during an episode of Q+A where he was also asked to clarify his family‚Äôs links to the coal industry.   In an episode that also featured opposition agriculture and resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon defending his call for Labor to adopt the government‚Äôs target of reducing emissions by 26-28% by 2030, and independent MP Zali Steggall attacking Fitzgibbon for his views on gas extraction, Canavan was pushed by host Hamish Macdonald about his ‚Äúinterests‚Äù in the coal industry.   Canavan‚Äôs vocal support of the coal industry has included calls for new coal-Ô¨Åred power stations, despite his moderate government colleagues opposing the idea. But the senator pointed out he had disclosed his brother‚Äôs senior position in the coal industry during his maiden speech to the Senate.   ‚ÄúI hardly started talking about the coal industry yesterday ... I have been elected on that platform, to develop our country and keep our jobs here. I think the best way of doing that is making sure we do not deny ourselves the cheapest form of power and energy,‚Äù Canavan said.   ‚ÄúThe Australian people have never voted for net zero emissions ... We seem to try and get bullied into these positions that the Australian people didn‚Äôt vote for.‚Äù  When asked why the government was able to accept experts‚Äô views when forming its coronavirus response but not when its climate change response, Canavan likened conÔ¨Çicting views of the impact of climate change to epidemiologists who diÔ¨Äered on how drastic they thought lockdowns should be.   ‚ÄúThere are very, very diÔ¨Äerent scientiÔ¨Åc views being put on this issue. So it‚Äôs not quite right to say that we just accepted the science,‚Äù he said, noting some experts have said governments are too strict, while others have said governments, like in Sweden, are too relaxed about lockdowns.   ‚ÄúThese are very hard questions ... And it‚Äôs the same thing with climate change science.   ‚ÄúIf you read the latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] report, the level of uncertainty around temperature increases from a doubling of carbon emissions has increased in the last 10 years. Increased. There‚Äôs no consensus on exactly what that Ô¨Ågure will be,‚Äù Canavan said.   Canavan also criticised the Paris climate agreement ‚Äì something he has called for Australia to abandon ‚Äì arguing the agreement is ‚Äútransferring industrial wealth from the west and from Australia to China, a country that‚Äôs bullying and threatening us‚Äù.  Fitzgibbon argued ‚Äúthe market will never‚Äù build a new coal-Ô¨Åred power station in Australia, and defended his position for Labor adopting the government‚Äôs climate targets, ‚Äúif we can get there [26%-28% emissions reduction by 2030] without causing people economic harm, then surely then we‚Äôve got a stronger platform from which to sell a more meaningful policy‚Äù.  He also reiterated his support for coalmining ‚Äì a signiÔ¨Åcant employer in his electorate of Hunter ‚Äì and said his backing of zero net emissions and support for the industry were not mutually exclusive.   In calling for greater gas extraction to Ô¨Åll any shortfalls in energy production left by reductions in coal-Ô¨Åred power, Fitzgibbon said, ‚Äúour manufacturing plants will not compete either domestically or internationally if we don‚Äôt get more gas out of the ground‚Äù.  ‚ÄúDomestic prices will go up if we do not get more gas out of the ground. And I get angry when I see state governments putting bans or moratoriums on gas in their own states, and then importing it from other states, and allowing others to take any environmental risks that might be involved,‚Äù he said.    Steggall called Fitzgibbon‚Äôs argument ‚Äúcompletely inconsistent‚Äù.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve just indicated that you‚Äôre committed to net zero. We cannot be increasing gas out of the ground ... gas is as high in terms of emissions as coal,‚Äù she said.   Fitzgibbon responded: ‚ÄúDo you really think, Zali, really, that we‚Äôre going to have enough renewables in the system to replace that baseload power and battery storage? No.‚Äù  Steggall replied: ‚ÄúAbsolutely.‚Äù   Zoe Whitton, Citi ESG analyst and Investor Group on Climate Change, also criticised increased gas extraction, saying ‚Äúinvestors are very uncertain and hesitant about it‚Äù.  Macdonald asked Steggall if she was ‚Äúpicking and choosing‚Äù when to use experts‚Äô opinions, after she cited chief scientist Alan Finkel‚Äôs work when making a point earlier in the program, but later rejected his views on gas being a transition fuel in 30 years.  Steggall denied she was picking and choosing when to rely on experts‚Äô arguments, and said she disagreed with Finkel on gas because his view was at odds with the Australian Energy Market Operator‚Äôs integrated system plan.

Guardian-2020-26.txt," Sunny coverage of UK heatwaves forgets risks, say climate experts Media urged to make public aware of dangers associated with increasingly hot summers Matthew Taylor Thu 4 Jun 2020 07.00 BST  

The public is being lulled into a false sense of security about the UK‚Äôs increasingly extreme weather patterns by news and weather reports that present long, hot, dry spells as good news, according to scientists and campaigners.  Experts say unusually dry and sunny conditions like those experienced in the UK over the past two months are too often framed as something to celebrate, with newspaper and TV reports featuring pictures of people sunbathing, playing in fountains or eating ice creams.  Instead, the experts say, people should be made aware of the risks associated with increasingly hot summers, especially for vulnerable groups, and they should be helped to ‚Äújoin the dots‚Äù to see heatwaves and Ô¨Çooding in the context of the wider climate crisis.   ‚ÄúI am afraid the media have not woken up to the risks associated with hot and dry weather and that can help lull the population into a state of ignorance about the extent and severity of those risks,‚Äù said Bob Ward, from the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.  He said elderly people and those with underlying health conditions were at risk from more regular heatwaves ‚Äì a danger often compounded by poorly insulated houses or care homes.  ‚ÄúIt is all very well to be talking about visits to the beach because it is going to be sunny and hot but we must recognise that there are real risks too, particularly for vulnerable groups of people,‚Äù Ward said.  The UK had its sunniest spring on record this year, smashing the previous record by almost 70 hours. England recorded its driest May, following its wettest February.  Ward said that although it was not possible to attribute the latest record-breaking extremes directly to the climate crisis, it was important to set them in a wider context of a rapidly changing environment.   ‚ÄúThe media are not very good at helping people to join the dots by placing unusual weather events in context and explaining if they are part of a trend that is linked to climate change, such as more frequent heatwaves or heavy rainfall,‚Äù he said.  ProfJoe Smith, the chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, said many people still assumed hot, sunny weather was good news.  ‚ÄúFor many, including a good portion of broadcast weather forecasters, the UK‚Äôs long, sunny spell simply feels like ‚Äònice weather‚Äô. In a wider context, this long, hot, dry spell sits alongside other ‚Äòunseasonal‚Äô weather such as long, wet, cool spells as signals of the increasing unpredictability of the UK‚Äôs climate.‚Äù  He said for farmers, planning for growing season was now like a ‚Äútrip to the casino‚Äù because of the increasingly erratic weather. But he added: ‚ÄúThe fact remains that bold early actions to slash emissions can still cut the larger risks associated with climate change in the UK and around the world, including risks to the food system.‚Äù  According to the Met OÔ¨Éce, 10 of the warmest years in the UK since records began in 1884 have occurred since 2002. Experts predict the climate crisis means UK summers will become hotter and drier and winters warmer and wetter.  Grahame Madge, from the Met OÔ¨Éce, said discussions around how to frame weather in the midst of a climate crisis were ongoing within the organisation, but he insisted it would not ‚Äúleap to a climate change conclusion‚Äù every time there was a ‚Äúspell of warm weather‚Äù.  He said: ‚ÄúThere is a spectrum of public opinion out there: some people regard hot weather as just nice sunny weather they can enjoy, others see anomalous warm spells as a sign of climate change, and we have to be sensitive to both those aspects, covering both weather and climate from an evidence-based perspective.‚Äù  Guy Shrubsole, from Friends of the Earth, said the 600 active Ô¨Çood warnings in February,   followed by a record-breaking dry and sunny spring when only 4mm of rain fell in south east England, should raise alarm bells.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not good enough to just try to enjoy the dry weather when it‚Äôs actively harming crops and records are being broken with alarming frequency. Climate breakdown fuelled by carbon emissions can only mean more extreme swings, making us go from Ô¨Çoods and droughts in a few months, with all of the misery that both cause.‚Äù "
Guardian-2020-27.txt," The world must seize this opportunity to meet the climate challenge  As current and former central bankers, we believe the pandemic oÔ¨Äers a unique chance to green the global economy Coronavirus ? latest updates See all our coronavirus coverage 

Andrew Bailey, Mark Carney, Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau, Frank Elderson Fri 5 Jun 2020 07.00 BST  

We are currently in the midst of the most severe macroeconomic shock since the  second world war. The disruption to our daily lives and subsequent impact on our economies has been enormous. We are seeing Ô¨Årst-hand that a collective response is needed to defeat a common enemy, as authorities across the world courageously mobilise all available resources to Ô¨Åght the Covid-19 pandemic.  This crisis oÔ¨Äers us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to rebuild our economy in order to   withstand the next shock coming our way: climate breakdown. Unless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow‚Äôs central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self- isolate from it.  In the immediate response to the pandemic, governments have taken measures of unprecedented scale to keep economic and Ô¨Ånancial systems aÔ¨Çoat. The IMF estimates that approximately $9tn of Ô¨Åscal support has been provided across the world. This is necessary to limit acute and permanent damage. But as we consider the next stage of recovery, we must look beyond the immediate crisis and think more strategically about how we do it.   Collectively, countries around the globe are still far from meeting climate crisis goals, most notably the Paris agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2C, and to pursue eÔ¨Äorts to limit the increase to 1.5C. Over the last year, we have seen record temperatures across Europe, extreme rainfall in the US and wildÔ¨Åres in the Arctic. The eÔ¨Äects of the climate crisis are irreversible, so the severity and frequency of these extreme weather events will only increase ‚Äì by how much depends on our success in transitioning to a net-zero emission world. Recognising this risk, the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) ‚Äì a coalition of 66 central banks, and supervisors ‚Äì has been working to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù the Ô¨Ånancial system to reduce the costly Ô¨Ånancial risks that these developments create.  Acting early will help to smooth the transition and avoid a sharp and disorderly adjustment. To meet the goals of the Paris agreement requires a whole economy transition: every business, bank and Ô¨Ånancial institution will need to adapt. The pandemic has shown that we can change our ways of working, living and travelling, but it has also shown that making these adjustments at the height of a crisis brings enormous costs. To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner. That requires us to be strategic. To build back better.  This will only happen if Ô¨Ånancial decisions, including those made by businesses, investors, banks and governments, take the climate crisis into account. The economic recovery plans being developed today oÔ¨Äer the chance to build a sustainable, competitive new economy.  Following the global Ô¨Ånancial crisis, only a fraction of Ô¨Åscal spending improved sustainability. This time, governments‚Äô stimulus packages can be more ambitious; for example, some are already accelerating the transition to clean energy, retroÔ¨Åtting homes and buildings, and linking Ô¨Ånancial support to climate-related conditions laid out by the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Investments in renewable energy infrastructure could also serve a dual purpose, moving us towards an orderly transition path and creating jobs to support the recovery.  Recognising the continued importance of climate risks to the Ô¨Ånancial sector, the NGFS has continued its work while those on the frontline Ô¨Åght the pandemic. As central banks and supervisors, we must use our Ô¨Ånancial stability mandates and expertise to ensure climate risks are eÔ¨Äectively managed in the Ô¨Ånancial system.  The challenge is global and will beneÔ¨Åt from early action, so we are working together to share best practice and build our capabilities. Last week, the NGFS released a package of reports on climate and environmental risks, including an overview of industry practices and guidance for supervisory authorities, and in the coming weeks it will publish a set of climate reference  scenarios. This work will support an orderly transition and raise the bar for the Ô¨Ånancial sector worldwide.  In the aftermath of the Ô¨Ånancial crisis the international community rallied together to reform the Ô¨Ånancial system. These reforms have enabled the Ô¨Ånancial system to be part of the solution rather than the problem. Once again we have reached a fork in the road. We have a choice: rebuild the old economy, locking in temperature increases of 4C with extreme climate disruption; or build back better, preserving our planet for generations to come.  To meet the climate crisis challenge, we must learn from the Covid-19 pandemic. Let us make a green recovery the Ô¨Årst step down that road.  ‚Ä¢ Andrew Bailey is governor of the Bank of England; Fran√ßois Villeroy de Galhau is governor of  Banque de France; Frank Elderson is chair of the Network for Greening the Financial System and executive board member of the Nederlandsche Bank; Mark Carney is UN special envoy for climate action and Ô¨Ånance "
Guardian-2020-28.txt,"  Russian mining Ô¨Årm accused of using global heating to avoid blame for oil spill Nornickel said permafrost thaw could have caused catastrophic diesel spillage in Arctic Andrew Roth in Moscow Tue 9 Jun 2020 20.00 BST  

Environmental groups have accused a Russian mining Ô¨Årm of emphasising the role of global climate change in last week‚Äôs historic oil spill in part to avoid punishment for its ageing infrastructure and potential negligence in the accident.  The World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace Russia said that although climate change likely played a role in the spillage of more than 20,000 tons of diesel fuel that turned two rivers crimson near the Arctic city of Norilsk, the risks of thawing permafrost to Arctic infrastructure were publicly known and could have been addressed months or years earlier.  The accident is one of the largest in Russian history and had been compared by Greenpeace to the Exxon Valdez spill.  Regional oÔ¨Écials on Tuesday said some pollutants from the leak had reached Lake Pyasino, a   large body of water that leads to the Kara Sea. But the main damage has been done to the local Ambarnaya and Daldykan rivers and may take a decade to clean, local oÔ¨Écials and environmentalists have said. Nornickel said that its monitoring did not show that the lake had been contaminated, citing the ‚Äúendeavour and the sacriÔ¨Åce of the accident responders‚Äù who had responded to the spill and placed sea boons to halt the fuel‚Äôs spread. A Russian emergency oÔ¨Écial on Tuesday also said that contamination levels in the lake remained ‚Äúwithin the maximum permissible concentration,‚Äù according to data from Russia‚Äôs environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor.  The operational director for the mining Ô¨Årm Nornickel, Sergei Dyachenko, had earlier denied that negligence at its subsidiary could have caused the accident. In a company press release, he said that ‚Äúanomalously warm temperatures‚Äù may have sped the thaw of permafrost beneath a gas tank and led to its collapse. In another press release, the company blamed the accident on ‚Äúa sudden sinking of supports of the storage tank which served accident-free for more than 30 years‚Äù.  Experts have pointed to the broad impact of climate change in Russia‚Äôs Arctic region over the past decade, noting in particular how thawing permafrost has led to Ô¨Åssures in apartment buildings in Norilsk.  But environmental groups say they are worried that Nornickel, a company that has been attacked in the past as one of Russia‚Äôs biggest polluters in the Arctic, is now seeking to twist concerns about climate change to its defence.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an attempt to write oÔ¨Ä Nornickel‚Äôs failure in risk management and ecological safety on the fashionable topic of climate change,‚Äù said Alexey Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Federation. ‚ÄúThe main factor is mismanagement.‚Äù  The accident, and a government investigation into its causes, is likely to have serious repercussions for Russian industry in the Arctic. Russian oversight agencies have drafted plans to review oil reservoirs throughout the region and investigators have charged one power plant oÔ¨Écial with violating environmental protection rules, which carries a maximum sentence of Ô¨Åve years.  The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, also gave a public scolding last week to Vladimir Potanin, the billionaire president of Nornickel, about the company‚Äôs ageing reservoirs. ‚ÄúIf you had changed them on time, there would have been no environmental damage and no need to foot such costs,‚Äù Putin told Potanin in a televised video call. Nornickel has pledged to cover all costs for the cleanup and to restore the local environment.  Greenpeace Russia last week put out a statement titled ‚ÄúThe melting of the permafrost is not an excuse for Nornickel‚Äù, noting it believed the company ‚Äúsought to avoid responsibility for the accident‚Äù by blaming it on climate change.  The environmental organisation noted that as far back as 2009 it had reported on the risks to Russia‚Äôs oil-and-gas infrastructure from thawing permafrost.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible that the company did not know about [thawing permafrost], but it is possible that the company used a dangerous facility irresponsibly,‚Äù said Vasily Yablokov, Greenpeace   Russia‚Äôs climate project manager.  Weak enforcement and business cost decisions meant companies were hesitant to replace technology, he said.  ‚ÄúIn principle, the interests of businesses are put above the ecology,‚Äù said Yablokov.  A Nornickel spokesperson said: ‚ÄúSo far, we have only named a possible version of what happened. Final conclusions can be drawn only after the investigation is completed.‚Äù She also said the company was actively involved in the clean-up from the accident.  During a conference call with investors and analysts on Tuesday, Dyachenko said the company believed that thawing permafrost was the cause of the accident. He said: ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt any precise monitoring being done on permafrost before [the accident],‚Äù adding that local eÔ¨Äorts to monitor the thawing permafrost were focused on the city of Norilsk and its residential building stock.   In a statement provided after publication, Nornickel said it ‚Äúcategorically rejects accusations of any attempts to avoid blame or downplay its responsibility for the diesel spillage in the Arctic,‚Äù adding that such accidents were ‚Äúabsolutely unacceptable regardless of their primary cause.‚Äù  The company said it was cooperating with law enforcement agencies and had launched ‚Äúa full and thorough internal investigation‚Äù into the accident.  ‚ÄúWe unequivocally accept that climate change risks, including those of abnormally high temperatures in the Arctic, must be properly addressed and mitigated. Nornickel has immediately launched a comprehensive inquiry into the increased risks we are now facing so to avoid climate-change related accidents in future.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe fully accept our responsibility for the event and are making appropriate Ô¨Ånancial provisions and arrangements for related legal liabilities as well as additional voluntary commitments in order to mitigate the inÔ¨Çicted environmental damage,‚Äù the company said.

Guardian-2020-29.txt,"  The Sims gets a climate.friendly makeover in Eco Lifestyle Love The Sims, but wish it were more in line with your green sensibilities? The famous life9 simulation game has had an eco makeover in its new expansion pack Keza MacDonald  Tue 9 Jun 2020 08.00 BST 

The Sims is often held up as a shiny, romanticised example of the capitalist ideal: work  hard, earn money, acquire stuÔ¨Ä, and happiness will follow. The game is stranger and funnier than that in reality ‚Äì browse Sims YouTube for half an hour and you‚Äôll quickly see that the stories players tell within this world are far weirder and more diverse than ‚Äúget money, get happy‚Äù, often involving ghosts, thwarted dreams and  scandalous pregnancies ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still very much Conspicuous Consumption: The Game.  Last week, however, The Sims went explicitly eco-conscious with a new expansion pack, Eco Lifestyle, which lets you design Sims and neighbourhoods around sustainability and climate- conscious choices. Or sack all of that oÔ¨Ä and live in a Ô¨Ålthy, smoggy nightmare town covered in trash. The Sims has never judged you.  Eco Lifestyle adds features that The Sims‚Äô enormous Gen Z audience had long been asking for,  such as septum piercings and boho fashions that would look great down the allotment ‚Äì and loads that surely nobody was asking for, including candle-making and the attractive prospect of having sex in dumpsters, thus fulÔ¨Ålling every older pearl-clutcher‚Äôs worst imaginings about the Ô¨Ålthy eco-conscious young. How your Sims live aÔ¨Äects how their neighbourhood develops, and they can vote on and participate in community initiatives that will eventually turn a run- down port town into a renewable energy-powered green oasis.  ‚ÄúEvery neighbourhood has its own eco footprint that most interactions feed into,‚Äù explains George Pigula, the game‚Äôs producer at developer Maxis. ‚ÄúYour neighbourhood could be on the industrial end with a bit more smog and pollution: this gives bonuses to power generation, fuel burning slower, and maybe a few more trash piles. Or you can go green and have your solar panels produce more power, your plants grow better ingredients, and you get to marvel at auroras overhead. Power and water utilities now have to be managed. You can continue to buy your power and water oÔ¨Ä of the grid, or you can generate it yourself. You will have to choose green options or fuel-burning options, and then live with the consequences of each.‚Äù  George Pigula of Maxis, producer of The Sims: Eco Lifestyle. Photograph: EA/Maxis Pleasingly, these systems make Eco Lifestyle more than a superÔ¨Åcial eco aesthetic featuring dungarees, kombucha and plenty of indoor plants. It doesn‚Äôt overtly push the player towards any particular path of action, but it does lay out the relationship between how we live and how the environment responds, and oÔ¨Äers some satisfying fantastical ways to live well ‚Äì such as fabricator machines that can make rugs and furniture out of trash, or reclaiming old railway lines to make sky gardens. It can even free Sims from the need for money altogether, if you   choose to go full freegan and found a neighbourhood where everyone shares, or pull discarded furniture out of the trash and Ô¨Åx it up. (In a cute touch, discarded furniture resembles old designs the very Ô¨Årst Sims game.)  I wouldn‚Äôt describe The Sims: Eco Lifestyle as overtly educational. It is a playful stage-setting themed around sustainable living, not a game with a message about what we‚Äôre doing to the planet. ‚ÄúReal-world climate change is an issue that the best minds are constantly working on. I don‚Äôt think we will solve that here,‚Äù agrees Pigula. ‚ÄúBut we are allowing the player to play around with the concept of changing everyday habits that all feed into a larger system.‚Äù  In the real world, the climate crisis is of course about more than just individual action: it is about corporate and government engagement to change the way the world works. The video games industry is itself a signiÔ¨Åcant contributor to global emissions. PCs and consoles are made of plastics and rare minerals that must be mined somewhere, not to mention the immense energy used by both players and development studios. A UN-backed initiative called Playing for the Planet has encouraged some (but not all) of the industry‚Äôs biggest companies to sign up and work towards the idea of carbon-neutral game development and educating players about global heating. Electronic Arts, the company that owns The Sims‚Äô developer Maxis, was not among them.  Sims hard at work upcycling in the Eco Lifestyle expansion. Photograph: EA/Maxis The Sims: Eco Lifestyle does not reÔ¨Çect this bigger picture, focusing instead on the potential of individual action and choices. But it was, according to Pigula, inspired not just by players‚Äô demands but by the changes that the people making the game have found themselves making to their lives.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve upped my recycling game, insulated my house, and switched to a wooden comb. Solar options, water reduction, reusable bags, meatless Mondays and electric vehicles are hugely popular among the team members,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúA lot of the Sims is about taking a lens to everyday life and embellishing it towards joy. I will say, I don‚Äôt think bills and recycling are fun in real life ‚Äì but we have made them fun in Eco Lifestyle.‚Äù      "
Guardian-2020-3.txt," ‚ÄòI'm not a quitter‚Äô: lobstermen turn to kelp farming in the face of climate crisis Climate breakdown is causing the Gulf of Maine to heat up and that eÔ¨Äect : in addition to the pandemic : is being felt across the lobster industry by Gabriella Gershenson 
  Tue 19 May 2020 06.00

 BSTRocky shorelines and weathered saltbox homes dot the landscape of South  Thomaston on the coast of Maine. Lobster traps take up frontyard real estate and lobster shacks, still shuttered for the season, are common sightings. Back from a day of scalloping, lobsterman Bob Baines has docked his boat, the FV Thrasher, at the Spruce Head Fishermans Co-op. His sternman, David McLellan, clad in waterproof overalls like Baines, shucks the last few hauls, tossing the meats into  a bucket and the shells overboard.  It‚Äôs the last week of scallop season, but there is a new venture on the horizon. Baines, 64, steers the Thrasher back out toward Hewett Island on Penobscot Bay to check on the underwater kelp farm that he ‚Äúplanted‚Äù in December. It‚Äôs a willowy structure made up of moorings, buoys and ropes that hovers 7ft underwater and spans 1,000ft wide, like a monster cat‚Äôs cradle.  The only indicator that there is anything happening below the surface are the buoys that outline a hidden plot, with 13 parallel lines criss-crossing back and forth, each wrapped in a helix of twine impregnated with kelp seed that has grown into translucent brown ribbons.  Baines is among the latest of 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming. It‚Äôs boom time for lobster in Maine ‚Äì 2019 was the fourth most proÔ¨Åtable year in the history of an industry that accounts for $1bn in state revenue, second only to tourism. But a variety of factors, most of which can be traced to climate change, have left lobstermen more vulnerable than ever.  The lobster industry‚Äôs unprecedented growth may sound like a good thing, but the cause of it is alarming. According to a 2015 Science magazine study, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world‚Äôs oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation eÔ¨Äorts implemented over the years, has accounted for the Ô¨Çourishing of the lobster population;   lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster Ô¨Åsheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters.  ‚ÄúI think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,‚Äù says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine‚Äôs Island Institute, who works with Ô¨Åshermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. ‚ÄúBut the changes that are occurring are undeniable.‚Äù  Those changes aren‚Äôt good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. ‚ÄúThe ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,‚Äù says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidiÔ¨Åcation, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially beneÔ¨Åt marine life in the future.  ‚ÄúThe Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn‚Äôt used to be that way,‚Äù says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he‚Äôs squinting. ‚ÄúWhen I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground Ô¨Åsh ‚Äì cod, haddock, hake ‚Äì that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.‚Äù The way Baines says ‚Äúcod‚Äù sounds more like ‚Äúcaught‚Äù, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here.  While Baines still goes out scalloping and sometimes Ô¨Åshes for halibut, most Maine lobstermen these days rely entirely on lobster to survive. If it‚Äôs a bad year for lobster, it‚Äôs a very bad year for lobstermen. And, in general, proÔ¨Åt margins are lower than they were years ago, due to fuel costs and the rising price of bait and gear, in addition to regulations placed on lobster Ô¨Åshing by the federal government to protect the endangered right whale. Federal restrictions due to the trade war with China and the economic fallout caused by Covid-19 have further devastated their bottom line.  Kelp farming is positioned as a form of insurance, oÔ¨Äering lobstermen such as Baines some of the Ô¨Ånancial security oÔ¨Ä-season Ô¨Åshing once did. He is one of the 24 ‚Äúpartner farmers‚Äù working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the Ô¨Årst commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines‚Äôs daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season ‚Äì from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster‚Äôs summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch.  The farmers grow two types of kelp ‚Äì ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp ‚Äì which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms‚Äô partner farmers‚Äô lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time.   Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming. Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines‚Äô kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest ‚Äì though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. ‚ÄúWe were getting ready to harvest,‚Äù says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. ‚ÄúThere were 18,000 feet of line, 3 ¬Ω to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long ‚Äì we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.‚Äù  After last year‚Äôs debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven‚Äôt crossed, which would rub the kelp right oÔ¨Ä, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not much of a quitter,‚Äù says Hutchins. ‚ÄúWhen Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.‚Äù Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started Ô¨Åshing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20- year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins Ô¨Åshed for shrimp during the lobster oÔ¨Ä-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp Ô¨Åshery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to Ô¨Åll the void where we had lost shrimping,‚Äù says Brewer, who wears a Ô¨Çeece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. ‚ÄúThe price of lobster is so volatile anyways,‚Äù adds Hutchins. ‚ÄúWhat we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we‚Äôre at $4, $4.50. So it‚Äôs nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.‚Äù  Back in South Thomaston, Baines cruises toward his kelp farm, pointing it out on a chart plotter, where it looks like a stick drawing of a rectangle on a digital screen. It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you‚Äôd think.   ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre seeding the farm, you‚Äôre working out of a skiÔ¨Ä, not out of a big lobster boat,‚Äù says Baines. ‚ÄúIn a 14ft skiÔ¨Ä in choppy waters, you‚Äôre bouncing all over the place. When I got home that Ô¨Årst day of seeding, I hadn‚Äôt been that tired in I don‚Äôt know how many years of Ô¨Åshing.‚Äù  But the eÔ¨Äort seems to be paying oÔ¨Ä. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and oÔ¨Äers a sample. The Ô¨Çavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms‚Äô kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-inÔ¨Çuenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass ‚Äì dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach ‚Äì and onto the plate ‚Äì in an ethereally crisp churro stuÔ¨Äed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top.  Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. ‚ÄúKelp farming is so new that for many Ô¨Åshermen, the initial reaction is ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want that around here, that‚Äôs where I go lobstering‚Äô,‚Äù says Baines.  At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine‚Äôs kelp farm, other lobstermen complained that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster‚Äôs oÔ¨Ä-season. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a reasonable argument,‚Äù says Baines. ‚ÄúOnce they see that my lease didn‚Äôt bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.‚Äù  Meanwhile, Atlantic Sea Farms powers ahead. They have plans to move into a larger facility and there is a waitlist of Ô¨Åshermen who want to farm with them. They want to expand their network of partner farmers, which currently numbers 24. But due to the coronavirus outbreak, the waters have become choppy. In late March, Atlantic Sea Farms lost most of their food service clients, which made up about 50% of their accounts. Simultaneously, they saw increased retail and meal kit demand, and a surge in online sales. In the short term, they hope to shift the ratio of their contracts toward retail, with a Wegmans rollout and an expansion into Whole Foods in New England and other regions scheduled for the summer.  Bob Baines, Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer, and the rest of the partner farmers received an email in late March from Briana Warner, the chief executive of Atlantic Sea Farms, assuring them that the company is still committed to buying their kelp. ‚ÄúLobster prices dropped dramatically and we are heading into the lobster season very soon, so this kelp income matters more than before,‚Äù says Warner. ‚ÄúIt could be a very hard season.‚Äù To meet the CDC standards for social distancing, Atlantic Sea Farms will not be bringing in their usual seasonal workers who commute from Massachusetts each day during harvest to process the kelp. Instead, it will be done with a local skeleton crew made up mostly of the company‚Äôs management team. ‚ÄúIt hurts but we‚Äôll get through it,‚Äù says Warner.  As for the farmers, they are happy to have work they can rely on. ‚ÄúThis is the hardest time of year for commercial Ô¨Åshermen,‚Äù says Hutchins of the winter-spring season. ‚ÄúAnd this year, not knowing what will happen with the lobster market as a whole, it‚Äôs nice to know I have something coming in.‚Äù    "
Guardian-2020-30.txt,"  'Why should I try to have a future?' The Weather Diaries, Lupa J and a she;wolf's lament Kathy Drayton set out to make a documentary about the plight of Australian Ô¨Çying foxes. She ended up making one about her daughter instead 

Jenny Valentish Tue 9 Jun 2020 03.55 BST 


 There had been previous obsessions; with eagles, with kangaroos. But when Imogen Jones Ô¨Årst saw Princess Mononoke, a 1997 Japanese anime Ô¨Ålm that was made about the same time she was born, her alignment with the girl raised by wolves would be so profound that she would dress up as the character for years of her childhood.  Later she would name her electro-pop alter ego, Lupa J, in honour of the character.    ‚ÄúThe fact that she was so Ô¨Åercely passionate about the animals in the wilderness resonated with me,‚Äù Jones tells Guardian Australia. ‚ÄúShe was the Ô¨Årst female character that I‚Äôd seen that was wild.‚Äù   If Princess Mononoke is a guiding force for Jones, Jones herself becomes such a force for her mother‚Äôs beautifully bleak documentary, The Weather Diaries, which premieres online this week as part of the 2020 Sydney Ô¨Ålm festival.  Originally, the focus of the Ô¨Ålm was on climate change and the Ô¨Çying foxes that were being evicted from Sydney‚Äôs Royal Botanic Gardens. But then Jones, who attended the Conservatorium high school that‚Äôs situated in the gardens, herself became the central motif in a Ô¨Ålm that Kathy Drayton now describes as a meditation on her daughter‚Äôs future.    Filmed over six years, The Weather Diaries follows Jones from when she was a 15-year-old violinist struggling to Ô¨Ånd her identity within a conservative school, to when she releases her Ô¨Årst album, Swallow Me Whole, and ends up touring with Sarah Blasko and Grimes.    In parallel to her daughter‚Äôs story, Drayton shadows rescuers working with the megabats, and researchers who are subjecting the Parramatta red gum to the conditions of a 3C hotter climate (predicted by 2070). During the course of Ô¨Ålming, temperatures reach 47C and the Ô¨Çying foxes start dying in droves. The Ô¨Ånal scenes, shot in December 2019, show the devastation of the bushÔ¨Åres.  As one of the researchers, Mike Aspinwall, from the Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, comments: ‚ÄúChanges aren‚Äôt likely to happen until people really start to hurt.‚Äù But by the time people hurt, he concedes, it‚Äôs too late.  In turn, Drayton reÔ¨Çects on Aspinwall‚Äôs data collection, as he weighs and measures our descent into disaster: ‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll be the Ô¨Årst species to record its own extinction,‚Äù she says in the voiceover. ‚ÄúAnd that will be our most remarkable achievement.‚Äù  Drayton acknowledges that documentaries about the climate emergency are seen in the industry as ratings killers: to Ô¨Ånd an audience they need to oÔ¨Äer grounds for optimism. But as her career starts to take oÔ¨Ä, Jones ‚Äì who is now 21 ‚Äì loses her own sense of hope. There‚Äôs a sense of futility in creating anything at all against a backdrop of mass extinction: ‚ÄúWhy should I even try to have a future at all? she asks her mother. ‚ÄúWhat does it matter, if I die when I‚Äôm young?‚Äù  Drayton Ô¨Ålms her daughter close to tears and wondering ‚Äì almost spookily, given the pandemic that was yet to come ‚Äì if there would even be places that she could play her music if there was some kind of mass environmental catastrophe. She‚Äôs lost touch with that lone wolf girl she once cherished, she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not able to be that strong.‚Äù  While perhaps older generations have watched and intellectualised the incremental deterioration of the environment, some of Jones‚Äôs generation is growing up with hopelessness ingrained in their psyche.  Lupa J: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre leftist and we understand the reality of what‚Äôs happening, but it‚Äôs hard to know what to do.‚Äô Photograph: Dean Tirkot ‚ÄúWhen I was in high school, I didn‚Äôt really think any further beyond that, and I was just focused on the immediate things I had to do to succeed,‚Äù Jones tells Guardian Australia. ‚ÄúThen I started to feel more jaded since Ô¨Ånishing high school. That‚Äôs why I was so feeling so hopeless about everything after putting my album out.‚Äù  After global public interest in Extinction Rebellion and the school strike movement, Jones says that many people, upon seeing The Weather Diaries, make the assumption that she is more of an activist than she is.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that people have gotten that from the Ô¨Ålm, because I think more than anything my mum was trying to show that people my age are so focused on their own lives that it‚Äôs hard to think about the future and climate change,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad to realise that, but it‚Äôs not like I have any activist friends either. We‚Äôre leftist and we understand the reality of what‚Äôs happening, but it‚Äôs hard to know what to do. I think my generation is just inherently nihilistic.

Guardian-2020-31.txt," Climate crisis to blame for $67bn of Hurricane Harvey damage 9 study Exclusive: new Ô¨Ågure far higher than previous estimates of direct impact of global heating 

Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Fri 12 Jun 2020 06.00 BST 


 At least $67bn of the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 can be attributed directly to climate breakdown, according to research that could lead to a radical reassessment of the costs of damage from extreme weather.  Harvey ripped through the Caribbean and the US states of Texas and Louisiana, causing at least $90bn of damage to property and livelihoods, and killing scores of people.  Conventional economic estimates attributed only about $20bn of the destruction to the direct impacts of global heating. Climate breakdown is known to be making hurricanes stronger and may make them more likely to occur, but separating the eÔ¨Äects of global heating from the   natural weather conditions that also cause hurricanes is complex.  In a study published in the journal Climatic Change, researchers used the emerging science of climate change attribution to calculate the odds of such a hurricane happening naturally or under increased carbon dioxide levels, and applied the results to the damage caused.  Similar methods were used in a separate study, published last month in the same journal, that found that droughts in New Zealand between 2007 and 2017 cost the economy about NZ$4.8bn, of which $800m was directly linked to climate change. Floods caused insured losses of about NZ$470m over the same period, of which NZ$140m was linked to the climate.  The researchers say the new tools are a more accurate way of estimating the economic damage caused by climate breakdown.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pretty sure the climate change-related damages associated with extreme events have been underestimated in most assessments of the social cost of carbon,‚Äù said David Frame, a professor of climate change at the Victoria University of Wellington and the lead author of the studies. ‚ÄúWe think this line of research, as it matures, should provide a really valuable input.‚Äù  Friederike Otto, the director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said the method could make it possible to generate global estimates of the true cost of climate breakdown, which could have a profound eÔ¨Äect on how governments and businesses approach the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  ‚ÄúWe have known about the costs of climate change theoretically,‚Äù said Otto. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all very well in the abstract, but the global mean temperature does not kill anyone ‚Äì extreme events cost money and lives. Being able to attribute these impacts to climate change means being able to convey what climate change really means.‚Äù  She said it would become possible to compile an inventory of the damage that could be attributed to climate change around the world, which governments and businesses could use to bring about change. ‚ÄúHopefully this will speed up the process of moving to net zero [carbon].‚Äù  Estimating the true costs of the climate crisis could also help developing countries seeking recognition of the loss and damage they face as a result of climate breakdown, which they argue should spur rich countries to provide more assistance. Loss and damage is likely to be one of the most vexed issues at next year‚Äôs UN Cop26 climate summit.  Legal actions around the world would also be aÔ¨Äected, said Tessa Khan, a co-director of the Climate Litigation Network. Activists and local governments around the world are taking fossil fuel companies to court over their greenhouse gas emissions, arguing that they knowingly caused damage while proÔ¨Åting from raising carbon dioxide levels.  ‚Äú[The two new studies] are opening to door to stronger evidence to persuade courts that fossil fuel companies should be held accountable for their role,‚Äù Khan said. ‚ÄúThis will strengthen the legal basis of these lawsuits.‚Äù   "
Guardian-2020-32.txt," Climate worst-case scenarios may not go far enough, cloud data shows Modelling suggests climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than thought Jonathan Watts Sat 13 Jun 2020 07.00 BST 


 Worst-case global heating scenarios may need to be revised upwards in light of a better understanding of the role of clouds, scientists have said.  Recent modelling data suggests the climate is considerably more sensitive to carbon emissions than previously believed, and experts said the projections had the potential to be ‚Äúincredibly alarming‚Äù, though they stressed further research would be needed to validate the new numbers.  Modelling results from more than 20 institutions are being compiled for the sixth assessment by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is due to be released   next year.  Compared with the last assessment in 2014, 25% of them show a sharp upward shift from 3C to 5C in climate sensitivity ‚Äì the amount of warming projected from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from the preindustrial level of 280 parts per million. This has shocked many veteran observers, because assumptions about climate sensitivity have been relatively unchanged since the 1980s.  ‚ÄúThat is a very deep concern,‚Äù Johan Rockstr√∂m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said. ‚ÄúClimate sensitivity is the holy grail of climate science. It is the prime indicator of climate risk. For 40 years, it has been around 3C. Now, we are suddenly starting to see big climate models on the best supercomputers showing things could be worse than we thought.‚Äù  He said climate sensitivity above 5C would reduce the scope for human action to reduce the worst impacts of global heating. ‚ÄúWe would have no more space for a soft landing of 1.5C [above preindustrial levels]. The best we could aim for is 2C,‚Äù he said.  Worst-case projections in excess of 5C have been generated by several of the world‚Äôs leading climate research bodies, including the UK Met OÔ¨Éce‚Äôs Hadley Centre and the EU‚Äôs Community Earth System Model.  Timothy Palmer, a professor in climate physics at Oxford University and a member of the Met OÔ¨Éce‚Äôs advisory board, said the high Ô¨Ågure initially made scientists nervous. ‚ÄúIt was way outside previous estimates. People asked whether there was a bug in the code,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it boiled down to relatively small changes in the way clouds are represented in the models.‚Äù  The role of clouds is one of the most uncertain areas in climate science because they are hard to measure and, depending on altitude, droplet temperature and other factors, can play either a warming or a cooling role. For decades, this has been the focus of Ô¨Åerce academic disputes.  Previous IPCC reports tended to assume that clouds would have a neutral impact because the warming and cooling feedbacks would cancel each other out. But in the past year and a half, a body of evidence has been growing showing that the net eÔ¨Äect will be warming. This is based on Ô¨Åner resolution computer models and advanced cloud microphysics.  ‚ÄúClouds will determine humanity‚Äôs fate ‚Äì whether climate is an existential threat or an inconvenience that we will learn to live with,‚Äù said Palmer. ‚ÄúMost recent models suggest clouds will make matters worse.‚Äù  In a recent paper in the journal Nature, Palmer explains how the new Hadley Centre model that produced the 5+C Ô¨Ågure on climate sensitivity was tested by assessing its accuracy in forecasting short-term weather. This testing technique had exposed Ô¨Çaws in previous models, but in the latest case, the results reinforced the estimates. ‚ÄúThe results are not reassuring ‚Äì they support the estimates,‚Äù he wrote. He is calling for other models to be tested in a similar way.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important. The message to the government and public is, you have to take this high climate sensitivity seriously. [We] must get emissions down as quickly as we can,‚Äù he said.   The IPCC is expected to include the 5+C climate sensitivity Ô¨Ågure in its next report on the range of possible outcomes. Scientists caution that this is a work in progress and that doubts remain because such a high Ô¨Ågure does not Ô¨Åt with historical records.  Catherine Senior, head of understanding climate change at the Met OÔ¨Éce Hadley Centre, said more studies and more data were needed to fully understand the role of clouds and aerosols.  ‚ÄúThis Ô¨Ågure has the potential to be incredibly alarming if it is right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut as a scientist, my Ô¨Årst response is: why has the model done that? We are still in the stage of evaluating the processes driving the diÔ¨Äerent response.‚Äù  While acknowledging the continued uncertainty, Rockstr√∂m said climate models might still be underestimating the problem because they did not fully take into account tipping points in the biosphere.  ‚ÄúThe more we learn, the more fragile the Earth system seems to be and the faster we need to move,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt gives even stronger argument to step out of this Covid-19 crisis and move full speed towards decarbonising the economy.‚Äù     "
Guardian-2020-33.txt," Fast%growing mini%forests spring up in Europe to aid climate Miyawaki forests are denser and said to be more biodiverse than other kinds of woods 

Hannah Lewis Sat 13 Jun 2020 08.00 BST 


 Tiny, dense forests are springing up around Europe as part of a movement aimed at restoring biodiversity and Ô¨Åghting the climate crisis.  Often sited in schoolyards or alongside roads, the forests can be as small as a tennis court. They are based on the work of the Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki, who has planted more than 1,000 such forests in Japan, Malaysia and elsewhere.  Advocates for the method say the miniature forests grow 10 times faster and become 30 times denser and 100 times more biodiverse than those planted by conventional methods. This result is achieved by planting saplings close together, three per square metre, using native varieties adapted to local conditions. A wide variety of species ‚Äì ideally 30 or more ‚Äì are planted to   recreate the layers of a natural forest.  Scientists say such ecosystems are key to meeting climate goals, estimating that natural forests can store 40 times more carbon than single-species plantations. The Miyawaki forests are designed to regenerate land in far less time than the 70-plus years it takes a forest to recover on its own.  ‚ÄúThis is a great thing to do,‚Äù said Eric Dinerstein, a wildlife scientist who co-authored a recent paper calling for half of the Earth‚Äôs surface to be protected or managed for nature conservation to avoid catastrophic climate change. ‚ÄúSo this could be another aspect for suburban and urban areas, to create wildlife corridors through contiguous ribbons of mini-forest.‚Äù  The mini-forests could attract migratory songbirds, Dinerstein said. ‚ÄúSongbirds are made from caterpillars and adult insects, and even small pockets of forests, if planted with native species, could become a nutritious fast-food Ô¨Çy-in site for hungry birds.‚Äù  In 2017, researchers at Wageningen University in the Netherlands monitored newly planted mini-forests and concluded that they ‚Äúincrease the biodiversity compared to the nearby forest. Both the number of species groups and the number of individuals is generally higher than in the reference forests.‚Äù   The higher biodiversity is due partly to the forests‚Äô young age and openness, explained Fabrice Ottburg, an animal ecologist who led the Wageningen study. This allows more sunlight to reach Ô¨Çowering plants that attract pollinators. Diversity is also boosted by planting multiple species, which ‚Äúprovide more variety in food and shelter for a higher diversity of animals like insects, snails, butterÔ¨Çies, amphibians, bugs, grasshoppers‚Äù, Ottburg said.  In the Netherlands, the conservation group IVN Nature Education has helped cities and households to plant 100 Miyawaki-style forests since 2015. It is on track to more than double that number by 2022 and is working on similar eÔ¨Äorts in a dozen other countries. Assorted groups in Belgium and France have recently created at least 40 mini-forests.   A three-year-old forest in Ormeignies, Belgium. Photograph: Urban Forests The Ô¨Årst in France was planted in March 2018 beside a busy four-lane road on the edge of Paris.  The dense thicket was intended to reduce noise and Ô¨Ålter air for the adjacent neighbourhood. On the day of planting, 40 people gathered with 31 species of saplings to bring new life to ground that had been prepared with compost from local horse stables.   Two years earlier, Enrico Fusto and Damien Saraceni had applied for funding from Paris‚Äôs participatory budget, a scheme that asks residents for ideas about how to spend 5% of the city‚Äôs funds. The pair proposed mini-forests, saying they could help increase the level of tree cover in the city, which is currently less than 10%, much lower than many other major cities. ‚ÄúEach community can be the protagonist of its own restoration story,‚Äù said Fusto.  In Toulouse, a mini-forest group planted 1,200 saplings on a 400 sq metre patch in March.  Nicolas de Braband√®re, a Belgian naturalist and founder of Urban Forests, began planting Miyawaki-style forests in 2016, organising volunteers and local authorities to plant 300 saplings on a grassy strip of land near a road. Now his Ô¨Årst forest is 3 metres tall, its Ô¨Çoor a thick layer of humus.   De Braband√®re believes the participatory nature and speed of a mini-forest is what appeals to people, and he predicts a bright future for the movement. ‚ÄúEvery time I tell the story, everybody likes it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo I have a good feeling the trend will continue.‚Äù "
Guardian-2020-34.txt,"  Australia has a problem with climate change denial. The message just isn't getting through Greg Jericho Guardian Australia and others report on the issue with the seriousness it deserves ; but it‚Äôs not enough to preach to the converted 

 Tue 16 Jun 2020 00.00 BST 

 An international survey of people‚Äôs news habits around the world reveals that  Australians‚Äô opinions on climate change are determined mostly by age and news source but that, overall, we are more likely to deny climate change than most other nations. And it is clear from the results of the 2020 Digital Media Report that a major reason for this denial is the inÔ¨Çuence of News Corp.  This year‚Äôs Digital News Report in Australia, which is produced by the News and Media Research Centre at the University of Canberra (disclosure, I am also employed by the university   and wrote a commentary for this year‚Äôs report), covers a wide range of topics that investigate how people access news and what interests them.  The report has some pretty eye-opening results on the topic of climate change, which conÔ¨Årm longheld beliefs about the impact of the News Corp coverage of the issue.  Of the 40 countries that take part in the survey, which is coordinated by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford, only the US, Sweden and Norway have a higher percentage of news consumers who believe that climate change is either not serious at all or they don‚Äôt know if it is serious (which eÔ¨Äectively means they do not think it is serious):  Just over one in Ô¨Åve news consumers in Australia regard climate change as either not very serious, not serious at all or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know‚Äù.  Given that the report was conducted during the recent horriÔ¨Åc bushÔ¨Åre season, that result is rather stunning and depressing.  The problem is that, given you are reading this, you are not one of those people.  Of all online news outlets, Guardian Australia readers are second only to those who read Junkee in being extremely concerned about climate change, and third behind readers of the Conversation and Vice News, of those who are more than ‚Äúsomewhat concerned‚Äù.  And while we can give ourselves a pat on the back, a look down the bottom of the charts shows where the problem lies.  Nearly 30% of skynews.com.au readers don‚Äôt believe climate change is a serious issue (compared to 35% of those who watch Sky News TV), and we see News Corp websites dominate the news sites whose readers most deny climate change.  Mostly the views of the online readers aligns with that of the oÔ¨Ñine readers by brand, although those who consume ABC online are generally more likely to deny climate change than those who consume ABC TV and radio.  The survey of 2,131 news consumers found that age is also a major factor behind people‚Äôs views of climate change. Generally, the younger you are the more concerned you will be:  As a card-carrying member of Gen X, it is rather shaming to Ô¨Ånd that barely half of us think climate change is either very or extremely serious, given unlike our baby boomer parents our formative years saw increasing temperatures:  But it is not just age ‚Äì political orientation is also a determinant.  Those who call themselves rightwing are much more likely to deny climate change:  But while this may not be surprising, given their news sources and the statements by rightwing politicians, what is more worrying is that just as many of those who class themselves as ‚Äúcentre‚Äù view climate change as merely ‚Äúsomewhat serious‚Äù, as do rightwingers.  This suggests a large gulf in the ability of the media to convey the issue‚Äôs importance to those with little political aÔ¨Éliation. When it comes to climate change, believing it is only ‚Äúsomewhat   serious‚Äù essentially means you have not understood the problem.  And it is clear that the media is not getting the message through.  Only 38% of those with a ‚Äúcentre‚Äù political orientation believe the media provides ‚Äúaccurate information‚Äù on climate change:  We need to be a bit careful with these Ô¨Åndings because while rightwingers are more likely to deny climate change, they are also more likely to believe the media is not telling the truth. So it is unclear whether those in the centre believe the media is exaggerating or underplaying the issue.  But while it is easy to lay all the blame at the feet of News Corp and those media organisations and journalists who choose to treat climate change as a debatable concept (or possibly a less than serious one) the report also points to the challenge for those of us in the media who agree with the science.  Over a quarter of those who only regard the issue as ‚Äúsomewhat serious‚Äù are disinterested in reading about climate change:  This is the challenge for organisations such as Guardian Australia, the ABC, and the Nine/Fairfax papers who do report on the issue with the seriousness it deserves. It is not enough to preach to the converted.  We need to reach those vaguely aware of the issue but not really informed well enough to understand its seriousness. Failure to do so will cede the issue to the climate-change denying media outlets, and will continue to have Australia with one of the highest numbers of deniers in the world.  ‚Ä¢ Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia     "
Guardian-2020-35.txt," Covid&19 pandemic is 'Ô¨Åre drill' for eÔ¨Äects of climate crisis, says UN oÔ¨Écial Lise Kingo says social equality issues must be part of sustainable development agenda Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Mon 15 Jun 2020 15.16 BST 




 The coronavirus pandemic is ‚Äújust a Ô¨Åre drill‚Äù for what is likely to follow from the climate crisis, and the protests over racial injustice around the world show the need to tie together social equality, environmental sustainability and health, the UN‚Äôs sustainable business chief has said.  ‚ÄúThe overall problem is that we are not sustainable in the ways we are living and producing on the planet today,‚Äù said Lise Kingo, the executive director of the UN Global Compact, under which businesses sign up to principles of environmental protection and social justice. ‚ÄúThe only way forward is to create a world that leaves no one behind.‚Äù  She said there were ‚Äúvery, very clear connections‚Äù between the Covid-19 and climate crises,   and the Black Lives Matter protests around the world, which she said had helped to reveal deep-seated inequalities and ‚Äúendemic and structural racism‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWe have seen illustrated to everyone that social inequality issues are part of the sustainable development agenda,‚Äù Kingo said.  Human rights were ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù from dealing with climate breakdown, she told the Guardian in an interview. ‚ÄúThis horrible racism [seen in the killing of George Floyd] is about human rights. We have to make sure that we give the social part of the agenda equal focus.‚Äù  She called on business leaders to take heed. ‚ÄúWe want all chief executives to become social activists ‚Äì to understand social equality,‚Äù she said. Not only was this the right thing to do, but ‚Äúit creates stable markets for companies around the world‚Äù and reÔ¨Çects the desires of young people.  ‚ÄúYoung people are so engaged, so dedicated to this agenda, they don‚Äôt want to work for companies that do not have a solid responsibility strategy,‚Äù she said.  The UN secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, said building a fairer society would be essential to the world‚Äôs health, as well as to saving the planet from climate breakdown and ecological destruction.  ‚ÄúToday, the fabric of society and the wellbeing of people hinge on our ability to build a fair globalisation,‚Äù he told the two-day UN Global Compact virtual conference of business leaders, which started on Monday.  ‚ÄúWhere once ‚Äòdo no harm‚Äô was a common approach for the business community, today we are arriving at a new landscape of elevated expectations and responsibilities. But despite progress, serious threats would undermine our future, including climate change, poverty, loss of biodiversity and widening social inequalities. The pandemic has underscored the world‚Äôs fragilities, which extend far beyond the realm of global health.‚Äù  Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, told the conference that the Covid-19 crisis had shown how urgent it was to tackle global heating. ‚ÄúThis is a crisis that will involve the whole world and from which no one can self-isolate,‚Äù he said.  He called for all companies to provide clear information to customers, the public and investors about how they plan to move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  More than 10,000 companies are signed up to the UN Global Compact, and they are being urged to strengthen their commitments to cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Many have pledged to cut carbon in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding global temperature rises to no more than 2C.  But scientiÔ¨Åc studies show that this may not be enough to stave oÔ¨Ä disaster, and that the consequences of even 1.5C of global heating will be severe. Kingo wants companies to revise their business plans in order to reduce carbon in line with a 1.5C goal. ‚ÄúWe need to see leadership to drive this,‚Äù she said.  A report by the UN for the 20th anniversary of the Global Compact found that only four in 10   companies had targets that would enable them to meet the UN‚Äôs sustainable development goals by the 2030 deadline, and fewer than a third thought their industry was moving fast enough.  While 84% of companies participating in the UN Global Compact were taking action on the goals, fewer than half were ‚Äúembedding‚Äù those targets into their core business activities, and only 37% were designing their business models to meet the goals.  ‚ÄúThe human community is completely interconnected and interdependent,‚Äù Kingo said. ‚ÄúWithout solidarity, especially with those most vulnerable among us, we all lose. We are paying the price for turning a blind eye to obvious injustices in the world.‚Äù   "
Guardian-2020-36.txt,"  Deadly heat is killing Americans: A decade of inaction on climate puts lives at risk Heat now causes more deaths than hurricanes, tornadoes or Ô¨Çoods in most years, creating a new public health threat. An investigation reveals why the CDC‚Äôs prevention eÔ¨Äorts have faltered

This story is co-published with Columbia Journalism Investigations, the Center for Public Integrity and Covering Climate Now. Read the full investigation here.  Charlie Rhodes lived alone on a tree-sparse street with sunburned lawns just outside Phoenix, Arizona. At 61, the army veteran‚Äôs main connection to the world was Facebook; often, he posted several times a day. But as a heatwave blanketed the region in June 2016 ‚Äì leading to temperatures among the highest ever recorded ‚Äì his posts stopped. Three weeks later, a pile of unopened mail outside his door prompted a call to police.  When oÔ¨Écers arrived, they were overcome by the odor of rotting garbage, worsened by the   still-searing heat. Inside the home, they found the air conditioner broken and its thermometer reading 99F. Rhodes lay dead in the bedroom, his body decomposing. The cause, his autopsy shows: ‚ÄúComplications of environmental heat exposure.‚Äù  Yearly heat-related deaths have more than doubled in Arizona in the last decade to 283. Across the country, heat caused at least 10,000 deaths between 1999 and 2016 ‚Äì more than hurricanes, tornadoes or Ô¨Çoods in most years.  Scientists link the warming planet to a rise in dangerous heat in the US, as well as the spread of infectious diseases and other health conditions. Federal research predicts heatstroke and similar illnesses will claim tens of thousands of American lives each year by the end of the century. Already, higher temperatures pose lethal risks: the Ô¨Åve warmest years nationwide have all occurred since 2006. In the last six decades, the number of annual heatwaves in 50 US cities has, on average, tripled. In contrast to a viral pandemic, this is a quiet, insidious threat with no end point. A decade of missed opportunities The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is charged with helping cities and states adapt to threats like extreme heat. Its climate program, created more than 10 years ago, is the federal government‚Äôs only sustained eÔ¨Äort to bolster state and local health departments‚Äô Ô¨Åght against global warming. But the program has been hampered by a decade of underfunding, limited expertise and political resistance, Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity found.  Interviews with more than 100 people and a review of hundreds of pages of government records show the Obama administration, while pushing measures to combat climate change, missed opportunities to expand the program. Under Donald Trump, oÔ¨Écials have tried to eliminate it.  The tepid federal response has left state and local health workers ill-equipped to act, exposing communities to underappreciated threats that will only get worse.  Arizona‚Äôs health department receives around $200,000 a year to fund its climate team. But for a state with 7 million people ‚Äì including a growing number of isolated, older residents like Rhodes ‚Äì experts say it‚Äôs not enough to pay for research and, most importantly, action.  Rhodes, a once gregarious jokester who cut himself oÔ¨Ä from family and friends after the loss of his job and father, had devised a method to handle the heat: he covered his windows with aluminum foil and ran the air conditioner in his bedroom. But as the temperature hit 120F near his home, no one checked on him.  Asked what the program has done to prevent people like Rhodes from dying of heat, the Arizona health department spokesperson Holly Poynter said its advisories on the hottest days include a sentence encouraging people to check on at-risk friends, family and neighbors twice a day. ‚ÄúHeat-related deaths are preventable,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand continued work is needed due to increasing vulnerable populations within the state.‚Äù  The CDC defended its eÔ¨Äorts on climate change, saying its program has assisted health departments successfully for years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre proud of the work that our program is doing,‚Äù said   Patrick Breysse, who heads the agency‚Äôs environmental health center and oversees its climate activities. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited about the leadership role we play.‚Äù  A hiker walks past a heat warning sign at sunrise, in Phoenix. Photograph: Matt York/AP Some CDC-aided health departments lead the nation in heat illness prevention. San Francisco‚Äôs climate program helped devise heat emergency response plans and mapped vulnerable city neighborhoods. Now, oÔ¨Écials use these maps to encourage neighbors to check on each other. Climate programs elsewhere helped change the threshold for heat advisories from 100F to 95F after Ô¨Ånding residents get sick at lower temperatures.  Yet many departments funded by the CDC are struggling to fulÔ¨Åll the program‚Äôs mission, according to government and academic reports and interviews with state and local health workers.  In North Carolina, program employees asked their CDC counterparts for guidance and expertise to identify the state‚Äôs climate health threats. Records show the agency failed to provide the assistance it promised early on. After nearly a decade of research, health workers only recently began reaching out to the most vulnerable residents.  In Florida, heat-related hospitalizations are on the rise. But health oÔ¨Écials there barred the state climate team from publicly acknowledging global warming‚Äôs link to heat. Then, with the CDC‚Äôs imprimatur, they evicted the program from the health department.  Most of the country‚Äôs 3,000 state and local health departments, meanwhile, get no such funding. They‚Äôre on their own to Ô¨Ågure out what to do and how to pay for it.

Photograph: Mike Stone/REUTERS A slow start Federal oÔ¨Écials have known for decades that climate change poses a public health crisis. In 1989, the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a 100-page report on how global warming could aÔ¨Äect human health. It urged public health agencies to fund research on extreme heat and provide health departments with ‚Äútrained professionals‚Äù. By 2000, the US released its Ô¨Årst recurring assessment of the changing climate‚Äôs impacts. Again, it called for ‚Äúinvestments in advancing the public health infrastructure‚Äù.  Five years later, Dr Howard Frumkin, a veteran epidemiologist hired to run CDC‚Äôs environmental health center, brought the nation‚Äôs leading public health agency into the battle against climate change. ‚ÄúWe knew that the climate was warming,‚Äù said Frumkin, who viewed the CDC as ‚Äúpast the point where we needed to be stepping up‚Äù. Obama‚Äôs mixed climate record In 2009 ‚Äì then the second-hottest year on record ‚Äì Frumkin seized an opportunity to expand the CDC‚Äôs climate eÔ¨Äorts. That February, he testiÔ¨Åed before a congressional committee about challenges brought by global warming. Health departments, he said, require climate and health training and data to plan for impacts. ‚ÄúCDC has in place many of the building blocks,‚Äù he told the committee, but it needed to assemble them into a serious eÔ¨Äort.  A month later, a Democratic-led Congress gave the CDC $7.5m for its climate program, to be renewed yearly with congressional approval. The new initiative seeded climate and health activities in 10 health departments. Frumkin hoped it would eventually expand to all 50 states.  Shortly after Congress funded the program, Dr Thomas Frieden, then the newlyappointed CDC director, introduced his ‚Äúwinnable battles‚Äù ‚Äì seven health initiatives that his agency prioritized. Climate was not among them. Most of those programs ‚Äì nutrition, food safety ‚Äì received an annual $50m to $700m by the end of his eight-year tenure. The climate program, by contrast, never exceeded $10m. In 2013, the CDC recommended reducing that budget.  As the CDC‚Äôs director, Frieden rarely used his bully pulpit to address threats posed by the warming planet. During a 20-minute keynote speech at a national environmental health conference, he discussed the topic for 13 seconds. A 2015 report by the Government Accountability OÔ¨Éce, a congressional watchdog, criticized the CDC for failing to provide   leadership on the issue.  Frieden, for his part, disputes claims that he did not prioritize climate change and insists he cares about the issue, pointing to the CDC‚Äôs work combating dangerous particulate matter produced by cars and coal plants. ‚ÄúIt will have major public health consequences,‚Äù he said of climate change. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs only a certain amount that public health programs can do.‚Äù  The CDC‚Äôs lackluster response contrasted with President Barack Obama‚Äôs public overtures and policy initiatives on climate. Former senior White House oÔ¨Écials ‚Äì including those who helped implement climate policies ‚Äì admit the administration didn‚Äôt apply enough pressure on the CDC to act.  In December 2015, Republicans in Congress rejected a proposal to boost spending on the CDC program to $18m. The increase would have more than doubled its size. When a broken air conditioner is lethal The summer of 2016 ‚Äì when Charlie Rhodes died ‚Äì showed there was no time to lose in the push to understand and stem heat death. The previous eight years, the number of heat-related fatalities in Arizona had averaged 145. That jumped to 219 in 2016, and 264 the year after. A report produced by Maricopa county ‚Äì where the largest number of the state‚Äôs heat deaths have occurred ‚Äì found that men, Native Americans and people 75 and older were most at risk.  Gene Moore, 82, Ô¨Åt all three categories. A Quechan tribe member, he spent much of his life on its reservation, near Yuma, Arizona, before moving near Phoenix in 2010 to live with his son. Over the years, Moore‚Äôs health declined, but he remained mobile and enjoyed talking on the phone with friends, according to his son, Ivan.  In June 2017 ‚Äì several weeks after Ivan had his home air conditioner repaired ‚Äì he took his family camping in the mountains. Gene stayed behind. The day Ivan left, the temperature hit 118F. Phoenix went 11 days at or above 110F, one of only Ô¨Åve such stretches on record. Four happened in the last three decades.  A week later, Ivan‚Äôs brother called to say Moore had stopped answering his phone. Ivan dialed the police. They found Moore dead on his bedroom Ô¨Çoor, his window open. The air conditioner had broken again, and the temperature inside topped 105F. Moore‚Äôs autopsy shows cardiovascular disease caused his death, while heat played a signiÔ¨Åcant contributing factor.  Arizona health oÔ¨Écials still don‚Äôt know why more residents like Moore are dying or how best to protect them. Temperatures are rising in the state, but the hottest summers don‚Äôt always match the highest death tolls. The Arizona State University researcher David Hondula, who works with the state‚Äôs climate team, contributed to a study ruling out temperature as the only reason. Other factors such as homelessness and substance abuse may play a role, he said, but the climate program doesn‚Äôt have money to keep studying the problem.  ‚ÄúIf additional funding existed, we could really dive in to answer this question,‚Äù Hondula said. Instead, the limited CDC money ‚Äì budgeted before the spike in deaths ‚Äì supports awareness campaigns in poorer areas such as Yuma county.  Many Arizona cities oÔ¨Äer cooling centers ‚Äì air-conditioned libraries, churches and other   shelters ‚Äì for residents to escape the heat. Moore and Rhodes both had access to a vehicle. Cooling centers were nearby. Health workers are now surveying residents who visit cooling centers, but they say it takes money to determine why so many others don‚Äôt.  Ivan Moore, who grew up hearing about heat death victims on the radio, blames himself for what happened to his father. ‚ÄúI should have had someone check on him sooner,‚Äù Ivan said, even though less than 36 hours had passed between Gene‚Äôs last email to his family and when police found him. ‚ÄúHe had quite a few years left on him.‚Äù A worker collapse at a sweltering factory In North Carolina, the CDC-funded program has helped enable what health department spokesperson Kelly Haight Connor described in an email as ‚Äúthe substantial growth in climate and health adaptation‚Äù. Even so, documents show the climate team ran into roadblocks almost as soon as it tried to evaluate the state‚Äôs preparedness for climate change. It was still seeking the agency‚Äôs assistance when, in 2015, it completed an analysis showing heat-related mortality would increase over the coming decade.  On 22 June that year, Sherion Winfrey, 63, had just returned to work after vacation and had nine days before she was due to retire. For nearly 40 years, she worked at the same oil- and air- Ô¨Ålter factory in Fayetteville, North Carolina, a city in the Sandhills. She‚Äôd learned to pack frozen water bottles in a cooler to keep herself refreshed on the hot assembly line. But that day, as the temperature outside hit 96F, she collapsed during her shift. Rushed to a hospital, she died early that afternoon.  A state inspection of the factory the next day found that heat from industrial ovens and the metal walls and roof of the un-air-conditioned production line raised the indoor heat index ‚Äì a combined measure of temperature and humidity ‚Äì to over 106F and into the Occupational Safety and Health department‚Äôs ‚Äúdanger‚Äù heat classiÔ¨Åcation. The inspector recommended the factory allow employees time to acclimate to the heat after an absence. But the investigation into Winfrey‚Äôs death ended after a medical examiner found that Winfrey suÔ¨Äered ‚Äúa fatal pulmonary embolism and did not die from exposure to extreme temperatures‚Äù. Recent research suggests this type of blood clotting may be brought on by daily temperature swings.  Danny Muhammad, Winfrey‚Äôs son, has no doubt heat contributed to her death. Winfrey complained to family about the factory‚Äôs stiÔ¨Çing environment. ‚ÄúThe heat index was out of this world that day,‚Äù Muhammad said. It was the ninth consecutive day that temperatures had reached at least 94F ‚Äì seven degrees hotter than the June average. Winfrey‚Äôs family Ô¨Åled a wrongful death lawsuit in 2017 against the factory, citing extreme indoor temperatures as the cause of her death, but the case was later dismissed. A spokesperson for the factory declined to comment.  It took another three years after Winfrey‚Äôs death for the North Carolina program‚Äôs heat education eÔ¨Äorts to begin in four Sandhills counties ‚Äì and not where she had lived. Budget cuts and self@censorship under Trump In the years since the Trump administration took over, the political pressure hampering some of the CDC climate program‚Äôs grantees has also been applied to the program itself. Former and current staÔ¨Ä said senior agency oÔ¨Écials, aware of Trump‚Äôs denials of climate science, have tried to keep the program operating under the radar.   Self-censorship surfaced quickly after the 2016 election, even before Trump assumed oÔ¨Éce. In December of that year, the CDC environmental health director, Patrick Breysse, indeÔ¨Ånitely postponed a Ô¨Årst-ever climate symposium that was scheduled for after the inauguration. George Luber, then the CDC‚Äôs climate chief, remembers his superiors warning the event would be poorly timed; Breysse said the postponement was for budgetary reasons.  The environmental health chief acknowledges that his staÔ¨Ä debated whether to use the term ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù. He later combined the climate and asthma programs and, internal documents suggest, omitted the word ‚Äúclimate‚Äù from the new branch‚Äôs title.  Breysse insists the White House never directed his actions. But they served as the basis for a whistleblower complaint Ô¨Åled by Luber, who was removed from his CDC post in 2018. The complaint alleged that Luber was ousted because of his outspokenness on global warming. It stirred a hornet‚Äôs nest of public attention, but some program insiders allege his removal had more to do with his mismanagement and mistreatment of employees than his advocacy.  The CDC, which refused to comment on ‚Äúpersonnel matters‚Äù, said its climate program was running better than ever. The agency pointed to the ‚Äúmini grants‚Äù it has doled out through partner organizations to help another 10 health departments, one-time funding of $5,000 to $50,000.  Meanwhile, every one of Trump‚Äôs budget proposals has tried to eliminate the program.  The inaction in Washington contrasts with some local eÔ¨Äorts to save lives endangered by the climate crisis. In Phoenix, spurred on by the sustained surge in heat deaths, some groups hand out 250,000 bottles of water annually to the homeless. Others distribute heat awareness magnets and brochures to the elderly. Still others are developing home sensors that will notify friends and family when indoor temperatures climb.  Many vulnerable residents fall through the cracks. Arizona medical examiner records of heat deaths are Ô¨Ålled with accounts of ageing and isolated people who hadn‚Äôt been heard from for days before a wellness check was requested.  Among them were Larry and Kathleen Purchase, 69 and 68 respectively, who died from environmental heat exposure in their Phoenix home during an unusual string of triple-digit days in September 2018. Married for almost 50 years, the two were active in their community and ran a small computer repair service, said Larry‚Äôs brother, Terry. When their 1970s rooftop air conditioner broke, they didn‚Äôt have the several hundred dollars to Ô¨Åx it.  Terry remembers them as ‚Äúgood stewards of the environment‚Äù, a tenet of their Christian faith. They didn‚Äôt believe in human-caused climate change, he said.  The day they were found, the temperature in their home hovered around 100F.

Guardian-2020-37.txt,"  Pass the shiraz: how Australia‚Äôs wine industry can adapt to climate change  We created a world:Ô¨Årst atlas to help secure the country‚Äôs wine future. It shows that all 71 grape: growing regions must adapt to hotter conditions

 Gabi Mocatta, Rebecca Harris and Tomas Remenyi for the Conversation Tue 16 Jun 2020 02.57 BST 


 Many Australians enjoy a glass of homegrown wine, and $2.78bn worth is exported each year. But hotter, drier conditions under climate change means there are big changes ahead for our wine producers.  As climate scientists and science communicators, we‚Äôve been working closely with the wine industry to understand the changing conditions for producing quality wine in Australia.  We created a world-Ô¨Årst atlas to help secure Australia‚Äôs wine future. Released today, Australia‚Äôs Wine Future: A Climate Atlas shows that all 71 wine regions in Australia must adapt to hotter conditions.   Cool wine regions such as Tasmania, for example, will become warmer. This means growers in that state now producing pinot noir and chardonnay may have to transition to varieties suited to warmer conditions, such as shiraz. Hotter, drier conditions Our research, commissioned by Wine Australia, is the culmination of four years of work. We used CSIRO‚Äôs regional climate model to give very localised information on heat and cold extremes, temperature, rainfall and evaporation over the next 80 years.  The research assumed a high carbon emissions scenario to 2100, in line with Earth‚Äôs current trajectory.  From 2020, the changes projected by climate models are more inÔ¨Çuenced by climate change than natural variability.  Temperatures across all wine regions of Australia will increase by about 3‚ÑÉ by 2100. Aridity, which takes into account rainfall and evaporation, is also projected to increase in most Australian wine regions. Less frost and more intense heatwaves are expected in many areas.  By 2100, growing conditions on Tasmania‚Äôs east coast, for example, will look like those currently found in the Coonawarra region of South Australia ‚Äì a hotter and drier region where very diÔ¨Äerent wines are produced.  That means it may get harder to grow cool-climate styles of varieties such as chardonnay and pinot noir.  Some regions will experience more change than others. For example, the Alpine Valleys region on the western slopes of the Victorian Alps, and Pemberton in southwest Western Australia, will both become much drier and hotter, inÔ¨Çuencing the varietals that are most successfully grown.  A map showing current average growing season temperature across Australia‚Äôs 71 wine regions. Photograph: Gabi Mocatta, Rebecca Harris and Tomas Remenyi via the Conversation Other regions, such as the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, will not dry out as much. But a combination of humidity and higher temperatures will expose vineyard workers in those regions to heat risk on 40-60 days a year ‚Äì most of summer ‚Äì by 2100. That Ô¨Ågure is currently about 10 days a year, up from 5 days historically.   Grapevines are very adaptable and can be grown in a variety of conditions, such as arid parts of southern Europe. So while adaptations will be needed, our projections indicate all of Australia‚Äôs current wine regions will be suitable for producing wine out to 2100. Lessons for change Australia‚Äôs natural climate variability means winegrowers are already adept at responding to change. And there is much scope to adapt to future climate change.  In some areas, this will mean planting vines at higher altitudes, or on south-facing slopes, to avoid excessive heat. In future, many wine regions will also shift to growing diÔ¨Äerent grape varieties. Viticultural practices may change, such as training vines so leaves shade grapes from heat. Growers may increase mulching to retain soil moisture, and areas that currently practice dryland farming may need to start irrigating.  The atlas enables climate information and adaptation decisions to be shared across regions. Growers can look to their peers in regions currently experiencing the conditions they will see in future, both in Australia and overseas, to learn how wines are produced there. Industries need not die on the vine Agriculture industries such as wine-growing are not the only ones that need Ô¨Åne-scale climate information to manage their climate risk. Forestry, water management, electricity generation, insurance, tourism, emergency management authorities and Defence also need such climate modelling, speciÔ¨Åc to their operations, to better prepare for the future.  The world has already heated 1C above the pre-industrial average. Global temperatures will continue to rise for decades, even if goals under the Paris climate agreement are met.  If Earth‚Äôs temperature rise is kept below 1.5C or even 2C this century, many of the changes projected in the atlas could be minimised, or avoided altogether.  Australia‚Äôs wine industry contributes $45bn to our economy and supports about 163,000 jobs. Decisions taken now on climate resilience will dictate the future of this critical sector.

Guardian-2020-38.txt," Climate crisis: alarm at record/breaking heatwave in Siberia Unusually high temperatures in region linked to wildÔ¨Åres, oil spill and moth swarms 

Damian Carrington Environment editor Wed 17 Jun 2020 16.49 BST 

 A prolonged heatwave in Siberia is ‚Äúundoubtedly alarming‚Äù, climate scientists have said. The freak temperatures have been linked to wildÔ¨Åres, a huge oil spill and a plague of tree-eating moths.  On a global scale, the Siberian heat is helping push the world towards its hottest year on record in 2020, despite a temporary dip in carbon emissions owing to the coronavirus pandemic.  Temperatures in the polar regions are rising fastest because ocean currents carry heat towards the poles and reÔ¨Çective ice and snow is melting away.  Russian towns in the Arctic circle have recorded extraordinary temperatures, with Nizhnyaya   Pesha hitting 30C on 9 June and Khatanga, which usually has daytime temperatures of around 0C at this time of year, hitting 25C on 22 May. The previous record was 12C.  In May, surface temperatures in parts of Siberia were up to 10C above average, according to the EU‚Äôs Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). Martin Stendel, of the Danish Meteorological Institute, said the abnormal May temperatures seen in north-west Siberia would be likely to happen just once in 100,000 years without human-caused global heating.  Freja Vamborg, a senior scientist at C3S, said: ‚ÄúIt is undoubtedly an alarming sign, but not only May was unusually warm in Siberia. The whole of winter and spring had repeated periods of higher-than-average surface air temperatures.  ‚ÄúAlthough the planet as a whole is warming, this isn‚Äôt happening evenly. Western Siberia stands out as a region that shows more of a warming trend with higher variations in temperature. So to some extent large temperature anomalies are not unexpected. However, what is unusual is how long the warmer-than-average anomalies have persisted for.‚Äù  Marina Makarova, the chief meteorologist at Russia‚Äôs Rosgidromet weather service, said: ‚ÄúThis winter was the hottest in Siberia since records began 130 years ago. Average temperatures were up to 6C higher than the seasonal norms.‚Äù  Robert Rohde, the lead scientist at the Berkeley Earth project, said Russia as a whole had experienced record high temperatures in 2020, with the average from January to May 5.3C above the 1951-1980 average. ‚Äú[This is a] new record by a massive 1.9C,‚Äù he said.  In December, Russia‚Äôs president, Vladimir Putin, commented on the unusual heat: ‚ÄúSome of our cities were built north of the Arctic Circle, on the permafrost. If it begins to thaw, you can imagine what consequences it would have. It‚Äôs very serious.‚Äù  Thawing permafrost was at least partly to blame for a spill of diesel fuel in Siberia this month that led Putin to declare a state of emergency. The supports of the storage tank suddenly sank, according to its operators; green groups said ageing and poorly maintained infrastructure was also to blame.  WildÔ¨Åres have raged across hundreds of thousands of hectares of Siberia‚Äôs forests. Farmers often light Ô¨Åres in the spring to clear vegetation, and a combination of high temperatures and strong winds has caused some Ô¨Åres to burn out of control.  Swarms of the Siberian silk moth, whose larvae eat at conifer trees, have grown rapidly in the rising temperatures. ‚ÄúIn all my long career, I‚Äôve never seen moths so huge and growing so quickly,‚Äù Vladimir Soldatov, a moth expert, told AFP.  He warned of ‚Äútragic consequences‚Äù for forests, with the larvae stripping trees of their needles and making them more susceptible to Ô¨Åres. "
Guardian-2020-39.txt," Climate crisis poses serious risks for pregnancy, investigation Ô¨Ånds Air pollution and heat exposure linked to negative outcomes Researchers discover ‚Äòpretty scary health burdens‚Äô 

Emily Holden in Washington Thu 18 Jun 2020 16.00 BST 


 More than a decade of overwhelming evidence links air pollution and heat exposure with negative pregnancy outcomes in the US, according to a new review of dozens of studies.  The investigation, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, identiÔ¨Åed 57 studies since 2007 showing a signiÔ¨Åcant association between the two factors and the risk of pre-term birth, low birth weight and stillbirth.  Black mothers were particularly at risk, as were people with asthma.   The review analyzed 32m births tracked across 68 studies. Of those, 84% found air pollution and heat to be risk factors.  Human-caused climate disturbances are forcing temperatures higher, raising humidity and reducing people‚Äôs ability to cool oÔ¨Ä even at night. Climate change also makes air pollution worse. Smog from the burning of fossil fuels forms on hot days. And wildÔ¨Åres that cause smoke inhalation are exacerbated by the crisis.  ‚ÄúWhen you talk about climate, people think about severe weather, big storms or huge Ô¨Åres ‚Ä¶ but we wanted to talk about the impacts that are common and widespread and ongoing and also are rarely attributed to the climate crisis,‚Äù said Bruce Bekkar, a co-author of the study and a retired obstetrician.  ‚ÄúWe are already having generations weakened from birth. There‚Äôs just no way we can allow that to happen, and I would like to see not just mothers and their husbands and kids show up at council meetings, but I‚Äôd like to see many more health professionals involved in calling for legislation that reduces the ongoing and really pretty scary health burdens of the climate crisis.‚Äù  The Ô¨Åndings come as the Trump administration has sought to weaken pollution protections and climate eÔ¨Äorts, including by rolling back standards for car and power plant emissions. Trump‚Äôs Environmental Protection Agency has also ignored scientists‚Äô advice to enact stricter air quality rules.  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists already Ô¨Ånds climate change to be an urgent threat to women‚Äôs health, in addition to a major public health challenge. Climate change is linked with worsening cardiac disease, respiratory disease, mental health and exposure to infectious diseases. But pregnant women and developing fetuses are especially vulnerable to its eÔ¨Äects.  In the review, 19 studies linked air pollution to pre-term birth, deÔ¨Åned as a baby born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Twenty-Ô¨Åve studies linked air pollution to low birth weight. And four studies linked air pollution to stillbirth. One study found the risk of stillbirth increased 42% with high third-trimester exposure. Stillbirth is rare, so data on it is limited and it is diÔ¨Écult to draw broad conclusions about why it happens, Bekkar said.  The review considered studies about smog, also called ozone, and Ô¨Åne particle pollution.  Emerging science is increasingly linking air pollution to a range of health problems, including dementia. A new rodent-based study from the University of California, Davis, Ô¨Ånds that traÔ¨Éc- related air pollution is connected to an increased risk for changes in brain development that might cause neurodevelopmental disorders.  ‚ÄúWhat we witnessed are subtle changes,‚Äù co-author Kelley Patten said. ‚ÄúBut we are seeing these eÔ¨Äects using air pollution exposures that fall within regulatory limits.‚Äù  There were fewer studies on the eÔ¨Äect of heat on pregnancies to review, but almost all of them found it to be harmful. One study posits that the risk of early birth increased 11.6% with every 5.6C increase. Global average temperatures are already more than 1C higher than since before industrialization and are on track to rise to 3C higher.  The review conÔ¨Årmed black mothers are at greater risk for pre-term birth and low birth weight. Social determinants of health ‚Äì including poverty, long-term stress levels and access to healthcare ‚Äìdisproportionately hurt people of color.  The study concludes that ‚Äúenvironmental exposures further exacerbate that background risk and could be included among these social determinants‚Äù.  Americans increasingly understand that the climate crisis is harming human health, according to a survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.  This year, far more Americans were likely to respond that they expect heatstrokes, asthma, diseases carried by insects and pollen-related allergies to get worse as the planet warms.  For example, in 2014, 37% of Americans thought heatstrokes caused by extreme heat waves would become more common. In April, 57% did.  A growing movement among medical practitioners aims to educate patients about climate change. Bekkar hopes health professionals will share the review‚Äôs Ô¨Åndings with their patients and urge them to avoid prolonged exposures to heat and pollution.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible for everybody, but those that can should. If someone doesn‚Äôt have an air conditioner at home and is pregnant, the more time they can spend in air-conditioned places that have Ô¨Åltered air, the better for their pregnancy outcome,‚Äù Bekkar said.  But he also wants women‚Äôs advocates to demand more from elected oÔ¨Écials.  ‚ÄúReducing air pollution and Ô¨Åghting climate change is a matter of their children‚Äôs survival and health,‚Äù he said.

Guardian-2020-4.txt,"  'I don't want to be seen as a zealot': what MPs really think about the climate crisis In return for anonymity, MPs agreed to speak candidly about climate change. The diÔ¨Äerence between what they say in private and in public is striking ? and shows us how we can make climate action central to post@pandemic politics. By Rebecca Willis Main image: ‚ÄòWhere we‚Äôre sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn‚Äôt fancy our chances.‚Äô Photograph: Alexandre Rotenberg/Shutterstock 
 Thu 21 May 2020 06.00 BSTO ne day in the summer of 2017, I was sitting at a cafe table in the atrium of  Portcullis House, across the road from the Palace of Westminster. With indoor trees and a good coÔ¨Äee bar, it‚Äôs a pleasant place for politicians and their staÔ¨Ä to meet, outside their cramped oÔ¨Éces. I was there to interview an MP for a research project, hoping to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and how that shaped their work in parliament.  The MP arrived. She was young and, at least on the surface, full of conÔ¨Ådence. I explained that my interviews would be anonymised, so that she and others could talk freely about how they came to their public positions on climate. She told me she regularly speaks for her party on climate change, telling people about the need for action to tackle emissions. And yet, she said, there was a catch: lots of people in the constituency she represents have jobs in an industry responsible for huge amounts of carbon pollution.  She had two, conÔ¨Çicting, demands: she wanted urgent action on climate; and she also wanted government support to allow her local industry to continue polluting. She was simultaneously backing and opposing climate action. She was worried that someone ‚Äì maybe a constituent or the local paper ‚Äì would point out this glaring contradiction. But so far, no one had. ‚ÄúI thought I might get a bit of pushback,‚Äù she told me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had absolutely zero.‚Äù  This contradiction sums up the state of climate politics in the UK today. There is strong cross- party support for far-reaching carbon targets. In June last year, the government passed a law to strengthen these targets, committing the UK to end virtually all emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases within the next 30 years. There was next to no opposition ‚Äì in fact, Labour and the Liberal Democrats argued for an earlier phase-out date. And yet politicians are oddly reluctant to talk about how we might actually meet these targets. There is very little honest   debate about the major changes to our economy and society that will be needed if we are to meet this challenge. Like my interviewee, we‚Äôre all in favour of climate action, but we haven‚Äôt yet had an honest conversation about the power and the vested interests involved, or the choices that will have to be made if we are to achieve signiÔ¨Åcant reductions in emissions.  I have come to think of this as the dual reality of climate politics. We know that things need to change, and yet we‚Äôre embedded in our current lives and our current politics. We exist in both realities at once. Politicians make grand statements about the threat of climate change, then Ô¨Çip straight back into politics-as-usual. They Ô¨Ånd it hard to imagine, and to get others to imagine, how we might talk about and bring into being a politics with climate at its heart. It‚Äôs easier to look away.  In recent months, though, politics has changed almost beyond recognition. The coronavirus pandemic is a global crisis that alters fundamentally the way we see risks, politics, and the relationship between people and society. Like everyone else, I am not sure what the world will look like on the other side. The only certainty is that everything will be diÔ¨Äerent. If, as I‚Äôve described, politicians have until now been Ô¨Ånding it hard to contemplate radical changes to the status quo, has this barrier now fallen away?  Covid-19 is, understandably, taking up all the political and media attention there is, for now. But the need for fast, radical carbon cuts ‚Äì and a political strategy that will allow this to happen ‚Äì has not gone away. Will green investment be prioritised in the economic stimulus packages that are undoubtedly needed? Will people think diÔ¨Äerently about travel or food security? Will we emerge with a politics that focuses more on a collective approach to global challenges such as climate? Or will we fall back into desperate attempts to rekindle the old economy and the old ways? For now, there are only questions. But my research oÔ¨Äers some clues about how the recovery could be climate-proofed.  I  ‚Äôve worked with politicians for many years. In the early days of Tony Blair‚Äôs administration, I got a job with the thinktank Green Alliance. I started to look into the backgrounds of new Labour MPs, trying to Ô¨Ånd ways of connecting with them on environmental issues. We worked with the Conservatives in opposition, too, so that they could hold the government to account. Gradually, climate issues grabbed a political foothold. In 2006, the Tories went into a local election campaign with the  slogan ‚Äúvote blue, go green‚Äù, and the parties began to compete for environmentally minded voters. Then in 2009, came the Climate Change Act, a comprehensive piece of legislation setting legally binding carbon targets into UK law.  Even then, the dual reality was evident. Despite the obvious implications for economy and society, there was precious little media coverage or political debate about these new laws. I asked a senior Labour Ô¨Ågure what discussions there had been about the act as it went through parliament. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember it being one of the big issues,‚Äù she told me. All the talk had been of counter-terrorism and banning smoking in public places. For climate, in contrast, ‚ÄúI remember it going on in the background, but it wasn‚Äôt something that had high temperature‚Äù. Politicians quietly passed a radical act of parliament committing the UK to serious change ‚Äì and then carried on as normal.  That same year the act was passed, I had an idea that came to dominate my working life for a decade. Frustrated by the mismatch between the scale of the climate challenge and the   response from politicians, I wanted to make sure that the next generation of MPs were equipped with all the evidence and skills they needed to make informed decisions on climate. New MPs are lobbied from all sides, but they are oÔ¨Äered very little training or support for their new and often daunting roles. Climate science, and climate policy, is complex. How could we expect them to lead us if they didn‚Äôt understand what it was all about?  With the backing of Green Alliance and some philanthropic funders, I set up a training programme. We oÔ¨Äered parliamentary candidates and new MPs the chance to learn about the science, policy and politics of climate in a series of tailor-made workshops. We worked with small groups of around 10 politicians, all from the same party, to allow them to question and debate freely. We asked leading climate scientists to join us to answer the MPs‚Äô questions. Businesspeople came to talk through how they were thinking about the likely impact of climate change on their companies, and climate activists explained why they campaigned on the issue. At the end of each workshop, the new MPs got together with more senior politicians ‚Äì ministers or frontbenchers ‚Äì to debate what climate change meant for the outlook, values and strategy of their party.  Running these workshops was a fascinating experience. In each, there was a deÔ¨Ånite point which I came to think of as a ‚Äúpenny-drop moment‚Äù, when the participants came to realise the signiÔ¨Åcance of the climate crisis and the way it would shape our collective future. In one workshop, for example, a very eminent scientist explained to MPs how crop yields are likely to be severely aÔ¨Äected by extreme weather, a likely scenario if global average temperatures rise by 2C or more ‚Äì and that this could lead to food shortages. The response was striking. There was a silence, a collective intake of breath, a recognition of the signiÔ¨Åcance of the changes that could be upon us if we don‚Äôt act.  And then, at the end of our workshop, they walked out of the door and back to their normal lives.  We kept talking to them. We organised more brieÔ¨Ångs, and we worked with them in their constituencies to bring climate issues home. In SheÔ¨Éeld, we talked about how communities could set up and own renewable energy projects. In Nottingham, we talked about resilience to Ô¨Çoods. They were polite conversations, but all the time, that sense of dual reality was with me. If they understood the seriousness of climate change, I thought constantly, why aren‚Äôt they   MPs from various parties meeting climate activist Greta Thunberg at the Houses of Parliament in April last year. Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images I became a little bit obsessed with this question. I wanted to see whether they worried about climate, or whether they had somehow convinced themselves that it would all be OK. I decided I would ask them directly. And so, in 2015, with Lancaster University, I set up my research project in order to learn more about how MPs understood climate change, and its implications for political life. I chose to work with a small number of MPs ‚Äì 23 in all ‚Äì to get a detailed, qualitative understanding of their views. I spoke to politicians from all parties and all levels of seniority. The only group I left alone were the small, but nonetheless inÔ¨Çuential, number of known ‚Äúclimate sceptic‚Äù MPs, who publicly state that they do not accept the scientiÔ¨Åc consensus on climate change.  I oÔ¨Äered my interviewees anonymity. Many displayed a disarming frankness about their professional and personal struggles, often at odds with their appearance of breezy conÔ¨Ådence.  All the politicians I spoke to accepted the science of climate change. And yet they downplayed the consequences. They showed a reluctance to discuss how climate change would reshape human society. A newly elected MP, talking to me in the House of Commons, told me that climate ‚ÄúterriÔ¨Åed‚Äù him. ‚ÄúWhere we‚Äôre sat right now might well be underwater, right next to the Thames. I wouldn‚Äôt fancy our chances.‚Äù  I asked why, if it‚Äôs so signiÔ¨Åcant, it wasn‚Äôt discussed much in parliament. But he didn‚Äôt answer. He couldn‚Äôt, or didn‚Äôt want to, linger on this point: he steered the discussion on to electoral cycles, the health service, the economy. He was back in the manageable normality he knew, rejecting the reality of a climate-changed future that had, just a few moments before, terriÔ¨Åed him.  Over the course of the interviews, carried out between 2016 and 2018, I saw a pattern emerge. The way politicians responded to climate didn‚Äôt just depend on what they thought about the science. Instead, it became clear to me that there were two main reasons why MPs struggled with the issue: Ô¨Årst, because it didn‚Äôt Ô¨Åt easily into the culture of political life and their own identity as a parliamentarian; and second, because they worried that public support for climate action was limited, and that, as representatives, they needed to be led by their electorate.  t‚Äôs obvious that the House of Commons is an institution with a strong internal culture. Yet I was   I surprised by the extent to which the MPs I spoke to felt constrained by the social norms  of their workplace. In one conversation, my interviewee was deliciously unguarded in her opinions of her colleagues. She said that just a few of her 600 or so fellow parliamentarians took climate seriously as an issue: ‚ÄúYou might not get into double Ô¨Ågures.‚Äù She told me she saw everything through a climate lens, and was, in private, very critical of measures such as tax breaks for oil and gas exploration. And yet she felt  that she had to tread carefully: she has to Ô¨Åt in. I asked her what would happen if she tried to intervene in a budget debate, to make the case that fossil fuels should stay in the ground. She replied: ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôd just think you were a bit ‚Äòniche‚Äô, is the way I‚Äôd put it ‚Äì I say ‚Äòniche‚Äô in quotes, like a bit of a lunatic fringe.‚Äù  One former MP, who had been an active climate campaigner in parliament, said: ‚ÄúI was known as being a freak.‚Äù Another told me about how he tried to avoid being seen as a ‚Äúzealot‚Äù. These remarks were common in my conversations with politicians. Some said they avoided any mention of climate for fear that it would put an unhelpful label on them. One conÔ¨Ådent, outspoken MP who worked on energy policy told me that he did what he could to promote policies that would reduce carbon, but justiÔ¨Åed his proposals on other grounds, such as reducing fuel bills. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use climate change as the word because I think it‚Äôs just toxic,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúAs is the way in these issues which are contentious, you won‚Äôt take people with you politically.‚Äù  This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise. We know the way people think and act is conditioned by their social world. This plays far more of a role in our responses to climate change than we might imagine ‚Äì and politicians are no exception.   Sir David Attenborough addresses the Climate Assembly UK in January this year. Photograph: Richard Stonehouse/Getty Images Back in 2001, the anthropologist Kari Norgaard spent a year living in a rural Norwegian village. That winter, the weather was unusually warm. The lake didn‚Äôt freeze over, and the local ski resort had not received any snow by mid-December, having to resort to artiÔ¨Åcial snow ‚Äì something that had not happened before. Income from the ski industry was reduced, and the tradition of ice Ô¨Åshing was interrupted. When talking about this and other weather patterns, villagers mentioned climate change, and seemed to have a good level of understanding. And yet climate was not something that people factored into their daily lives.  Norgaard uncovered a paradox: people were aware of, and concerned by, climate change, but chose to ignore it. It was an unspoken collective turning away. She asked: ‚ÄúHow could the possibility of climate change be deeply disturbing and almost completely invisible ‚Äì simultaneously unimaginable and common knowledge?‚Äù She labelled this phenomenon ‚Äúsocially organised denial‚Äù. Norgaard pointed to a range of strategies people used that allowed them to continue as if climate change wasn‚Äôt happening. Some said that Norway was a relatively small country, with insigniÔ¨Åcant emissions compared to the US. There was also a widespread sense that, as a rural community, they lived simply and ‚Äúwith nature‚Äù. By telling each other these and other stories, they created the Ô¨Åction that all could continue unchanged.  Socially organised denial is alive and well in the Commons. It is exacerbated by very deliberate strategies from those who have a stake in high-carbon activities: countries, and companies, that depend on fossil fuels.  As a result, it is surprisingly diÔ¨Écult for politicians to talk openly about the need to transition   away from fossil fuels. Witness Nicola Sturgeon, leader of a progressive Scottish government that champions strong climate commitments, while also supporting continued oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. When challenged, her reply is always the same: the industry ‚Äúcannot be shut down overnight‚Äù. She‚Äôs right. But her dismissive response shies away from the science, which tells us very clearly that fossil fuels need to stay in the ground, and that we need a plan to move away from them, and create opportunities and jobs elsewhere ‚Äì not overnight, but urgently.  The toxic combination of socially organised denial and deliberate lobbying has created a problem that I‚Äôve come to think of as the ‚Äúfeelgood fallacy‚Äù. So far, climate action has focused overwhelmingly on low-carbon solutions such as developing renewable energy or oÔ¨Äering grants for electric vehicles. These are very valuable schemes, but all this positive activity masks a deeper problem. Little has been done to curb carbon-intensive activity. New coal mines are opened and new airports built with little discussion of climate impacts. If we are constantly Ô¨Ånding new ways to dig up and burn carbon, it won‚Äôt be enough just to ramp up renewable energy. Study after study shows that meeting climate goals means phasing out the extraction and use of oil, coal and gas ‚Äì yet no mainstream political party has a coherent plan to do this.  If pressed, politicians like Sturgeon could hide behind a quirk in the rules of carbon accounting. According to conventions set by the United Nations, we count the carbon where it‚Äôs burned, not where it‚Äôs taken out of the ground. This creates a strange incentive to dig more up, ship it out and let other countries take the hit on their carbon target. But what might make accounting sense for one country works directly against the global goal of reducing emissions.  Politicians, then, are constrained by the culture of political life. They also feel constrained by the electorate. There was a striking consistency in my interviews: no MP felt that their voters were putting them under particular pressure to act. As one said to me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve knocked hundreds, literally thousands of doors, and had tens of thousands of conversations with voters ‚Ä¶ and I just don‚Äôt have conversations about climate change.‚Äù  Many of these conversations took place before the school climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests began in 2018 ‚Äì these were remarkable events, after which the polls showed heightened levels of concern. Yet speaking to politicians during and after the 2019 election, I heard a lot of uncertainty about how this generalised concern might translate into support for particular climate strategies. And this matters, particularly in the UK‚Äôs constituency-based system, where MPs feel a particularly strong attachment to the local patch, described by one as ‚Äúalmost like being a parent. It‚Äôs got the sort of joys and terror associated with that type of emotional connection.‚Äù  An Extinction Rebellion climate protest in the House of Commons public gallery in April 2019. Photograph: Extinction Rebellion/EPA Exactly how a politician ‚Äúrepresents‚Äù the people is not at all straightforward. When an MP campaigns against a hospital closure, they are, in eÔ¨Äect, saying‚Äù: ‚ÄúI am campaigning for local health services and this makes me a worthy representative of this area.‚Äù This is a relatively straightforward claim. With climate ‚Äì a complex, global issue with no clear beginning or end ‚Äì it‚Äôs more complicated. Politicians have to work quite hard to make a claim for why acting on climate is in the best interests of their electorate.  They might do this through pointing out that a global problem such as climate change requires everyone to do their bit. But this claim is often ignored, because people are understandably caught up with their daily lives and struggles, or feel powerless, cynical or overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge. Some politicians point out the economic or social beneÔ¨Åts of climate action, such as jobs in renewable energy. As one told me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to use an economic argument if that means more people will come on side.‚Äù Another told me about proposals for a new road in his constituency, which he opposed. If he had used a climate argument, he said, ‚Äúthere would have been a rolling of eyes and saying: ‚ÄòOh, here he goes again.‚Äô‚Äù Instead, he made the case on economic grounds, saying that investment in public transport was a better option.  There‚Äôs a danger in dampening down the message in this way. If politicians don‚Äôt speak out, people don‚Äôt feel a sense of urgency. They are less likely to support climate action if they don‚Äôt see their politicians leading the way, or oÔ¨Äering up a strategy that is as serious as the problem it is designed to address. Climate politics becomes a silent standoÔ¨Ä, with neither citizens nor representatives willing to make the Ô¨Årst move.  But this standoÔ¨Ä contains the seeds of a solution. If politicians have the conÔ¨Ådence to lead, to see climate action as a social contract between citizens and politicians, this is likely to lead to greater support. What could a conÔ¨Ådent climate politics look like?  n this new world of the coronavirus pandemic, this question is all the more urgent. Some have cheered the unintentional environmental beneÔ¨Åts of lockdown. It‚Äôs certainly true that the air is cleaner, the streets quieter. We can hear the birdsong. Carbon emissions have taken a dive, too. But this is in no way a model for climate strategy. Experience from China has shown that emissions bounce back pretty quickly once lockdown restrictions are eased. But most importantly, lockdown has imposed  I   untold misery and sacriÔ¨Åce. This is emphatically not what is needed for climate action. Instead, politicians need to talk about a purposeful transition: not the juddering halt of lockdown, but the managed transformation of our economy, so wellbeing increases as carbon falls.  What the pandemic does provide, though, is the possibility of change. The government has done things in the last few weeks that no one thought possible: paying the wages of millions of private-sector workers; shoring up company Ô¨Ånances; involving itself in the lives of individuals in ways that would previously have caused the hackles of even the most radical of politicians to rise. Fundamentally, we are rethinking the relationship between state and citizen. As citizens, we have realised that we need the state to keep us safe from crises, be they immediate, like Covid-19, or longer term, like climate change. Politicians, for their part, have realised that people can rise to the challenge, if they understand what they need to do and why.  Once the trauma of lockdown eases, the rebuilding begins. This is perhaps the point at which the risks and opportunities for climate are at their most stark. The government could choose to align its recovery strategy with its climate strategy, or, in the rush to prop up an ailing economy, it could do the opposite ‚Äì handing money out in such a way as to safeguard the high- carbon economy.  Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigning for a Green New Deal in Washington DC in November 2019. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPA If we are to make the right choice here, as a society, the essential Ô¨Årst step is a simple one: speaking out. Politicians, and others, need to speak openly and with unÔ¨Çinching honesty about the signiÔ¨Åcance of climate change. As my conversations with MPs have shown, this is a surprisingly diÔ¨Écult thing to do. The left has made a start, with its idea of a Green New Deal. In the US, politicians led by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ed Markey put forward a plan aiming for net-zero emissions and 100% renewable energy, including job creation in manufacturing, economic justice and even universal healthcare.  Following Covid-19, what the Green New Deal now oÔ¨Äers is, essentially, a green route to recovery. The plan has many critics, but compared to the low-key approach favoured by UK politicians, it has the advantage of being idealistic, bold and honest. It tells a story about climate action that aims to connect with voters. Elements of this approach could be seen in Labour‚Äôs 2019 election oÔ¨Äer. On the political right, though, despite support for ambitious  targets, there is a distinct lack of a clear story on climate.  A second step is to open up a more meaningful dialogue between citizens and politicians. One practical way is through processes like citizens‚Äô assemblies. Early this year, Climate Assembly UK got underway. This gathering of 110 representative UK citizens, commissioned by six select committees, has heard evidence from experts on climate science and responses, has discussed and deliberated on possible solutions, and will shortly report its Ô¨Åndings back to parliament.  Third, improving conversations on climate change almost certainly requires more of an appeal to the heart as well as the head. The language of cost-beneÔ¨Åt analysis and gross domestic product has its uses, but its appeal is limited, and it accentuates the divide between experts and public, rather than breaking it down. Yet this is the language that politicians have used until now. There are parallels here with the Brexit debate. Remain politicians thought they could win by putting forward a clear-headed case for economic stability, but they left the emotion out of it. In truth, we need both. People care about family, fairness and decency, and an enabling state, looking out for the interests of its citizens. This is exactly how climate action could be framed. Following the coronavirus shutdown, there‚Äôs an opportunity to involve people in shaping the way we rebuild our societies and economies, to increase resilience against future threats ‚Äì not least, those arising from climate change.  Every politician is reassured if they know there is support for their proposals. They can‚Äôt govern in a vacuum. We can‚Äôt aÔ¨Äord to be silent now, when politicians are debating our future. Street protests are out of the question at the moment, but there are many ways to make your voice heard. Talk to MPs and local councillors about your views on climate. Get in touch by phone or email. Ask them what they think; make it a dialogue. From a politician‚Äôs point of view, showing your strength of feeling as a citizen, as someone who doesn‚Äôt normally kick up a fuss, is immensely powerful.  Given a meaningful opportunity to have their say, most people would support action in the face of the climate breakdown that is unfolding in front of us. But our democracies, in their current form, are just not oÔ¨Äering people that choice. Politicians and citizens, if they take each other seriously, can turn this around.   "
Guardian-2020-40.txt," World has six months to avert climate crisis, says energy expert International Energy Agency chief warns of need to prevent post9lockdown surge in emissions Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Thu 18 Jun 2020 05.00 BST  

The world has only six months in which to change the course of the climate crisis and prevent a post-lockdown rebound in greenhouse gas emissions that would overwhelm eÔ¨Äorts to stave oÔ¨Ä climate catastrophe, one of the world‚Äôs foremost energy experts has warned.  ‚ÄúThis year is the last time we have, if we are not to see a carbon rebound,‚Äù said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.  Governments are planning to spend $9tn (¬£7.2tn) globally in the next few months on rescuing their economies from the coronavirus crisis, the IEA has calculated. The stimulus packages created this year will determine the shape of the global economy for the next three years,  according to Birol, and within that time emissions must start to fall sharply and permanently, or climate targets will be out of reach.  ‚ÄúThe next three years will determine the course of the next 30 years and beyond,‚Äù Birol told the Guardian. ‚ÄúIf we do not [take action] we will surely see a rebound in emissions. If emissions rebound, it is very diÔ¨Écult to see how they will be brought down in future. This is why we are urging governments to have sustainable recovery packages.‚Äù  Carbon dioxide emissions plunged by a global average of 17% in April, compared with last year, but have since surged again to within about 5% of last year‚Äôs levels.  In a report published on Thursday, the IEA ‚Äì the world‚Äôs gold standard for energy analysis - set out the Ô¨Årst global blueprint for a green recovery, focusing on reforms to energy generation and consumption. Wind and solar power should be a top focus, the report advised, alongside energy eÔ¨Éciency improvements to buildings and industries, and the modernisation of electricity grids.  Creating jobs must be the priority for countries where millions have been thrown into unemployment by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns. The IEA‚Äôs analysis shows that targeting green jobs ‚Äì such as retroÔ¨Åtting buildings to make them more energy eÔ¨Écient, putting up solar panels and constructing wind farms ‚Äì is more eÔ¨Äective than pouring money into the high-carbon economy.  Sam Fankhauser, executive director of the Grantham Research Institute on climate change at the London School of Economics, who was not involved in the report, said: ‚ÄúBuilding eÔ¨Éciency ticks all the recovery boxes ‚Äì shovel-ready, employment intensive, a high economic multiplier, and is absolutely key for zero carbon [as it is] a hard-to-treat sector, and has big social beneÔ¨Åts, in the form of lower fuel bills.‚Äù  He warned that governments must not try to ‚Äúpreserve existing jobs in formaldehyde‚Äù through furlough schemes and other eÔ¨Äorts to keep people in employment, but provide retraining and other opportunities for people to ‚Äúmove into the jobs of the future‚Äù.  Calls for a green recovery globally have now come from experts, economists, health professionals, educators, climate campaigners and politicians. While some governments are poised to take action ‚Äì for instance, the EU has pledged to make its European green deal the centrepiece of its recovery ‚Äì the money spent so far has tended to prop up the high-carbon economy.  At least $33bn has been directed towards airlines, with few or no green strings attached, according to the campaigning group Transport and Environment. According to analyst company Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more than half a trillion dollars worldwide ‚Äì $509bn ‚Äì is to be poured into high-carbon industries, with no conditions to ensure they reduce their carbon output.  Only about $12.3bn of the spending announced by late last month was set to go towards low- carbon industries, and a further $18.5bn into high-carbon industries provided they achieve climate targets.  In the Ô¨Årst tranches of spending, governments ‚Äúhad an excuse‚Äù for failing to funnel money to   carbon-cutting industries, said Birol, because they were reacting to a sudden and unexpected crisis. ‚ÄúThe Ô¨Årst recovery plans were more aimed at creating Ô¨Årewalls round the economy,‚Äù he explained.  But governments were still targeting high-carbon investment, Birol warned. He pointed to IEA research showing that by the end of May the amount invested in coal-Ô¨Åred power plants in Asia had accelerated compared with last year. ‚ÄúThere are already signs of a rebound [in emissions],‚Äù he said.  Climate campaigners called on ministers to heed the IEA report and set out green recovery plans. Jamie Peters, campaigns director at Friends of the Earth, said: ‚ÄúA post-Covid world must be a fair one. It will only be equitable if the government prioritises health, wellbeing and opportunity for all parts of society. As if the case was not compelling enough in a dangerously heating planet, it is even more urgent post-Covid.‚Äù  Putting the IEA‚Äôs recommendations into action would boost the economy, added Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK. ‚ÄúGovernment putting money behind sustainable solutions really is an economic no-brainer. It can see us build a recovery that both tackles the climate emergency and improves people‚Äôs lives through cleaner air and lower bills.‚Äù  Investors were also keen to put private sector money into a green recovery, alongside government stimulus spending, said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change, representing funds and asset managers with $26tn in assets. ‚ÄúThe IEA has shown [a green recovery] is not only desirable, but economically astute. Investors are fully committed to playing their part in this process.‚Äù "
Guardian-2020-41.txt," Climate crisis threatens future of global sport, says report Study says heatwaves, Ô¨Åres and Ô¨Çoods, and rising sea levels pose major threat over coming years Matthew Taylor Environment correspondent Sat 20 Jun 2020 00.01 BST 

 The rapidly accelerating climate crisis threatens the future of major sports events around the world, according to a report that also says the global sporting industry is failing to tackle its own emissions.  The study found that in the coming years nearly all sports ‚Äì from cricket to American football, tennis to athletics, surÔ¨Ång to golf ‚Äì will face serious disruption from heatwaves, Ô¨Åres, Ô¨Çoods and rising sea levels.  It also estimated that globally, sports‚Äô own carbon emissions are equal to that of a medium- sized country, adding that sport administrators and stars had an important role to play in global   eÔ¨Äorts to tackle climate breakdown.  Andrew Simms, the co-ordinator of the Rapid Transition Alliance, which published the report, said: ‚ÄúSport provides some of society‚Äôs most inÔ¨Çuential role models. If sport can change how it operates to act at the speed and scale necessary to halt the climate emergency, others will follow.‚Äù  The report found that in the next three decades a quarter of English league football grounds will be at risk of Ô¨Çooding every season, one in three British golf courses will be damaged by rising sea levels and the Winter Olympics will be increasingly diÔ¨Écult to stage because of rising temperatures.  It also highlighted how the climate crisis was already having an impact on major sports events. Last year‚Äôs Rugby World Cup was hit by a huge typhoon, while this year‚Äôs Australian Tennis open was disrupted by toxic smoke from the country‚Äôs devastating bush Ô¨Åres.  Commenting on the Ô¨Åndings, Rosie Rogers, the head of Green Recovery at Greenpeace, said: ‚ÄúFrom Ô¨Çooding to sweltering heat, even sport can‚Äôt escape the climate emergency. But it‚Äôs also clear that the sector is playing a part in fuelling it.‚Äù  As it re-emerged from the Covid-19 lockdown the industry had a chance to think about how to do things diÔ¨Äerently and what a ‚Äúsporting green recovery‚Äù would look like, she said.  ‚ÄúWhether that‚Äôs switching planes for trains, ditching single use plastic or cutting fossil fuel sponsorship, sport can show it‚Äôs on the winning side as we take the climate crisis head on.‚Äù  The study found that of hundreds of governing bodies, only Ô¨Åve have a zero carbon pledge, with World Athletics, Formula 1 motor racing and the All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs Wimbledon, having pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030.  The report‚Äôs author, David Goldblatt, said sport should be doing much more.  ‚ÄúFew human practices oÔ¨Äer such an extraordinarily large, global, and socially diverse constituency as those playing and following sport. Making a carbon-zero world the common sense priority of the sports world would make a huge contribution to making it the common sense priority of all politics.‚Äù  Jens Sejer Andersen, the international director of Play the Game, the global organisation for good governance in sport, said the report underlined the need for the industry to take a lead in the Ô¨Åght against climate breakdown.  ‚ÄúWe must be ready to revise the ways we organise our events and tasks ‚Ä¶ But we won‚Äôt stop here. Climate action must be an essential part of sports governance.‚Äù  He said the climate crisis would be a central topic at the organisation‚Äôs next international conference in 2021.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do our best to engage our global network of reporters, sport leaders, athletes and oÔ¨Écials in raising their game.‚Äù   "
Guardian-2020-42.txt," Britain still failing on climate crisis, warn advisers Committee urges that companies must meet green standards to qualify for Covid;19 corporate bailouts Robin McKie Sun 21 Jun 2020 08.23 BST  

Ministers are bracing themselves for a powerful new rebuke from the government‚Äôs own advisers over the nation‚Äôs inadequate response to the climate crisis. In its annual progress report, to be published on Thursday, the Committee on Climate Change will lambast continuing failures by the government to tackle the issues of overheating homes, Ô¨Çash Ô¨Çoods, loss of biodiversity and the other threats posed as our planet continues to overheat dangerously.  Last year, the committee complained that no areas of the UK‚Äôs response to the climate crisis were being tackled properly. ‚ÄúThe whole thing is run by the government like a Dad‚Äôs Army,‚Äù said the committee‚Äôs chairman, Lord Deben.  And this year‚Äôs report will bring no happier news for ministers. Instead, the committee will   highlight the fact that virtually no progress has been made over the past year to tackle the misery that will be brought by climate change. And although global carbon emissions have decreased during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, many scientists warn that any beneÔ¨Åts for the climate are likely to be temporary.  As a result, the committee is expected to make a number of key proposals to try to get Britain back on track and moving towards its commitment to bring all greenhouse gas emissions in the UK to net zero by 2050. It will recommend:  Enforcing strict environmental conditions to any corporate bailouts made during the pandemic crisis, in line with standards imposed in France, Germany and Canada Making major improvements in broadband provision and cycling routes to ensure the nation avoids a surge in car use as people return to work while trying to avoid using buses and trains Consideration of a new tax on fossil fuels Introducing new policies on energy eÔ¨Éciency in buildings, planting more trees, and protecting peatland The need to take action over climate change has become increasingly urgent, scientists have warned over the past few weeks. Despite the recent dip in carbon emissions, last month was the warmest May on record, according to Nasa, and scientists say 2020 could be the warmest year on record.  Siberia is now sweltering in a heatwave and its permafrost is in danger of melting, releasing plumes of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And in the Antarctic, researchers have reported the spread of algal blooms triggered by rising temperatures.  Petrol and diesel vehicles will have to be phased out if emissions targets are to be met. Photograph: Robert Harding/Rex No part of the globe is going to escape the crisis, researchers insist, and the UK must be prepared to tackle the inevitable threats of rising sea levels, coast erosion, Ô¨Çooding, heatwaves and epidemics of diseases, such as malaria. At the same time, it needs to rapidly curtail its reliance on fossil fuels to meet global emission pledges.  ‚ÄúThe UK is due to host the critical United Nations climate change summit next year, but its credibility as a climate leader is now under threat,‚Äù said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. ‚ÄúSuccessive committee reports have warned we are not on course to meet our carbon budgets which set future emissions targets. The   government needs to use the economic recovery packages from Covid-19 to put us back on track.‚Äù  Petrol and diesel vehicles need to be phased out, moves begun to eliminate gas central heating, and work started on adapting homes and workplaces against Ô¨Çooding and heatwaves. ‚ÄúThese will all require massive investments, but they will also create new jobs and economic growth,‚Äù added Ward.

Guardian-2020-43.txt," Let's end Australia's climate and energy warfare, Albanese tells Morrison Labor leader sets out policy pivot in challenge to PM to display genuine bipartisanship 

Katharine Murphy Political editor Tue 23 Jun 2020 18.30 BST

  Anthony Albanese has dumped Labor‚Äôs former backing of Malcolm Turnbull‚Äôs national energy guarantee and opened the door for taxpayer support for carbon capture and storage technologies, in a major overture to Scott Morrison to reach bipartisan agreement on energy policy.  The Labor leader will use a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday to set out his guiding principles for an agreement to end more than a decade of political warfare on climate and energy policy.  In a letter sent to the prime minister before Wednesday‚Äôs address, Albanese says Labor is open minded on a new policy mechanism to guide investment as long as the emissions reduction  targets are scalable ‚Äì meaning a future government of either persuasion could dial them up, or wind them back ‚Äì and as long as the mechanism isn‚Äôt the Coalition‚Äôs existing emissions reduction fund.  The Labor leader has also told the prime minister the opposition is open to CCS, which remains a controversial technology with many environmentalists, as long as projects are not funded through the national renewable energy bodies the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.  But Albanese says Labor will not support domestic nuclear power. The Morrison government has Ô¨Çagged examining ‚Äúemerging nuclear technologies‚Äù as part of Australia‚Äôs energy mix in the future in a new discussion paper kicking oÔ¨Ä the process of developing its much-vaunted technology investment roadmap.  While Albanese has signalled that Labor cannot accept the Coalition‚Äôs emissions reduction fund ‚Äì the heavily criticised policy that replaced Labor‚Äôs carbon price in 2013 ‚Äì as the bipartisan mechanism, he says a future Labor government would not seek to unwind contracts entered during this parliament, including any contracts involving support for CCS.  Labor‚Äôs new position reÔ¨Çects an attempt by Albanese to balance divided views within his own ranks. Some in the right faction believe Labor‚Äôs commitment to climate policy ambition has cost the party electorally, and Labor will not win the next federal election unless it reconnects with workers in carbon-intensive industries in New South Wales and Queensland.  But it is also an eÔ¨Äort to challenge Morrison to use the post Covid-19 recovery to display genuine bipartisanship in the service of Ô¨Åxing a problem that has festered in Australia for more than a decade. Albanese‚Äôs repositioning also comes as the major parties accelerate their campaigns in the marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, where climate change is an issue, with the byelection due on 4 July.  The Coalition has successfully weaponised climate change against Labor at every federal election since 2013, but the government is also under pressure from business groups and major institutions to end the policy uncertainty that is undermining investment in critical infrastructure.  Facing sustained pressure to adopt a 2050 target of net zero emissions, pressure it is continuing to resist despite signing the Paris agreement which has that ambition embedded within it, the government plans instead to develop the technology roadmap as the cornerstone of the Coalition‚Äôs mid-century emissions reduction strategy.  Given that the government has launched the roadmap, Labor is taking the opportunity to launch its own pivot on energy policy, and attempt to open the door to a new round of discussions.  A leading Australian business organisation, the AiGroup, has called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory ‚Äì recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äì to be addressed together, saying that would boost economic growth and put the country on a Ô¨Årm long-term footing. A number of other community and investor groups have expressed similar sentiments.  In his letter to Morrison, Albanese says Australia has lacked a national energy policy since the renewable energy target was met in late 2019 and Morrison dumped Turnbull‚Äôs Neg shortly after taking the prime ministership. Labor adopted the Neg as policy during the last parliament in an eÔ¨Äort to see whether any common ground could be reached between the major parties, but that proved fruitless.  The letter says the lack of a settled mechanism has increased investor uncertainty ‚Äúand new investment in renewable energy generation fell by 50% in 2019, according to the Reserve Bank of Australia and industry analysis‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWe have an opportunity to move past partisan approaches to energy policy, to draw on the community‚Äôs clear desire for more bipartisan approaches to diÔ¨Écult policy areas, and to Ô¨Ånally deliver an enduring, eÔ¨Äective and bipartisan energy policy for Australia,‚Äù Albanese writes.  Labor has adopted a net zero target by 2050 as policy post-election, but it remains unclear what interim emissions reduction targets will be. "
Guardian-2020-44.txt,"  Labor's climate wars truce is cause for hope, as long as it doesn't lead to bipartisan inaction Frank Jotzo Taken at face value, Anthony Albanese‚Äôs intervention throws a positive challenge to the government  Wed 24 Jun 2020 08.59 BST 

 Australia has been in the climate wars since late 2009 when Tony Abbott rolled  Malcolm Turnbull and made the pursuit of no climate policy a hallmark of Australian conservative politics. It has been an all-out battle at many points, simmering conÔ¨Çict at others. Investor conÔ¨Ådence has been one of the casualties.  Now it appears that the Labor party is oÔ¨Äering a truce. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, oÔ¨Äered the PM to ‚Äúagree on an energy investment framework that will deliver the modernisation of our energy system‚Äù. Labor wants a ‚ÄúÔ¨Çexible and enduring‚Äù policy model that can adapt to diÔ¨Äerent emissions targets and says it is agnostic about which policy instrument   would deliver this.  The focus on investment in clean energy is absolutely right. Australia‚Äôs energy and industrial system is crying out for modernisation. The zero emissions options are right there, and they are aÔ¨Äordable. In fact, renewable energy is becoming cheap enough for the tantalising prospect of exporting zero-emissions fuels and metals.  The government‚Äôs discussion paper towards its Technology Roadmap acknowledges much of this. But will government actually support the large-scale deployment of clean technologies? Will it pump much more money into its clean energy agencies ARENA and CEFC, and properly fund the universities for research? Crucially, will it set proper incentives and regulations for industry to invest?  The Coalition government seems a long way from putting any policy in place to actually accelerate clean investment, and thereby push out coal plants and other fossil-fuel-using equipment. Its new mantra is ‚Äútechnology not taxes‚Äù, and plans announced so far are only to drip-feed some subsidies to industry.  The zero-carbon transition means investment of hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars, and for this to happen we need a clear and lasting direction in national policy.  For Labor to get the Coalition to lift its oÔ¨Äerings, the oÔ¨Äer for a truce would need to come from a position of strength. A majority of the population wants action on climate change, but only just over half say they think Australia is not doing enough. The bushÔ¨Åres put the spotlight on climate change, but the big issue now is of course Covid and its aftermath. Australian voters are easily scared of the presumed costs of acting on climate change at the best of times. The recession will make it a lot harder to win any argument on environmental policy.  And yet climate change remains the true national challenge. Not just in terms of dealing with the increasingly dire impacts, but also for creating an economy that is competitive in a world that will shift to a lower carbon model. Australia‚Äôs long-term economic prosperity will not lie in coal and gas. It could in part lie in renewable power, zero-emissions fuels and metals, and clean and green agriculture.  Albanese called for ‚Äúrespect for science‚Äù. That respect is what made the successful Covid response possible, and it would be the perfect foundation for bipartisanship on climate change.  In a political system like Australia‚Äôs, basic agreement between the two major parties is needed to make lasting progress on the big issues. The opening of the economy in the 1980s is one example, immigration another.  Countries that have made big progress on climate policy typically have that broad political consensus. In the UK and Germany, it is accepted across the political mainstream that the goal is net zero emissions, and that governments should and will push in that direction. The contest is about how quickly to go not in which direction, the ‚Äúhow‚Äù not the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù.  Bipartisanship like that is what Australia needs on climate policy. The economic stakes and industry interests are huge and so there cannot be lasting progress when climate change is fodder for party politics. If we had agreement on cornerstones of goals and policy, federal governments could Ô¨Ånally help position our economy for the technologies and export   industries of the future. It would lessen the risk that we will get stuck at an economic dead end. And it would allow us to play a constructive role in global eÔ¨Äorts on climate change.  A gloomier interpretation is that Labor simply wants to shut down the issue and Ô¨Åght the next election on the question of the economy and the social fallout from Covid alone. It would Ô¨Åt in with the global shift towards isolationism and economic nationalism. There are those in the Labor party who see support from blue collar constituents shrinking away and who see better electoral prospects singing the praises of fossil fuels. If the truce oÔ¨Äered is their doing then it is really a surrender.  A bipartisanship of inaction on climate would be a nightmare for the prosperity of the country, and for our contribution to solving the climate crisis.  Taken at face value though, Albanese‚Äôs intervention throws a positive challenge to the government. Here‚Äôs hoping.  Frank Jotzo is a professor at ANU Crawford School of Public Policy.

Guardian-2020-45.txt," UK weather: temperatures near 33C on hottest day of year so far Mercury hits 32.6C in Heathrow and could reach 34C in south of England on Thursday Jessica Murray Wed 24 Jun 2020 17.48 BST  

Britain has been basking in sunshine on the hottest day of the year so far, the Met OÔ¨Éce has conÔ¨Årmed, as the temperature peaked at 32.6C (90.6F) on Wednesday.  That high was recorded in Heathrow, west London, and the mercury was forecast to hit 33C in other parts of the UK, although it remained cooler in northern Scotland.  The Met OÔ¨Éce said temperatures were unlikely to fall any lower than the high teens overnight and could rise to 34C in the south of England on Thursday.  The heatwave, which began on Tuesday and has led to much of the country sweltering in temperatures averaging in the high 20s or low 30s, is expected to continue until Friday.   Weather warnings for thunderstorms across much of the UK have been issued for Friday and Saturday.  Many people have been Ô¨Çocking to parks and the seaside this week, with the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, just one of many packed with sunbathers and swimmers.  The Met OÔ¨Éce‚Äôs chief meteorologist, Dan Suri, said: ‚ÄúWe quite often see warm southerly air from the continent bringing these high temperatures to the UK in summer, however this week the air across the UK has arrived from the Atlantic.  People play basketball in Brockwell Park, south London, on Wednesday. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images ‚ÄúThis Atlantic air will descend and warm up as it moves across the UK and this, in combination with clear skies and strong late-June sunshine, is why we are seeing temperatures rise.‚Äù  The highest UK temperature recorded in June was 35.6C, set at MayÔ¨Çower Park in Southampton, on 28 June 1976.  While many have been enjoying the sunshine this week, others will be alarmed at the soaring temperatures amid reports of global heating in other parts of the world.  The Met OÔ¨Éce said parts of northern Eurasia had been experiencing extremely high temperatures this year because of a combination of climate change and extreme climate variability.  In May, surface temperatures in parts of Siberia were 10C above average amid a prolonged heatwave that climate scientists described as ‚Äúundoubtedly alarming‚Äù.  The Russian town of Khatanga, which usually has daytime temperatures of about 0C at this time of year, hit 25C on 22 May.  There has been speculation that 2020 could become the hottest year on record, but Prof Adam Scaife, the head of the Met OÔ¨Éce‚Äôs long-range prediction, said that was unlikely. ‚ÄúWe are likely to have seen the most extreme global temperatures already this year,‚Äù he said.

Guardian-2020-46.txt,"  We must not miss this glorious chance to address the climate and biodiversity crises Jonathon Porritt If the government plots a green recovery from coronavirus, the beneÔ¨Åts are endless. If it doesn‚Äôt, we‚Äôre screwed  Wed 24 Jun 2020 11.43 BST 

 Trillions of dollars will be invested by governments in reviving their economies over  the next two or three years. If those dollars are well spent, ensuring low-carbon, nature-restoring prosperity, we have a real chance of avoiding runaway climate change and ecosystem collapse. If they‚Äôre spent on taking us back to pre-coronavirus days, we‚Äôre screwed. The climate‚Äôs screwed. The planet‚Äôs screwed. And all future  generations are screwed. It‚Äôs as simple ‚Äì and as binary ‚Äì as that.  This year was meant to be the year of major breakthroughs in addressing the climate   emergency and the biodiversity crisis. It will be neither. It will live in the minds of most people as the Year of Covid-19. And rightly so. But those twin emergencies of climate and collapsing ecosystems haven‚Äôt gone away while we‚Äôve been straining humankind‚Äôs every sinew to mitigate the impacts of the deadliest public health threat in 100 years.  Yet what made the climate emergency and the biodiversity crisis so urgent before Covid-19 guarantees that they will be even more daunting and even more disruptive at the end of this traumatic year ‚Äì with a whole 12 months lost in terms of political engagement and leadership.  Ignore all the over-excited coverage there will no doubt be at the end of this year celebrating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 10%, towns and cities temporarily purged of the horror of toxic air quality (killing far more people, by the way, every year, than Covid-19 will), and nature back in our lives through the magic of birdsong and wild creatures returning to our denatured urban landscapes. Look on all that as a short-lived respite, a beautiful but evanescent manifestation of how things could be, for citizens the world over. All those silver linings will rapidly disappear unless we start doing things very diÔ¨Äerently.  A mighty choir of voices (from Prince Charles and Greenpeace to countless multinationals and academics) are now singing from the rooftops to remind our politicians that we have a glorious opportunity to bring forward lasting improvements that would have been unimaginable even six months ago. Their mandate now is crystal clear: restore purchasing power; create new jobs; prioritise the least well-oÔ¨Ä ‚Äì and do all of that in ways that simultaneously make it possible for us to deliver climate stability and a thriving planet.  So is there any indication that the UK government is thinking in those terms? The short answer is ‚Äúpossibly‚Äù. Beyond the standard waÔ¨Ñe from the prime minister (‚ÄúWe owe it to future generations to ‚Äòbuild back better‚Äô and base our recovery on solid foundations, including a fairer, greener and more resilient global economy‚Äù), there have been much stronger declarations of intent from both the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Treasury, with speciÔ¨Åc talk of a ‚Äúgreen industrial revolution‚Äù to create tens of thousands of new jobs.  Even the Department for Transport has been getting in on the act, announcing plans for 2,500 electric charging points along motorways and A-roads by 2030, as well as a ¬£250m active travel fund to support the development of pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cycle- and bus- only corridors ‚Äì a down-payment, apparently, on a much bigger programme under consideration.  But all this is very small beer indeed compared with the plans of the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to spend up to ¬£27bn over the next Ô¨Åve years to expand Britain‚Äôs road network ‚Äì locking us into decades of carbon-intensive car dependency at precisely the time when every company in the country is developing post-coronavirus work and travel planning, speciÔ¨Åcally to reduce car use and commuting, doubling down on more Ô¨Çexible, tech-enabled ways of working.  So just Ô¨Çip it, Rishi! Transport is the UK‚Äôs biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Hang on to that scale of ambition by making the ¬£27bn available to our cities and towns to invest in cycle lanes, better pedestrian facilities and improved public transport ‚Äì as cities such as Bristol and London are already starting to do. This will deliver jobs at the local level (especially in many of our northern cities, which one assumes Boris Johnson hasn‚Äôt yet entirely forgotten   about), cleaner air and improved health (reducing the burden on the NHS) and potentially massive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 10 years.  Similar, massive beneÔ¨Åts are available if the government chooses to invest in a nationwide housing retroÔ¨Åt programme, a pre-existing commitment that has come and gone on several occasions, simply because no previous government ever put its money where its cynically gabby mouth was. As the Green New Deal group has shown, as well as the government‚Äôs own Infrastructure Commission, an ambitious retroÔ¨Åt programme means jobs in every constituency (many of them available to young people staring out on a blighted, jobless post-coronavirus world), a huge uptake in construction skills and trades, a rapid reduction in the kind of fuel poverty that has blighted the lives of tens of millions of people (simultaneously costing the NHS billions every year), with signiÔ¨Åcant reductions in greenhouse gas emission by the end of the decade.  Once the Treasury opens its mind to the potential of a far-reaching Green New Deal, we should also be borrowing unashamedly from President Roosevelt‚Äôs original New Deal back in the 1930s by creating a 21st-century equivalent of his Conservation Corps to help restore this nation‚Äôs desperately degraded environment. It‚Äôs only six months since the major political parties were trying to out-green each other by committing to massive tree-planting programmes in their election manifestos. Since then, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural AÔ¨Äairs has pretty much sat on its hands.  Nothing is ever quite as ‚Äúshovel-ready‚Äù as advocates would have us believe, but local transport solutions, housing retroÔ¨Åts and nature-climate solutions could all be brought forward, at speed and at scale, in ways that would be hugely popular with citizens across the country. There is now not one good reason why this government shouldn‚Äôt soon be announcing one of the most ambitious rescue packages anywhere in the world.  ‚Ä¢ Jonathon Porritt is an environmentalist and author.

Guardian-2020-47.txt," Reserve Bank warns of 25% GDP loss by 2100 unless action taken on climate change Australia‚Äôs central bank joins 60 others, including the Bank of England, to warn of climate risk to the economy and Ô¨Ånancial sector Adam Morton Environment editor Thu 25 Jun 2020 18.30 BST 

 More than 60 central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England, have warned that global GDP could fall 25% below the expected level by 2100 if the world does not act to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.  They suggested if the world acted to limit emissions to net zero by about 2070, giving a 67% chance of limiting global heating to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the impact of the climate crisis on global GDP could be about 4%.  The estimates are included in scenarios published by the Network for Greening the Financial System, a collection of 66 central banks and supervisors and 13 observer institutions. Described   as the Ô¨Årst of their kind, the scenarios are designed to guide bankers and Ô¨Ånancial regulators, including Australia‚Äôs Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), in assessing the climate risks to the economy and Ô¨Ånancial sector.  Their launch follows warnings from Ô¨Ånancial regulators of the economic threat posed by the climate crisis. Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney last year warned it was possible the transition needed to tackle the climate crisis could result in an abrupt Ô¨Ånancial collapse, and the risk of collapse would grow the longer action was delayed. In Australia, APRA board member, GeoÔ¨Ä Summerhayes, warned climate change posed a material risk to the entire Ô¨Ånancial system and urged companies to start adapting.  In a statement released overnight Wednesday, the Network for Greening the Financial System said the changes to the climate were unprecedented. Frank Elderson, the chair of the network and an executive board member of De Nederlandsche in the Netherlands, summarised: ‚ÄúClimate change leads to Ô¨Ånancial risks and therefore remains a vital issue for central banks and supervisors to address.‚Äù  The network said understanding the Ô¨Ånancial risks and economic costs required it to examine scenarios stretching decades ahead.  It considered three possibilities: under its orderly scenario, climate policies would be introduced soon and gradually tightened, limiting the risk of physical damage ‚Äì including extreme weather events ‚Äì and the impact of the transition to low emissions. It would be expected to lead to a ‚Äúrelatively small‚Äù economic impact of about 4% of global GDP by 2100.  Under the ‚Äúdisorderly‚Äù scenario, climate policies would not be not introduced until 2030, and the emissions reductions needed would be more abrupt than in an orderly world. It was estimated to have a signiÔ¨Åcantly larger economic impact, with nearly a 10% reduction in global GDP below what would otherwise be expected.  In the third scenario, described as a ‚Äúhot house‚Äù world, action to deal with the climate crisis would be limited to current policies only. Countries‚Äô international commitments would not be not met and physical risks would be greatly increased as global emissions kept rising until 2080, leading to more than 3C of warming.  The network estimated the physical damage caused under this scenario could wipe out up to a quarter of annual global GDP by the end of the century. But it warned this could be an underestimate as it was not possible to adequately account for all risks, particularly from high impact events such as signiÔ¨Åcant sea-level rise, extreme weather and societal changes that could be triggered by climate-related migration and conÔ¨Çict.  ‚ÄúAs a result, damages in this scenario will be larger than models suggest, particularly in regions with lower resilience and capacity for adaptation,‚Äù the network said.  Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, said the scenarios clearly demonstrated that climate change was a systemic economic threat that would undercut prosperity and job security. She said a low-emissions transition was inevitable, and would be cheaper and much less damaging if there was early action. In Australia, it would require a stable long-term policy framework and a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.   ‚ÄúThe alternative is sitting on our hands which will continue to expose Australia to decarbonisation eÔ¨Äorts across the world while not gaining access to new opportunities that will stem from modernising the economy,‚Äù she said.  The scenarios will inform an APRA climate risk vulnerability assessment that was expected to be Ô¨Ånished by September before being delayed by the Covid-19 shutdown. Herd said they should lead to companies consistently disclosing their exposure to climate risk, rather than ‚Äúcherry picking‚Äù scenarios that suited their business strategy.  ‚ÄúGovernments should also apply these climate scenarios to their own policy decisions, including Covid-19 economic recovery eÔ¨Äorts, to ensure taxpayer expenditure is not put at risk by locking in support for carbon-intensive activities,‚Äù she said.  On Thursday, the Australian Energy Council ‚Äì representing all major electricity and gas companies ‚Äì joined business groups, banks, major miners, the ACTU, institutional investors, all state governments and the federal opposition in calling for the government to adopt a target of net zero emissions by 2050 consistent with the Paris agreement, and for the introduction of stable national policies to set a path to the goal.  It followed the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, setting out Labor‚Äôs hopes for a bipartisan agreement to end more than a decade of political brawling over climate and energy policy. The government rejected both calls.      "
Guardian-2020-48.txt,"  The Guardian view on Covid019 and climate: leadership required Editorial Government advisers have set a course through the pandemic to net zero. Is Boris Johnson capable of following it? 

 Thu 25 Jun 2020 18.54 BST 


 The colossal challenge facing human civilisation, of ending our reliance on fossil fuels  in short order, has almost certainly been made harder by the pandemic. Ever since scientists discovered that the Earth was warming as a result of human activity, it has been a struggle to get people, governments and businesses to do anything about it. Even in those countries least resistant to the evidence of rapidly approaching danger,  something else was usually seen as more important. In the past few months, once again, the climate emergency has been knocked oÔ¨Ä the top of world leaders‚Äô to-do list by the more immediate threat of the virus.   Recognising this, the environmental movement came up with the excellent idea of a green recovery. The annual report published on Thursday by the Committee on Climate Change, which provides oÔ¨Écial advice to the UK government, is a crucial, national component of that global eÔ¨Äort. It sets out to tell Boris Johnson, his ministers and the British public how we can embed the lessons of Covid-19 in the next phase of carbon cuts.  There is some hopeful news, amid the destruction: because of the economic contraction caused by the pandemic, global emissions are expected to fall by 5-10% in 2020. In the UK, the switch to home-working has been far swifter and more dramatic than anything envisioned by climate policymakers. If this can be sustained post-pandemic, the reduction in transport emissions could be huge.  To what extent the overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be sustained, either domestically or internationally, will depend on the policies pursued. The committee identiÔ¨Åes post-pandemic stimulus spending on high-carbon infrastructure as a threat. Changing attitudes to public transport due to the risk of infection is another. On the other hand, the kind of transformation that will be required if we are to become a zero-carbon world has arguably been made easier by the pandemic. Once people see how fragile and interconnected we really are, pressure for rapid decarbonisation could be expected to grow.  In the UK, the report identiÔ¨Åes buildings and transport as key priorities, and has a raft of recommendations geared towards progress in these two areas. Regulations on housebuilding have been disgracefully lax, allowing 1 million new homes to be put up that already require retroÔ¨Åtting to meet energy standards (and allow owners and tenants to beneÔ¨Åt from lower bills). Low-carbon heating must be pushed into a dominant position, and out of its current eco- specialist niche. On surface transport, which is now responsible for more emissions than any other sector in the UK (24% in 2019), the popularity of energy-intensive sports utility vehicles (SUVs) is one problem that leaps out. Their market share jumped from 6% in 2008 to 25% in 2019. The shift is mirrored in other countries.  Beyond such practical indications of where action is needed, and highlighting of inconsistencies in areas from agriculture to aviation, the report makes a case for ‚Äúfairness as a core principle‚Äù. This applies domestically, and requires ministers to think about the diÔ¨Äerential impact of any changes ‚Äì for example to energy taxes. But it also has global implications, and entails a new way of counting emissions that includes consumption as well as production.  Sound advice is one thing. The capacity to take it is another. Boris Johnson has only chaired one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change set up last October. This fact on its own is dismal. But the opportunity remains. Next week he is expected to set out how the UK government will approach the recovery. Preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks are the ideal way to make this a global discussion. Can Mr Johnson show more eÔ¨Äective leadership in the climate crisis than he has during the pandemic? For the UK in 2020 there are few more important questions. "
Guardian-2020-49.txt," Road to net zero: what the Committee on Climate Change recommends The government adviser publishes its progress report today. Here are the areas it says require urgent attention Act fast to stop UK carbon emission rebound, climate advisers urge

 Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Thu 25 Jun 2020 00.01 BST 

 The government‚Äôs statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), publishes its progress report on Thursday on eÔ¨Äorts to cut emissions. This is what it says needs to happen urgently if the UK is to reach its target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Energy eÔ¨Éciency A national plan for insulating the UK‚Äôs draughty homes is needed. This would create thousands of new green jobs as the UK struggles to emerge from the coronavirus recession. Previous attempts at national programmes have foundered and there are few incentives for  homeowners to pursue energy eÔ¨Éciency, but housing is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions, along with transport. Domestic heat Gas boilers are one of the most intractable problems for reducing emissions. Alternatives such as ground-source heat pumps have been slow to take oÔ¨Ä, but low-carbon heating must become the dominant form of new heating installation by the early 2030s. Electric vehicles Earlier this year, the prime minister pledged to bring forward the phase-out of diesel and petrol vehicles to 2035. The CCC says its research suggests the switch could be managed by 2032, despite objections by car manufacturers. Carbon tax Oil prices stand at historic lows, making this a good time to raise fuel duty without hitting consumers, according to the CCC. About ¬£15bn a year could be raised in government revenues that could be recycled into other green measures, such as incentives to motorists to switch to electric vehicles. Agriculture and land use Tree planting and restoring peatlands, wetlands and other natural carbon sinks could generate ‚Äúshovel-ready‚Äù projects that create new jobs around the country ‚Äì in rural areas, but also in cities where green space is shrinking. The agriculture bill going through parliament should oÔ¨Äer an opportunity for more nature-friendly farming that helps lock carbon into vegetation and soils, turning agriculture from a major source of emissions to a net absorber. Reskilling and retraining programmes The net zero economy will require a net zero workforce, according to the report. This will include everything from installing low-carbon boilers and home insulation to improving broadband networks (for more home-working) and creating jobs in burgeoning industries such as oÔ¨Äshore wind. The recovery from the Covid-19 crisis oÔ¨Äers an opportunity for the government to step in with retraining incentives. Behavioural changes in lockdown About half of employed people in the UK were working from home during April, the CCC found, showing how much home working is possible. If more of us worked at home, transport emissions would be vastly reduced, so more employers should be encouraged to make the changes permanent where possible. New infrastructure is needed to help people continue to cycle and walk to work. The public sector should lead by example in encouraging remote working. Targeted science and innovation funding Kickstarting research and innovation in low-carbon technologies will be vital if the UK is to become a centre of low-carbon development after leaving the EU. Promising technologies include hydrogen fuel and the development of carbon capture and storage in depleted oilÔ¨Åelds under the North Sea. Adaptation to the eÔ¨Äects of the climate crisis   Ministers have pledged to spend ¬£5bn on Ô¨Çood defences, which could be brought forward to protect homes and create green jobs. Housebuilders and homeowners also need to adapt the UK‚Äôs housing to hotter summers; older people in particular are in danger from more frequent heatwaves. Growing thick ivy on the walls is one good way to protect a house against overheating in scorching summers, the CCC says. "
Guardian-2020-5.txt,"  Our environment has always aÔ¨Äected our mortality, should we add climate change to death certiÔ¨Åcates?  As temperatures rise we predict increasing morbidity and mortality, particularly in the climate< vulnerable parts of northern Australia
 Arnagretta Hunter
 Thu 21 May 2020 06.16 BST 

 Last summer was bad for our health. We breathed hazardous air, watched our rivers dry  up, lived in towns without water, suÔ¨Äered through scorching heat with record- breaking temperatures, and many people survived intense experience of Ô¨Åre.  Yet our death records for 2020 won‚Äôt record this. Death certiÔ¨Åcates will reÔ¨Çect the  heart attacks or lung failure, the injuries and the organ failure that occur at the end of life. They do not record the environmental factors that contribute to these fatal events.   Human health is complex. At its core there is the biology and science of how our bodies work, and how diseases take hold. It is this biology that we record on death certiÔ¨Åcates with descriptions such as heart attack, stroke, infection and cancer.  Other factors have a strong inÔ¨Çuence on health and wellbeing. The social determinants of health ‚Äì factors like education, economics, geography and relationships ‚Äì have a deep inÔ¨Çuence on how diseases progress. This often has a powerful inÔ¨Çuence on life expectancy.  But despite this strong inÔ¨Çuence, it is much less often reÔ¨Çected in our mortality data. Doctors are increasingly literate in understanding the consequences of these social determinants, yet they often still see these factors as secondary and not worthy of the same attention.  The natural environment in which we live is the other dominant inÔ¨Çuence on our health and wellbeing. Temperature, weather and the climate have always aÔ¨Äected our health, even as we have become better at building shelters and homes to protect ourselves from the elements.  Visionary physicians including Tony McMichael, Bob Douglas and David Shearman have called for years for environmental factors to be given recognition in our understanding of health and wellbeing. And yet in hospitals and medical practices, we are really only just beginning to appreciate the immense inÔ¨Çuence of the environment on our health.  The lack of consideration can be seen through our Australian health data. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports our health data, with rates of cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and infection sitting along side some important socioeconomic indices such as location, education and economics. Within this data is very little information to reÔ¨Çect the health eÔ¨Äect of the environment, with events like bushÔ¨Åres, Ô¨Çoods and drought not well represented at all.  Research from our group at the Australian National University published this week suggests that up to 2% of mortality in Australia is inÔ¨Çuenced by very hot temperatures. As clinicians we are seeing patients in hospital aÔ¨Äected by heat, and we can also see there are longer term aÔ¨Äects from increasing temperatures, yet mortality from heat is not routinely presented by our federal agencies.  Published in the Medical Journal of Australia recently, colleagues from University of Tasmania demonstrate that mortality from bushÔ¨Åre smoke over summer months from November to February was likely to be more than 400 people, and that many thousands of people went to hospital over that period because of the smoke. This information does not come from death certiÔ¨Åcates or from health department data, but from statistical and attribution analysis of the period.  Climate change is the greatest health challenge we face in Australia, even after we recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Our last summer has given us a serious lesson in the inÔ¨Çuence of environmental factors on our health and wellbeing. As temperatures rise in Australia, we predict increasing morbidity and mortality, particularly in the climate-vulnerable parts of northern Australia.  As temperatures rise and extreme weather events become more common we will see this reÔ¨Çected in our health data. It is time for our health agencies and health professionals to   understand the risks and reÔ¨Çect them for our population to understand. We can start this by adding environmental factors to our death certiÔ¨Åcates and hospitalisation data.  Through naming and describing the threat we go part way to confronting it. For years climate scientists have warned that hundreds of millions, if not billions of people are likely to be aÔ¨Äected by climate change over this century. Heat is one of the major threats. And we can now begin to see why these predictions have been made and how sobering this is when considering the health and wellbeing of Australians.  The current global pandemic carries a mortality rate of less than 1% for those infected. Population mortality is much, much lower because of our control mechanisms and the global response. Rising temperatures through climate change threatens the health and wellbeing of so many more people and deserves more attention and response.  The solutions to combat climate change oÔ¨Äer tremendous opportunities and health beneÔ¨Åts. As we respond to the global pandemic we have a remarkable opportunity to combat a number of serious threats to our human future, creating a safer, cleaner and kinder world. Part of addressing the challenge comes from recognising the magnitude of the risk to our health. It is immense and demands attention today.

Guardian-2020-50.txt," Act fast to stop UK carbon emission rebound, climate advisers urge Report says Boris Johnson‚Äôs lack of climate leadership risks missing target and embarrassing UK at Cop26 Road to net zero: what the Committee on Climate Change recommends 

Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent Thu 25 Jun 2020 00.01 BST  


The UK is falling behind on its target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and risks a surge in carbon emissions as lockdown eases, the government‚Äôs climate advisers warn.  Ministers must act fast if the UK is to avoid a massive rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis eases, Lord Deben, chair of the committee on climate change (CCC), which published its progress report to parliament on Thursday, said. By setting up new schemes to insulate homes, raise carbon taxes, switch to electric vehicles and improve broadband, the government could spur a green recovery to create jobs and cut emissions permanently.   The CCC found that the lack of clear leadership and direction from the prime minister was at the heart of the problem, just as the world was looking to the UK as host of the next UN climate summit.  Boris Johnson has chaired only one meeting of the cabinet committee on climate change since taking personal charge of the issue last October, with the government‚Äôs statutory advisers urging him to convene the group more often, as a matter of urgency, if the UK is to meet its 2050 net zero carbon target, which is oÔ¨Ä track.  Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC said: ‚ÄúWithout central and integrated leadership we will fail in our task, and this really does need the prime minister‚Äôs attention to make a success of it. It is a poor excuse that [the cabinet committee] has not met more often.‚Äù  Deben added: ‚ÄúWe have to do this as rapidly as possible ‚Äì this window of opportunity is closing clearly. What we do not want is a lot of good-hearted statements about beginning policies ‚Äì what we need to do is seize the opportunity.‚Äù  Delay in the government‚Äôs regulations for housebuilding had already resulted in 1 million new homes that were ‚Äúnot Ô¨Åt for purpose‚Äù because they had been built to old ineÔ¨Écient standards, he said. They would all have to be retroÔ¨Åtted for energy eÔ¨Éciency at extra cost.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens if you don‚Äôt take these measures,‚Äù he said.  The ‚Äúcentral role‚Äù of the cabinet committee on climate change, which Johnson said last October would spearhead a cross-government push to bring down emissions, is mentioned 10 times in the CCC‚Äôs 196-page progress report to parliament, published on Thursday.  The cabinet committee‚Äôs one meeting, chaired by Johnson, was in March, the Guardian has established, and a second meeting is planned in the near future. Details are scant as the government has said it does not intend to report publicly on the committee meetings.  ‚Äú[It] will need to meet more regularly and demonstrate it is driving sustained progress,‚Äù the CCC report said.  Insiders told the Guardian that despite the government‚Äôs public commitment to net zero carbon emissions, the lack of leadership was severely hampering the UK‚Äôs ability to meet its carbon targets and its credibility as host of next year‚Äôs UN Cop26 climate summit.  ‚ÄúWe are not being given a good lead by the prime minister and this is really undermining our ability to move things on,‚Äù said Tom Burke, co-founder of the environment thinktank E3G and a veteran government adviser. ‚ÄúWhat binds any institution, but especially the government, is leadership, and if you don‚Äôt get leadership, then people go oÔ¨Ä in diÔ¨Äerent directions.‚Äù  He called for Johnson to take personal control. ‚ÄúThe point of setting up a cabinet committee is to signal the importance of the issue for the government. If you don‚Äôt follow up that signal by using the device you created, you tell people you are more interested in the headline than in the outcome.‚Äù  Other recommendations in the CCC report include:   A national plan to renovate buildings and construct new housing to the highest standards of energy and water eÔ¨Éciency. Bringing forward the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicles from 2035 to 2032. Raising carbon taxes, including fuel duty, while oil prices are low, to bring in ¬£15bn a year for spending on green measures. The UK‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions fell by about 3.2% last year, but emissions must fall faster over the next 30 years to meet the target of net zero emissions by 2050.  The report sets out 29 milestones for the government to reach by 2030, as well as more than 130 detailed policy recommendations covering each government department. Ministers must respond to the report by 15 October.  A government spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe agree with the CCC that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. We were the Ô¨Årst major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and want to ensure the UK has the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.‚Äù  Green campaigners called on ministers to act urgently, as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepared a statement on the post-coronavirus economic rescue package for early next month. Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK, said: ‚ÄúThe likes of energy, eÔ¨Éciency, cycling and saving peatlands are essential, not nice-to-have measures. The CCC have shown the government where they need to put their money, and all eyes are now on the chancellor to make it happen.‚Äù     "
Guardian-2020-51.txt," UK weather: thunderstorms and torrential rain to follow soaring temperatures UK‚Äôs hot weather will turn wet from Thursday afternoon, forecasters warn PA Media Thu 25 Jun 2020 07.15 BST 


 Soaring temperatures across the UK will be followed by thunderstorms and torrential rain over coming days, forecasters have warned.  Wednesday was the hottest day of the year so far but the Met OÔ¨Éce said Thursday could beat that record, with temperatures expected to climb in the Midlands and Wales.  However, thunderstorms are expected to form across the west of the UK in the afternoon, bringing heavy rain, lighting and hail.  West London is forecast to see temperatures peak between 32C and 33C, while parts of Wales could see the mercury rise to 34C.   Should that happen, it would be the hottest June on record in Wales, surpassing the previous peak of 33.7C on 18 June 2000.  Met OÔ¨Éce meteorologist John GriÔ¨Éths said the Midlands could see temperatures reach 32C on Thursday, while the Welsh Marches ‚Äì the area along the Welsh border ‚Äì could see temperatures of 34C ‚Äúvery locally‚Äù.  The hot weather is expected to turn from 4pm on Thursday as thunderstorms form in the south-west and south-east of England, Wales, western Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The Met OÔ¨Éce has issued a yellow weather alert for those areas until 9am on Friday, warning of disruption due to Ô¨Çooding, lightning strikes, hail and wind. Between 30mm to 40mm of rain could fall in less than two hours.  The storms are expected to continue from midday on Friday through to 6am on Saturday, with another yellow warning in place for the whole of the UK.  Areas hit by the storms could experience ‚Äútorrential downpours‚Äù with 30-50mm of rain falling in an hour.  On Wednesday the mercury peaked at 32.6C at London‚Äôs Heathrow airport at 2.46pm.  The hot weather saw people Ô¨Çock to beaches in huge numbers despite social distancing measures remaining in place.  Bournemouth beach as temperatures rose across the UK. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA The Met OÔ¨Éce raised its heat alert level to three, as health authorities encouraged those most vulnerable ‚Äì many of whom have been shielding during lockdown ‚Äì to protect themselves amid the ‚Äúexceptionally hot weather forecast this week‚Äù.  Public Health England (PHE) said older people, those with underlying health conditions, and very young children were all more at risk from the higher temperatures.  The amber level three, which remains in place for the east and West Midlands, requires social and healthcare services to target speciÔ¨Åc actions at high-risk groups, according to the Met OÔ¨Éce website.  People have been advised to keep cool and stay hydrated where possible.   The Met OÔ¨Éce said UV levels were expected to remain at eight across many parts of the UK on Thursday.

Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP /Getty Images Dr Michaela Hegglin, associate professor in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Reading‚Äôs department of meteorology, said Thursday could see some of the ‚Äúhighest UV levels ever recorded‚Äù in Britain.  She said: ‚ÄúThis is because of a combination of factors. We are at the summer solstice, when the sun is almost directly overhead at one o‚Äôclock.  ‚ÄúUV levels this high are rare in the UK, so people with light skin should be very careful to avoid getting burnt. While UV is important for getting vitamin D and keeping us healthy, too much of it can cause skin cancer or eye cataracts.‚Äù  Emer O‚ÄôConnell, consultant in public health at PHE, said it was important that people kept checking on the vulnerable, as many continued to spend more time at home due to coronavirus.  Shoppers have also been advised to be aware they could be forced to spend extra time in the sun as a result of social distancing measures. And dog owners have been urged to avoid exercising their pets during the hottest part of the day.  The public is also being reminded to take care around water throughout the summer, amid concerns people might be tempted to take a dip to cool down. Thames Valley police said on Wednesday oÔ¨Écers had found a body, following a search for a missing man who is believed to have got into diÔ¨Éculty in the water at Lulle Brook in Cookham, Berkshire, on Tuesday.

Guardian-2020-52.txt," Government climate advisers running scared of change, says leading scientist Rapid transformation needed, Kevin Anderson says, particularly in lifestyles of rich Matthew Taylor Fri 26 Jun 2020 13.16 BST 

 Kevin Anderson, one of the world‚Äôs leading climate scientists, had a familiar reaction to the latest report from the government‚Äôs climate advisers, which was published this week.  The 196-page document by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) delivered a stinging rebuke of the government‚Äôs record and said ministers must urgently up their game if the UK is to avoid a signiÔ¨Åcant rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis and meet its 2050 net zero carbon target.  Anderson is a professor of energy and climate change, working across the universities of Manchester, Uppsala in Sweden and Bergen in Norway. He said: ‚ÄúThe constructive, meticulous criticism of the government, which is failing abysmally by any measure, is Ô¨Åne. The problem is   the framing the CCC has for net zero is already far removed from what is needed to meet our Paris commitments.‚Äù  Anderson‚Äôs latest research argues the UK‚Äôs planned reductions in emissions, even if it hits net zero by 2050, would be two or three times greater than its fair share of emissions under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, where countries agreed to hold global increases in temperature to ‚Äúwell below 2C  and to pursue 1.5C‚Äù.  ‚ÄúAcademics have done an excellent job in understanding and communicating climate science, but the same cannot be said in relation to reducing emissions,‚Äù said Anderson. ‚ÄúHere we have collectively denied the necessary scale of mitigation, running scared of calling for fundamental changes to both our energy system and the lifestyles of high-energy users. Our paper brings this failure into sharp focus.‚Äù  Shortly after the study was published, Anderson posted a warning on Twitter about what he described as a cosy consensus between senior academics, journalists and government scientists, who were unwilling to publicly acknowledge the urgent system-level transformation required to tackle the climate crisis.  He said: ‚ÄúMany senior academics, senior policymakers, basically the great and good of the climate world have decided that it is unhelpful to rock the status quo boat and therefore choose to work within that political paradigm ‚Äì they‚Äôll push it as hard as they think it can go, but they repeatedly step back from questioning the paradigm itself.‚Äù  Kevin Anderson is a professor of energy and climate change, working at several universities. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian Anderson, who travels between his three universities by ‚Äúlong, slow train‚Äù and last took an airline Ô¨Çight in 2004, says that such ‚Äúmitigation denial‚Äù stems from the ‚Äúfundamental failure‚Äù of the academic community to be honest about the implications of its research. This had potentially devastating consequences for the future, he said.  ‚ÄúOur job as academics is to be disinterested in whether policymakers like or dislike our conclusions. We should only be concerned [with] whether they agree or disagree with our Ô¨Åndings ‚Äì and why,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúOn mitigation, the academic community and the CCC have collectively failed the political realm and civil society by tailoring our conclusions to Ô¨Åt with what we judge to be politically   palatable ‚Äì all at the expense of scientiÔ¨Åc integrity.‚Äù  Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, defended the logic behind its 2050 target, which he said was based on ‚Äúdetailed considerations of the climate science, based on the IPCC‚Äôs work, the international context, including the Paris agreement and ‚Äòequity‚Äô considerations, and the feasible speed and cost at which UK emissions can be reduced‚Äù.  Stark added: ‚ÄúOur recommendations reÔ¨Çect a consideration of all of these issues and are designed to best support the required increase in global eÔ¨Äort. It continues to be the CCC‚Äôs view that this is the right target for the UK, but we welcome new evidence and we will review new studies as we develop our advice on the sixth carbon budget for the end of this year.‚Äù  However, Anderson said too many models for tackling climate change relied on ‚Äúunproven technologies far in the future‚Äù, such as carbon capture and storage. ‚ÄúPerhaps we‚Äôll be lucky and they will work at huge planetary scale ‚Äì but it‚Äôs one hell of a gamble.‚Äù  He said the models also ignored the fact that it was the lifestyles of a relatively wealthy few that gave rise to the lion‚Äôs share of emissions.  ‚ÄúGlobally the wealthiest 10% are responsible for half of all emissions, the wealthiest 20% for 70% of emissions. If regulations forced the top 10% to cut their emissions to the level of the average EU citizen, and the other 90% made no change in their lifestyles, that would still cut total emissions by a third.  ‚ÄúIf we were serious about this crisis we could do this in a year ‚Äì if we were really serious we could do it in a month, but we are not and our emissions just keep rising.‚Äù  In his latest report, published in the journal Climate Policy last month, Anderson and his colleagues argued that after ‚Äú30 years of failure‚Äù to control growing emissions, a fundamental reframing was required.  But he insisted that this did not mean a complete upheaval in how most people lived their lives, even in the UK.  ‚ÄúYes, some changes will be needed, but for the majority of people the solutions to this crisis will also improve their lives: long-term job prospects for them and their children, better house quality, better access and more aÔ¨Äordable public transport.‚Äù  However, for wealthy high emitters it would mean fundamental change.  ‚ÄúThe very wealthy amongst us, senior academics and professors included, will have to make profound changes to our high-emitting lifestyles. We recycle and often live in relatively eÔ¨Écient homes, but they‚Äôre typically big homes and sometimes we have two or more of them.  ‚ÄúMany of us are frequent Ô¨Çyers, we drive long distances in big cars, buy a lot equipment, have fridge-freezers the size of a small terrace house ‚Äì every facet of our lives, although normalised by us, is central to our nation‚Äôs high emissions. But the models are unwilling to accept this ‚Äì preferring to pass the buck on to our children in the form of future technical silver bullets.‚Äù  Anderson said that the UK‚Äôs use of energy should be zero-carbon by 2035 rather than net zero   by 2050 ‚Äì a move that would ‚Äúrequire a fundamental re-evaluation of economic assumptions around growth value and progress‚Äù.  He said the scale and timeframe of transformation required would be bigger than that of Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal or the Marshall plan to reconstruct Europe after the second world war.  ‚ÄúMany say that such rapid and deep change is unrealistic ‚Äì but it‚Äôs much more realistic than believing a fair and progressive society can survive with 3, 4 or even 5C of warming,‚Äù he said.  ‚Ä¢ This article was amended on 26 June 2020 to clarify a sentence referring to research arguing that planned reductions in emissions would still be two or three times ‚Äúgreater than [the UK‚Äôs] fair share‚Äù under the Paris agreement. That is now spelled out as an overshoot on emissions (as distinct from an excess of reductions). An incorrect Fahrenheit conversion was also eliminated. "
Guardian-2020-53.txt,"  Beyond Google: my afternoon trawling Trove for the Ô¨Årst mentions of climate change What happens when you decide to search the National Library database for historical references to global warming? It goes further back than you think Celina Ribeiro  Sat 27 Jun 2020 21.00 BST

‚ÄúScience has uncovered indisputable evidence that the level of our oceans is  rising. This is the result of a sudden and unexpected increase in our planet‚Äôs northern temperatures. Ice masses are melting rapidly away. If the rate of thawing continues, civilisation near the sea may be submerged and profound changes be wrought in climate, soil, sea and the race itself. The whole face of  the earth may be moving towards a vast transformation.‚Äù  That‚Äôs quite an opening paragraph, but it‚Äôs not mine. It belongs a story titled ‚ÄúSea Levels Rising‚Äù published in the Central Queensland Herald on Thursday. Thursday 30 September 1948.   This was not what I had expected to Ô¨Ånd when I started trawling Trove, the National Library of Australia‚Äôs newly re-launched digital archive. The archive has digitised versions of Australian newspapers, community newsletters, reports and audio recordings dating back to the early 1800s. The new site is geared towards use by ordinary people, not PhDs. Like me.  I wanted to try to track down the earliest reference to climate change in Australian papers. First, because I could. But second, because I wanted to know how long we had known this is coming. Over the last black summer I was overwhelmed with fatalism, with the sickening sense that we had been warned. Now I wanted to Ô¨Ånd out for how long we had known.  I knew we had been warned about climate change since the late 1960s. I knew there had been scientists theorising about climate and carbon for longer than that.  But I thought I was stretching when I entered the search term ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù and set the search parameters for newspapers published between 1930 and 1950. I expected there might be some records of Ô¨Çoods, droughts or heatwaves, but nothing equivocal. Then the results came up. I gasped. Loudly.  Climate Change: World is Warming, Courier-Mail, Monday 22 May 1950  There were more.  Whole Earth Seems to be Warming Up, Courier-Mail, Friday 6 June 1947.

World Changing Climate ‚Äì Scientists Puzzled, Courier-Mail, Friday 21 April 1939. Carbon Dioxide. Could Change the World, Townsville Daily Bulletin, Tuesday 25 July 1933.  These are not headlines misread by contemporary understanding. This is reporting of climate change as we understand it today, albeit in its infancy and with uncertainty over whether that change was all bad.  It was clear I‚Äôd have to go further. I searched the 19th-century newspapers. There were sporadic articles talking about drought, and how some old colonialists had remembered diÔ¨Äerent weather decades before, but there was nothing about climate change as a phenomena separate to individual memory and musing.  I began to search the 1920s records. Reports in 1926 linked the warmer winters in Europe to ‚Äúcarbonic acid‚Äù. A 1923 report subtitled ‚Äúcauses of climate change‚Äù went into detail about the warming of the North Pole.  Further. I was going to have to go back further.  I changed my search parameters again. And there, tucked away on page 4 of the Picton Post, between one report about a new skipping machine that not only turns the rope but counts the skips and another about Swiss engineers boring a tunnel through the Caucasus Mountains, was a one-paragraph story:  ‚ÄúCoal Consumption AÔ¨Äecting Climate‚Äù. From Wednesday 17 July 1912.   At nearly precisely 108 years old, it looks to be quite possibly the Ô¨Årst general audience warning on human-induced climate change in Australia. The coal burning in the world‚Äôs furnaces, says the snippet in the regional paper, adds 7,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere yearly. ‚ÄúThis tends to make the air a more eÔ¨Äective blanket for the earth and to raise its temperature. The eÔ¨Äect may be considerable in a few centuries.‚Äù  Almost instantly, my understanding of climate history was reshaped, and within moments I was consumed by a renewed, more urgent sense that our inaction and rhetoric on the subject has passed the point of forgiveness.  But it was not very diÔ¨Écult to Ô¨Ånd. It took a free afternoon, sitting at home clicking on a search icon.

Guardian-2020-54.txt," Match Covid,19 economic stimulus with climate Ô¨Åght ambition, urge MPs InÔ¨Çuential committees call for bold investments to recover and grow in ‚Äòcleaner and greener way‚Äô 

Jillian Ambrose Mon 29 Jun 2020 06.01 BST 


 MPs have joined growing calls from business leaders and environmentalists for the government to use its post-coronavirus economic recovery plan to accelerate investments aimed at tackling the climate crisis.  The chairs of two inÔ¨Çuential cross-party select committees have warned the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that time is running out to ‚Äúavert an even greater future global crisis caused by climate change‚Äù.  In a joint letter, the chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee, and the chair of the environmental audit (EAC) committee, said the government must align plans to  boost the economy with its climate ambitions.  Darren Jones, the chair of the BEIS committee, said the post-pandemic world oÔ¨Äers an ‚Äúopportunity for the UK to step up our eÔ¨Äorts to tackle climate change, to foster a green recovery and accelerate the transition to net zero‚Äù.  Jones is due to lead an inquiry into the government‚Äôs climate progress at a hearing on Thursday following a report from the Committee on Climate Change, the government‚Äôs oÔ¨Écial climate advisers, which warned last week that the UK is falling behind on its climate targets.  ‚ÄúI hope the chancellor will be bold in his investment in infrastructure and people, demonstrating the government‚Äôs commitment to tackling climate change, boosting the prospects of a green recovery, creating net-zero related jobs, and bolstering the UK‚Äôs credibility as a net zero leader in the run up to COP26 [climate talks],‚Äù he said.  The EAC has also opened a new investigation into how the government can use the opportunities created by the post-Covid recovery plans to further the UK‚Äôs green agenda.  Philip Dunne, the chair of the EAC committee, said that ‚Äúif there is anything positive to come out of the pandemic, it is that we wake up to the warnings that we are hearing from scientists about the urgency of acting on climate change‚Äù.  Dunne added: ‚ÄúMany of the actions we need to make our net-zero ambition a reality can be used to revive our economy, creating green jobs and generating long term cost savings. It would be a historic mistake to miss this opportunity.‚Äù  The combined calls for a green economic recovery from within the government echoes rising calls from green groups, industry leaders and the Prince of Wales to support Ô¨Årms that can help to spur the UK‚Äôs low-carbon ambitions and help create jobs in the ‚Äúgreen economy‚Äù.  More than 200 business leaders ‚Äì including chief executives and chairs from nearly half of FTSE 100 companies ‚Äì are due on Monday to attend a virtual meeting with the business secretary, Alok Sharma, and the environment secretary, George Eustice, to plot a route towards the UN climate talks, which have been delayed by a year to November 2021.  Ahead of the meeting, Liv GarÔ¨Åeld, the chief executive of the FTSE 100 water Ô¨Årm Severn Trent, said the UK had a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime opportunity to recover and grow in the right way ‚Äì a cleaner and greener way‚Äù and that ‚Äúevery business in the UK has a role to play in delivering this‚Äù.  The event, organised by the Council for Sustainable Business (CSB) in tandem with the government, will focus on the climate action that the UK can take within the next 10 years. "
Guardian-2020-55.txt," UK ministers send mixed messages over climate commitments, says fund manager Nigel Wilson criticises ‚Äòconfusion‚Äô created by prioritising HS2 and Heathrow expansion Kalyeena MakortoÔ¨Ä Mon 29 Jun 2020 19.59 BST  The head of the UK‚Äôs largest fund manager has criticised the UK government for creating ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù around the country‚Äôs climate commitments by prioritising projects such as expanding Heathrow airport and pushing ahead with HS2.  Nigel Wilson said government priorities were ‚Äúnot necessarily consistent‚Äù with climate crisis objectives and sending mixed messages to investors and the Ô¨Ånancial services industry.  During a webinar focused on Ô¨Ånancial climate risks on Monday, Wilson said: ‚ÄúThe government has to become a collaborative partner. At the moment the mandates on what they want to do, and what they want to spend their money on, are not always aligned with climate change at all, [and] send all sorts of confusing messages.  ‚ÄúThe highest-priority projects, these seem to be Heathrow and HS2 [and] those are not necessarily consistent with the climate objectives ‚Ä¶ and this creates confusion amongst our staÔ¨Ä and our customers.‚Äù  Wilson‚Äôs comments targeted two of the most controversial infrastructure projects on the government agenda. They come months after plans for a third runway at Heathrow were deemed illegal by the court of appeal. Judges ruled in February ministers did not take into account government commitments to tackle the climate crisis.  The comments also come weeks after anti-HS2 protesters embarked on a 200km (125 mile) protest march to highlight the damage they said the high speed rail project will inÔ¨Çict on wildlife and woodland.  But while the Legal & General boss has been a long-time sceptic of mega-projects such as Heathrow, Hinkley Point C and HS2, he has often raised concerns about their practical delivery rather than their environmental impact.  A spokesman for Wilson said the money would be better spent on smaller projects, which are easier to fund, can be completed in a shorter timeframe and have clearer economic and climate beneÔ¨Åts. They include intra-city transport, electric vehicle infrastructure and housing retroÔ¨Åtting, that would boost jobs and cut emissions.  A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe have an ambitious target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and we are developing a transport decarbonisation plan to set out how we will achieve this.‚Äù  Wilson‚Äôs criticisms were aired during a webinar on Monday that marked the launch of the Climate Financial Risk Forum (CFRF) guide, spearheaded by the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority. The project is meant to help banks, insurers and asset managers navigate the looming threats of the climate crisis.  Wilson, who chaired the CFRF‚Äôs work on innovation, said Ô¨Årms should be thinking of creative ways to tackle global heating. For example, mortgage providers should consider energy costs and a home‚Äôs energy performance certiÔ¨Åcate (EPC) when assessing mortgage aÔ¨Äordability, he said. "
Guardian-2020-57.txt," Emmanuel Macron pledges ‚Ç¨15bn to tackle climate crisis French president announces measures following ‚Äògreen wave‚Äô in local elections 

Kim Willsher in Paris Mon 29 Jun 2020 14.38 BST  


Emmanuel Macron has promised an extra ‚Ç¨15bn (¬£13.7bn) for measures to combat the climate crisis over the next two years and a referendum on whether to introduce the crime of ‚Äúecocide‚Äù for harming the environment.  The measures were announced just hours after environmental candidates sparked a green wave across France with major gains in local elections in which the president‚Äôs governing party failed to make its mark.  At a meeting with members of the Citizens‚Äô Commission for the Climate ‚Äì a committee of 150 randomly chosen French people that reported back after a nine-month deliberation last week ‚Äì Macron promised extra funding and strong measures.  He said he accepted all but three of the 149 recommendations put forward by the commission.  Macron said he hoped to implement the measures immediately and a new law would be drawn up before the end of summer. He congratulated the commission for having ‚Äúmade the choice of putting ecology at the heart of our economic model‚Äù, but rejected its suggestion for a ‚Äúdividend tax‚Äù on investments and postponed a debate on whether to introduce a 110km/h speed limit on French roads.  The Citizens‚Äô Commission for the Climate is part of a democratic experiment in France where a group of citizens, ranging from teenage school pupils to bus drivers and retired railway staÔ¨Ä, were asked to deÔ¨Åne government environmental policy for the remaining two years of Macron‚Äôs mandate ‚Äì and speciÔ¨Åcally how to cut the country‚Äôs carbon emissions by 40% by 2030.  It came up with proposals grouped under Ô¨Åve main themes: transport, housing, work and production, food, and consumption of natural resources.  The results of France‚Äôs municipal elections in which the environmental party Europe √âcologie Les Verts made signiÔ¨Åcant gains in a vote marked by the coronavirus crisis and historic abstention, made Macron‚Äôs response even more crucial for his centrist La R√©publique en Marche party (La REM).  The vote was a predictable blow to La REM, which has fractured France‚Äôs political landscape nationally but made little headway in local elections outside Paris or in ‚Äúla France profonde‚Äù.  The ecologists took several major cities including Lyon, Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Marseille and Besan√ßon, and many other large towns in Sunday‚Äôs vote. In Paris, where the Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo, in alliance with EELV, was reelected with a signiÔ¨Åcant majority on a programme that prioritised tackling pollution, the climate crisis and clean energy.  The environmentalist and MEP Yannick Jadot said the result was a ‚Äúredrawing of the political landscape‚Äù around ecological issues.  ‚ÄúPeople are trying to make sense of things, our way of life, our housing, the density of cities, food, travel, solidarity, new democratic methods ‚Ä¶ Part of the population has a wish, a desire, for real change in our societies that is socially and economically realistic,‚Äù Jadot told Ouest- France newspaper.  ‚ÄúThere will obviously be a before and after the 2020 local elections. It‚Äôs a real political turn in our country,‚Äù he said.  Greenpeace accused Macron of watering down the commission‚Äôs proposals using ‚Äújokers‚Äù to get out of important measures.  ‚ÄúThe message sent by the municipal elections is clear: ecology and the climate crisis are no longer only a distant preoccupation for French people, but a political priority that must result in acts, concrete measures and a general goal in keeping with the Paris climate accord. The Citizen‚Äôs Commission has said the same thing and it will need more than a lovely speech from the Elys√©e to satisfy the deep expectations,‚Äù said Jean-Fran√ßois Julliard, the director general of Greenpeace France.  Cl√©ment S√©n√©chal, responsible for Greenpeace France‚Äôs climate campaign, said the government   could make its actions match the president‚Äôs words by making state aid for coronavirus-hit businesses, including carmakers and airlines, dependent on their willingness to introduce ‚Äúsocial and environmental measures‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThis would force polluting businesses to change their model and get behind the Paris agreement,‚Äù S√©n√©chal said.  The president is widely reported to be considering a government reshuÔ¨Ñe including the Ô¨Åring of his popular prime minister, √âdouard Philippe, who was elected mayor of Le Havre on Sunday. "
Guardian-2020-58.txt," Eden Monaro Liberal candidate under Ô¨Åre for climate and same%sex marriage comments Fiona Kotvojs is ‚Äòmore conservative‚Äô than Tony Abbott on climate change, one campaigner has warned

 Paul Karp Tue 30 Jun 2020 18.30 BST  


Climate and LGBT equality campaigners have rounded on the Liberal candidate for Eden- Monaro, Fiona Kotvojs, in the lead-up to Saturday‚Äôs byelection, with one warning she is ‚Äúmore conservative‚Äù on climate change than Tony Abbott.  Matthew Nott, the founder and president of Clean Energy for Eternity, made the comparison in reference to comments Kotvojs made at a meeting with the local climate group ahead of the 2019 election that Australia‚Äôs contribution to global emissions is ‚Äúminute‚Äù.  Equality campaigners have also raised concerns over a submission to the Ruddock religious freedom review, signed by Kotvojs, arguing that wedding service providers should be able to   discriminate against same-sex weddings or any ‚Äúvision of marriage that violates their sincerely held beliefs‚Äù.  On Monday Guardian Australia revealed that Kotvojs, who has a history of downplaying the human contribution to global heating, had submitted to the bushÔ¨Åre royal commission in April that governments cannot address heat as a cause of bushÔ¨Åres so must focus on managing fuel loads instead.  On Tuesday, Kotvojs was grilled about her position at a press conference in Lobs Hole, telling reporters she believes humans ‚Äúare contributing‚Äù to climate change ‚Äì but repeatedly refusing to say if she thinks it increased the intensity of the summer‚Äôs bushÔ¨Åres.  Labor‚Äôs climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, has accused Kotvojs of being a ‚Äúclimate change sceptic‚Äù, warning voters she will ‚Äúbe part of the Liberal team that‚Äôs done nothing on climate change‚Äù.  Nott shared Butler‚Äôs Facebook post, commenting: ‚ÄúIn a one hour meeting with Dr Kotvojs prior to last year‚Äôs federal election, I heard every excuse for inaction on climate change that I‚Äôve ever heard. She has a more conservative position on climate than Tony Abbott.‚Äù  Nott told Guardian Australia that at the meeting in Bega, Kotvojs said the climate ‚Äúwill always continue to change‚Äù, which echoes similar comments she made to ABC South East in October 2018.  ‚ÄúShe went on to say that there were many forces controlling climate other than emissions,‚Äù Nott said. ‚ÄúShe said that Australia‚Äôs contribution to global emissions was minute and therefore we shouldn‚Äôt look at anything economically damaging to reduce emissions.‚Äù  Nott said Kotvojs had presented Australia‚Äôs emissions ‚Äúas a percentage of human and natural emission‚Äù to argue its contribution is even less than 1.3% of global emissions.  Nott accused Kotvojs of ‚Äúmissing our point‚Äù that ‚Äúrenewable energy creates jobs in regional areas in areas like Eden Monaro‚Äù and praised the New South Wales government and Liberal environment minister, Matt Kean, for embracing renewables.  In the religious freedom submission, Kotvojs and other signatories to a form submission told the review in 2018 that there ‚Äúshould be no legal detriment to anyone who expresses the view that marriage is between one man and one woman‚Äù.  They argued that religious schools ‚Äúshould be allowed to positively discriminate in employment for people who adhere to their beliefs on marriage‚Äù and parents should be able to ‚Äúwithdraw their children from classes teaching radical LGBTIQ sex and gender theory‚Äù.  Anna Brown, the chief executive of Equality Australia, said ‚Äúthe people of Eden-Monaro voted resoundingly in favour of equality for LGBTIQ+ people in 2017, and the parliament explicitly rejected proposals to allow businesses to discriminate against same-sex couples‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWe hope that Fiona Kotvojs‚Äôs position has evolved ‚Ä¶ Australia needs politicians to focus on rebuilding communities impacted by bushÔ¨Åres and Covid-19 and ensuring that no one is left behind, including LGBTIQ+ people,‚Äù she said.   Rodney Croome, the Just Equal spokesperson, said it is ‚Äúabhorrent that a major party candidate believes a commercial service should be allowed to discriminate on the ground of religion‚Äù.  On Tuesday Kotvojs defended her position on climate change and the bushÔ¨Åre submission at a press conference alongside Scott Morrison, but did not respond to written questions from Guardian Australia about Clean Energy for Eternity and her views on same-sex marriage.  ‚ÄúI believe that the climate is changing and I believe humans are contributing to that change,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúIn my experience where I live, the Ô¨Åres came through our farm, and we watched them coming at Cobargo into Dignams Creek, and the areas where hazard reduction had already occurred, the Ô¨Åre came through at lower intensity and much slower, it caused much less damage.  ‚ÄúThe area where the hazard reduction hadn‚Äôt occurred the Ô¨Åre was just so intense, it‚Äôs caused so much damage.  ‚ÄúYou look at the bush now and it just looks like an atomic bomb went oÔ¨Ä there, it‚Äôs terrible. The regeneration is slow, it‚Äôs still silent, the animals haven‚Äôt come back.‚Äù  Kotvojs said ‚Äúin the area where I live the key thing is hazard reduction‚Äù and the submission is about her experience in her area.  Asked if climate change impacted on the intensity, Kotvojs replied: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to the outcomes from the royal commission because that is looking at all of those reasons and I‚Äôm really pleased that the terms of reference speciÔ¨Åcally identiÔ¨Åed that the royal commission would look at the impact of climate change.‚Äù  Asked for her personal view, she replied: ‚ÄúI can speak about our area ‚Äì because that‚Äôs where I was Ô¨Åghting the Ô¨Åres with the RFS, that‚Äôs where I was defending our home and our property.  ‚ÄúI know what happened. I can‚Äôt speak about other places, I wasn‚Äôt there. But in our place, our farm, my community, the key thing ‚Ä¶ that I could see was hazard reduction.‚Äù  On Wednesday, Kotvojs told ABC Riverina that ‚Äúas a Christian ‚Ä¶ I love everybody and I treat everybody with equality‚Äù.  Kotvojs declined to explain her view on same-sex marriage or the proposed legalisation of discrimination against same-sex couples. ‚ÄúI obey the law ‚Ä¶ and treat everybody with equality,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe law is very clear.‚Äù  The Climate and Health Alliance‚Äôs expert adviser, Dr Liz Hanna, said: ‚ÄúThere can be no denying that the bushÔ¨Åres that tore through communities in Eden-Monaro last summer were greatly intensiÔ¨Åed by climate change and our fossil-fuelled global warming.  ‚ÄúClimate change is not only here, it is accelerating, and the whole world is suÔ¨Äering. Last summer Australia burned, right now Siberia is burning.‚Äù  Hanna said people in Eden-Monaro had ‚Äúmet the frightening face of climate change‚Äù and ‚Äúwant a candidate who listens to the science and supports urgent climate action‚Äù.   Kotvojs has previously said that ‚Äúsolar activity‚Äù is the primary driver of climate change, that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù it increases cyclones and that the risk to PaciÔ¨Åc nations is overstated because some, such as Tuvalu, have increased land mass.  Earlier in June, Kotvojs told Guardian Australia she stood by those statements. She also criticised native grassland laws, saying they ‚Äúcontradict in various areas‚Äù and that inconsistencies have ‚Äúa perverse eÔ¨Äect in relation to the native grasslands and the environment‚Äù.

Guardian-2020-59.txt," Likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK is ‚Äòrapidly accelerating‚Äô Such deadly heat may become regular occurrence later this century, scientists Ô¨Ånd 

Damian Carrington Environment editor Tue 30 Jun 2020 16.00 BST 


 The likelihood of the UK experiencing deadly 40C temperatures for the Ô¨Årst time is ‚Äúrapidly accelerating‚Äù due to the climate crisis, scientists have found.  The research shows that such searing heat could become a regular occurrence by the end of the century unless carbon emissions are cut to zero. Global heating has already made UK heatwaves 30 times more likely and extreme temperatures led to 3,400 early deaths from 2016-19.  The highest temperature recorded in the UK is 38.7C, set in Cambridge in July 2019, while the summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record. The new analysis found an increasing risk of even higher temperatures.   Today, a high of 40C is expected once every few centuries. But this would be every 15 years in a medium emissions scenario, in which carbon cuts are made but not enough to meet the 1.5C or 2C limits agreed by nations in the 2015 Paris climate deal. In a worst-case scenario, with emissions continuing the trend of recent decades unchecked, somewhere in the UK would reach 40C every 3.5 years.  The new analysis follows research in 2019 that used the same medium emissions scenario to indicate that by 2050 London will have the same climate that Istanbul has today, Leeds will be like Melbourne, CardiÔ¨Ä like Montevideo in Uruguay, and Edinburgh like Paris. All these foreign cities have already broken 40C.  ‚ÄúThe probability of recording 40C, or above, in the UK is now rapidly accelerating,‚Äù said the scientists in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. Its lead author, Nikolaos Christidis, at the Met OÔ¨Éce Hadley Centre, said: ‚ÄúThe rate of change is remarkable.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLast year, we had the record temperature in the UK and [Public Health England] reported spikes in mortality,‚Äù Christidis said. ‚ÄúWhen these kinds of events happen, we have detrimental impacts to our transport infrastructure, agricultural catastrophes and water shortages. We need to reduce our vulnerability to these kinds of impacts.‚Äù  Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds and not part of the Met OÔ¨Éce study, said: ‚ÄúHeatwaves are a real risk to life in the UK, especially if we do not begin modifying our homes, workplaces and hospitals to manage their expected overheating.‚Äù  The government‚Äôs oÔ¨Écial advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June ‚Äúthe UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including ‚Ä¶ overheating‚Äù.  ‚ÄúHowever, we should note that in terms of heatwaves, the UK will get oÔ¨Ä lightly compared with most other nations,‚Äù said Forster. ‚ÄúHeatwaves in the major crop-growing regions of the world could have more profound eÔ¨Äects, both globally and for the UK.‚Äù  The Met OÔ¨Éce research combined temperature measurements at 1km scale across the UK with 16 large-scale climate models to calculate the likelihood of an extreme temperature being reached somewhere in the nation in a particular year.  The signiÔ¨Åcantly larger risk in the high-emissions scenario compared with the medium- emissions scenario shows cutting carbon emissions makes a big diÔ¨Äerence in reducing the frequency of extreme heat, from breaching 40C once every 3.5 years to once every 15 years.  The scientists also examined the likelihood of exceeding 35C. This occurs in the UK about every Ô¨Åve years at present, but would be an annual occurrence by the end of the century in either emissions scenario.  The south-east and south regions of the UK are most aÔ¨Äected by the rising heat, because other regions beneÔ¨Åt more from the cooling inÔ¨Çuence of the Atlantic ocean. The study found that many areas in the north for which 30C is extremely rare may exceed that level at least once per decade by 2100.  Some scientists argue that the high-emissions scenario is unrealistic given the action being taken by nations to at least curb carbon emissions. However, Forster said: ‚ÄúFortunately, the   increasing use of fossil fuels portrayed in [the high-emissions scenario] is unlikely, but the average temperature levels seen at the end of the century under this scenario still remain a real risk if some of the worst-case ampliÔ¨Åcation eÔ¨Äects in the Earth system come to pass, such as massive permafrost thawing.‚Äù "
Guardian-2020-60.txt,"  Democrats say they have a bold climate plan but Republicans have other plans 
Plan will be fodder for election-year attacks from Republicans who will frame it as economy-killing and a grab-bag of Democratic social policies Emily Holden in Washington Tue 30 Jun 2020 17.29 BST  


House Democrats on Tuesday released an ambitious and wide-ranging climate crisis plan on par with what scientists say the world will have to do to avert catastrophic warming.  But the US government remains far from ready to seriously tackle the problem, and the action plan will be fodder for election-year attacks from Republicans who will frame it as economy- killing and a grab-bag of Democratic social policies.  The Democrat plan, the details of which the Guardian reported on Monday, endorses a goal of   essentially eliminating US climate pollution by 2050. Some House Republicans, including the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, have backed that general timeline in principle. That is where any signiÔ¨Åcant overlap ends.  The two parties have long been locked in a culture war over how to address the escalating emergency, even as two-thirds of Americans think the government should do more on climate and a majority support a range of actions. Political observers see a blue wave in November ‚Äì where Democrats regain the Senate and the White House ‚Äì as the only shot at signiÔ¨Åcant climate legislation any time soon. Even with a controlling interest in government, substantial policies would probably be hamstrung by moderates and lawmakers from states that depend on the fossil fuel industry.  Unveiling the proposals on Tuesday, the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, nodded to the political divide over climate, saying: ‚ÄúI wish it weren‚Äôt a Ô¨Åght. I wish it were a coming together. But it will be a Ô¨Åght as long as it needs to be.‚Äù  Sarah Hunt, a conservative who works in clean energy policy and co-founded the non-partisan Rainey Center, said the plan ‚Äúgives little reason to hope we will have a serious discussion about climate legislation in the near future‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe Democratic plan does not set the table for meaningful bipartisan conversation leading to actionable legislation. This table is not even in a restaurant congressional Republicans will enter,‚Äù she said, because it includes issues like support for labor unions and electoral reform that could beneÔ¨Åt Democrats.  Republicans on the House select climate committee that wrote the plan quickly criticized the report, saying they were cut out from the process. The ranking Republican, Garret Graves, touted ‚Äúpolicies rooted in innovation lower the cost of energy, drive economic growth, and cut emissions‚Äù, without ‚Äúincreasing costs on working families‚Äù or adding ‚Äúburdensome regulations‚Äù. He praised a ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù in natural gas ‚Äì a climate change contributor ‚Äì for boosting a shift away from burning coal. And he pointed to China and developing nations as the sources of most emissions growth.  The action plan outlines recommendations for zeroing out climate pollution from new buildings by 2030, from new vehicles by 2035 and from electricity by 2040.  Republicans, meanwhile, have oÔ¨Äered little in the way of details about how they would achieve science-based climate goals. Many for years have denied the crisis is even happening or that it is manmade.  If the two sides could come to the table, other experts say there is some room for bipartisan agreement.  Leah Stokes, an assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies climate policy, noted that the Democrat proposal emphasizes the need for negative emissions technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide, ideas that have been favored by Republicans in the Senate. It also shows an openness to nuclear energy, which is often a sticking point for environmental advocates who say the power source ‚Äì although zero-carbon ‚Äì is still extractive.  The 538-page document includes dozens of references to narrower climate proposals that have   support from Republican lawmakers, including eÔ¨Äorts to reduce the costs of wind energy, geothermal and hydropower.  ‚ÄúRepublicans need to come to the table to negotiate on climate change, for their own children‚Äôs sake,‚Äù Stokes said. ‚ÄúEven if their children are in their 40s! Because climate change is happening now.‚Äù  Stokes said if the plan were enacted ‚Äúwe would have a hope of taking on the climate crisis at the scale and pace necessary‚Äù. At the same time, some advocates on the left began to criticize it as not serious enough.  ‚ÄúThis is not an emergency response,‚Äù said Laura Berry, research director for The Climate Mobilization. Berry said the plan outlines a ‚Äúleisurely, three-decade transition to a cleaner economy‚Äù.  Already, average global temperatures are more than 1C higher than before industrialization, and on track to rise 2C more. The eÔ¨Äects are already being felt. A 3C hotter world would be devastating ‚Äì within the century, major cities would be submerged by rising seas and coastal Ô¨Çooding, droughts that threaten food supplies would be widespread and heatwaves in many parts of the world would become insuÔ¨Äerable.  The US is the biggest historical emitter of the pollution that has caused the problem, followed by China. It is set to withdraw from a landmark international agreement to start curbing emissions just after the election in November, even if Donald Trump is not re-elected. Trump has revoked US climate eÔ¨Äorts and supported fossil fuels.  The Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, meanwhile, has pledged to pursue a timeline similar to what House Democrats have proposed. Donald Trump‚Äôs refusal to concede ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ risks jeopardising the transition for president elect Joe Biden, vice president elect Kamala Harris, and all those who believe in justice. It could disrupt eÔ¨Äorts to take rapid action on the escalating pandemic, the climate crisis, and the migrant emergency in Central America. Trump‚Äôs false accusations of voter fraud are already being thrown out of courts, and appear to subvert the very foundations of democracy. "
Guardian-2020-7.txt,"Fri 22 May 2020 07.26 Anthony Albanese has demanded the deputy prime minister and Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, apologise for observing that a lot of people ‚Äúset their hair on fire‚Äù about climate change, given the recent experience of the catastrophic summer of bushfires . The Labor leader said McCormack‚Äôs comment on Friday was ‚Äúentirely inappropriate‚Äù given the government had conceded that climate change was one of the factors in the fires ‚Äúthat saw thousands of homes lost, that saw millions of hectares burnt, and that had a devastating impact on the communities of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia‚Äù. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say to Michael McCormack that he should reflect on those comments and retract them, and we need to be very careful about the language that we use,‚Äù the Labor leader said. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to climate change, it is real, we do need action.‚Äù McCormack made the quip at a press conference in Canberra earlier in the day. Asked by a reporter whether he supported Australia adopting a target of net zero emissions by 2050, the Nationals leader replied: ‚ÄúIt is 2020, we‚Äôre talking about 30 years in advance and a lot of people, I know, set their hair on fire about climate change and all the rest of it ‚Äì yes, it‚Äôs important, for the farmers, it‚Äôs important, for their factories, it‚Äôs important.‚Äù Deputy PM 'very concerned' over reports China's power plants warned not to buy Australian coal Read more It is not the first time the deputy prime minister has decried community activism. Last November, McCormack railed against ‚Äúinner-city raving lunatics‚Äù and ‚Äúpure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies‚Äù ‚Äì people linking climate change and prolonged drought to bushfires. On Friday McCormack said although addressing climate change was important, so were jobs ‚Äúfor here and now‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important is we continue on a path to lower emissions, and we‚Äôre doing that while at the same time not taxing farmers out of business and making sure as best we can [that] we can have a manufacturing industry, we can have people working in factories and industry and we‚Äôre not sending everything offshore to countries where they couldn‚Äôt care less about making sure they lower emissions. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing it in a right and responsible way while at the same time protecting the interests that protect Australia.‚Äù Climate change and the overhang from the bushfires will be a significant issue in the looming Eden-Monaro byelection triggered by the retirement of the Labor incumbent, Mike Kelly. Labor has preselected Kristy McBain, the Bega Valley shire mayor, as its candidate. Business, unions and green groups call for sustainable Covid-19 recovery with clean energy transition Read more The Liberals are expected to settle on a candidate on Sunday. The party had hoped to field Andrew Constance, the New South Wales transport minister, but he withdrew after an acrimonious stand-off with John Barilaro , the deputy premier of NSW and state Nationals leader ‚Äì who had wanted to switch to the federal arena for some time. Barilaro blamed McCormack for failing to champion his candidacy. The government has avoided committing to the net zero target despite being a signatory to the Paris agreement. The energy minister, Angus Taylor, said on Tuesday that signatories to the Paris agreement, including Australia, had agreed to hit net zero ‚Äúin the second half of the century‚Äù. But scientists say in order to meet the central Paris goal of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C ‚Äì a commitment Australia adopted in 2015 ‚Äì signatories need to hit net zero by 2050. Major business groups, including the Business Council of Australia and the Ai Group, say Australia should adopt the net zero by 2050 target. Earlier this month the Ai Group called for the two biggest economic challenges in memory ‚Äì recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and cutting greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äì to be addressed together , saying it would boost growth and put the country on a firm long-term footing. Every Australian state has signed up to net zero emissions by 2050, and these commitments are expressed either as targets or aspirational goals.

Guardian-2020-8.txt," Young climate activists call for EU to radically reform farming sector Fridays for Future to publish letter urging reform of common agricultural policy ahead of European commission meeting Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent
 Fri 22 May 2020 07.00 BST 

 The EU‚Äôs farming sector needs radical reform, and the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be rewritten if the climate crisis is to be tackled, a group of young climate activists will urge.  Fridays for Future, founded by teenagers in the wake of Greta Thunberg‚Äôs school strikes, will confront the European commission‚Äôs vice-president, Frans Timmermans, online to call for new plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, and replace subsidies based on the amount of land farmed with payments for farmers supplying public goods, such as clean water, clean air and lower carbon emissions.  ‚Äú[We] demand a pathway to climate neutrality for the EU‚Äôs agricultural and food sector,‚Äù the    activists wrote in an open letter published ahead of the virtual meeting. ‚ÄúWe need to transform direct payments into payments for public goods. Public money needs to Ô¨Çow into the transition to sustainable, climate-friendly and peasant [sic] agriculture. We need a new evidence-based and just CAP.‚Äù  The CAP is worth close to ‚Ç¨60bn a year, and costs roughly ‚Ç¨114 annually per citizen. However, the system has been blamed for the increase in intensive farming, overuse of pesticides and poor attention to soil conservation and wildlife protection.  Earlier this week, the EU published its biodiversity strategy, which would devote ‚Ç¨20bn a year to boosting wildlife, and require the planting of 3bn trees in the next decade, but stopped short of the sweeping reform of the CAP that campaigners want.  ‚ÄúCurrent agropolicy is an immediate threat to our future,‚Äù Tilman von Samson, one of the activists, told the Guardian. ‚ÄúNot only because the CAP is inactive in reducing emissions ‚Äì much worse, it is gambling away the potential for hope that lies in agriculture [which] can be a climate buÔ¨Äer.‚Äù  Reform to subsidies could reward farmers for conserving carbon in their soil and vegetation, which would beneÔ¨Åt nature as well as helping the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The EU‚Äôs farm to fork strategy would cut pesticide use, boost organic farming and halve the use of antibiotics on farm animals by 2030, as well as improving farming practices to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  Fridays for Future wants the EU to go further as part of its European Green Deal, the centrepiece of the bloc‚Äôs strategy which is meant to steer Europe to net zero emissions by 2050. The European commission is trying to push the policy ahead of crunch climate talks, called Cop26, postponed to next year from their original date of this November in Glasgow.  Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, hailed the green deal plan as Europe‚Äôs equivalent of the US putting a man on the moon in the last century, a transformative proposal that would reach into every aspect of people‚Äôs lives, from energy and transport to food and nature.  But von Samson told the Guardian: ‚ÄúEverything that has been discussed yet is incompatible with the Paris Agreement, and the future into which the current CAP proposals will lead us are as far from one another as the man on the moon and his home planet. We want to remind the commission of their responsibility. If they want to make a real change, they have to start with a new CAP.‚Äù "
Guardian-2020-9.txt,"  The Guardian view on climate and Covid: time to make diÔ¨Äerent choices 
Editorial 
Despite some Ô¨Åne words about the environmental crisis, ministers are pushing ahead with a trade bill that threatens to damage the planet 
 Fri 22 May 2020 18.07 BST 

 The dust storms that devastated the US prairie during the Great Depression were the  worst ecological disaster in American history. They were also, partly, manmade. Decades of farming in the Great Plains had rid the topsoil of its native grass, leaving nothing to prevent Ô¨Åelds crumbling to dust when drought struck in 1931. Across the Dust Bowl in midwest America, millions of acres of farmland were swept away in brown blizzards. Forced oÔ¨Ä the land, hungry families headed west in search of new jobs and lives. The dust blew so far east that it settled on the White House lawn.   Almost 90 years ago the US president‚Äôs response was not to lie about the scale of disaster or blame others. Instead, Franklin D Roosevelt launched one of his New Deal‚Äôs signature relief programmes: the Civilian Conservation Corps. Its mission was to put unemployed Americans to work. More than 3 million people planted 3bn trees, built shelter belts across the Great Plains to reduce the risk of dust storms, and created 700 state parks. FDR‚Äôs legacy survives, but his policy is venerated more in name than in deed.  That needs to change. The world faces mass unemployment caused by the Covid crisis and a climate emergency which could spell the end of humanity. But there is no sign in the UK of the eÔ¨Äort required to combine our need for jobs with the pursuit of alternatives to fossil fuels and a concomitant reduction in greenhouse gases.  The coronavirus pandemic and the environmental crisis share the same roots: humans‚Äô success as a species in arrogating global resources for themselves and the consequent ecological disturbance. This is increasing viral exchanges ‚Äì Ô¨Årst from animal to human, then from human to human ‚Äì on a pandemic scale. Our environmental footprint is too large for the planet, leading to accelerated species extinctions and atmospheric chaos. Both the Covid and climate catastrophes are not misfortunes that befell us. They are part of a pattern of decisions that we humans are taking. We need to make diÔ¨Äerent choices.  Parts of the Conservative party are keenly attuned to the political salience of greenery. This week the environment minister Zac Goldsmith put his name to a letter calling for a ‚Äúglobal shift towards more sustainable forms of agriculture and land use [which] would provide a strong opportunity for job creation‚Äù.  These are Ô¨Åne words. But we must judge the government on its actions. There‚Äôs no sign that cabinet ministers are pushing to transition to a cleaner world with a Green New Deal or seeking to emulate FDR in putting the jobless to work in conservation. We ought to be importing production techniques that emit fewer greenhouse gases and strengthen food security. Instead we are opening up to foreign businesses that may do the opposite.  Liz Truss, the trade secretary, appears to want to agree a deal with Washington that could see the UK accepting imports of climate-unfriendly US factory farming that it previously rejected, or letting American-made cars that emit higher levels of CO on to Britain‚Äôs streets. Trade deals that privilege industrial competitiveness without taking into account the cost of carbon provide a strong incentive for Britain to oÔ¨Äshore greenhouse gas emissions to meet its net-zero target.    The absence of politically powerful interests outside of business pushing for global cooperation over health or the environment is a concern. The threat of a boycott by British supermarkets helped derail a Brazilian law that could enable the faster destruction of the Amazon rainforest, a planetary rampart against the rise of future zoonotic diseases. But MPs sit powerless to vote on such matters. Under government plans the Commons won‚Äôt have oversight of, or votes on, trade deals. Instead, after the Brexit transition ends, ministers gain unchecked powers over trade.  The size, speed and scale of action provoked by the Covid-19 outbreak show what is possible if governments can set aside short-term thinking. Ministers must adopt the same approach to the climate emergency. They should drop beggar-thy-neighbour policies and back meaningful   ways to enforce rules for global green goods ‚Äì or else the government will be pushing a form of globalisation that diminishes the chances of human survival.

Readying for Climate Change While Calling It Anything But
By Christopher Flavelle

But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.

A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn't use the terms ""climate change"" or ""global warming,"" nor does South Carolina's proposal. Instead, Texas refers to ""changing coastal conditions"" and South Carolina talks about the ""destabilizing effects and unpredictability"" of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.

Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase ""climate change"" in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.

The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.

The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven't yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.

The money is distributed according to a formula benefiting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.

Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana ($1.2 billion), Florida ($633 million), North Carolina ($168 million) and South Carolina ($158 million), all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.

The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn't yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.

Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the United States Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding, citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.

Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida's proposal calls it ""a key overarching challenge,"" while North Carolina pledges to anticipate ""how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects"" will affect state residents.

The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program's goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn't use the terms ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" but referred to ""changing environmental conditions.""

Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their ""current and future risks."" And when those risks included flooding -- the most costly type of disaster nationwide -- states were instructed to account for ""continued sea level rise,"" which is one consequence of global warming.

A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.

Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was ""a case of picking your battles.""

""When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not,"" Mr. Gimont said. ""You've got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it's best to draw a middle road on these things.""

Texas released a draft version of its plan in November. That draft said the state faced ""changing coastal conditions,"" as well as a future in which both wildfires and extreme heat were expected to increase. In response, the state proposes better flood control, buying and demolishing homes in high-risk areas and giving counties money for their own projects.

But state officials in Texas, where Republicans control the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature, were silent on what is causing the changes. The report does not cite climate change or global warming, though ""climate change"" pops up in footnotes citing articles and papers with that phrase in their titles.

Brittany Eck, a spokeswoman for the Texas General Land Office, which produced the proposal, did not respond to questions about the choice of language or the role of climate change in making disasters worse. In an email, she said Texas would distribute the funding based on ""accepted scientific research, evidence and historical data to determine projects that provide the greatest value to benefit ratio to protect affected communities from future events.""

Some local politicians in hard-hit areas of Texas are outspoken. Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat and the top elected official in Harris County, which includes Houston and which suffered some of the worst effects of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, said that addressing the effects of climate change was a top issue for her constituents.

""Harris County is Exhibit A for how the climate crisis is impacting the daily lives of residents in Texas,"" Ms. Hidalgo said in a statement. ""If we're serious about breaking the cycle of flooding and recovery we have to shift the paradigm on how we do things, and that means putting science above politics.""

In South Carolina, which like Texas is controlled by Republicans in both legislative chambers and the governor's office, the state's proposal likewise makes no mention of climate change. It cites sea-level rise once, and only to say that it won't be addressed.

The state's flood-reduction efforts ""will only address riverine and surface flooding, not storm surge or sea-level rise issues,"" according to its proposal.

That is despite the fact that sea levels and storm surges are increasing across the coastal southeastern United States because of climate change, federal scientists wrote in a sweeping 2018 report. The report's authors noted that Charleston, S.C., broke its record for flooding in 2016, at 50 days, and that ""this increase in high-tide flooding is directly tied to sea-level rise.""

Megan Moore, a spokeswoman for South Carolina's Department of Administration, said by email that the proposal ""is designed to increase resilience to and reduce or eliminate long-term risk of loss of life or property based on the repetitive losses sustained in this state."" She did not respond to questions about why the proposal did not address climate change.

One of the states acknowledged that weather conditions were changing and seas were rising, but still mostly avoided the term climate change. Louisiana, whose location at the mouth of the Mississippi River makes it one of the states most threatened by climate change, intends to use the $1.2 billion it will receive to better map and prepare for future flooding -- a major peril for countless low-lying areas -- said Pat Forbes, executive director of the state's Office of Community Development, which is managing the money.

""We realize we've got to get better, because it's going to get worse,"" Mr. Forbes said.

The state, where both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans but the governor is a Democrat, submitted a proposal that makes references to climate change, noting that the risks of flooding ""will continue to escalate in a warming world.""

Still, the 91-page report uses the phrase ""climate change"" only once, at the end of an appendix on its final page.

Mr. Forbes called climate change ""not that important a thing for an action plan,"" and said that mostly leaving the phrase out of the document was not intentional. He said the purpose of the proposal was to demonstrate to the federal government that Louisiana knows what it wants to do with the money.

""Our governor has acknowledged on multiple occasions that we expect the flooding to be more frequent and worse in the future, not better,"" Mr. Forbes said. ""So we've got to have an adaptive process here that constantly makes us safer.""

Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. ""Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards,"" wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governor's office.

In North Carolina, which has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, the proposal argued that the state was trying to anticipate ""how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects will impact the needs of North Carolina's vulnerable populations.""

Shana Udvardy, a climate resilience analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the failure to confront global warming made it more important for governments to at least call the problem by its name.

""We really need every single state, local and federal official to speak clearly,"" Ms. Udvardy said. ""The polls indicate that the majority of Americans understand that climate change is happening here and now.""

Others were more sympathetic. Marion McFadden, who preceded Mr. Gimont as head of disaster-recovery grants at HUD during the Obama administration, said the department was responding to the political realities in conservative states. She described the $16 billion grant program as ""all about climate change,"" but said some states would sooner refuse the money than admit that global warming is real.

""HUD is requiring them to be explicit about everything other than the concept that climate change is responsible,"" said Ms. McFadden, who is now senior vice president for public policy at Enterprise Community Partners, which worked with states to meet the program's requirements. Insistence on saying the words raises the risk ""that they may walk away."" "

Democrats' Climate Plan to Embrace Racial Justice
By Christopher Flavelle

The policy road map, expected on Tuesday, could guide the party if it gains control of Congress and the White House in November.

WASHINGTON -- Democrats in Congress are expected to make public on Tuesday a broad list of proposals on climate change, laying out in detail what could become the starting point for their climate agenda if the party regains control of Congress and the White House next year.

The 538-page report sets a range of targets including ensuring that every new car sold by 2035 emits no greenhouse gases, eliminating overall emissions from the power sector by 2040, and all but eliminating the country's total emissions by 2050.

It also calls for requiring companies, and by extension consumers, to pay for emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but in a way that gives money back to low- and moderate-income households. In the past, efforts like these have been politically difficult to achieve: In 2018, Gov. Jay Inslee tried and failed to enact a version in Washington State.

The package also approaches climate change as a matter of racial injustice. The report cites the police killing of George Floyd in its opening paragraph and goes on to argue that communities of color are also more at risk from the effects of climate change. The report says the government should prioritize minority communities for new spending on energy and infrastructure.

""We have to focus on environmental-justice communities,"" said Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida and chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, which compiled the report. ""There is an awakening across the country to systemic racism, and this is a report that at its center, at its core, focuses on those communities.""

Few of the proposals are likely to go anywhere this year because they would require support from the Republican-led Senate as well as President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax. But as a political statement the package is notable because it presents what Democrats call a comprehensive legislative agenda for climate change at a time when public support is on the rise.

In 2016, only 38 percent of adults in the United States said dealing with global climate change should be ""a top priority for the president and Congress,"" according to the Pew Research Center. By this year, that number had jumped to 52 percent.

Still, a major challenge remains: how to address the demands of climate activists without alienating more centrist voters.

Last year, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced the Green New Deal, which called for getting 100 percent of the country's power from renewable and zero-emissions within 10 years. Republicans have pilloried her proposals, using (and at times mischaracterizing) them to try to paint Democrats as willing to sacrifice the economy in the pursuit of environmental goals. The Democratic leadership has sought to distance itself from the package.

A growing coalition of Republicans led by the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, have moved in recent months to embrace solutions to climate change. Those measures focus on developing technologies that can capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants or other industrial facilities and store them so they don't enter the atmosphere, rather than limiting fossil fuels.

The economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has put new pressure on Democrats, who must balance voters' concerns about their jobs with policies to cut emissions. Since the start of the pandemic, many Republicans have characterized even modest efforts to tackle climate change as having too high an economic cost for Americans who are struggling financially.

Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana, the leading Republican on the climate committee, said the two parties had found some common ground, including on the need to make communities more resilient to natural disasters.

But where the two sides diverged, he said, was on the question of the continued use of fossil fuels. Mr. Graves said Democrats' view boiled down to, ""fossil fuels are evil.""

""In my opinion, that ignores the science,"" Mr. Graves said, stressing that he had not seen the report that Democrats planned to release. ""If you can find ways to utilize the fuels, but have as good or better emissions, then that is a viable option.""

Ms. Castor said the measures included in the report, including new federal spending on energy and infrastructure, would create new jobs and opportunities.

The proposals call for cutting emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, from the oil and gas sector two-thirds by 2025, making all new residential and commercial buildings effectively zero-emissions by 2030 and setting ""climate stewardship practice goals across all U.S. farmland.""

The report, which comes 11 years after House Democrats passed a bill to impose a cost on companies that emit greenhouse gases, only to watch it fail in the Senate, again calls for some version of that same approach, though the authors emphasized that such a system would have to be implemented with care.

""Carbon pricing is not a silver bullet,"" the report says, adding that energy-intensive industries that try to reduce pollution should remain ""on a level playing field with foreign competitors that use dirtier technologies.""

In a sign of how quickly the discussion around climate change has shifted, the report also embraces positions that might have seemed radical just a few years ago.

It cites a 2018 United Nations report that found preventing a dangerous level of global warming is not possible simply by cutting emissions, and requires finding a way to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as well. Congress must ""dramatically increase federal investment in carbon removal research and development,"" the report says.

The report also says that as hurricanes, flooding and other effects of climate change accelerate, the government must spend more to fortify vulnerable communities with better infrastructure, but that doing so won't be enough. In some cases, people will need to move.

""Communities need support developing longer-term strategies, including options to relocate and resettle willing neighborhoods or communities,"" the report reads. Federally funded programs should ""consider the trade-offs of relocation and protection.""

The prospect of climate-driven migration, both internal and across borders, is so serious that it must be incorporated into the country's national defense and homeland security planning, the report adds.

""Developing countries are especially ill-prepared to face the impacts of climate change,"" the report says. ""The resulting humanitarian and refugee crises, if unchecked, have the potential to become national security threats."" "

As Australia Faces a Fire Crisis, a Climate-Change Denier Rallies the Troops
By Damien Cave

Scroll through the Facebook page of Craig Kelly, a conservative politician, and you'll see why the country has not taken strong action on global warming.

SUTHERLAND, Australia -- Throughout Australia's devastating fire season, one Facebook page has rallied an angry public like no other, with more shares and comments than anything coming from the prime minister or the country's largest environmental groups.

That page belongs to Craig Kelly -- a former furniture salesman who has spent a decade in Parliament setting himself up as the climate-change denier in chief.

Now, in Australia's dark hour, Mr. Kelly has found his moment.

As the country fears it is being condemned to a fiery future by heat and drought, Mr. Kelly has been gathering and goading a right-wing tribe under the banner of posts that shout in all caps: ""Bushfires have nothing to do with 'climate change""' or ""Beware of climate alarmists: Everything they tell you is a lie.""

Mr. Kelly, 56, insists that he is just trying to protect everyday Australians from higher energy prices and lost jobs in coal and other industries.

But with posts and comments on his Facebook page that cherry-pick data and encourage violence against environmentalists, he has emerged as the public face of a parallel universe -- the potent force that helps keep the government, despite the wishes of a broad majority of Australians, from taking stronger action on climate change.

For other politicians, this is a time to show sympathy for the fire victims and promise help.

Mr. Kelly prefers pugilism. He argues that the fires are no worse than in the past, that arsonists and socialists are to blame for the blazes, that coal is winning, that Arctic ice is not melting -- and that those who disagree are no better than the censors in Orwell's ""1984.""

""It's all rather nefarious,"" said Michael E. Mann, an American climate scientist on sabbatical in Australia, who was once a target of climate denialists. ""The loyal soldiers of the fossil fuel industry like Kelly promote the talking points and incite a rabble.""

Many Australians, even climate scientists, dismiss Mr. Kelly as a political Falstaff, outrageous if powerless. But his following has grown to include a wide swath of the country, including rural firefighters who share his Facebook posts, and his efforts have frequently aligned with Prime Minister Scott Morrison's attempts to steer people away from viewing the fires as a turning point for the nation's approach on climate issues.

Before Mr. Morrison started emphasizing that the best way to fight future fires would be through more preventive burning rather than serious action on global warming, Mr. Kelly was hammering the point. He blamed ""green madness"" and ""climate alarmists"" -- a term used by President Trump this week in Davos, Switzerland -- for exaggerating the role of climate change and preventing the defensive burns, even though fire officials have said the problem is resources and time, not politics.

Echoing Mr. Kelly's argument that cutting Australia's greenhouse gas emissions will not prevent fires, the prime minister has also moved straight on to rebuilding and recovery rather than addressing the public's concerns about the warming climate.

""It's a very cynical strategy based on the idea that the fires will end, the drought will be broken and people will move on,"" said John Hewson, a former leader of the center-right Liberal Party, to which Mr. Morrison and Mr. Kelly belong. The prime minister, he added, ""is trying to be seen to be doing a lot, but he's actually doing very little.""

Mr. Kelly and Mr. Morrison, who serve in adjoining districts with lots of churches, small apartments and workers in the trades, have each other to thank for where they are. Mr. Kelly and other right-wing lawmakers toppled Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in a 2018 party coup, making Mr. Morrison the new leader. Mr. Morrison then overruled the party's preference for a moderate alternative to Mr. Kelly, protecting his candidacy.

It wasn't just Mr. Morrison. Mr. Turnbull and another prime minister, Tony Abbott, previously also pushed aside moderate challengers to ensure that Mr. Kelly returned to Parliament -- a sign of his usefulness to leaders in rallying their conservative base.

""He's the tail wagging the dog,"" said Tom Kristensen, an artist, climate activist and volunteer firefighter in Mr. Kelly's district who has closely tracked his Facebook posts. ""He's part of a tiny minority that has too much power.""

Australia's conservative media outlets, dominated by Rupert Murdoch, have helped. In 2012, two years after Mr. Kelly was first elected, he drew a flood of media attention after joining Mr. Abbott, another climate denialist who would soon become prime minister, in opposing a plan to put a price on carbon emissions, describing it as a ""poisonous, toxic tax."" In 2013, he joined Alan Jones, a notorious conservative radio host, for a ""wind power fraud rally"" in front of Parliament.

Since then, Mr. Kelly has made regular appearances on Mr. Jones's radio show, as well as on the Murdoch-owned Sky News, where he appeared on Tuesday night to talk climate.

""It's just political opportunism at its worst,"" Mr. Hewson said. ""Sky, which is running its own anti-climate agenda, has been using him as a show pony. They can feed him lines and get him to say things.""

Mr. Kelly has at times gone too far even for his own party. Early this month, he brought his views on the fires to an interview on British television with Piers Morgan, the conservative commentator, who was so appalled that he called Mr. Kelly ""disgraceful.""

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

In response, some members of Mr. Morrison's cabinet tried to distance themselves from Mr. Kelly. David Littleproud, the minister for the drought, dismissed Mr. Kelly as a ""sideshow&#34; who ""doesn't represent the views of the government.""

(Critics have noted that Mr. Littleproud had only recently questioned whether climate change was being caused by human activity.)

After the debacle, Mr. Morrison called for a moratorium in his party on interviews with the international news media.

Nevertheless, Mr. Kelly embraced a lengthy interview with The New York Times, after announcing, ""I have to be careful because the prime minister told us not to talk to international media.""

Over the phone, Mr. Kelly argued that his enemies had called him a denier to make him sound like a Holocaust denier. Mr. Kelly, who has no college degree and no scientific expertise, said he agreed that temperatures had been rising since the 1970s, but added that the human contribution was ""up for debate."" (Scientists say this is not in dispute.)

He also insisted that the drought fueling this season's fires was unrelated to climate change (though there is evidence that warming temperatures have been a major contributor, in part by pushing rainfall farther south). And he said that these fires were bad, but not that bad.

""People have forgotten our past -- that we have had bushfires equivalent to this,"" he said.

The reality is that this season's fires are unique for several reasons. They have covered a geographic spread beyond the fires of the past, in a year without the El Ni√±o conditions that usually accompany the country's worst fire seasons. And they began as Australia endured its hottest, driest year on record.

Several months after the blazes started, scorching subtropical rainforest in September, they have burned 16 million acres, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and killed at least 29 people.

Those numbers are hard to find on Mr. Kelly's Facebook page.

""Craig Kelly is an excellent example of a scientifically illiterate person with a public platform,"" said Jo√´lle Gergis, a leading climate scientist and writer at the Australian National University.

""His opinions are ignorant and harmful,"" she added, ""because they confuse people rather than educate.""

Rajendra K. Pachauri, 79, Is Dead; Led Nobel-Winning Climate Agency
By John Schwartz

Sharing the prize with Al Gore, his U.N. organization was recognized for its work on global warming, but his career was undone by harassment accusations.

Rajendra K. Pachauri, a charismatic voice on the risks of global warming who led the United Nations' climate science agency when it won the Nobel Peace Prize, but whose career ended amid accusations of sexual harassment, died on Thursday at his home in New Delhi. He was 79.

His death was announced by the Energy and Resources Institute in India, the influential policy organization he had headed for 34 years until being replaced in 2015 under the cloud of the harassment accusations, which also led to his departure from the U.N. agency. No cause of death was given, but he had recently undergone surgery for ""a prolonged cardiac ailment,"" according to India Today, a major news outlet.

The institute's chairman, Nitin Desai, said in a statement that Dr. Pachauri's leadership of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ""laid the ground for climate change conversations today.""

Dr. Pachauri was chairman of the panel from 2002 to 2015. In 2007, the Norwegian Nobel Committee jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the group and former Vice President Al Gore ""for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change.""

The panel's reports have detailed the overwhelming scientific evidence in support of climate change. In a statement, the panel noted that a report, known as the Fifth Assessment and published in 2014 under Dr. Pachauri's leadership, provided ""the scientific foundation of the Paris Agreement,"" the 2015 deal among nearly 200 nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The agreement was hailed as a landmark in international cooperation on climate issues, but President Trump is withdrawing the United States from it.

Dr. Pachauri stepped down as chairman of the U.N. panel in 2015, when a researcher at the Indian energy institute, a 29-year-old woman, said he had made lewd advances and sent graphic emails and text messages to her.

Dr. Pachauri denied the accusations, saying he had been hacked. But at least one other employee made similar accusations against him. A case based on the allegations remained unresolved at his death.

The U.N. group said at the time that the decision to replace Dr. Pachauri would ""ensure that the I.P.C.C.'s mission to assess climate change continues without interruption."" In a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, Dr. Pachauri wrote, ""For me the protection of Planet Earth, the survival of all species and sustainability of our ecosystems, is more than a mission"" -- it was ""my religion and my dharma,"" or duty, he said.

Like many other prominent figures in climate science, Dr. Pachauri faced criticism from climate-change denial groups and their allies. Even within the scientific community he was sometimes criticized as having a tendency to combine science and advocacy.

A 2010 review of the U.N. panel's procedures warned that ""straying into advocacy can only hurt I.P.C.C.'s credibility."" However, many well-regarded climate scientists argue that advocacy is an essential part of raising alarms about the threat of climate change.

The researcher who led the 2010 review, Robbert Dijkgraaf, the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., said that the I.P.C.C. ""was very open to suggestions to strengthen the organization"" and that he ""was impressed with Chairman Pachauri's emphasis on scientific rigor and careful processes.""

A former colleague offered a mixed portrait of Dr. Pachauri. Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, a former vice president of the I.P.C.C., praised him in a statement on Twitter for having ""put the climate change challenge and the science behind it on top of the international agenda.""

But be added that Dr. Pachauri ""was sometimes overconfident, as when he refused to quickly acknowledge and correct"" an erroneous estimate in the panel's 2007 report, known as the Fourth Assessment, saying it was ""very likely"" that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035 if current warming trends continued.

""This led to escalated and undue criticism of the organization he chaired,"" Dr. van Ypersele wrote.

Through a spokesman, Mr. Gore said Dr. Pachauri's ""dedication to advance the science and raise global awareness of the climate crisis will endure.""

Rajendra Kumar Pachauri was born on Aug. 20, 1940, in Nainital, a hill station in the foothills of the Himalayas. He said that the stunning setting there had given him a deep affection for nature and made him sensitive to the fragility of the natural world.

He worked variously as an engineer, scientist and economist, with an academic career that took him to the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Jamalpur, in Bihar state, and to North Carolina State University in Raleigh, where he earned a master's degree in industrial engineering in 1972 and a joint doctorate in industrial engineering and economics in 1974.

In 1981 he became chief executive of what would become known as the Energy and Resources Institute, or TERI. Over his career, he wrote or co-wrote some 25 books.

Dr. Panchauri's survivors include his wife, Saroj (Puri) Pachauri, who is a doctor and researcher on family planning and reproductive health; two daughters, Rashmi Pachauri-Rajan and Shonali Pachauri; and a son, Ash Pachauri.

Dr. Pachauri, known familiarly as Patchy, was a vegetarian, both because of his religious commitment as a Hindu and because of his views on the impact of meat production on the climate. He recommended vegetarianism as a way to fight global warming.

""In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time,"" he said in a 2008 interview with The Guardian, ""it clearly is the most attractive opportunity.""

In an interview after the 2007 Peace Prize was announced, Dr. Pachauri urged the nations of the world to act quickly to stop climate change.

""The price of waiting is enormous,"" he said.

NYT-2020-13.txt," Wednesday, April 29, 2020  The New York Times ‚Ä¢ Late Edition Final ‚Ä¢ p. A 1 ‚Ä¢ 1741 words  Science Speaks (But President Rarely Listens)   

By Lisa Friedman and Brad Plumer   

  The president's Covid-19 response has extended the administration's longstanding  practice of undermining scientific expertise for political purposes.  WASHINGTON -At a March visit  with doctors and researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  the public health agency at the heart of  the fight against the coronavirus, President Trump spoke words of praise for  the scientific acumen in the building -particularly his own. ""Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability,"" Mr. Trump said. It was a striking boast, even amid a grave health crisis in which Mr. Trump  has repeatedly contradicted medical experts in favor of his own judgment. But  a disregard for scientific advice has been a defining characteristic of Mr. Trump's administration. As the nation confronts one of its worst public health disasters in generations, a moment that demands a leader willing  to marshal the full might of the American scientific establishment, the White  House is occupied by a president whose  administration, critics say, has diminished the conclusions of scientists in formulating policy, who personally harbors  a suspicion of expert knowledge, and  PHOTO: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the administration's most visible medical expert, has been contradicted by President Trump several times. who often puts his political instincts ahead of the facts. ""Donald Trump is the most anti-science and anti-environment president we've ever had,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. The president's actions, he said, have eroded one of the United States's most enviable assets: the government's deep scientific expertise, built over decades. ""It's extraordinarily crazy and reckless,"" he said. Judd Deere, a White House spokesman,  said in a statement that Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak ""has  put the full power of the federal government to work to slow the spread, save  lives, and place this great country on a data-driven path to opening up again."" Well before winning the presidency, Mr. Trump had publicly questioned science by expressing skepticism about vaccines and suggesting climate change was a hoax fabricated by China.  Once in office, Mr. Trump's administration quickly began work on one of  its most far-reaching policies -the systematic downplaying or ignoring of science in order to weaken environmental health and global warming regulations. Automakers, farmers and others had sought regulatory relief, saying that more flexible rules would still ensure progress on environmental protection while avoiding bureaucratic mandates.  However, in implementing the rollbacks, the administration has marginalized key scientists, disbanded expert advisory boards and suppressed or altered  findings that make clear the dangers of pollution and global warming.  More recently, as the coronavirus outbreak engulfed the nation, Mr. Trump  has repeatedly clashed with his own public health experts. He was slow to react to early internal  warnings to take the outbreak more seriously and has promoted the use of various drugs to fight the virus even as scientists said there was no proof they  would be effective. On Thursday, he suggested that injecting disinfectants might help defeat Covid-19, drawing global condemnation and ridicule. And last week Mr. Trump publicly downplayed a warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the administration's most visible medical expert, that the United States still lacked adequate capacity to test for the coronavirus. ""I don't agree with him on that, no,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I think we're doing a great job on testing."" The president also suggested that the virus might be gone by the fall, a line that was immediately countered by Dr.  Fauci, who said: ""We will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of  that."" Historians and foreign policy experts said the administration's disregard for scientific expertise -combined with the nation's broader retreat from international trade agreements and cross-border defense alliances like NATO -is  diminishing the nation's status on the world stage. ""America's friends feel like they don't even recognize us,"" said Kori Schake, director of foreign and defense  policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research  organization.  Other critics noted that Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw the United States  from the Paris Agreement, a 2015 pact among nations to combat climate change, has left the world adrift on one  of the biggest challenges to face humanity. And now, amid a sweeping global  pandemic, Mr. Trump has said he will  halt funding for the World Health Organization.  Part of what elevated America after World War II, Dr. Schake said, was that  ""we represented modernity in all its advantages,"" whether by creating a polio  vaccine or landing a man on the moon. ""It will be a real struggle to restore the admiration for the United States that is such an important part of our power in the world,"" she said.  The administration faces immense challenges in navigating the coronavirus  outbreak. Shutdowns nationwide have already pushed 26 million people into unemployment. But health experts have converged on a broad agreement that sending people back to work too soon, before measures like a robust testing system are in place, risks causing a surge of new infections, deepening the crisis. In many cases, the administration's guidance broadly follows that scientific understanding. But experts have also warned that Mr. Trump's frequent exhortations to quickly reopen the economy  threaten to muddle a vital public health message at a precarious time.  ""It's precisely because we're in this uncertain and perilous moment that it's all  the more important to rely on the best scientific advice,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of public health law at Georgetown University. Mr. Deere, the White House spokesman, said any suggestion that Mr. Trump hasn't consulted and relied upon health experts and scientific advisers ""is just false."" On Friday Mr. Trump announced a phased approach to reopening the economy that the White House said is  ""based on the advice of public health experts.""  Past administrations have, to varying degrees, disregarded scientific findings that conflicted with political or policy  priorities. For example, the Reagan administration was criticized by health experts for being slow to respond to the  AIDS crisis in the 1980s. And in 2011,  President Barack Obama's top health official overruled Food and Drug Administration scientists who had found that  over-the-counter emergency contraceptives were safe for minors.  But within the Trump administration, the attacks on science and expertise have been far more broad. ""Scientists tell them inconvenient things,"" said Jerry Taylor, president of the Niskanen Center, a centrist research organization, and former climate change  denialist who now advocates for the acceptance of climate science. ""Whether  we're talking about the E.P.A. or we're talking about climate change broadly speaking, or we're talking about the coronavirus, his administration is constantly engaged in magical thinking.""  Critics of the administration's actions both on environmental matters and the virus say that federal policy has been shaped to favor short-term economic gain at the expense of public health. With much of the nation sheltering at home from the coronavirus -bringing  commerce to a halt, sending unemployment skyrocketing and causing turmoil  in the financial markets -the motivations to restart the economy are powerful. But Mr. Taylor of the Niskanen Center said that some conservatives were  incorrectly diagnosing the stay-at-home orders as the main driver of the nation's woes rather than the virus itself. Mr. Taylor likened it to the argument that government action to fight climate change would be too costly in various ways -an argument that overlooks the significant costs of inaction. ""If we  leave the underlying problem unattended,"" he said, ""the economic cost will be  far greater."" Meanwhile, the pandemic hasn't slowed  the administration's environmental rollbacks.  Over the past month the Environmental Protection Agency has issued several  deregulatory policies, including on mercury pollution and automobile emissions, overruling advice from the  agency's own independent advisory  board that such findings lacked scientific rigor. The E.P.A. also refused to tighten air quality standards, despite preliminary research suggesting that long-term  exposure to dirty air could exacerbate the risk of death from the coronavirus. The administration has maintained that it can safeguard health and the environment while loosening restrictions on industry. Andrea Woods, a spokeswoman  for the E.P.A., said, ""We have never ignored the science in making the very  tough policy decisions required of the agency.""  The parallels between the administration's environmental rollbacks and its  coronavirus response are not exact.  When it comes to the coronavirus outbreak, there is still an important counterweight to many of Mr. Trump's impulses, most notably Dr. Fauci. Asked last  week if he felt that experts at the National Institutes of Health were unable to  speak their minds or oppose Mr. Trump, Dr. Fauci was unequivocal. ""Absolutely no,"" he said.  That stands in contrast to the administration's approach on issues like climate change, where officials who have  spoken out have found themselves sidelined.  In July, Rod Schoonover, a State Department intelligence analyst, resigned  in protest after the White House blocked  his discussion of climate science in Congressional testimony. In other instances,  the administration has promoted climate denialists' work and allowed them to insert misrepresentations of scientific  facts into federal documents. Still, there have been some prominent staff shake-ups at health agencies. Before the pandemic began, the C.D.C.  had reduced its staff in Beijing from approximately 47 to 14 under the Trump  administration, a move that critics have said may have complicated its ability to confront the outbreak earlier. An agency  spokesman said it had been done to focus more on ""technical collaboration"" with China, which requires fewer people.  In February, Nancy Messonnier, a top  C.D.C. official, was removed from overseeing the agency's coronavirus response. Dr. Messonnier had warned that  Americans need to prepare for a ""significant disruption"" at a time when Mr.  Trump was insisting that the virus was ""very well under control in our country."" Last week, Rick Bright was dismissed  as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, the agency involved in work on  coronavirus treatments. Mr. Bright said  he had been removed after urging caution in expanding access to hydroxychloroquine, the controversial treatment  embraced by Mr. Trump. He also said the administration had put ""politics and cronyism ahead of science."" Mr. Trump has said he ""never heard"" of Dr. Bright. Mr. Deere, the White House spokesman, accused critics of waging a campaign ""to criticize this president for discussing anything that might provide hope to the American people.""

Climate Change Condemns Polar Bears to Grim, and Limited, Future
By Henry Fountain

Polar bears could become nearly extinct by the end of the century as a result of shrinking sea ice in the Arctic if global warming continues unabated, scientists said Monday.

Nearly all of the 19 subpopulations of polar bears, from the Beaufort Sea off Alaska to the Siberian Arctic, would face being wiped out because the loss of sea ice would force the animals onto land and away from their food supplies for longer periods, the researchers said. Prolonged fasting, and reduced nursing of cubs by mothers, would lead to rapid declines in reproduction and survival.

""There is very little chance that polar bears would persist anywhere in the world, except perhaps in the very high Arctic in one small subpopulation"" if greenhouse-gas emissions continue at so-called business-as-usual levels, said Peter K. Molnar, a researcher at the University of Toronto Scarborough and lead author of the study, which was published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Even if emissions were reduced to more moderate levels, ""we still are unfortunately going to lose some, especially some of the southernmost populations, to sea-ice loss,"" Dr. Molnar said.

The fate of polar bears has long been a flash point in the debate over human-caused climate change, used by scientists and environmentalists as well as deniers in their arguments.

By rough estimates there are about 25,000 polar bears in the Arctic. Their main habitat is sea ice, where they hunt seals by waiting for them to surface at holes in the ice. In some areas the bears remain on the ice year round, but in others the melting in spring and summer forces them to come ashore.

""You need the sea ice to capture your food,"" Dr. Molnar said. ""There's not enough food on land to sustain a polar bear population."" But bears can fast for months, surviving on the energy from the fat they've built up thanks to their seal diet.

Arctic sea ice grows in the winter and melts and retreats in spring and summer. As the region has warmed rapidly in recent decades, ice extent in summer has declined by about 13 percent per decade compared to the 1981-2010 average. Some parts of the Arctic that previously had ice year-round now have ice-free periods in summer. Other parts are now free of ice for a longer portion of the year than in the past.

Dr. Molnar and his colleagues looked at 13 of the subpopulations representing about 80 percent of the total bear population. They calculated the bears' energy requirements in order to determine how long they could survive -- or, in the case of females, survive and nurse their cubs -- while fasting.

Combining that with climate-model projections of ice-free days to 2100 if present rates of warming continue, they determined that, for almost all of the subgroups, the time that the animals would be forced to fast would eventually exceed the time that they are capable of fasting.

In short, the animals would starve.

""There's going to be a time point when you run out of energy,"" Dr. Molnar said.

Compounding the problem is that a longer fasting time also means a shorter feeding period. ""Not only do the bears have to fast for longer and need more energy to get through this, they also have a harder time to accumulate this energy,"" he said.

While fasting, bears move as little as possible to conserve energy. But sea-ice loss and population declines create new problems -- having to expend more energy searching for a mate, for example -- that could further affect survival.

Even under more modest warming projections, in which greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2040 and then begin to decline, many of the subgroups would still be wiped out, the research showed.

Over the years, polar bears have become a symbol both for those who argue that urgent action on global warming is needed and for those who claim that climate change is not happening or, at best, that the issue is overblown.

Groups including the Cato Institute, a libertarian research organization that challenges aspects of climate change, have called concerns about the bears unwarranted, arguing that some research shows that the animals have survived repeated warm periods. But scientists say during earlier warm periods the bears probably had significant alternative food sources, notably whales, that they do not have today.

Poignant images of bears on isolated ice floes or roaming land in search of food have been used by conservation groups and others to showcase the need for action to reduce warming. Occasionally, though, these images have been shown to be not what they seem.

After a video of an emaciated bear picking through garbage cans in the Canadian Arctic was posted online by National Geographic in 2017, the magazine acknowledged that the bear's condition might not be related to climate change. Scientists had pointed out that there was no way of knowing what was wrong with the bear; it might have been sick or very old.

The new research did not include projections in which emissions were reduced drastically, said Cecilia M. Bitz, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington and an author of the study. The researchers needed to be able to determine, as precisely as possible, the periods when sea ice would be gone from a particular region. ""If we had wanted to look at many models we wouldn't have been able to do that,"" Dr. Bitz said.

Andrew Derocher, a polar bear researcher at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the study, said the findings ""are very consistent with what we're seeing"" from, for instance, monitoring the animals in the wild. ""The study shows clearly that polar bears are going to do better with less warming,"" he added. ""But no matter which scenario you look at, there are serious concerns about conservation of the species.""

Of the 19 subpopulations, little is known about some of them, particularly those in the Russian Arctic. Of subpopulations that have been studied, some -- generally those in areas with less ice loss -- have shown little population decline so far. But others, notably in the southern Beaufort Sea off northeastern Alaska, and in the western Hudson Bay in Canada, have been severely affected by loss of sea ice.

One analysis found that the Southern Beaufort Sea subpopulation declined by 40 percent, to about 900 bears, in the first decade of this century.

Dr. Derocher said one drawback with studies like these is that, while they can show the long-term trends, ""it becomes very difficult to model what is happening from year to year.""

Polar bear populations can be very susceptible to drastic year-to-year changes in conditions, he said. ""One of the big conservation challenges is that one or two bad years can take a population that is healthy and push it to really low levels.""

Rise in Concern on Climate, but Not for Everyone
By Nadja Popovich

Protecting the environment and tackling climate change have climbed up the list of Americans' political priorities this year as economic concerns have faded, according to a new report from Pew Research Center.

For the first time in the survey's two-decade history, a majority of Americans said dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress. That's a 14 percentage point rise from four years ago.

Nearly two-thirds of Americans ranked protecting the environment as a leading policy priority, which is almost as many as said economic growth should remain a primary focus.

But the surge in climate and environmental concern masks a deep partisan divide:

Addressing climate change has become more urgent for Democrats in recent years, with 78 percent calling it a top policy priority in 2020. But Republicans have, by and large, remained unmoved.

The partisan gap over climate change was the widest to date in 2020 and the most yawning among 18 issues covered by the survey. Protecting the environment, including air and water quality, was the second most divisive issue.

""Intense partisan polarization over these two issues in particular"" has been growing for decades, said Riley Dunlap, a professor emeritus at Oklahoma State University who studies trends in public opinion on environmental topics. Political messaging from party leaders and the media has been a major driver of the divide, he said.

""Voters take cues on their policy preferences and overall positions,"" Dr. Dunlap said. ""President Trump has, in the past, called climate change a hoax and all that. You get a similar message from many members of Congress on the Republican side. And most importantly, it's the message you get from the conservative media.""

The Democratic Party, meanwhile, has made combating climate change a more central focus in recent years. All eight presidential hopefuls still vying for the party's 2020 nomination support drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, and most have issued detailed climate action plans.

Multiple candidates called the issue an ""existential threat"" during the latest Democratic debate on Wednesday.

Seeking to provide a counter-narrative, House Republicans introduced their own climate agenda last week, which included a plan to plant one trillion trees by 2050. But the effort stopped well short of the kind of ambitious action most scientists say is needed to avoid the worst effects of global warming.

Still, the agenda is a likely nod to the rising influence of younger voters.

A separate Pew report published last year dug deeper into Americans' views on climate and energy, and found generational and gender divides among Republicans.

Republicans and Republican-leaning independents under 40 were much more likely to say the government isn't doing enough to address global warming or protect the environment, compared with their older counterparts. So were those identifying as female.

In that survey, a majority of Americans in both parties, 62 percent of Republicans and 90 percent of Democrats, said the United States should prioritize alternative energy development -- such as wind, solar and hydrogen power -- over fossil fuels.

But Dr. Dunlap urged caution on such policy-specific questions. ""Strong partisan identities are more powerful than ever and they lead people to vote for candidates who will go to Congress or to state legislatures and vote against all of this stuff,"" he said. ""The bottom line is, how do people vote?""

How Bad Is Climate Change Now?
By Henry Fountain

Global warming is happening, and its effects are being felt around the world. The only real debates are over how fast and how far the climate will change, and what society should do -- the global-warming equivalents of lockdowns and social distancing -- to slow or stop it and limit the damage.

As of now, the damage seems to be getting worse. As I wrote in December, impacts that scientists predicted years ago -- including severe storms, heat waves and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets -- are accelerating.

The coronavirus pandemic can seem overwhelming because of its sheer scope; so can climate change. As a science writer at The Times for more than 20 years, I've learned that, to avoid being overwhelmed, it helps to start by understanding one part of the larger problem.

So let's take a closer look at one piece: what's happening at the top of the world, the Arctic. It's a good place to understand the science of climate change, and, it turns out, a critically important one to understand its effects.

Since the mid-1990s, the Arctic has been warming faster than any other region of the planet: currently, at least two and a half times as fast. (Last year, average air temperatures were about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.9 degrees Celsius, higher than the average from 1981-2010.)

In large part, the Arctic is warming the way the rest of the world warms, only up north the process has run amok.

As the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases increase in the atmosphere, so does the amount of heat they trap. But the source of that heat is sunlight striking the Earth, and the amount of heat radiated differs depending on the surface the sunlight hits. Just as a black car gets much hotter than a white car on a sunny day, darker parts of the planet absorb more sunlight, and in turn radiate more heat, than lighter parts.

The Central Arctic is all ocean -- dark water that is covered, to a varying extent, by light ice. The ice absorbs only about 30 to 40 percent of the sunlight hitting it; the rest is reflected. Ocean, on the other hand, absorbs more than 90 percent.

As the Arctic warms more of the ice disappears, leaving more dark ocean to absorb more sunlight and radiate even more heat, causing even more loss of ice. It's a vicious cycle that contributes to rapid warming in the region.

Is this happening at the South Pole as well? No, because while the Arctic is mostly water surrounded by land, Antarctica is the opposite, a huge land mass surrounded by ocean. Some of the ice that covers the continent is melting, but no dark ocean is being exposed. (That's not to say that the continent isn't losing ice: it is, mostly through calving of icebergs and melting of the undersides of ice shelves.)

In the Arctic, currents and winds flow out of the region and affect weather elsewhere.

Weakening of the high-altitude winds known as the polar jet stream can bring extra-frigid winter weather to North America and Europe. Cold snaps like these have occurred for a long time although, because of global warming, studies have found that they are not as cold as they used to be. But some scientists now say they think Arctic warming is causing the jet stream to wobble in ways that lead to more extreme weather year round, by creating zones of high-pressure air that can cause weather systems -- the ones that bring extreme heat, for example -- to stall.

Arctic warming may also be affecting climate over the longer term. As Greenland's ice sheet melts, the fresh water it releases lowers the saltiness of the nearby ocean. These salinity changes may eventually have an effect on some of the large ocean currents that help determine long-term climate trends in parts of the world.

As climate researchers are fond of saying, what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic.

Climate Denial Infuses Reports At
U.S. Agency

By Hiroko Tabuchi
The misleading language appears in at least nine reports, including environmental studies and impact statements on major watersheds in the American West that could be used to justify allocating increasingly scarce water to farmers at the expense of wildlife conservation and fisheries.

The effort was led by Indur M. Goklany, a longtime Interior Department employee who, in 2017 near the start of the Trump administration, was promoted to the office of the deputy secretary with responsibility for reviewing the agency's climate policies. The Interior Department's scientific work is the basis for critical decisions about water and mineral rights affecting millions of Americans and hundreds of millions of acres of land.

The wording, known internally as the ""Goks uncertainty language"" based on Mr. Goklany's nickname, inaccurately claims that there is a lack of consensus among scientists that the earth is warming. In Interior Department emails to scientists, Mr. Goklany pushed misleading interpretations of climate science, saying it ""may be overestimating the rate of global warming, for whatever reason;"" climate modeling has largely predicted global warming accurately. The final language states inaccurately that some studies have found the earth to be warming, while others have not.

He also instructed department scientists to add that rising carbon dioxide -- the main force driving global warming -- is beneficial because it ""may increase plant water use efficiency"" and ""lengthen the agricultural growing season."" Both assertions misrepresent the scientific consensus that, overall, climate change will result in severe disruptions to global agriculture and significant reductions in crop yields.

Samuel Myers, a principal research scientist at Harvard University's Center for the Environment who has studied the effects of climate change on nutrition, said the language ""takes very specific and isolated pieces of science, and tries to expand it in an extraordinarily misleading fashion.""

The Interior Department's emails, dating from 2017 through last year and obtained under public-records laws by the watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute, provide the latest evidence of the Trump administration's widespread attacks on government scientific work. The administration has halted or scaled back numerous research projects since taking office, including an Obama-era initiative to fight disease outbreaks around the world -- a decision that has drawn criticism in recent weeks as a deadly coronavirus has spread globally.

The Interior Department referred questions to the Bureau of Reclamation, the office that oversees the nation's dams and water resources and the first to publish the language. ""Uncertainty is a part of climate modeling, as it is with all scientific modeling,"" said Marlon Duke, the bureau's acting public affairs chief. He said the bureau did not have a formal requirement to include specific language in any document, ""but we strive to be fully transparent in recognizing and sharing appropriate uncertainties in the information we use to make decisions.""

The Interior Department declined to make Mr. Goklany available for an interview, and he did not return requests seeking comment.

The misleading language appears in environmental studies and impact statements affecting major watersheds including the Klamath and Upper Deschutes river basins in California and Oregon, which provide critical habitat for spawning salmon and other wildlife. In addition, millions of acres of farms in California's agriculturally important Central Valley are supplied, in part, by the Klamath, which is California's second-largest river by volume and is only slightly smaller than the Colorado River. Thirsty farms there have used increasing amounts of water at a rate that scientists say hurts wildlife and imperils the salmon industry.

Scientists and policy experts say that, by embedding an inaccurate sense of uncertainty about scientific findings in its documents, the Trump administration is advancing its policy of weakening environmental rules and reallocating vast quantities of water to farming and irrigation, even though climate change projections show that use to be unsustainable. Last month, President Trump signed a memo in California relaxing regulations that have limited the flow of water to irrigate the Central Valley's big farms.

""Highlighting uncertainty is consistent with the biggest attacks on the climate science community,"" said Jacquelyn Gill, an associate professor of paleoecology and plant ecology at the University of Maine. ""They're emphasizing discussions of uncertainty to the point where people feel as though we can't actually make decisions"" based on the research.

Mr. Goklany has been employed by the Interior Department since the 1980s, much of that time in less influential positions focused on policy analysis. He has also written papers for and participated in events hosted by libertarian think tanks including the Cato Institute and the Heartland Institute, which have spread doubt about the scientific consensus that human activity is causing the world to warm rapidly. In 2009, he appeared as an expert voice in a film titled ""Policy Peril: Why Global Warming Policies are More Dangerous than Global Warming Itself.""

But Mr. Goklany's Interior Department responsibilities expanded substantially in the early months of the Trump administration, when he was elevated by Trump appointees to a position guiding the Interior Department's climate policy and began attending senior-level meetings and weighing in on early policy moves such as changes to the department's website. However, the details of his role in the agency's scientific work, including pressing scientists to include misleading climate language in critical policy documents, wasn't previously known.

In interviews, four current and former Interior Department officials said Mr. Goklany's rise was abrupt and unexpected.

""They were like, 'Who the hell is this guy?""' said Joel Clement, a former top climate-policy expert at the Interior Department who quit in 2017 and testified in Congress that former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was purging the agency of government scientists working to address climate change -- allegations later backed by the agency's inspector general. Mr. Clement is now a senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Mr. Zinke has denied the allegations.

The new documents show that, as early as September 2017, Mr. Goklany, newly appointed to the office of the deputy secretary, started directing scientists to add climate uncertainty language in agency reports. In an exchange with scientists at the Bureau of Reclamation, dated Sept. 12 of that year, Mr. Goklany ordered up uncertainty language that the emails say would be included in future studies of river basins, and he directly edited the file.

""My edits are on the attached,"" Mr. Goklany wrote in the email, sending a marked up draft that contained the misleading references to the benefits of higher carbon dioxide levels and that questioned the widely accepted scientific research projecting the future course of climate change. He also included an abstract of a paper, indicating, he wrote, ""that CO2 may have increased the water use efficiency of plants globally.""

In December of that same year, he gave a presentation at the Interior Department promoting the benefits of fossil fuels and carbon dioxide to human and environmental well-being, according to presentation slides viewed by The Times.

By early 2018, the emails show, the bureau had adopted a de facto requirement that studies reference climate uncertainty. ""Attached here is the latest draft of the 'uncertainty' language that Dave Raff and others worked on with the Department, to be included in all Basin Studies from here forward,"" Avra Morgan, a watershed management official, wrote on Jan. 26, 2018, in an email to more than a dozen bureau scientists.

The Interior Department's scientists pushed back with some success against Mr. Goklany's demands, the emails show. Amanda Erath, program coordinator of the Bureau of Reclamation's water recycling and reuse projects, wrote in an email on Feb. 4, 2019, that more scientifically ""robust uncertainty language"" had been negotiated. In another email, she referred to the wording as the ""Goks uncertainty language.""

The final language seemed ""balanced enough, especially since it does mention potential adverse effects of warming on water resources,"" wrote Ralph F. Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in an email. Nevertheless, Mr. Keeling -- who was the lead author of the study cited by Mr. Goklany finding that more carbon dioxide helps plants use water more efficiently -- also noted that the text ""might have mentioned that warming may increase the water requirements for plant growth, which counters the CO2 impact on water-use efficiency.""

Both scientists and environmental groups are concerned that Mr. Goklany's campaign will start to build a body of evidence that will undermine the agency's response to climate change in a region where water is already a highly contested resource. The language could ""create a loophole that would prevent future legal challenges from succeeding,"" said Jayson O'Neill, deputy director of Western Values Project, a public-lands advocacy group.

In the Klamath River Basin in Southern Oregon and Northern California, for example, the federal government is set to make a decision on whether to remove four hydroelectric dams that block about 400 miles of habitat for migratory salmon and steelhead trout. However, as climate change reduces the water available for irrigation there, some farmers have opposed the dam removals, fearing they will get even less water.

The Interior Department reports expressing uncertainty about the risks of global warming ""become part of the record"" supporting that argument, said Kristen Boyles, Seattle-based attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice, which is involved in court cases opposing more irrigation. ""They'll be able to say, 'We're not going to consider climate change.""'

CLIMATE FWD:

Here to Help; The Facts About Alcohol and Climate Change
By Lisa Friedman and Miranda Green

Also this week, booze and global warming

Welcome to the

.)

Scientists say solving climate change means significantly reducing the use of fossil fuels. That's not how many Republicans in Congress see things, though.

A new House Republican climate agenda, the first part of which was announced last week, includes an ambitious tree-planting program. It also calls for tax breaks to help encourage the development of technology to capture emissions from coal and gas plants. Measures to bolster energy storage and advanced nuclear technology are planned, too.

One thing the Republican climate plans won't do, though, is cut the use of fossil fuels most responsible for heating up the planet. Party leaders openly acknowledge that they hope to solve global warming without sacrificing coal, gas or oil.

""I think that's possible"" said Representative David B. McKinley, a West Virginia Republican. Mr. McKinley is writing bipartisan legislation with Representative Kurt Schrader, an Oregon Democrat, that would fund the development of carbon capture technology in exchange for delaying federal regulations for a decade.

Sitting in his Capitol Hill office beneath a photograph of a coal miner holding a young girl's hand, Mr. McKinley said that, in parts of his district, much of the economy is linked to the local coal plant.

""If they close, what impact will that have on the schools?"" he asked. ""The first responders? The health care workers?""

""Fossil fuels aren't the enemy,"" said Representative Garret Graves of Louisiana, the top Republican on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. ""It's emissions. So, let's devise strategies that are based on emissions strategies, not based on eliminating fossil fuels.""

That approach has a number of political advantages for Republicans. It allows them to attack Democratic-led proposals like the Green New Deal while offering ideas of their own. And the solutions they propose will slowly reduce emissions.

The problem, scientists say, is that those proposals are not nearly enough to achieve what's needed to avoid the worst consequences of climate change: A reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions of 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.

""There isn't any way to make the math solve without a substantial direct reduction in fossil fuels,"" said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University.

Planting one trillion trees, an idea President Trump recently embraced, could absorb as much as 205 gigatons of carbon emissions. But it would take many decades for new trees to reach maturity.

Carbon capture technology could eventually sequester as much as 2 gigatons a year in the United States. But that's less than half of the approximately 5.5 gigatons emitted annually, and getting to even that level would also require decades and billions of dollars, Mr. Jenkins said.

Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center for Global Energy Policy who was a top official in the Department of Energy under President Barack Obama, said all of the options Republicans have outlined would be needed, but it's still necessary to sharply reduce fossil fuels.

""Climate change is an existential threat,"" Dr. Friedmann said. ""I see no reason to tie one's arm behind your back on anything. We are in the fight of our lives and we need absolutely every option.""

He called the Republican plans ""positive"" for helping to build consensus around greater climate ambition. But, Dr. Friedmann added, they're ""still not a substitute for the rest.""

If you did dry January this year, you probably reduced your carbon footprint without knowing it. That's because alcohol production and distribution can be quite energy intensive. So, what if you want to reduce your environmental footprint but you're not quite ready to hop on the wagon and stay there?

Whatever your poison, one of the most important things you can do, for your health and for the planet, is drink in moderation. Even if you don't cut out the booze, keep it reasonable. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men.

Beyond that, it helps to know the facts about your drink of choice.

Broadly speaking, liquor tends to be more environmentally sustainable per unit. ""The more concentrated they are, the less impact they have,"" Alissa Kendall, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis, said of alcoholic beverages.

Drinkers typically get more mileage out of a bottle of spirits than wine or beer. That's especially true if you drink to get a buzz. Simply put: Liquor is quicker.

For beer, the world's most consumed alcoholic beverage, refrigeration is a big part of the emissions equation. A 2008 study by the New Belgium Brewing Company, based in Fort Collins, Colo., found that the greenhouse gas emissions from one six-pack were about the same as driving a car nearly eight miles. The largest share of those emissions came from refrigeration. Craft beers must remain chilled to retain their flavor profile, experts say.

Another factor to consider is packaging materials. Is the beer in a glass bottle or a can? In the United States, the most environmentally friendly option is almost always the can. Not only is aluminum lighter to ship, but it's more likely to be recycled.

According to Georgie Walker, co-author of a sustainability study for the Firestone Walker Brewing Company, her family's business, it's also important to look at the number of miles a beer has covered after being bottled. Then, buy local.

""It will be fresher,"" Ms. Walker said. ""It won't be sitting in storage as long and won't have the gas miles behind it.""

Shipping distance can also be an important consideration when choosing climate-friendly wine. A study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, for example, found that transportation accounted for 13 percent of wine's emissions in the state.

Generally, shipping by sea is better than train, and train is better than truck.

An easy way to assess the emissions in play is to consider the East Coast, West Coast divide. Wines from Chile, for instance, are often transported in giant vats via ship to the West Coast, where they are bottled and then moved to market. Those wines could be a sustainable option for, say, drinkers in Oregon, but not in New Hampshire.

Easterners, on the other hand, may be better off with French Burgundies that were shipped across the Atlantic. Many wine labels list origin and bottling details.

For wine, though, there is no bigger emissions culprit than bottles.

Manufacturing a 750 milliliter glass bottle accounts for 33 percent of a wine's life cycle emissions in North America, according to the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable.

Want a better alternative? Try bag-in-box wines.

Yes, we know. Quelle horreur. But the quality of boxed wines has been improving for a while now.

According to a 2011 study of California's wine industry, boxes reduce the drink's overall carbon footprint by 40 percent. Boxed wines also last longer after being opened and the packaging is largely recyclable.

According to Dr. Kendall, the U.C. Davis professor, you can use that to help win over skeptics.

""You can feel O.K. about maybe going lower-end on your wine choices and tell your snobby friends you're saving the environment,"" she said. "

Southwest Drought Rivals Those of Centuries Ago, Thanks to Climate Change
By Henry Fountain

The drought that has gripped the American Southwest since 2000 is as bad as or worse than droughts in the region over the past 1,200 years, a new study finds. 

ALBUQUERQUE ‚Äî A severe drought that has gripped the American Southwest since 2000 is as bad as or worse than long-lasting droughts in the region over the past 1,200 years, and climate change has helped make it that way, scientists said Thursday.

The researchers described the current drought, which has helped intensify wildfire seasons and threatened water supplies for people and agriculture, as an ‚Äúemerging megadrought.‚Äù Although 2019 was a relatively wet year, and natural climate variability could bring good luck in the form of more wet years that would end the drought, global warming increases the odds that it will continue.

‚ÄúWe know that this drought has been encouraged by the global warming process,‚Äù said Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, and lead author of a study published Thursday in Science. ‚ÄúAs we go forward in time it‚Äôs going to take more and more good luck to pull us out of this.‚Äù

While the term megadrought has no strict definition, it is generally considered to be a severe dry period persisting for several decades or longer. Many climate researchers and hydrologists have long thought that a Southwestern megadrought was highly likely. A 2016 study put the probability of one occurring this century at 70 percent or higher.

Dr. Williams and his colleagues reconstructed drought conditions in the Southwest for every year back to 800 A.D., using tree growth as a proxy for soil moisture content. Examining nearly 1,600 tree-ring records, they found four periods of more than two decades each during which soil moisture content was far below the baseline for the entire 1,200 years, indicating severe drought conditions of lack of precipitation and increased dryness. One of these megadroughts, in the 13th century, lasted more than 90 years.

Their analysis showed that, as measured by soil moisture content, the current drought is more severe than three of the ancient ones. Only one in the late 1500s was worse, and not by much, the researchers said.

‚ÄúAncient megadroughts have always been seen by water managers as worst-case scenarios,‚Äù Dr. Williams said, ‚Äúand we just have to hope that there‚Äôs some kind of protection measure in the climate system that‚Äôs not going to allow one of those to repeat itself. And what we‚Äôre seeing is that we‚Äôre actually right on track for one.‚Äù

Water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean are thought to play a large role in determining drought conditions in the Southwest, both now and in the past. Cooler sea-surface temperatures ‚Äî what is commonly called La Ni√±a ‚Äî affect the jet stream, which pushes storms approaching Western North America to the north, leaving the Southwest drier.

But since the beginning of the 20th century, when large-scale emissions of heat-trapping gases began, warming has played a role as well. Using 31 computer climate models, the researchers estimated that climate change contributed nearly half to the severity of the current drought.

Put another way, without global warming the current drought would be only of moderate severity rather than one of the worst.

While the natural variability of La Ni√±a conditions continues, Dr. Williams said, ‚Äúall of that is being superimposed on what appears to be a pretty strong long-term drying trend.‚Äù

The current drought has followed a pattern that is similar to the ancient ones, he said. Rather than one or two extremely dry years that would suddenly throw the region into drought, dry conditions have been nearly continuous and the drought has built up over time.

‚ÄúAs of Year 5 this was looking like the beginning of a megadrought,‚Äù Dr. Williams said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs developing right along the same path.‚Äù

Brad Udall, a water and climate research at Colorado State University who was not involved in the study, said that tying the current drought to a longer-term context ‚Äúfits what a lot of people have been thinking.‚Äù

Dr. Udall said the researchers‚Äô finding that climate change accounted for about half of the drought‚Äôs severity was strongly supported by his and others‚Äô recent studies of the shrinking flow of the Colorado River, which attribute about half of the decline to global warming.

‚ÄúI love the focus on soil moisture,‚Äù Dr. Udall said of the new study. ‚ÄúPeople underappreciate how important soil moisture is.‚Äù

Soils have a buffering effect that can allow problems of water scarcity to persist even after a relatively wet year, because soils that are dry from years of drought soak up more water that would normally run into rivers and streams.

The wetter weather in 2019, for example, resulted in a deep mountain snowpack across much of the West. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs increasingly clear we didn‚Äôt get the runoff we had expected,‚Äù Dr. Udall said.

The latest ancient megadrought the researchers found was the long one in the 16th century. That finding reinforces the widely held idea that conditions were relatively wetter in the Southwest for centuries before the current drought.

Among other things, the rapid growth of the region‚Äôs population in the 20th century, and the agreements to divide water resources like the Colorado River, came at a time when water was more abundant than it is now and is likely to be in the future. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs become clearer and clearer that the 1900s were a bad time to develop, if you were going to develop all-out and use every last drop of water available,‚Äù Dr. Williams said.

But the finding also makes attributing the current drought to climate change more complicated, he said.

‚ÄúHow much could this just be a return to the long-term average?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe there was something going on that we don‚Äôt understand that caused the last 400 years to be so much wetter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of this is just to say there‚Äôs still a lot of mysteries out there,‚Äù Dr. Williams said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have the whole story of Southwestern hydroclimate nailed down.‚Äù

Jay Inslee Endorses Biden, Citing Private Conversations on Climate Policy
By Alexander Burns

The governor of Washington State, one of the Democratic Party‚Äôs most prominent environmentalists, urged progressives to get on board with the presumptive presidential nominee‚Äôs campaign.

Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, one of the Democratic Party‚Äôs most prominent environmentalists, endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Wednesday after extensive private conversations in which Mr. Biden signaled he would make fighting climate change a central cause of his administration.

Mr. Inslee, who mounted a long-shot presidential campaign of his own last year, said in an interview that he had spoken repeatedly to Mr. Biden in recent weeks and came away convinced that the former vice president was preparing to greatly expand his policy proposals for reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy.

Though he and Mr. Biden clashed early in the primary season, Mr. Inslee said he was confident that Mr. Biden was ‚Äúwilling to aim faster and higher‚Äù on climate policy than he had indicated at that stage. Mr. Inslee said his aides were consulting with Mr. Biden‚Äôs campaign about new components to his environmental agenda.

‚ÄúI am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this will be a major driving force of his administration,‚Äù Mr. Inslee said. ‚ÄúI think what you‚Äôre going to see is an increased commitment to some shorter-term actions and he‚Äôs been very open to that.‚Äù

Mr. Inslee‚Äôs endorsement comes as little surprise, given Mr. Biden‚Äôs status as the presumptive Democratic nominee. The Biden campaign has rolled out a series of valuable endorsements over the past few weeks, a phase of the campaign in which public activity has been strictly limited by the coronavirus outbreak. Last week, endorsement videos from former President Barack Obama and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren helped Mr. Biden stir Democratic enthusiasm and raise money during a news cycle overwhelmed by the pandemic.

Mr. Inslee has been among the most prominent governors confronting the crisis, ordering early lockdowns and other restrictions that have helped limit the damage in Washington State to a fraction of the ruin inflicted on New York, where public officials acted somewhat more slowly. The emergency has also brought Mr. Inslee into conflict with President Trump, whom Mr. Inslee has criticized for his handling of the outbreak. Mr. Trump has answered Mr. Inslee‚Äôs criticism with heated personal and partisan attacks, calling him a ‚Äúsnake.‚Äù

But unlike some governors who have tried to mute their differences with Mr. Trump while they are lobbying his administration for help in the fight against coronavirus, Mr. Inslee made plain in the interview that he intended to speak bluntly about what he saw as Mr. Trump‚Äôs deficiencies. He said the president had shown ‚Äúno empathy for anyone but himself‚Äù and had ‚Äúabused even Republican governors‚Äù who expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government‚Äôs performance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had to deal with a totally dishonest person in the White House,‚Äù Mr. Inslee said, predicting that Mr. Biden would be a better partner for governors in both parties.

In addition to the endorsement, Mr. Inslee participated in another ritual of Mr. Biden‚Äôs lockdown-era campaign: On Tuesday, he recorded an episode for Mr. Biden‚Äôs podcast, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the Deal,‚Äù which has previously featured conversations with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. On the podcast, Mr. Biden alluded to numerous private conversations about climate with Mr. Inslee, as well as with former Vice President Al Gore; in his view, Mr. Biden said, confronting the climate crisis represented an enormous opportunity for the United States to create jobs ‚Äúgenerating a fundamentally green infrastructure.‚Äù

Mr. Inslee‚Äôs vote of confidence in Mr. Biden comes at a timely moment, on the 50th occasion of Earth Day and as the former vice president continues to face grumbling on the left about the scope of his announced climate policies. While Mr. Biden has embraced a broad agenda to limit emissions, progressives have long viewed his stated timeline ‚Äî reducing emissions to net zero by 2050 ‚Äî as dangerously slow.

During one of the debates last year, Mr. Inslee was among those who challenged Mr. Biden‚Äôs plans as ‚Äútoo little, too late.‚Äù

But Mr. Biden has shown signs recently of raising his governing ambitions across the board, not only on climate, even adopting some of the messages of former rivals like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren in arguing that the next president will have to seek much larger social and economic change to help the country recover from the current crisis.

Mr. Inslee, who is seeking a third term as governor this November, expressed little sympathy for reluctant liberals, urging them to get on board with Mr. Biden as quickly as possible. Whatever their preferences during primary season, Mr. Inslee said, Democrats should recognize that Mr. Biden‚Äôs candidacy represents ‚Äúa chance for the survival of life as we know it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe faster we get in harness together, the likelier it is we will remove a man who has dedicated himself to deceit and rejection of science,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Inslee allowed that some of his enthusiasm for Mr. Biden stemmed from factors besides policy, describing the former vice president as open-minded and easy to connect with ‚Äî common sentiments among Mr. Biden‚Äôs former rivals who have aligned themselves with unusual speed behind a candidate who not long ago seemed to be on the brink of defeat.

‚ÄúI just enjoy talking to Joe Biden,‚Äù Mr. Inslee said. ‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs one of the reasons he‚Äôs been successful as a leader.‚Äù

Overlooked No More: Eunice Foote, Climate Scientist Lost to History
By John Schwartz

Foote‚Äôs ingenious experiment more than 150 years ago yielded a remarkable discovery that could have helped shape modern climate science had she not been overshadowed.

Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The Times.

In the 1850s, Eunice Foote, an amateur scientist and activist for women‚Äôs rights, made a remarkable discovery about greenhouse gases that could have helped form the foundation of modern climate science.

But the scientific paper she published that might have added her name to the pantheon of early climate scientists was quickly forgotten, and she faded into obscurity. There isn‚Äôt even a known photograph of her today.

The idea that greenhouse gases warm the planet is anything but new, and anything but unsettled.

Foote‚Äôs ingenious and elegant experiment involved two glass cylinders filled with various substances, including moist air and carbon dioxide. She placed a thermometer in each container, then left them in sunlight.

In her 1856 paper about the experiment, ‚ÄúCircumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun‚Äôs Rays,‚Äù she wrote that a cylinder with moist air became warmer than one with dry air. A cylinder filled with carbon dioxide warmed even more, and, once removed from the light, ‚Äúit was many times as long in cooling.‚Äù

She then reached a sweeping conclusion: ‚ÄúAn atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature.‚Äù

She noted that ‚Äúif, as some suppose, at one period of its history the air had mixed with it a larger proportion‚Äù of carbon dioxide, then an increased temperature ‚Äúmust necessarily have resulted.‚Äù

Her paper was presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ‚Äî but by a male scientist, Joseph Henry, not by Foote. (It is unclear why she did not present the paper herself; she would present another one of her papers on a different topic the next year.)

Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, has referred to Foote and her early climate-change work as ‚Äúremarkably prescient.‚Äù She is now working with other historians, writers and scientists to bring Foote‚Äôs work to prominence.

‚ÄúShe was really an amazing woman,‚Äù said Hayhoe, who is an author of the most recent edition of the Fourth National Climate Assessment, the leading federal report on climate change in the United States. ‚ÄúThe fact that she turned glass jars into an experiment on heat-trapping gases is phenomenal.‚Äù

It would be three years before John Tyndall, a scientist in England, published his famous paper identifying the gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.

His paper, ‚ÄúNote on the Transmission of Radiant Heat Through Gaseous Bodies,‚Äù published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, did not cite Foote‚Äôs work.

Tyndall more accurately captured how carbon dioxide and water vapor could warm the planet. Because Foote was using the sun‚Äôs energy, her experiment focused on the visible spectrum; Tyndall used spectroscopy and was able to focus on the infrared spectrum, which is the form of heat radiated from the planet toward space.

His method ‚Äúgave him a sensitive and accurate means of determining very small amounts of absorption, and of measuring accurately the differences in absorption between different gases and of gases at different densities,‚Äù Roland Jackson, a scientist, historian and biographer of Tyndall, wrote in a paper, ‚ÄúEunice Foote, John Tyndall and a Question of Priority,‚Äù published last year by the Royal Society.

Jackson concluded that Tyndall and other major ‚Äúcritical physicists of the period‚Äù probably did not know of Foote‚Äôs work. ‚ÄúOn the face of it, the significance of the paper passed everyone by who could have had a particular interest in it,‚Äù he wrote.

Why did Foote‚Äôs work disappear for so long? Was this a case of historical erasure, or even intellectual theft? The truth is more subtle and interconnected, Jackson wrote.

For starters, Foote was regarded as an amateur scientist. She was also an American working at a time when the most important work in the field was being performed in Europe. And the world at that time did not exactly welcome the contributions of a woman.

‚ÄúEunice Foote was disadvantaged not only by this lack of an academic community in America and poor communication with Europe, but by two further factors: her gender and her amateur status,‚Äù Jackson wrote.

Jackson acknowledged that ‚ÄúFoote does seem to have been the first person to notice the ability of carbon dioxide and water vapor to absorb heat, and to make the direct link between the variability of these atmospheric constituents and climate change.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúFor that she deserves proper recognition, even if she was not able to explore, and perhaps did not recognize, the distinction between solar radiation and radiated heat from the earth.‚Äù

Hayhoe of Texas Tech put it this way: ‚ÄúThe conclusion she came to is correct, but the conclusion was not actually supported by her experiment,‚Äù because she didn‚Äôt distinguish between visible and infrared radiation ‚Äúand the greenhouse effect is primarily due to the latter, not the former.‚Äù

But Foote, she said, ‚Äúwas the first person to say in print that if carbon dioxide levels were higher, the planet would be warmer.‚Äù That alone, she said, was ‚Äúan amazing accomplishment, and she should be absolutely celebrated for that.‚Äù

Marveling at how much Foote was able to accomplish given the limited horizons for women of her time, Hayhoe pondered, ‚ÄúWhat would she have accomplished if she had been born today?‚Äù

Eunice Newton was born in Goshen, Conn., on July 17, 1819, one of 11 children of Isaac Newton Jr., a farmer and entrepreneur, and Thirza Newton, a homemaker. She attended the Troy Female Seminary, a school that encouraged female students to attend science lectures at a nearby college and had its own chemistry labs for experiments.

Science was not Foote‚Äôs only passion. She was also a prominent feminist and a signer of the declaration that emerged at the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, one of the nation‚Äôs first organized events for women‚Äôs rights. Her name is fifth on the list. Her husband, Elisha Foote, a judge and amateur scientist whom she married in 1841, also signed the document, which called for ‚Äúthe civil, social, political and religious rights of women.&#34;

She also published on many different topics, and as a result she never built up the reputation that comes with accumulated research in one area or field.

She died on Sept. 30, 1888. She was 69.

Paul Yeaton, a great-great-grandson of Eunice Foote, said he knew little of his illustrious ancestor growing up. However, he said, ‚Äúreading the monograph, jeez, it‚Äôs pretty remarkable, her powers of deduction.‚Äù

In hearing about the recent surge in research and publication that recognizes Foote‚Äôs work, he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice that somebody got their due rights.‚Äù

A short film about Foote, called ‚ÄúEunice,‚Äù was made in 2018.

Another relative, Liz Foote, a scientist pursing a Ph.D. in environmental studies in Hawaii, said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honor personally to be part of a family tree with someone like Eunice in it.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thrilled that we could be hearing more of her story now.‚Äù

Facing the Climate Change Crisis, Three Books Offer Some Ambitious Proposals

THE FUTURE WE CHOOSE

Surviving the Crisis

By Christina Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac

The first question to ask when reading ‚ÄúThe Future We Choose‚Äù is, Who exactly is the ‚Äúwe‚Äù of the title? Figueres, who helped facilitate the passage of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and Rivett-Carnac, a lobbyist for the United Nations, position their book as presenting options for what ‚Äúgovernments, corporations and each of us can do‚Äù about climate change. But those are three distinct groups with different motivations and pressures. That the book lumps them all together regardless of their contribution to the problem ‚Äî your average person in Guatemala has contributed far less to climate change than a person in New York City, and each has contributed less than an oil company ‚Äî illustrates the book‚Äôs unevenness.

Further, in pursuit of their optimistic messaging, the authors are loose with certain facts. For example, their emphasis on tree planting and reforestation (laudable goals, to be sure) relies partly on a flawed study in the journal Science that overestimated how many trees can actually be planted, because of ecosystem constraints ‚Äî we don‚Äôt grow trees in the desert ‚Äî and how much carbon they can pull out of the atmosphere. Similarly, they write that biofuels will replace fossil fuels in airplanes, but what those fuels will be made of, and how we might balance the required agriculture with the prescription for more forestland, is not made clear.

Perhaps most unsatisfying, the book is presented as an action guide but offers few actions the average reader can actually take. Many of the pages focus on how one can cultivate the right mind-set, an especially puzzling section because it comes after the authors have chastised us for being too individualistic. (Yet of the 10 actions they highlight, only one mentions cultivating community.) It‚Äôs not that the action statements are bad ‚Äî nobody would argue with engaging with politics, or nurturing a shared positive vision for the future ‚Äî but the book falls short on telling us how.

THE STORY OF MORE

How We Got to Climate Change and Where to Go From Here

By Hope Jahren

Reading ‚ÄúThe Story of More,‚Äù you might become aware of a curious omission: Until about three-quarters of the way into the book, there is no direct mention of climate change. Instead, after introducing the problem of global warming in the first chapter, Jahren takes a step back.

She leads us on a journey across time and space, outlining thoughts and beliefs from Mesopotamia to her tiny Minnesota hometown. Along the way she discusses the impact of everything from population growth to Norwegian fishing to nuclear power. She takes this approach in order to present climate change as a result of broader dysfunctions having to do with consumption habits that, she says, don‚Äôt even make us happy. The only way to solve one problem, she suggests, is to solve both.

It‚Äôs an argument that contrasts with the recent spate of climate books, which opt to pummel readers with facts and guilt.Jahren, who first came to prominence with the best-selling memoir ‚ÄúLab Girl,‚Äù instead writes delicately, like the whispery scrape of a skate tracing a figure on the ice.

‚ÄúWe wake in the morning and leave our homes and we work, work, work, to keep the great global chain of procurement in place,‚Äù she writes in a section focused on food waste. ‚ÄúThen we throw 40 percent of everything we just accomplished into the garbage. We can never get those hours back. Our children grow up, our bodies wane, and death comes to claim some of those we love. All the while, we spend our days making things for the purpose of discarding them.‚Äù

THE 100% SOLUTION

A Plan for Solving Climate Change

By Solomon Goldstein-Rose

At 22 Goldstein-Rose became one of the youngest people to serve in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Now 26 and a climate activist, he argues that only in combination can the many climate strategies ‚Äî including renewable energy, energy efficiency and sequestration ‚Äî reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas levels enough by 2050 to stave off the worst effects of climate change.

His message is a necessary one. Climate action is often distilled into individualistic actions that on their own aren‚Äôt sufficient. But Goldstein-Rose doesn‚Äôt provide the comprehensive plan for solving climate change that he sets out to.

While he offers five pillars of emissions reduction, he doesn‚Äôt quantify how much we can reasonably expect to bring down the level of carbon. This is probably because his solutions depend in part on highly efficient technologies that he admits don‚Äôt exist yet. To create them, he calls for a national effort on climate change akin to the one that sent humans to the moon.

Similarly, some details raise doubts as to how much Goldstein-Rose knows about existing efforts. In a section discussing the need to reduce agriculture emissions he proposes using Peace Corps volunteers to bring sustainable agricultural practices to low-income countries, as though this were a novel idea. But in some countries, they are already doing just that. Meanwhile his discussions on energy ignore the tremendous subsidies that fossil fuels receive compared with other energy sources. When discussing the risks of nuclear energy, he focuses on power plant designs that have not yet been properly piloted, and focuses on the risk with no mention of the horrors experienced by some communities, such as the Navajo Nation, that come from extracting a plant‚Äôs fuel. As a broad idea the book works, but as a road map to climate action, it skips too many details.

Scientists Narrow Their Predictions
for Global Warming

By John Schwartz

For more than 40 years, scientists have expressed the answer as a range of possible temperature increases, between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, that will result from carbon dioxide levels doubling from preindustrial times. Now, a team of researchers has sharply narrowed the range of temperatures, tightening it to between 2.6 and 4.1 degrees Celsius.

Steven Sherwood, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and an author of the new report said that the group's research suggested that these temperature shifts, which are referred to as ""climate sensitivity"" because they reflect how sensitive the planet is to rising carbon dioxide levels, are now unlikely below the low end of the range. The research also suggests that the ""alarmingly high sensitivities"" of 5 degrees Celsius or higher are less likely, though they are ""not impossible,"" Dr. Sherwood said.

What remains, however, is still an array of effects that mean worldwide disaster if emissions are not sharply reduced in coming years.

Masahiro Watanabe, a professor in the atmosphere and ocean research institute at the University of Tokyo and an author of the report, said that determining an accurate range of temperatures was critically important for international efforts to address global warming, like the Paris climate agreement, and for mitigating the effects of climate change.

""Narrowing the uncertainty is relevant not only for climate science but also for society that is responsible for solid decision making,"" he said.

The new paper, published on Wednesday in the journal Reviews of Geophysics, narrowed the range of temperatures considerably and shifted it toward warmer outcomes. The researchers determined that there was less than a 5 percent chance of a temperature shift below two degrees, but a 6 to 18 percent chance of a higher temperature change than 4.5 degrees Celsius, or 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

If the effects of carbon dioxide are at the low end of the range or even below it, then climate change will be affected less by emissions and the planet will warm more slowly. If the Earth's climate is more highly sensitive to carbon dioxide levels, then the expected results are not only more imminent, but also more catastrophic.

The scientists noted that the Earth's temperature is already about 1.2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and that, if current emissions trends continue, the doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide could happen well before the end of this century.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University, who was not an author of the report but who was one of its earlier outside reviewers, called the paper ""a real tour de force,"" adding that ""this is probably the most important paper I've read in years.""

For many years, those who wished to underplay the threat of climate change have tried to say that the sensitivity is low, and so rising greenhouse gases would have little effect. And some recent climate models have suggested warming could be frighteningly worse.

The value of the paper, Dr. Dessler said, lies in the way that it narrows the probable range of temperatures the world can expect. ""There were a number of people who were arguing the climate sensitivity was much lower, and a smaller number claiming it was much higher,"" he said, ""and I think the case for either of those positions is a lot weaker now that this paper has been published.""

That means that those who undercut the seriousness of climate change and the need for action have a much harder case to make now, Dr. Dessler said. ""It would be great if the skeptics were right,"" he said. ""But it's pretty clear that the data don't support that contention.""

The paper, produced under an international science organization, the World Climate Research Program, brought together three broad fields of climate evidence: temperature records since the industrial revolution, records of prehistoric temperatures preserved in things like sediment samples and tree rings, as well as satellite observations and computer models of the climate system. None alone could determine the range, but the researchers found ways mathematically to reconcile the three disciplines to reach their conclusions.

""This paper is really the first to try and include all of those disparate sources of observational evidence in a coherent package that actually makes sense,"" said Gavin A. Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and an author of the paper.

Another author on the paper, Gabriele Hegerl, a professor of climate system science at the University of Edinburgh, said that the way the threads of research came together was surprising: ""We don't expect these three lines of evidence to agree completely,"" she said, but hoped they would ""overlap."" And they did, she said, so ""our research is more robust than I initially expected.""

Not everyone is prepared to accept the new results. Nicholas Lewis, an independent scientist who has been critical of aspects of mainstream climate research and who has found flaws in the work of others that led to the retraction last year of a major study on ocean warming, questioned the new paper's reliance on computer models to interpret the lines of evidence, as well as the group's definition of climate sensitivity itself. He also suggested that the paper ignored some possible complications from changes in clouds and convection.

Dr. Schmidt said that the new paper made all of the data and methodology available. ""This is a real challenge to people who think the experts are wrong to go in, change the assumptions, run the code and show us their results,"" he said.

Some degree of uncertainty about planetary warming is inevitable, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist with The Breakthrough Institute and an author of the paper. But the current range is ""not a good amount of warming at all,"" he said, noting that eliminating the extremes still leaves a middle range that means climate disaster. ""You don't need five degrees of warming to justify climate action,"" he said. ""Three degrees is plenty bad.""

William Collins, a climate scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who was not involved with the study, praised the effort to tie together so much research into a single paper, but said that further advances in computing and data gathering would continue to drive the quest for answers. He compared climate sensitivity research to climbing Mount Everest and said: ""This is an extremely important base camp. We are not at the pinnacle yet."""

Climate Concerns Have Not Shifted
During Pandemic

By John Schwartz

Researchers thought Covid-19 might displace climate change as a threat in the American mind. It hasn't, according to a new survey.

Americans' positions on climate change have remained largely unshaken by the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis, according to a new national survey that showed acceptance of the reality of global warming at record highs in some categories.

In the report, Climate Change in the American Mind, written by researchers at Yale University and George Mason University and made public on Tuesday, 73 percent of those polled said that climate change was happening, which matches the highest level of acceptance previously measured by the survey, from 2019.

The percentage of people who are ""extremely"" or ""very"" certain that it is happening has risen to a record high, 54 percent. And 62 percent accepted the established scientific view that global warming is mostly caused by human activity, a level also tied with the figure for 2019.

By contrast, only one in 10 Americans said global warming was not happening, and just six percent were ""extremely"" or ""very"" sure that it was not happening.

The findings are somewhat surprising because of a hypothesis in psychology called the ""finite pool of worry,"" which suggests that when people's level of concern about one issue rises, concern about others tends to fall.

Many social scientists have pointed to a drop in Americans' level of acceptance of climate science that occurred during the Great Recession, which began in the late 2000s, as evidence supporting the theory: From 2008 to 2010, public understanding that global warming is occurring fell by 14 percentage points, with similar drops in the perception that humans are the cause.

Subsequent analysis from researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Yale program suggested that the recession did not cause the drop. Researchers traced it instead to political attacks on climate science during national debates over proposed climate legislation and international agreements on curbing the effects of warming.

Conservative groups and the fossil fuel companies ""were working in overdrive and spending millions and millions of dollars to try to disrupt the policy process,"" said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. At the same time, political leaders expressed denial of climate science. ""When leaders lead, followers follow,"" he said.

When the coronavirus pandemic and its attendant economic devastation made their way around the world, many wondered whether concerns about climate change would be eclipsed. Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication, said, ""I personally was quite concerned that public worry and engagement about climate change would be greatly diminished at present as a result of the pandemic.""

The answer, at least so far, is that climate attitudes have not shifted. ""We see no drop-off at all in beliefs,"" Dr. Leiserowitz said.

This steady level of understanding and concern has persisted even as the prominence of climate change has diminished in the news media because of the crush of news about the pandemic and its effects. Just 24 percent of those surveyed said they had heard about climate change in the news media at least once a week; last November that figure was 35 percent.

The new survey also found that two out of three Americans said global warming was either extremely, very or somewhat important to them personally, and more than four in 10 said they would be personally harmed by the effects of a warming planet. Nearly half said global warming would affect people in their community, and a majority said they were at least moderately interested in news stories about climate issues, including actions by government.

The steadiness of American attitudes, Dr. Leiserowitz said, suggests that ""climate change has matured as an issue"" and become ""a durable worry"" in millions of Americans' minds.

Americans, Dr. Maibach said, have until recently ""accepted the reality of climate change but saw it as a distant problem,"" both far away across the globe and far in the future. The latest survey shows ""the majority of Americans see climate change as a clear and present threat to the health of people in their community,"" he said. ""It's a threat that's come home.""

The survey was conducted from April 7 through the 17th, when much of the United States was already under shelter-in-place orders and the economic impact of the coronavirus was apparent. It involved 1,029 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

The finite-pool-of-worry concept could still be correct, Dr. Leiserowitz said, but ""climate change is central enough to many people's pool of worry that it hasn't been displaced."" The coronavirus crisis could actually be contributing to public support for climate science, he said, because the administration's stumbling response to the pandemic has underscored the message ""that science matters, that expertise matters.""

Dr. Maibach agreed. The loss of 90,000 American lives, he said, ""has been a very powerful and bitter lesson in the need to listen to experts.""

Sunshine Menezes, an associate professor of environmental communication at the University of Rhode Island who was not involved in the survey, expressed surprise about the results.

""I'm excited by these findings,"" Dr. Menezes said. ""Taken together, the report's findings indicate that Americans are reaching, or maybe even have reached, a turning point. They see climate change in their backyards, they recognize the unequal impacts, they increasingly recognize the urgency of adaptation measures, and they want news coverage that tackles consequences and solutions."""

John Houghton, Who Sounded Alarm on Climate Change, Dies at 88
By John Schwartz

He led the United Nations panel on global warming that won a Nobel Peace Prize; he died from complications of the coronavirus

This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.

John Houghton, a climate scientist and influential figure in the United Nations panel that brought the threat of climate change to the world‚Äôs attention and received a Nobel Prize, died on April 15 in Dolgellau, Wales. He was 88.

The cause was complications of the novel coronavirus, according to his granddaughter Hannah Malcolm, who announced the death, at a hospital, on Twitter.

A key participant in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Dr. Houghton was the lead editor of the organization‚Äôs first three reports, issued in 1990, 1995 and 2001. With each report, the evidence underpinning global warming and the role humans play in causing it grew more ineluctable, and the calls for international action became more pressing. The group received the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize jointly with Al Gore, the former vice president and climate campaigner.

Speaking about climate change in 1994, Dr. Houghton said that delay served no one. ‚ÄúWe should start to do what we can do now and also begin to plan to do more,‚Äù he said, and ‚Äúnot wait 10 or 20 years till things are more clear.‚Äù

Mr. Gore recalled Dr. Houghton in a statement as ‚Äúa critical voice bringing the urgency of the climate crisis to the attention of policymakers.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe took seriously the responsibility of scientists to not only produce research,‚Äù Mr. Gore added, ‚Äúbut also to help ensure that the public world understood the implications of that research.‚Äù

Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, said in an email: ‚ÄúHe understood earlier than most, and was willing to tell the politicians, that climate change was real and a threat not just to the richer countries, but especially to the poorer ones.‚Äù

Religion was central to Dr. Houghton‚Äôs life. In his autobiography ‚ÄúIn the Eye of the Storm‚Äù (2013, with Gill Tavner), he said: ‚ÄúIt was increasingly clear to me that the universe is God‚Äôs creation. As science was the means by which I would be able to explore and describe God‚Äôs creative work, I could not see how there could possibly be conflict between science and faith.‚Äù

Dr. Houghton provided a spark that led to a climate movement within the evangelical community. In 2002, the Rev. Rich Cizik, an American evangelical leader, heard Dr. Houghton speak at the University of Oxford in England and had a ‚Äúconversion on climate change so profound that he likened it to an ‚Äòaltar call,‚Äô when nonbelievers accept Jesus as their savior,‚Äù The New York Times wrote in 2005.

John Theodore Houghton was born in Dyserth, Wales, on Dec. 30, 1931, to Sidney and Miriam (Yarwood) Houghton. His father was a history teacher, and his mother taught mathematics before becoming a homemaker. At 16, John received a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford, in 1948.

‚ÄúNot only was I 16,‚Äù he wrote in the autobiography, ‚Äúbut I was a rather young 16 from a strict Christian background, with very little experience of anything other than home.‚Äù

But he made his way, studying mathematics and physics. He graduated from Oxford with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in 1951 and a doctorate in atmospheric, oceanic and planetary physics in 1955. He began to teach at Oxford in 1958.

In the 1970s, Dr. Houghton worked with NASA on the remote sensing instruments that allowed its Nimbus satellites to explore the earth‚Äôs atmosphere; the instrumentation helped transform the study of weather systems and the environment. In 1972, he became a fellow of the Royal Society, the British scientific society.

Dr. Houghton was director general and chief executive of the United Kingdom‚Äôs Meteorological Office from 1983 to 1991 and joined the effort to form the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or I.P.C.C. He served as a chairman of the panel‚Äôs scientific assessment working group from 1988 to 2002. In 1990, he helped set up the Hadley Center for Climate Prediction and Research, a leading center of climate work in Britain. He was knighted in 1991.

Dr. Houghton‚Äôs other books include ‚ÄúGlobal Warming: The Complete Briefing,‚Äù first published in 1994, and ‚ÄúDoes God Play Dice? A Look at the Story of the Universe‚Äù (1988).

He married Margaret Broughton in 1962; she died in 1986. In 1988, he married Sheila Thompson. In addition to his granddaughter Hannah, he is survived by his wife; two children from his first marriage, Peter Houghton and Janet Malcolm; a younger brother, Paul; and six other grandchildren. An older brother, David, died in 2015.

In recent years Dr. Houghton had retired to the Welsh seaside and was fading into dementia, Hannah Malcolm said, adding: ‚ÄúBut the sea remained with him. A good life.‚Äù

As a leader of the I.P.C.C., he had the skills of a statesman, said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele of the Universit√© Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. He recalled watching Dr. Houghton co-chair a meeting in 1995 in Madrid that led to a statement that the smoking gun of climate change had been found: The influence of human activities on climate was becoming discernible in observations of the present, not just in projections of the future.

‚ÄúFossil fuel companies and oil-dependent countries were intensely lobbying at that I.P.C.C. meeting to try to dilute the message,‚Äù Dr. van Ypersele said. But Dr. Houghton, he added, ‚Äúhad a deep understanding of the science,‚Äù and ‚Äúhe was also a British gentleman, able to listen patiently to the views of vested interests, and manage the meeting so that scientists would have the last word, as it should be.‚Äù

After a marathon session that was still going at 4 a.m., the tough language was approved.

Despite such efforts, however, effective global action to blunt the effects of a warming world has yet to happen. In a series of Twitter messages about her grandfather, Ms. Malcolm said: ‚ÄúWhen I was younger, my consistent memory of him was warnings over the devastation waiting us if we didn‚Äôt act on climate change. And I remember thinking how glad I was that scientists like him were in charge. But of course it isn‚Äôt the scientists in charge.‚Äù

Climate Change Is Transforming the Time-Honored Home Loan
By Christopher Flavelle

Climate change is starting to transform the classic home loan, a fixture of the American experience and financial system that dates back generations.

WASHINGTON -- Up and down the coastline, rising seas and climate change are transforming a fixture of American homeownership that dates back generations: the classic 30-year mortgage.

Home buyers are increasingly using mortgages that make it easier for them to stop making their monthly payments and walk away from the loan if the home floods or becomes unsellable or unlivable. More banks are getting buyers in coastal areas to make bigger down payments -- often as much as 40 percent of the purchase price, up from the traditional 20 percent -- a sign that lenders have awakened to climate dangers and want to put less of their own money at risk.

And in one of the clearest signs that banks are worried about global warming, they are increasingly getting these mortgages off their own books by selling them to government-backed buyers like Fannie Mae, where taxpayers would be on the hook financially if any of the loans fail.

""Conventional mortgages have survived many financial crises, but they may not survive the climate crisis,"" said Jesse Keenan, an associate professor at Tulane University. ""This trend also reflects a systematic financial risk for banks and the U.S. taxpayers who ultimately foot the bill.""

The trends foreshadow a broader reckoning. The question that matters, according to researchers, isn't whether the effects of climate change will start to ripple through the housing market. Rather, it's how fast those effects will occur and what they will look like.

The change has already begun. It's not only along the nation's rivers and coasts where climate-induced risk has started to push down home prices. In parts of the West, the growing danger of wildfires is already making it harder for homeowners to get insurance.

But the threat that climate change poses to the 30-year mortgage is different, striking at an American social institution that dates from the Great Depression. Before that, many home loans required owners to pay lenders back just a few years after buying a house, which led to waves of defaults and homelessness, according to Andrew Caplin, a professor of economics at New York University.

In response, the federal government created the Federal Housing Administration, which in turn standardized the way Americans finance their homes.

There was nothing magical about a period of 30 years, Dr. Caplin said; it simply proved useful, making payments predictable and affordable by stretching them out over decades. ""It was designed from a viewpoint of a consumer, who wouldn't find it too hard to understand exactly what they had committed to,"" Dr. Caplin said.

But now, as the world warms, that long-term nature of conventional mortgages might not be as desirable as it once was, as rising seas and worsening storms threaten to make some land uninhabitable. A retreat from the 30-year mortgage could also put homeownership out of reach for more Americans.

Changes to the housing market are just one of myriad ways global warming is disrupting American life, including spreading disease and threatening the food supply. It could also be one of the most economically significant. During the 2008 financial crisis, a decline in home values helped cripple the financial system and pushed almost nine million Americans out of work.

But increased flooding nationwide could have more far-reaching consequences on financial housing markets. In 2016, Freddie Mac's chief economist at the time, Sean Becketti, warned that losses from flooding both inland and along the coasts are ""likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and the Great Recession.""

If climate change makes coastal homes uninsurable, Dr. Becketti wrote, their value could fall to nothing, and unlike the 2008 financial crisis, ""homeowners will have no expectation that the values of their homes will ever recover.""

In 30 years from now, if global-warming emissions follow their current trajectory, almost half a million existing homes will be on land that floods at least once a year, according to data from Climate Central, a research organization. Those homes are valued at $241 billion.

Currently, new research shows banks rapidly shifting mortgages with flood risk off their books and over to organizations like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored entities whose debts are backed by taxpayers. In a paper this month in the journal Climatic Change, Dr. Keenan and Jacob T. Bradt, a doctoral student at Harvard University, described the activity, which suggests growing awareness among banks that climate change could cause defaults.

Tellingly, the lenders selling off coastal mortgages the fastest are smaller local banks, which are more likely than large national banks to know which neighborhoods face the greatest climate risk. ""They have their ears to the ground,"" Dr. Keenan said.

In 2009, local banks sold off 43 percent of their mortgages in vulnerable zones, Dr. Keenan and Mr. Bradt found, about the same share as other areas. But by 2017, the share had jumped by one-third, to 57 percent, despite staying flat in less vulnerable neighborhoods.

If coastal mortgages defaulted on those loans, it could cause losses for Fannie and Freddie. That pain could spread to taxpayers: In 2008, the two firms required $187 billion in public aid to stay solvent. They later repaid the money.

In a separate working paper with Marco Tedesco and Carolynne Hultquist of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Dr. Keenan found banks protecting themselves in other ways, such as lending less money to home buyers in vulnerable areas, relative to the value of the homes.

Typically, a bank will lend about 80 percent of the cost of a house, with the buyer putting down the other 20 percent. But examining several counties particularly exposed to rising seas, the researchers found that a growing share of mortgages had required down payments between 21 percent and 40 percent -- what Dr. Keenan called nonconventional loans.

In coastal Carteret County, N.C., the share of nonconventional mortgages increased by 14 percent between 2006 and 2017 in the areas most exposed to sea-level rise. That change can't be explained by the general trend there: In the rest of Carteret County, nonconventional loans became less common during the same period.

Similarly in St. Johns County, Fla., south of Jacksonville, between 2006 and 2017, the share of nonconventional loans in the most vulnerable areas increased by 6 percent, while falling 22 percent in the rest of the county. ""You're seeing a statistically significant trend,"" Dr. Keenan said.

The Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group, declined to comment directly on the findings. Pete Mills, the association's senior vice president of residential policy, cited the requirement for homeowners to buy insurance.

""Lenders make sure all properties are properly insured,"" Mr. Mills said in a statement. ""For loans in Special Flood Hazard Areas, flood insurance is required,"" he added, referring to areas the Federal Emergency Management Agency has determined have a high flood risk.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said, ""Any loan located in FEMA-designated Special Flood Hazard Areas must have flood insurance in order for the loan to be purchased by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.""

But flood insurance isn't likely to address the problem, Dr. Keenan said, because it doesn't protect against the risk of a house losing value and ultimately becoming unsellable.

Lenders aren't the only ones who seem to be inching away from traditional 30-year mortgages in risky areas. More homeowners are also taking out a type of mortgage that is less financially painful for a borrower to walk away from if a home becomes uninhabitable because of rising seas. These are known as interest-only mortgages -- the monthly payment covers only the interest on the loan, and doesn't reduce the principal owed.

Under normal circumstances, this kind of loan sounds like a bad deal: It's a loan you can never pay off with the regular monthly payments. However, it also means buyers aren't sinking any more of their own money into the property beyond a down payment. That's an advantage if you think the property may become unlivable.

""A household that expects the house will be flooded within a decade, say, is unlikely to value the accumulation of equity in this house,"" said Amine Ouazad, an associate professor of real estate economics at HEC Montreal who has researched the practice. ""The ability to walk away from a mortgage in case of major floods or sea-level rise is a feature.""

In new research this month, Dr. Ouazad found that, since the housing crash, the share of homes with fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages has declined sharply -- to less than 80 percent, as of 2016 -- in areas most exposed to storm surges. In the rest of the country, the rate has stayed constant, at about 90 percent of home loans.

Part of the difference was the interest-only loans, Dr. Ouazad found. More than 10 percent of homeowners in those areas had interest-only loans in 2016, compared with just 2.3 percent in other ZIP Codes. The work hasn't been peer-reviewed, and more research is needed, Dr. Ouazad said. But he said there's reason to think climate risks are part of the explanation.

The tougher question, according Carolyn Kousky, executive director of the Wharton Risk Center at the University of Pennsylvania, is what happens after that, when people quite simply no longer want to live in homes that keep flooding. ""What happens when the water starts lapping at these properties, and they get abandoned?"" she said.

Pandemic? Lab Says Main Crisis Is Still Climate
By Richard Schiffman

Nestled in the forest behind a guard house just north of the border between New York and New Jersey off Route 9W is one of the world's greatest meccas for climate change research.

Here, perched on the lip of the Palisades, a half-hour north of Manhattan, is a sylvan 180-acre campus where researchers have helped to untangle mystery after mystery about how our planet actually works. No other geoscience lab was as influential during the second half of the 20th century as Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. It is where the very phrase ""global warming"" was coined.

""Columbia's scientists are the Paul Reveres of climate change,"" said Peter de Menocal, the director of the Center for Climate and Life at Lamont. ""They have been ringing this bell loudly and with increasing urgency since the 1980s.""

Today, more than 300 researchers and graduate students work in almost monastic seclusion in a quirky mix of palatial homes, wooden cottages, machine shops and state-of-the-art scientific laboratories, which testifies to the long and disparate history of the place.

The land, originally a family estate, was given to Columbia by Florence Lamont after her husband, Thomas Lamont, a Wall Street banker, died in 1948. Maurice ""Doc"" Ewing, Lamont's first director, moved the university's seismograph there from its Manhattan campus, where it was being jostled by the nearby IRT subway. Other scientists followed. Gradually, the lab's mission expanded beyond geology. Lamont-Doherty now has the largest concentration of earth scientists on earth. Half of them are working on projects related to climate change.

Or at least they were working on them until the coronavirus slowed research to a glacial crawl. It's only the latest challenge they have faced. Even before the pandemic locked Lamont scientists out of their labs, the institution was struggling to compete with others for a steadily shrinking pot of federal dollars -- particularly when confronted by a government hostile to the very subject it studied.

""The Trump administration has hugely diminished funding for climate research,"" said Dr. de Menocal. ""It has gotten to the point now where you can't even use the word 'climate.' You have to say 'air quality' or some other aspect of the environment in your research proposal.""

He hopes that the virus crisis will, if nothing else, underscore the value of science. ""The take-home for me is that you really do have to support scientific research and listen to what the scientists are telling you,"" Dr. de Menocal said.

The crucial role the Lamont-Doherty lab plays in climate research all started with a brilliant and somewhat eccentric geologist named Wallace Broecker, who is credited as the first person to use the term ""global warming"" in a scientific paper -- 'Climatic Change: Are we on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?'-- published in 1975, a year before global temperatures began a steady rise that has continued until today.

Dr. Broecker likened the climate system to ""an angry beast"" that humans were ""poking with sticks."" Days before he died last year at 87, he warned that we are moving too slowly to cut greenhouse gas emissions. His suggestion for the future: Scientists should consider deploying a massive ""solar shield"" in Earth's atmosphere to cool the planet by deflecting the sun's rays.

Not everyone at the lab agrees, however, that massive, risky geoengineering schemes are the answer.

""Right now, we just don't know enough about how the climate system behaves to give the beast another big poke,"" cautioned Park Williams, a drought expert at the lab. ""If we did something dramatic now, we might simply be adding fuel to the fire.""

It's hardly the first time that Lamont scientists have disagreed. According to Robin Bell, a geophysicist who has studied polar ice sheets at Lamont since 1982, debates about how to preserve a livable planet (not to mention many more obscure scientific questions) were everyday affairs in the lab's cavernous cafeteria, which earlier housed the estate's swimming pool.

""That's how science advances,"" Dr. Bell said. ""You are going to test my ideas, you are going to challenge me, ask me questions that will change how I look at something.""

One question that invariably generates a lively discussion is how rapidly climate change will progress. Some at the lab had argued that impacts would develop slowly over many decades, even centuries. But a spate of recent extreme weather events suggests that climate is changing much faster than scientists anywhere had previously anticipated.

Dr. Bell (who has a ridge named after her in Antarctica) is trying to figure out how quickly polar ice sheets will melt, a critical factor for determining rates of sea level rise that threaten coastal cities like New York.

Her work -- like everything that they do at the lab, she said -- is very much a team effort.

""You wouldn't want a doctor who just worried about one part of you; you want somebody to look at your entire system,"" Dr. Bell said. ""Here you can find somebody who is thinking about the deep interior of the earth, the chemistry of the upper atmosphere and everything in between.""

The guiding principle ever since the lab was founded, Dr. Bell said, is that in order to predict the planet's future, you need to understand its past.

Little was known about Earth's 4.5-billion-year history until systematic field work began in the mid-20th century. In the 1960s, Lamont scientists used data from the lab's own pioneering expeditions to prove the theory of plate tectonics, which holds that the continents sit on massive geological plates that generate earthquakes and volcanic activity as they rub up against one another.

Much of that research was conducted by scientists on the research vessel Vema, a three-mast schooner that Columbia purchased in 1953. Until it was decommissioned in 1981, the Vema sailed more than a million nautical miles seeking knowledge of the planet's last great frontier -- the largely unexplored depths of the world's oceans. The first-ever relief map of the sea floor was published by Lamont in 1977 from measurements taken in part on the Vema.

The crew of the Vema and other research vessels also brought back samples. ""This is a library of mud,"" said Nichole Anest, director of the Lamont Core Repository. She gestured toward high shelving walls bristling with more than 40 miles of sediment cores drilled during those expeditions, some of them from over a mile below the surface of the sea.

Fine-grained red, green and white clays spilled out from opened cores on a nearby display table. ""The mud includes remains of millions of tiny foraminifera,"" Ms. Anest said, referring to a marine organism that lives both in the water column of the ocean and also in the sediments on the sea floor. ""By analyzing the chemistry of their shells, we can determine what the climate was like when they were formed.""

One crucial insight from the core analysis was that Earth's climate system has been far more volatile than anyone previously thought. It turns out it has a disconcerting tendency to change swiftly and dramatically rather than gradually over time.

A study by Dr. de Menocal of sediments off the coast of Africa showed that the present-day Sahara transformed from a lush savanna teeming with hippos and elephants to a virtually rainless desert in the mere geological blink of an eye (roughly a century) because of a sudden shift in the regional monsoon.

Could something equally disruptive happen now? They are taking that possibility seriously at the tree-ring lab, a long, gable-roofed structure that resembles a museum inside, with maps and cross sections of trees pinned to the walls and sitting on work tables.

""Tree rings are the bar codes of climate,"" Dr. Williams said as he entered a room stacked high with polished tree cores. ""They show us that the past 20 years in the U.S. Southwest have been as dry as any 20-year period in the last millennium."" Those drought-like conditions have increased the risk of megafires, which have already radically transformed the landscape in large swaths of the West.

Earlier generations of Lamonters may have been content to engage in pure scientific research, without concern for its practical implications. But scientists like Dr. Williams are increasingly focused on helping communities actively prepare for climate change. He is currently using his knowledge of fire and climate to advise officials in California about where best to direct future fire prevention efforts.

Likewise for Radley Horton, a climatologist who served as the lead scientist for the New York City Panel on Climate Change. ""What I like to do first is sit down with decision makers, infrastructure stewards, farmers, people in developing countries,"" Dr. Horton said. ""I ask them, 'What are your current vulnerabilities to extreme weather events, what keeps you up at night?""'

One thing that keeps public health officials up at night: the deadly combination of extreme heat and humidity, which can push humans beyond our biological limit.

""There are places like the Persian Gulf, where we are already beginning to see these lethal combinations emerge, where it is thermodynamically impossible to sweat fast enough to stay cool,"" Dr. Horton said. ""Climate models need to be better designed to help communities around the world prepare for previously underappreciated risks like this.""

Dr. Horton is consulting with New York's power company, Con Edison, which is upgrading its infrastructure to prepare for anticipated spikes in peak demand from air-conditioner use during the projected hotter summers ahead. He is also working with the city as it plans an eventual ""managed retreat"" from some low-lying neighborhoods like coastal Staten Island and the Rockaways, Queens.

Lamont scientists discovered that New York City (along with much of the Eastern Seaboard) is actually sinking nearly as quickly as the sea around it is rising -- a double threat that suggests that America's largest city will have a far different shoreline in the not-so-distant future.

In the past, climate scientists mostly steered clear of the political controversies that swirled around their work. Things have changed. ""Fewer researchers,"" Dr. Horton said, ""are just sitting in the ivory tower."" The younger ones, in particular, are speaking publicly about the need to act, even challenging Columbia University to do more to curb its own emissions.

But just as Lamont scientists are feeling more energized, the lab continues losing the financial support of the government, which was once its largest source of financing.

""The existing federal funding model is not well suited to this unfolding disaster,"" Dr. de Menocal said. ""We need a vastly accelerated and vastly better-funded research program if we are going to find the answers in time to do something about it.""

""We've watched the Covid-19 situation unfold at incredible speed,"" Dr. de Menocal said. He worries that environmental threats are not being felt as viscerally. ""The climate crisis is playing out on a much slower time frame. We know roughly what to expect and when to expect it, and we should be preparing with the same level of urgency.""

There is little time to waste, he said, though he admitted that he had no idea when scientists might return to the laboratory itself. The virus, Dr. de Menocal said, has shown us how vulnerable we are as a society.

""The laws of nature don't care whether we believe in them or not,"" he said. ""The tragedy and inconvenience we've seen from this pandemic pale in comparison to what's in store from climate change. There is a much bigger crisis knocking on our door and we have to remember the big lesson from this pandemic: Science saves lives.""

Reluctant Nod From U.S. as Finance Ministers Issue Statement on Climate Threats
By Alan Rappeport and Lisa Friedman

The United States, under pressure from Europe, agreed to include a climate reference in an official G20 statement.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- The United States, under pressure from European countries to address the economic threat of climate change, agreed on Sunday to include a reference to those risks in a joint statement at the conclusion of a meeting of the world's top economic leaders.

The inclusion of the term ""climate change"" in a statement from the Group of 20 finance ministers appeared to be a notable, but subtle, acknowledgment by the United States that the threat from rising temperatures was a valid economic concern. The reference, on the third page of the document and at the bottom of a long list of potential risks, said the ""financial stability implications of climate change"" were being monitored by the G20's Financial Stability Board.

The Trump administration does not accept the established science that human activities are the dominant cause of climate change. It has aggressively rolled back environmental regulations, including those aimed at curbing greenhouse gases, over the last three years. President Trump's position that these regulations hold back business have left the United States at odds with other countries at international forums, regularly threatening to derail official statements, or communiqu√©s. But rising temperatures and increasingly frequent and severe weather events have stoked concerns that climate change poses a significant risk to the world economy and the global financial system.

Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, said in an interview on Sunday he and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had a long discussion on Saturday evening about the language. While Mr. Le Maire had hoped for something more extensive, he said he believed that progress was made.

""I think he clearly understands that even if we do not share the exactly the same assessment on climate change, there is a need to address the issue within the G7 and within the G20,"" Mr. Le Maire said of Mr. Mnuchin. ""I think that we have a totally different perspective on the risk of climate change -- for us, this is clearly one of the major risks. This is a financial risk.""

Mr. Mnuchin's counterparts were pushing for a more assertive pronouncement of climate change as an economic headwind, leading to last-minute negotiations over how the phrase would appear in the statement. References to climate change as a risk have been excluded from such statements while Mr. Trump has been in office.

At a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin played down the inclusion, saying it was ""merely"" a factual reference to work that the Financial Stability Board was already doing.

""I did not bend to pressure from the Europeans,"" Mr. Mnuchin said. ""Some of the people felt it was relevant to put in.""

The Trump administration has long demonstrated antagonism to combating global warming, including pulling out of the Paris Agreement, the attempted censoring of basic scientific facts and advocating policies of developing more fossil fuels that are responsible for planet-warming emissions.

In recent months, Mr. Mnuchin has faced questions about the consequences of failing to safeguard the environment. He has generally demurred, noting that while he used to drive an electric car -- a Tesla -- he is not an expert on climate science.

However, he has cast doubt about climate policies that he believes could inhibit growth and under his watch the Treasury Department has rejected policies such as carbon pricing to fight climate change. In December, he said he did not believe that studying the economic risk of climate change fell under the purview of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the interagency panel he oversees that is charged with monitoring risks to the financial system.

Over the past three years, the Trump administration has systematically disengaged the Treasury Department from all aspects of addressing climate change.

In 2017, it reversed an Obama-era guidance restricting the United States from supporting the financing of coal plants through the World Bank and other global investment institutions. The new policy calls for the United States to ""promote universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and clean energy, help countries access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.""

The administration also eliminated the agency's Office of Environment and Energy, reassigning its staff elsewhere within the Treasury Department.

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, Mr. Mnuchin garnered headlines when he mocked Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate change activist, for expressing views on fossil fuel investments without a degree in economics. Mr. Mnuchin's wife, Louise Linton, took to Instagram to defend Ms. Thunberg and her environmental views before deleting the posts.

While in Davos, Mr. Mnuchin also told Christine Lagarde, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, that she was incorrect in pinpointing the risks of climate change as a critical issue for the global finance community.

""I just don't want to kid ourselves,"" he said. ""I think there's no way we can possibly model what these risks are over the next 30 years with a level of certainty, given what I think is changes in technology and everything along the way.""

At a time when investors are more alarmed and active than ever on climate change, the absence of the United States Treasury Department is notable. On Friday, economists at JPMorgan issued a report to clients warning that life ""as we know it"" could be threatened by climate change, and that it could affect economic growth, health and the stability of national security.

""Here you are, you're the most important economy in the world still. All of your peers are working together to figure out how to use the instruments of fiscal monetary policy in order to manage a smooth energy transition, and you're not in the room,"" said Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former climate change envoy for the World Bank.

Matthew J. Kotchen, an economics professor at Yale University who led the Office of Environment and Energy during the Obama administration, said having a specialized office dealing with environmental issues meant climate change was being discussed alongside tax policy and exchange rates three times a week at the highest levels of the department.

""The fact that Treasury is not leading on this and getting involved says they're not even responding to their immediate constituency,"" Mr. Kotchen said, noting that the insurance and finance industries are increasingly thinking about how to manage the risks from climate change.

The Federal Reserve has also been cautious in its approach to climate-related issues, even as other central banks have made them a top priority -- most notably the Bank of England, which under Mark Carney has been developing climate risk-related stress tests for banks.

Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, summed up the central bank's approach to climate change during his January news conference: ""Society's overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed.""

While Mr. Powell has emphasized that climate issues are largely outside the central bank's remit, he and his colleagues are attentive to the risk that global warming and severe weather could pose to the financial system, which the Fed supervises.

""I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change,"" he said in January.

As part of that effort, Mr. Powell suggested the Fed might join the Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of central banks that advocates sustainable finance and low-carbon economic growth. The Fed currently attends the meetings but has not formally signed on.

But just weeks after Mr. Powell said the Fed would probably join the network ""at some point,"" he seemed to soften that stance in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee: ""We haven't made a decision yet,"" he said.

""Climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it's essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments,"" Mr. Powell said.

European countries, which are currently considering new carbon border taxes, are pressing ahead with their climate responses and trying to pull the reluctant United States along.

The International Monetary Fund warned last week that the global economy could face ""major shocks"" if climate change was not addressed.

""The climate crisis is upon us,"" Kristalina Georgieva, the I.M.F.'s managing director, said Friday at an event in Riyadh on the eve of the G20.

S. Fred Singer, 95, Physicist Who
Denied Climate Risks

By John Schwartz

Derided as a ‚ÄúMerchant of Doubt,‚Äù he spent decades trying to refute the evidence of global warming and other environmental risks.

S. Fred Singer, a physicist whose efforts to refute established climate science earned him the enmity of experts, died on April 6 at a nursing facility in Rockville, Md. He was 95.

His death was confirmed by Rochelle Lieberman, a cousin.

Even as evidence of the human causes of climate change and its risks to the planet coalesced into a scientific certainty, Dr. Singer argued that the threat of climate change was overblown, that efforts to blunt its effects would cause grievous economic damage, and that the effects of global warming would be largely beneficial.

‚ÄúNot only was Fred among the first atmospheric experts to publicly question the validity of climate models, but as it became more and more politically incorrect to criticize the models, Fred was unmoved,‚Äù said Steven J. Milloy, a climate-change denialist who served on President Trump‚Äôs transition team for the Environmental Protection Agency. ‚ÄúHe doubled and tripled down on substantive criticism of the models, putting his scientific view ahead of the risks to his stellar career and reputation.‚Äù

But most climate experts saw a humbug.

Dr. Singer was a focus of the book ‚ÄúMerchants of Doubt‚Äù (2010), which examined how tobacco and other industries promoted a small group of scientists who worked to muddy the truth on climate change and other environmental risks, including secondhand smoke, asbestos and acid rain. He was one of those, the book‚Äôs authors, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, wrote, who ‚Äúused their scientific credentials to present themselves as authorities‚Äù and ‚Äúused their authority to try to discredit any science they didn‚Äôt like.‚Äù

In an interview, Dr. Oreskes, who is a historian of science at Harvard University, noted that Dr. Singer singled out reputable climate scientists for personal and professional attack. ‚ÄúI think he did a lot of damage, through literally decades of casting doubt on established science,‚Äù she said.

Before he was a vocal climate-change contrarian, Dr. Singer had an illustrious scientific career. An early rocket scientist whose work was important to the development of earth observation satellites, he was a professor at the University of Maryland, the University of Miami and the University of Virginia, among other institutions, alternating with positions in government.

From 1962 to 1964, he was director of what was known as the National Weather Satellite Center. He was the deputy assistant secretary for water quality and research at the Department of the Interior from 1967 to 1970 and then, until 1971, the deputy assistant administrator for policy at the newly formed Environmental Protection Agency. From 1987 to 1989, he was chief scientist at the Department of Transportation.

Despite his accomplishments, said Ms. Lieberman, his cousin, ‚Äúhe wasn‚Äôt flashy about things like that.‚Äù She recalled that during a visit with him to the National Air and Space Museum in Washington when she was a little girl, she was surprised to find him cited in an exhibition about earth observation satellites. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs his name on this?‚Äù she recalled thinking. ‚ÄúI was too young to appreciate it at the time.‚Äù

In 1990, Dr. Singer created the Science and Environmental Policy Project ‚Äúto challenge government environmental policies based on poor science,‚Äù as the group‚Äôs website states. He would later try to undercut the work of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by creating a think tank called the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change.

The U.N. group warned in 1995 that warming ‚Äúis likely to cause widespread economic, social and environmental dislocation over the next century if emissions of heat-trapping gases are not reduced.‚Äù Dr. Singer remained unfazed. ‚ÄúThey have no evidence. None,‚Äù he told fellow contrarians at a conference in Copenhagen in 2009.

With the coming of the Trump administration, climate contrarians were once again in demand, and Dr. Singer was considered ‚Äúthe most senior of Mr. Trump‚Äôs experts on climate change,‚Äù Peter Ferrara, a senior fellow at Heartland, wrote last year in an essay in The Washington Times.

Siegfried Fred Singer was born on Sept. 27, 1924, in Vienna to Joseph Singer, a jeweler, and his wife, Anna, according to the 2004 book ‚ÄúShapers of the Great Debate on Conservation: A Biographical Dictionary.‚Äù

His family fled the Nazis, sending him to England through the kindertransport program. He made his way to the United States in 1940 and was reunited with his family in Ohio.

He graduated from the Ohio State University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in electrical engineering in 1943. He signed naturalization papers in 1945, while serving in the Navy. He received a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University in 1948.

Dr. Singer married Isabel Robbins in 1979; they divorced in 1983. In 1990 he married Candace Carolyn Crandall, who helped set up the Science and Environmental Policy Project. They divorced in 2000. He had no children from either marriage, though he had five stepchildren. A sister, Melanie Watkins, died last year. His survivors include his stepchildren Erin Gifford and Ryan Hill, and a close extended family.

A prolific writer, Dr. Singer published opinion articles in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal; his most recent for The Journal (which is confuted by reams of data and research) appeared in 2018, when he was 94. He wrote or co-wrote more than a dozen books.

Reacting to Dr. Singer‚Äôs death, Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&amp;M University, wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúI always liked Fred personally,‚Äù comparing him to ‚Äúan irascible uncle who would say the most preposterous things at Thanksgiving and everyone would just roll their eyes.‚Äù Dr. Singer occasionally spoke at Professor Dessler‚Äôs classes on climate change policy.

In an interview, Professor Dessler stood by his fond description, but added that while Dr. Singer‚Äôs early career was respectable, his climate work was deeply flawed.

‚ÄúNone of the scientific claims he made,‚Äù he said, ‚Äústood the test of time.‚Äù

Chasing a $7 Million Climate Prize, Inventors Craft Vodka and Jet Fuel
By Christopher Flavelle

""I said, 'Hold on, you made this from carbon dioxide?""' recalled his friend, Gregory Constantine, who worked in marketing for Smirnoff. Now the two are in the vodka business, using Dr. Sheehan's technology and marketing it as a way to fight global warming.

Their company, Air Co., was one of 10 finalists for a pair of $7.5 million prizes to be awarded this year to the teams that can devise the most profitable use for carbon dioxide, which causes global warming by trapping the sun's heat when released into the atmosphere by power plants, cars and industry. The five-year competition, the Carbon XPrize, was designed to create a financial incentive to capture carbon dioxide and use it profitably, instead of releasing it.

However, just as the Brooklyn vodka makers -- along with the nine other finalists from as far afield as Nova Scotia (stronger concrete), India (an ingredient in pharmaceuticals) and China (a plastics replacement) -- were approaching the finish line, the competition has been delayed by the coronavirus crisis.

""There's a lot of upheaval,"" said Marcius Extavour, a Canadian physicist who leads the energy team for the XPrize Foundation, which in the past has offered multimillion-dollar awards for everything from building reusable manned spaceships to creating water from air. ""We're still rolling with the punches.""

The unusual contest offers a reminder that even as the world focuses on the coronavirus, slower-moving crises like climate change continue to fester, Dr. Extavour said. The past decade was the warmest ever, and polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s.

The virus crisis also shows the risks of waiting for a problem to get out of control before taking adequate steps to deal with it, he said. ""This prize is an exercise in trying to get ahead of the curve,"" Dr. Extavour said.

Rather than focus on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as renewable power, the prize came at the problem from the opposite direction: It set out to create financial incentives for companies that produce a lot of carbon dioxide to hang on to it, rather than releasing it. Doing so is technologically feasible, but it doesn't typically generate any revenue.

To claim the prize, sponsored by NRG Energy and a coalition of Canadian oil sands companies, each of the 10 finalist teams were by now meant to begin transporting their equipment and personnel to two sites, one in Calgary and the other in Gillette, Wyo., to show their projects in operation and produce data backing their claims.

But the three teams based outside North America -- from India, Scotland and China -- are now blocked from flying to the United States and Canada, and the American teams that were supposed to go to Calgary are likewise blocked from crossing the border.

Dr. Extavour said no final date has yet been set for the rescheduled final round of the competition. That puts the teams competing for the money in a tough position, delaying their chance to get the attention of potential investors or clients.

""We need to be able to take that massive foghorn that is the XPrize,"" said Rob Niven, founder of CarbonCure, the Nova Scotia-based company that is among the finalists.

'A Crazy Enough Idea'

Back in 2005, Mr. Niven, then a master's student at McGill University in Montreal, attended a United Nations conference on climate change being held nearby. There, he heard representatives from Pacific Island states talking about losing not just their land to rising seas, but also their history and identity. ""It was just crushing,"" he recalled.

Mr. Niven wrote his thesis on how to turn carbon dioxide into concrete and, after he graduated, decided to take the 10,000 Canadian dollars he had left in unspent student loans, follow his girlfriend to Halifax and try to turn his idea into a business.

The first year was horrible. ""Everyone thinks that you're wasting your time,"" Mr. Niven said. But he got a break when a local concrete company agreed to let him into its plant to experiment with how to apply the technology in practice.

""That's just a crazy enough idea that it might work,"" Mr. Niven recalled the plant owner telling him.

After some tinkering, Mr. Niven found an approach that let him retrofit existing concrete plants in a way that lets them use less cement -- the most expensive and also carbon-intensive component of concrete -- by injecting carbon dioxide near the end of the manufacturing process. The company has raised money from a venture-capital fund whose board is chaired by Bill Gates.

His hope was that winning the prize, or at least putting up a good showing, might help him scale up the process faster. ""At this rate of growth, we're not going to matter,"" he said. ""We're trying to solve climate change. We don't have time to goof around.""

First Skateboards, Then Jet Fuel

Another competitor, Dimensional Energy, owes its existence to Jason Salfi's decision to leave his skateboard company.

Mr. Salfi founded a company called Comet, which made skateboards from environmentally-friendly materials such as sustainably forested hardwood. In 2014, he left to work for an organization run by New York State whose goal was to help researchers turn ideas for clean energy into businesses.

In 2016, Mr. Salfi came across separate applications from two researchers at Cornell, in Ithaca, N.Y., both of whom were working on ways to turn carbon dioxide into energy. He realized that each researcher had a part of the puzzle that the other needed, and neither had time to run a business. And he had heard about the XPrize, with its $20 million purse.

""I said, 'Wow, we're all in Ithaca,""' Mr. Salfi recalled, and proposed they work together. ""Really the main operating principle was, let's set this business up and compete in the Carbon XPrize.""

They founded Dimensional Energy, with Mr. Salfi as chief executive. The technology uses concentrated sunlight to turn carbon dioxide into industrial energy sources like syngas, which is used to produce jet fuel, diesel and other liquid fuels.

""We mimic natural photosynthesis,"" Mr. Salfi said. ""We take sunlight and carbon dioxide, and turn it into what becomes industrial nutrients.""

Vodka, or Hand Sanitizer?

Still, when it comes to sheer marketing potential, the other competitors may struggle to match Air Co.

After Dr. Sheehan and Mr. Constantine joined forces, they needed to scale up, eventually building a 2,500-square-foot facility in the Bushwick neighborhood of Brooklyn, an area full of artists and industrial spaces. Getting the permits alone took almost two years.

More important, though, they had to show that their vodka actually tasted good. Air Co. entered its vodka in a blind taste test at last year's Luxury Masters competition and won a gold medal. One panelist said he loved the texture, ""which had a little viscosity.""

Mr. Constantine said that more than 60 venues in New York City have signed purchase agreements to buy their vodka. Of course, the coronavirus crisis has put that business on hold, with bars, restaurants and retailers shutting down.

In the meantime, he and Mr. Sheehan are putting vodka production on hold, instead using the alcohol they make for hand sanitizer to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Mr. Constantine said they plan to produce 1,600 bottles' worth. ""We're actually out of product at the moment,"" Mr. Constantine said.

How Debt and Climate Change Pose ‚ÄòSystemic Risk‚Äô to
World Economy

By Somini Sengupta

With dozens of countries struggling to manage both staggering debt and mounting climate disasters, some
Ô¨Ånancial leaders are calling for green debt relief.

How does a country deal with climate disasters when it‚Äôs drowning in debt? Not very well, it turns out.
Especially not when a global pandemic clobbers its economy.

Take   Belize,   Fiji   and   Mozambique.   Vastly   different   countries,   they   are   among   dozens   of   nations   at   the
crossroads   of   two   mounting   global   crises   that   are   drawing   the   attention   of   international   Ô¨Ånancial
institutions: climate change and debt.

They owe staggering amounts of money to various foreign lenders. They face staggering climate risks, too.
And now, with the coronavirus pandemic pummeling their economies, there is a growing recognition that
their debt obligations stand in the way of meeting the immediate needs of their people ‚Äî not to mention
the investments required to protect them from climate disasters.

The combination of debt, climate change and environmental degradation ‚Äúrepresents a systemic risk to the
global economy that may trigger a cycle that depresses revenues, increases spending and exacerbates
climate   and   nature   vulnerabilities,‚Äù   according   to   a   new   assessment   by   the   World   Bank,   International
Monetary Fund and others, which was seen by The Times. It comes after months of pressure from academics
and advocates for lenders to address this problem.

The bank and the I.M.F., whose top ofÔ¨Åcials are meeting this week, are planning talks in the next few months
with debtor countries, creditors, advocates and ratings agencies to Ô¨Ågure out how to make new money
available for what they call a green economic recovery. The goal is to come up with concrete proposals
before the international climate talks in November and ultimately, to get buy-in from the world‚Äôs wealthiest
countries, including China, which is the largest single creditor country in the world.

Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in an emailed statement that green recovery
programs had the potential to spur ambitious climate action in developing countries, ‚Äúespecially at a time
they face Ô¨Åscal constraints because of the impact of the pandemic on their economies.‚Äù

One of the countries at the crossroads of the climate and debt crises is Belize, a middle-income country on
the Caribbean coast of Central America. Its foreign debt had been steadily rising for the last few years. It was
also feeling some of the most acute effects of climate change: sea level rise, bleached corals, coastal erosion.
The pandemic dried up tourism, a mainstay of its economy. Then, after two hurricanes, Eta and Iota, hit
neighboring Guatemala, Ô¨Çoods swept away farms and roads downstream in Belize.

Today, the debt that Belize owes its foreign creditors is equal to 85 percent of its entire national economy. The
private credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs has downgraded its creditworthiness, making it tougher
to get loans on the private market. The International Monetary Fund calls its debt levels ‚Äúunsustainable.‚Äù

Belize, said Christopher Coye, the country‚Äôs minister of state for Ô¨Ånance, needs immediate debt relief to deal
with the effects of global warming that it had little role in creating.

‚ÄúHow do we pursue climate action?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are Ô¨Åscally constrained at this point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should be compensated for suffering the excesses of others and supported in mitigating and adapting
to climate change effects ‚Äî certainly in the form of debt relief and concessionary funding,‚Äù Mr. Coye said.

Many Caribbean countries like Belize do not qualify for low-interest loans that poorer countries are eligible
for.



The United Nations said Thursday that the global economic collapse endangered nearly $600 billion in debt

 



service payments over the next Ô¨Åve years. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are
important lenders, but so are rich countries, as well as private banks and bondholders. The global Ô¨Ånancial
system would face a huge problem if countries faced with shrinking economies defaulted on their debts.s


‚ÄúWe cannot walk head on, eyes wide open, into a debt crisis that is foreseeable and preventable,‚Äù the United
Nations Secretary General, Ant√≥nio Guterres, said last week as he called for debt relief for a broad range of
countries. ‚ÄúMany developing countries face Ô¨Ånancing constraints that mean they cannot invest in recovery
and resilience.‚Äù

The Biden administration, in an executive order on climate change, said it would use its voice in international
Ô¨Ånancial institutions, like the World Bank, to align debt relief with the goals of the Paris climate agreement,
though it hasn‚Äôt yet detailed what that means.

The   discussions   around   debt   and   climate   are   likely   to   intensify   in   the   run   up   to   the   climate   talks   in
November, where money is expected to be one of the main sticking points. Rich nations are nowhere close
to   delivering   the   promised   $100   billion   a   year   to   help   poorer   countries   deal   with   the   effects   of   global
warming. Low- and middle-income countries alone owed $8.1 trillion to foreign lenders in 2019, the most
recent year for which the data is available ‚Äî and that was before the pandemic.

At the time, half of all countries that the World Bank classiÔ¨Åed as low-income were either in what it called
‚Äúdebt distress or at a high risk of it.‚Äù Many of those are also acutely vulnerable to climate change, including
more frequent droughts, stronger hurricanes and rising sea levels that wash away coastlines.

(The fund said on Monday that it would not require 28 of the world‚Äôs poorest countries to make debt
payments through October, so their governments can use the money on emergency pandemic-related
relief.)

Lately, there‚Äôs been a Ô¨Çurry of proposals from economists, advocates and others to address the problem. The
details vary. But they all call, in one way or another, for rich countries and private creditors to offer debt relief,
so countries can use those funds to transition away from fossil fuels, adapt to the effects of climate change,
or obtain Ô¨Ånancial reward for the natural assets they already protect, like forests and wetlands. One widely
circulated proposal calls on the Group of 20 (the world‚Äôs 20 biggest economies) to require lenders to offer
relief ‚Äúin exchange for a commitment to use some of the newfound Ô¨Åscal space for a green and inclusive
recovery.‚Äù

On the other side of the world from Belize, the low-lying PaciÔ¨Åc island nation of Fiji has experienced a
succession of storms in recent years that brought destruction and the need to borrow money to rebuild. The
pandemic brought an economic downturn. In December, tropical cyclone Yasa destroyed homes and crops.
Fiji‚Äôs debts soared, including to China, and the country, whose very existence is threatened by sea level rise,
pared back planned climate projects, according to research by the World Resources Institute.

The authors proposed what they called a climate-health-debt swap, where bilateral creditors, namely China,
would forgive some of the debt in exchange for climate and health care investments. (China has said nothing
publicly about the idea of debt swaps.)

And then there‚Äôs Mozambique. The sixth-poorest country in the world.

It was already sinking under huge debts, including secret loans that the government had not disclosed,
when, in 2019, came back-to-back cyclones. They killed 1,000 people and left physical damages costing more
than $870 million. Mozambique took on more loans to cope. Then came the pandemic. The I.M.F. says the
country is in debt distress.

Six   countries   on   the   continent   are   in   debt   distress,   and   many   more   have   seen   their   credit   ratings
downgraded by private ratings agencies. In March, Ô¨Ånance ministers from across Africa said that many of
their countries had spent a sizable chunk of their budgets already to deal with extreme weather events like
droughts and Ô¨Çoods, and some countries were spending a tenth of their budgets on climate   adaptation
efforts. ‚ÄúOur Ô¨Åscal buffers are now truly depleted,‚Äù they wrote.

In developing countries, the share of government revenues that go into paying foreign debts nearly tripled to
17.4 percent between 2011 and 2020, an analysis by Eurodad, a debt relief advocacy group found.

Research suggests that climate   risks   have   already   made   it   more   expensive   for   developing   countries   to
borrow money. The problem is projected to get worse. A recent paper found climate change will raise the
cost of borrowing for many more countries as early as 2030 unless efforts are made to sharply reduce

 





greenhouse gas emissions.

Biden Wants to Spend Billions to Fight Climate Change. It's
Not Enough.

By Farhad Manjoo

His plan is too big to pass, and too small to work.

To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times,

.

Joe Biden's new infrastructure plan is far and away the most ambitious climate change idea ever proposed
by an American president. Granted this is not an especially high bar: The $2 trillion plan announced on
Wednesday may be the only major climate-focused proposal ever offered by an American president.

Still, Biden's plan absolutely dwarfs the last big spending bill to address the climate, Barack Obama's 2009
stimulus, which provided $90 billion in investments for clean energy. Biden would spend nearly that much
just on public transit. He also calls for $174 billion for electric vehicle infrastructure; $80 billion to improve rail
lines; $50 billion to strengthen essential services against severe weather; and $35 billion for climate-related
research and development.

And that's just on the climate. The White House's fact sheet outlining the complete infrastructure proposal
runs to 27 printed pages on my computer; the word ""billion"" appears 69 times. Reading through it can feel
like watching a cheesy infomercial or an Oprah giveaway. Here's $400 billion for home care workers, $300
billion for manufacturers, $100 billion for work force development -- but wait, there's more! The electric grid,
water systems, broadband -- you get $100 billion, and you get $100 billion, and you get $100 billion!

What I'm saying is, Biden's proposal is gargantuan. And if a version manages to pass Congress at anywhere
near its current scope, it would constitute a historic level of spending to mitigate the climate crisis   and
improve basic American services to a level above ""crumbling.""

Yet here is the stark shame of our current political moment: Huge as it sounds, the Biden plan is not nearly
big enough. Rather than inspiring optimism, then, the vast size of the proposal sets up a disheartening
conundrum for anyone looking forward to a habitable future on this fragile planet: Any plan bold enough to
effectively address climate change seems unlikely to survive the American political system. And any bill that
can survive our politics may not make enough of a dent on the climate.

A 2019 estimate by the Roosevelt Institute suggests it will take about $1 trillion in spending per year over at
least 10 years to achieve a carbon-neutral American economy; several other estimates come to a similar
conclusion. Part of the investment is likely to come from the private sector, but most will need to be from the
government. Biden's proposal is just a Ô¨Åfth of what the institute estimates is the minimum amount that the
government needs to spend to stave off the worst projected dangers of a warming climate; at the high end
of spending projections, it's only an eighth.

Republicans are already balking at the cost of Biden's plan -- or, more precisely, they're balking at the
prospect of raising taxes on corporations to pay for it. Last month Democrats passed Biden's $1.9 trillion
Covid-19 recovery plan, and a huge infrastructure proposal seems to poll well with voters. But congressional
Democrats from different factions are already calling for big changes to various parts of the plan, and the
party doesn't have much room to lose support in either the House or the Senate.

It isn't just climate change that might be left behind when Congress is done chewing up Biden's plan. I spent
much of Wednesday afternoon talking about  Biden's   ideas   with   advocates   for   public   transit   and   other
environmentally friendly transportation systems. They were giddy about the boldness of Biden's proposals,
especially its recognition that the nation is far too dependent on cars.

 





Among the bright spots: The plan calls for $115 billion in spending on roads and bridges, but unlike many
previous highway-funding proposals, Biden's plan emphasizes repairing roads before expanding them or
building new ones. This is crucial because one of every Ô¨Åve miles of roadway in America is rated in poor
condition -- but when given federal money for roads, states often spend a lot of it on expansion rather than
repair.


This is counterproductive. New roads are often justiÔ¨Åed as a way to reduce trafÔ¨Åc, but that's not how trafÔ¨Åc
works -- new and expanded roads tend to encourage more driving, just making congestion worse. New
roads also make for more maintenance, adding to the backlog of repairs.

Another novelty in a federal highway bill is the proposal's emphasis on road safety. It includes $20 billion to
reduce crashes and fatalities ""especially for cyclists and pedestrians,"" constituencies that are often forgotten
about in spending for cars. The plan also outlines many ideas to address racial equity, including a $20 billion
program to redress the practice of building highways through Black neighborhoods.

But at the moment, Biden's big ideas exist mainly as a fact sheet -- there is no written bill yet, and in the
sausage-making of transportation legislation, ambitious ideas are often left behind.

""Whether what they write at every step matches their rhetoric, that is the real question,"" said Beth Osborne,
the director of Transportation for America, an advocacy group. Osborne served as the deputy assistant
secretary for transportation policy in the Obama administration, and she notes that Obama too called for
repairing roads before expanding them. But she regrets that Obama's progressive rhetoric on transportation
policy did not translate to progressive legislation.

""Congress and the administration have been left off the hook -- but no one ever called them on it, and no
one ever does,"" she told me. ""I'm hoping this time they do.""

I am too. I plan to watch the process closely and I promise to throw a columnistic tantrum if the promises
aren't   met.   But   it   will   likely   take   many   months   for   a   version   of   the   package   to   wend   its   way   through
Congress, and public interest is likely to die down through the long slog. Given the mismatch between the
scale of the crisis and the political will to do something big, I can't say I'm very hopeful.

CLIMATE FWD:

Here to Help; How to Get Involved In Environmental Issues

President Biden is planning a huge economic program that would represent a fundamental shift in the way
Democrats treat the environment: Climate change would not be a side issue.

Our   virtual   event   series,   Netting   Zero,   returns   on   Thursday.   Moderated   by   the   Times   journalist   Henry
Fountain, this episode will explore climate solutions linked to the world's oceans. You can sign up here.

President Biden's economic team is Ô¨Ånalizing plans to invest between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in spending
and tax credits to lift the economy, but one thing is already certain: Tackling climate change and shifting to
clean energy will underpin virtually every part of the package.

The move represents a major philosophical shift in how Democrats talk about solving global warming.
They're not treating it like a side element of broader economic stimulus efforts, as in the Obama era. This
time, Ô¨Åxing climate change is at the heart of the economic plan.

Why it matters: Democrats have struggled to make the case for reducing planet-warming greenhouse gases.
The new spending plans show they are coalescing around a clear message, that solving climate change goes
hand-in-hand with lifting the economy.

The numbers: Climate-related spending in the economic plan could reach $2 trillion, one source said.

Biden appointees at the E.P.A. said they were shocked by the extent of political meddling in scientiÔ¨Åc
decisions under the Trump administration. They're carrying out a public accounting.

The Senate leader stalls an insurance overhaul

The ofÔ¨Åce of Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has put the brakes on a plan by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to update Ô¨Çood insurance rates by making them more accurately reÔ¨Çect
the risks faced by individual policyholders.

The new rates were supposed to start going into effect on Oct. 1. Now with Mr. Schumer objecting that the
overhaul will hurt some of his New York constituents, it's unclear whether that will still happen.

The dust-up demonstrates a big problem for elected ofÔ¨Åcials: Measures to address the risks that come with
rising seas can be very unpopular among constituents with waterfront property. -- Christopher Flavelle and
Emily Cochrane

Key numbers: For 23 percent of households with Ô¨Çood insurance, costs would go down under the FEMA plan.
Another 73 percent would see no change, or an increase of no more than $20 a month. But some high-risk
households would eventually see their rates go up Ô¨Åvefold or more.

Why   it   matters:   Flood   insurance   premiums   are   among   the   government's   most   powerful   tools   for
discouraging construction in high-risk areas.

After a season of Ô¨Åre, Ô¨Çoods ravage Australia

Two huge storms have converged over eastern Australia over the past week, dumping more than three feet
of rain in just Ô¨Åve days. The Ô¨Çooding comes less than a year after the country suffered the worst wildÔ¨Åres in
its recorded history.

Scientists say that both forms of catastrophe represent Australia's new normal. The country is one of many
seeing a pattern of intensiÔ¨Åcation -- more extreme hot days and heat waves, as well as more extreme rainfalls
over short periods. -- Damien Cave

Video: The Ô¨Çoods necessitated at least 500 rescues in New South Wales and Queensland.



 



Also important this week:


Fish farming is getting better: Fish raised in captivity are eating more veggies and less wild Ô¨Åsh, a new study
has found. That's good news for nature.

The seas are still vulnerable: Bottom trawling may unleash as much carbon as air travel, according to new
research on marine conservation.

And Ô¨Ånally, one thing you can do:

Stay informed about local issues

The Keystone XL pipeline might not run through your backyard, but there are probably other important
environmental issues up for debate in your community. The problem? It can be hard to Ô¨Ånd out about them.

Most state environmental agencies have a newsletter or bulletin because they're required to notify residents
about speciÔ¨Åc actions. Unfortunately, those bulletins can be pretty boring, long and confusing.

It might be more effective to join a local environmental advocacy organization, said Kimberly Ong, a lawyer
with the Natural Resources Defense Council, though not necessarily a big national one. Plus, states and
municipalities have different rules, which can be hard to navigate by yourself.

There are a few reasons you, as a local, have more power this way: You're the expert on your area, your health
might be affected, and you have a say in whether the politicians or ofÔ¨Åcials responsible keep their jobs, she
said.

These groups have experts who are paying close attention to legislation and regulatory changes and can
distill this information to help you Ô¨Ågure out how best to leverage your power. Speaking with one voice
makes a big difference, Ms. Ong said.

""It's always good to have a buddy, but it's especially good to have a buddy in environmental advocacy,"" she
said. -- Tatiana Schlossberg

Big Bet: Fighting Climate Change Will Add to Work Force

By Coral Davenport, Noam Scheiber and Lisa Friedman

On Wednesday, President Biden traveled to Pittsburgh to try to make the opposite case: that the workers Mr.
Trump was appealing to have more to gain from combating climate change than to lose.

It is going to be a tough bet. To Mr. Biden, a $2 trillion infrastructure plan is about creating union jobs,
hundreds of thousands of them, in wind and solar power, electric cars and road- and bridge-building. Even
those more basic infrastructure projects would have a climate angle: the new roads and bridges would be
built to withstand the high waters and brutal storms of a changing climate.

""I am a union guy. I support unions, unions built the middle class. It is about time you start to get a piece of
the action,"" Mr. Biden said in Pittsburgh.

He promised ""good paying jobs"" for ""American workers"" making ""American products.""

That is not a new pitch. For decades, Democrats have insisted ""jobs versus the environment"" is a false choice.
But in the scale of his proposal and the audacity of his promises, Mr. Biden may be laying his political future
on that idea.

He faces a lot of skepticism.

In Michigan, a state critical to the president's political future, autoworkers know it takes fewer of them to
build an electric car. Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote could again decide the
package's fate, understands coal miners in his state would earn considerably less putting up wind turbines.

And   in   Pennsylvania,   which   put   Mr.   Biden   over   the   top   in   November,   and   then   hosted   his   speech   on
Wednesday, some union workers don't see how skills honed over decades in fossil fuel industries would
translate in a clean-energy future.

""They keep saying, 'We're going to transition you into solar jobs.' That's not how it works,"" said Shawn Steffee,
a leader of the Boilermakers Local 154 in Pittsburgh. ""We build power plants, petrochemical plants and
maintain steel mills.""

He asked, ""Would you ask Tom Brady to play middle linebacker just because he's a football player?""

Union leaders -- some of whom switched from supporting Mr. Trump in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020 -- say that
for now, they will work with him to realize his vision of conquering climate change, even as it transforms their
workplaces.

But they are skeptical that the well-paying union jobs the president promises will materialize, noting that, so
far, the ecosystem of manufacturers, contractors and utility developers that has grown up around the green
economy has often been low-paying and hostile to unions.

""The president's new mantra is 'Build Back Better' with good union jobs that have good wages, and not just
wages but representation,"" said Joe Davis, the state political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers in Michigan. ""But these companies seem to be resistant to that.""

And Republicans are ready to try to win back the union votes that Mr. Trump won, then lost. ""Rather than
picking winners and losers with pie-the-sky Green New Deal mandates, we should be embracing an all-the-
above   energy   strategy,""   Representative   Cathy   McMorris   Rodgers,   Republican   of   Washington,   said
Wednesday.

No industry may have more to gain -- or lose -- from Mr. Biden's climate plan than America's automakers,
which currently employ about a million workers. The president's infrastructure plan proposes $174 billion to
encourage   the   manufacture   and  purchase   of   electric  cars,   which  today  make   up  just  2  percent  of  the
vehicles on America's highways.

 





He envisions a not-too-distant future in which nearly half of the middle class drives affordable union-made
cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles that produce zero fossil-fuel pollution, powered by millions of electric
vehicle charging stations, all jump-started by his stimulus spending.


From a climate perspective, the plan makes sense. Fossil fuel emissions from vehicle tailpipes are the leading
cause of planet-warming pollution in United States. Replacing gas-guzzlers on the road with electric vehicles
could be one of the most effective ways to lower the nation's emissions.

From a job-creation perspective, it's more complicated. On the one hand, it takes about one-third fewer
workers to build an electric car than a car with an internal combustion engine. On the other, the plan could
make Detroit more competitive and increase its share of the global automobile market.

Mr. Biden's proposed solution is to lure the electric-battery industry, and its supply chain, to the United States
from China and elsewhere in Asia, with a mix of manufacturing tax credits and other incentives. If it works,
the next two years would see new electric vehicle battery and assembly plants sprouting up across the
country. If it fails, Mr. Biden could face harsh political repercussions.

""We can make it work, but we have to be intentional about policy to bring the battery supply chain back to
the U.S.,"" said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose Detroit-area district is home to some of the
nation's largest auto plants. She added, ""If they're in China and Asia, this isn't going to be OK.""

Some industry analysts say as Americans buy more electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will build plants
in   the   United   States.   That   would   make   it   easier   to   integrate   the   batteries   into   cars   and   helps   save   on
transportation costs.

But even with new plants, much of the work can happen outside of the United States. According to a recent
report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and BloombergNEF, an energy research group,
only 46 percent of the value of a Tesla battery assembled in the United States comes from this country. The
rest comes from Japan and China.

Mr. Biden's energy plan would also dedicate $100 billion to update and modernize the electricity grid to
make it more reliable and better able to route power from wind and solar plants to large cities. Mr. Biden
would also extend tax credits that subsidize investments in wind and solar energy.

Accelerating the shift to wind and solar power is likely to create tens of thousands of construction jobs,
economists and industry ofÔ¨Åcials say. But those jobs typically pay far less than those in the fossil fuel industry.

Anthony Prisco, the head of the renewable energy practice for the stafÔ¨Ång Ô¨Årm Aerotek, said a standard solar
project wouls employ about 250 workers for just under a year. About one-third of the workers make $30 an
hour or more; the other two-thirds have fewer skills and make hourly wages of less than $20.

By contrast, the construction of a gas-powered electricity plant typically lasts two to three years and employs
hundreds of skilled, unionized tradesmen -- electricians, pipe-Ô¨Åtters and boilermakers -- who make $75,000 a
year or more, including beneÔ¨Åts.

""When you're talking about the transition to the new green economy, the Ô¨Årst question has got to be how
are   people   going   to   make   a   horizontal   economic   move,""   said   Sean   McGarvey,   the   president   of   North
America's Building Trades Unions, in an interview last month. ""I can tell you that in the onshore wind and
solar industry, for my members we're talking in some cases a 75 percent pay cut and they're losing beneÔ¨Åts.""

Jim Harrison, the director of renewable energy for the Utility Workers Union of America, said that it typically
takes hundreds of workers to operate and maintain a nuclear or coal plant, several dozen at a gas plant -- and
about a dozen at a wind farm. Solar Ô¨Åelds can often operate without a single worker on-site.

Mr. Biden has acknowledged that his plans could leave around 130,000 oil, gas and coal workers without their
livelihoods. He included a $16 billion program to help fossil fuel workers transition to new work like capping
leaks on defunct oil wells and shutting down retired coal mines.

The fossil fuel industry, while generally supportive of capping abandoned wells, contends that Mr. Biden is
overstating the job opportunities.

""It's something oil and gas workers could do. They're already experts at it, and they would be union jobs,"" said
Frank Maisano, a partner at Bracewell LLP, which represents oil and gas companies. ""But there are a lot of oil
and gas workers, and there aren't enough of those wells.



 



Still, whatever their concerns, union ofÔ¨Åcials have expressed optimism about the Biden plan, particularly its
large investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. ""These investments can restore our
economic well-being and create hundreds of thousands of good union jobs,"" said Terry O'Sullivan, president
of the Laborers&#39; International Union of North America, in a statement.


In Pittsburgh, a former steel town that has transformed into a hub for high tech and medicine, leaders have
made clear they support clean energy development. But in other parts of Western Pennsylvania, union
workers closely tied to fossil fuel industries had reservations.

""I don't see solar or wind creating as many jobs as we get from petrochemical plants, cryogenic plants or
coal-Ô¨Åred   power   plants,""   said   Kenneth   Broadbent,   business   manager   of   the   SteamÔ¨Åtters   Local   449   in
Pittsburgh, who endorsed President Biden.

""There's no stopping electric cars,"" Mr. Broadbent said. But, he added, ""You're not going to see natural gas
and coal and nuclear be phased out as quickly as people would like.""

A $6 billion Royal Dutch Shell petrochemical complex under construction in Beaver County, northwest of
Pittsburgh, employs 2,700 workers from the steamÔ¨Åtters union. Mr. Biden's plan, if passed, may create jobs,
Mr. Broadbent said, but it won't be a ""godsend"" like the petrochemical industry has been.

Biden‚Äôs Climate Plan Means Tough Choices: Which Homes
Get Saved?

By Christopher Flavelle

The proposal represents an enormous effort to Ô¨Åght climate change, but it sidesteps the question of who will
be forced to move because of rising water.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî President Biden‚Äôs $2 trillion infrastructure plan represents an enormous effort to protect
Americans from climate change, but it sidesteps one of the most immediate and wrenching dilemmas:
Deciding not just where to spend more money on roads, bridges or sea walls, but where to stop spending ‚Äî
and instead, help people get out of the way.

The need to make difÔ¨Åcult decisions like these reÔ¨Çects the growing consensus among experts that not every
community in the United States can be protected in the long run. Some areas ‚Äî particularly in some coastal
zones, but also inland along rivers and other areas where Ô¨Çooding is worsening with climate change ‚Äî can‚Äôt
successfully be defended no matter how much money the government might be willing to throw into
fortiÔ¨Åcations, drainage upgrades or other improvements.

Deciding which areas should be abandoned, and when, is one of the most urgent and difÔ¨Åcult challenges
facing the United States. The decision is deeply emotional, because it involves uprooting lives and destroying
communities. The Ô¨Ånancial consequences are also sweeping, since property values are likely to plummet,
along with the life savings of people who live there.

As   a   result,   Ô¨Åguring   out   how   to   plan   for   retreat   is   among   the   hardest   decisions   facing   policymakers,
according to people who have worked on climate resilience.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an enormous challenge ‚Äî the politics are very difÔ¨Åcult,‚Äù said Alice Hill, who planned for managing
climate effects at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. At that point, she said, the
government wasn‚Äôt ready to tell people in vulnerable towns and cities, ‚ÄúYou really want that bridge and
you‚Äôre not going to get it, because your community‚Äôs going to be washed away.‚Äù

But as disasters become more devastating and frequent, Ms. Hill added, that conversation can no longer be
avoided. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deÔ¨Ånitely time,‚Äù she said.

The scale of the challenge is enormous, with as much as half a trillion dollars of coastal real estate expected
to be underwater by the end of the century.

The idea is that communities facing insurmountable risks can either retreat from the most threatened areas
in an organized way, before disaster strikes, or afterward. But either way, retreat in some places will be
necessary.

Across the country, communities are already struggling to make difÔ¨Åcult choices.

Louisiana, for example, has divided its southeastern coast ‚Äî parts of which are being lost to rising seas ‚Äî into
low,   medium   and   high-risk   zones,   with   the   goal   of   having   the   high-risk   zones   ‚Äútransition   away   from
permanent residential development.‚Äù Instead, development of new infrastructure would be focused further
inland to accommodate the expected wave of new arrivals.

The Florida Keys delivered a similar message to residents, saying there wasn‚Äôt enough money to elevate
every county road above the rising sea. Decisions about infrastructure spending, ofÔ¨Åcials warned, were
necessarily becoming decisions about which places to try to protect, and which places to let go.

In the Outer Banks of North Carolina, residents are being asked to pay higher property taxes ‚Äî in some
cases, increases of almost 50 percent ‚Äî to protect the main road from being washed away by storms,
prompting concern about how long that solution can last.



And  last  year   Virginia   issued  a   coastal   development  plan  that  bluntly  acknowledged  that  Ô¨Çooding   and

 



inundation   would   force   retreat   from   many   coastal   areas,   requiring   public   and   private   buildings   and
infrastructure to be moved to higher ground ‚Äúto avoid destruction.‚Äù


‚ÄúSome Virginia residents and communities will face difÔ¨Åcult choices about relocation,‚Äù Matthew J. Strickler,
Virginia‚Äôs secretary of natural resources, said by email. ‚ÄúWe are not shying away from talking about this.‚Äù

Even previous administrations, including that of President Donald J. Trump, have acknowledged that some
places can‚Äôt be saved.

In the Ô¨Ånal weeks of the Obama administration, when Mr. Biden served as vice president, the White House
sought to create what it called a working group on managed retreat, to coordinate policies across the federal
government   for   relocating   communities   that   wanted   to   move.   It   deÔ¨Åned   retreat   as   ‚Äúa   complete
abandonment of that community.‚Äù

While   Mr.   Trump   was   president,   that   idea   continued   to   gain   momentum   after   a   series   of   devastating
hurricanes. Agencies that help communities rebuild after disasters began pushing harder for what they
called ‚Äúlarge-scale migration or relocation,‚Äù through buying and demolishing vulnerable homes. The Army
Corps of Engineers even began telling local communities that, to get some kinds of federal aid, they must be
willing to evict reluctant homeowners from hard-to-protect houses.

But taking that logic one step further, and restricting new federal infrastructure spending for those areas,
was too challenging, Ms. Hill said.

The question came up again during the Trump administration but was quickly rejected, according to a
former   administration   ofÔ¨Åcial   who   worked   on   resilience   issues   and   requested   anonymity   because   they
weren‚Äôt authorized by their current employer to speak to the media.

Mr. Biden‚Äôs infrastructure proposal suggests that political pressure remains.

The   proposal   doesn‚Äôt   include   the   word   retreat,   but   it   does   call   for   ‚Äúrelocation   assistance   to   support
community-led transitions for the most vulnerable tribal communities.‚Äù The plan doesn‚Äôt say why relocation
assistance  would  speciÔ¨Åcally  apply   to  Native   American  communities.   In  an  interview,   an  administration
ofÔ¨Åcial, who agreed to discuss the proposal on the condition that he not be identiÔ¨Åed by name, said the
infrastructure   package   included   money   to   improve   data   about   future   climate   risks.   That   would   allow
governments to better understand the threats facing new projects, the person said, and incorporate that
information into decisions about how and where to build.

Jainey Bavishi, who worked on managed-retreat policy as a senior ofÔ¨Åcial in the Obama administration, said
the question was challenging because it goes beyond engineering and Ô¨Ånance.

Deciding where to pull back is also about race and equity, she said, since many vulnerable areas are also
minority communities that have suffered a lack of government investment in the past. Retreat also impacts
other policy problems, like the availability of affordable housing and the impact on families‚Äô Ô¨Ånancial health.

‚ÄúTalking about where people can live, and where people cannot, is ultimately what this is about,‚Äù said Ms.
Bavishi, who is now director of the Mayor‚Äôs OfÔ¨Åce of Resiliency in New York City. ‚ÄúAnd those are really, really
difÔ¨Åcult conversations to have.‚Äù

A climate scientist‚Äôs new job at NASA shows how the Biden
administration is elevating climate issues.

By John Schwartz

Gavin Schmidt, a leading climate scientist, was recently named to a newly created position as senior climate
adviser to NASA. Now he faces the challenge of bringing NASA‚Äôs climate science to the public and helping
Ô¨Ågure out how to apply it to saving the planet.

Dr. Schmidt, who had headed NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies since 2014, will be working with an
administration   that   is   making   climate   policy   one   of   its   priorities.   The   Biden   team   is   adding   positions
throughout the government for policymakers and experts like Dr. Schmidt who understand the threats
facing the planet.

‚ÄúClimate change is not only an environmental issue that belongs to the E.P.A., it‚Äôs not only a science issue
that   belongs   to   NASA   and   NOAA,‚Äù   said   Katharine   Hayhoe,   a   climate   scientist   at   Texas   Tech   University.
‚ÄúClimate change is an everything issue,‚Äù she said, and ‚Äúit needs to be considered by every single federal
agency.‚Äù

Dr. Schmidt has written some 150 scientiÔ¨Åc papers, and has an active and sometimes acerbic social media
presence. At the Goddard Institute, he led development of one of the most authoritative models of Earth‚Äôs
climate system.

‚ÄúClimate change changes what you need to worry about,‚Äù he said, and the space agency can help the nation,
and the world, Ô¨Ågure out what we all need to know. That includes things like ‚ÄúHow do we accelerate the
information   that   you   need   to   build   better   defenses   against   coastal   Ô¨Çooding?‚Äù   and   ‚ÄúWhat   do   we   really
understand about intensifying precipitation?‚Äù

In announcing Dr. Schmidt‚Äôs appointment, the acting NASA administrator, Steve Jurczyk, said, ‚ÄúThis position
will provide NASA leadership critical insights and recommendations for the agency‚Äôs full spectrum of science,
technology   and   infrastructure   programs   related   to   climate,‚Äù   though   the   position   will   have   no   separate
budget or staff.

The space agency, which launches the satellites that monitor the conditions of the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere,
oceans, snow, ice and more, is one of the wellsprings of hard science that inform us all about climate change.
But its leaders have sometimes had a difÔ¨Åcult time talking about it.

‚ÄúNot   every   administration   was   interested   in   calling   it   ‚Äòclimate change,‚Äô   the   Trump   administration   most
notably,‚Äù said Lori Garver, a former NASA deputy administrator who is now chief executive of Earthrise, a
nonproÔ¨Åt that promotes using satellite data to address global warming.

Ms. Garver said she was ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù by Dr. Schmidt‚Äôs appointment, calling it a message that ‚Äúthis will be a top
priority for NASA.‚Äù

Biden invites world leaders, including Putin and Xi, to a
climate summit.

By David E. Sanger

President Biden on Friday invited 40 world leaders, including Presidents Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Xi
Jinping of China, to participate in a climate summit next month.

The summit will begin on Earth Day, April 22. Like all of Mr. Biden‚Äôs international meetings so far, it will be
held virtually, and a White House announcement said it would be ‚Äúlive streamed for public viewing.‚Äù

That format may ensure a fair bit of public posturing by the leaders on how climate is an issue on which they
can all work together ‚Äî and it eliminates the potential problem of ‚Äúpull aside‚Äù meetings on other topics with
American adversaries. Over the past 10 days, Mr. Biden has called Mr. Putin a ‚Äúkiller‚Äù and said that Mr. Xi did
not   have   a   democratic   ‚Äúbone   in   his   body.‚Äù   But   he   has   promised   to   cooperate   with   them   on   common
challenges.

The summit is part of an effort to get the United States and its partners back on track after Mr. Biden re-
entered the Paris agreement, the global pact intended to avert catastrophic global warming. It is his chance
to galvanize efforts to reduce emissions, set standards for limiting the warming of the atmosphere, and
make good on his promise that efforts to stem climate change can also create jobs.

Among the invitees are the leaders of all the United States‚Äô major European and Asian allies, along with
Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India and the leaders of some tiny nations such as Bhutan and the Marshall
Islands.

Mr. Biden invited King Salman of Saudi Arabia but not the de facto leader of the country, Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman. The United States said in an intelligence report last month that Prince Mohammed
had approved the operation that led to the killing of the journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, which had
prompted an international outcry.

Canada Court Gives Victory On Climate To Trudeau

By Ian Austen

In rejecting a request from some provinces to strike down national carbon pricing, the court declared that
the measure meets an important national need.

OTTAWA  --  In   a   decision   that  marked   an  important  victory  for   Prime  Minister   Justin  Trudeau's  climate
change agenda, Canada's Supreme Court ruled that the federal government's imposition of carbon taxes in
provinces that oppose them was constitutional.

Citing Parliament's power to legislate on matters related to ""peace, order and good government,"" the court
said that Ô¨Åghting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions was a matter of ""national concern""
protected under the Constitution.

""This matter is critical to our response to an existential threat to human life in Canada and around the world,""
the court wrote in its 6-to-3 decision. ""Climate change is real. It is caused by greenhouse gas emissions
resulting from human activities and it poses a grave threat to humanity's future.""

The concept of carbon pricing has been widely endorsed by economists and, according to the World Bank,
some form of it has been carried out or is in development in 64 countries, either through direct taxes on fossil
fuels or through cap-and-trade programs.

Setting minimum carbon prices as a way to reduce emissions and encourage efÔ¨Åciency is a cornerstone of
Mr. Trudeau's climate change program. During the 2015 election campaign that Ô¨Årst brought him to power,
Mr. Trudeau emphasized the need for provinces to implement carbon pricing, an approach opposed by his
Conservative predecessor, Stephen Harper.

Several   U.S.   states   have   carbon   pricing   programs,   notably   California.   Money   and   tax   credits   to   address
climate change are expected to underpin much of President Biden's coming spending proposals, which
aides and documents suggest could cost as much as $4 trillion over the next decade.

But several people familiar with the forthcoming infrastructure package in the United States said that there
are no plans currently to price carbon emissions. Instead, the president plans to greatly raise fuel efÔ¨Åciency
standards for cars, forcing automakers toward electric vehicles through regulation, not legislation. Similarly,
Mr. Biden plans to reimpose strict emissions regulations on electric power plants to move the sector away
from coal.

Republicans in Congress remain Ô¨Årmly opposed to a carbon tax and have voted repeatedly and nearly
unanimously over the years to bar the government from imposing one.

Like Republicans in the United States, conservative premiers in the oil-producing provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan have long strenuously campaigned against carbon pricing. They were joined by Doug Ford,
another Conservative, who canceled the carbon pricing program in Ontario shortly after he became premier
of Canada's most populous province in 2018.

Court challenges by those three provinces of Mr. Trudeau's carbon pricing law ultimately led to the Supreme
Court's decision.

""We certainly would hope that this brings an end to the jurisdictional and partisan battle around climate
action here in Canada,"" said Keith Brooks, programs director at Environmental Defence, an advocacy group.
""People, including premiers who don't like carbon pricing, use it as a political wedge and to sow division but
also misinformation.""

While the Supreme Court decision's detailed the dangers of climate changes to Canada and its coastlines,
Arctic   region   and   Indigenous   people   in   particular,   none   of   the   three   provinces   that   started   the   legal
challenges dispute its effects. Their objections instead focused on the argument that Mr. Trudeau's program

 





had overstepped the federal government's constitutional powers.


In 2019, Mr. Trudeau set a minimum price for carbon. It will become 40 Canadian dollars a metric ton on April
1 and will reach 170 dollars a ton in 2030. Most provinces have their own programs to meet those targets,
either through a direct charge on fuels and industry emissions or by setting a cap on emissions and then
creating a marketplace for industries that exceed the limit to buy emission permits from other businesses
who fall below the cap.

The federal government has only stepped in when a province, like Ontario under Mr. Ford, refused to price
carbon. In those cases, it placed a tax on fuel and set other fees for industrial emissions.

Individual Canadians receive carbon tax rebates from the government to compensate for the surcharge on
fuel. A review by Parliament's budget watchdog found that most households are paid more in rebates than
they spend on carbon taxes. Households can boost that bonus by further cutting emissions by using more
efÔ¨Åcient or electric vehicles or improving their heating systems.

Jason Kenney, the premier of Alberta, who canceled his province's program, told reporters that he was
disappointed with the decision but declined to say if his province will come up with a carbon pricing system
to replace the federally imposed one. ""We're going to consult with Albertans and talk to our allied provinces
to determine the best way forward,"" he said.

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in part because the federal plan only kicks in if
provinces   do   not   set   up   their   programs,   thus   maintaining   the   shared   jurisdiction   the   two   levels   of
government hold on environmental issues.

It   also   concluded   that   setting   a   single   national   minimum   price   for   carbon   is   necessary   for   effectively
reducing greenhouse gases, or GHGs, which makes federal involvement essential

""Addressing climate change requires collective national and international action,"" the court wrote. ""This is
because the harmful effects of GHGs are, by their very nature, not conÔ¨Åned by borders.""

What‚Äôs Going On in This Graph? | Global Climate Risks

By The Learning Network

What   are   the   primary   climate   risks   around   the   world   that   could   be   faced   by   2040   if   greenhouse-gas
emissions are not cut drastically?

Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.

This map shows the world‚Äôs top climate risks by 2040 if greenhouse-gas emissions are not cut drastically.

After looking closely at the map above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:

What do you notice? What do you wonder?

What impact does this have on you and your community?What‚Äôs going on in this map? Write a catchy
headline that captures the map‚Äôs main idea.

The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order.

2. Next, join the conversation online by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box. (Teachers of
students younger than 13 are welcome to post their students‚Äô responses.)

3. Below the response box, there is an option for students to click on ‚ÄúEmail me when my comment is
published.‚Äù This sends the link to their response which they can share with their teacher.

4. After you have posted, read what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting a comment.
Use the ‚ÄúReply‚Äù button to address that student directly.

On Wednesday, March 31, teachers from our collaborator, the American Statistical Association, will facilitate
this discussion from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern time.

5. By Friday morning, April 2, we will reveal more information about the graph, including a free link to the
article that included this graph, at the bottom of this post. We encourage you to post additional comments
based on the article, possibly using statistical terms deÔ¨Åned in the Stat Nuggets.

The Reveal

The United States has experienced what seems to be an unrelenting series of climate disasters: Ô¨Çooding on
the Mississippi, heat stress in the Upper Midwest, drought in the Mountain states, wildÔ¨Åres on the West Coast
and hurricanes and sea rise along the East Coast. So, too, has the rest of the world had severe climate
disasters. This map is a graph (see below Stat Nugget) that shows what we could expect if greenhouse-gas
emissions are not cut drastically. Ways to accomplish this include adoption of electric cars (see November 20,
2019 and January 21, 2021 graphs) plus President Biden‚Äôs plans to rejoin the Paris climate agreement, cancel
the Keystone XL pipeline permit and roll back vehicle emission standards.

This map appeared January 31, 2021 in The New York Times article ‚ÄúEveryone Has Its Own Climate Risks.
What‚Äôs Yours?‚Äù It is based on a report prepared by Four Twenty Seven, Inc., a California-based climate risk
data Ô¨Årm that measures the physical risks of climate change.  The   report  focuses   on projections   of   the
percentage of agriculture, people and economic activity that is exposed to high-risk climate hazards. In this
map, only the primary climate risk by region is represented. This does not tell the full story. More than two-
thirds of the world‚Äôs countries have two or more risks. The United States has regions with each of the six risks:
Ô¨Çooding,   heat   stress,   water   stress,   wildÔ¨Åres,   hurricanes   and   typhoons   and   sea   level   rise.   Worldwide,
FourTwentySeven projects that roughly 90 percent of the world‚Äôs population ‚Äì rich and poor countries alike,
will be exposed to one or more threats arising from global warming.

Here are some of the student headlines we received online that capture the story of these graphs: ‚ÄúClimate
Change‚Äôs True Colors‚Äù by Kiernan and ‚ÄúStop Greenhouse Gases Before It‚Äôs Too Late!‚Äù by Paige, both from
Alaska, and ‚ÄúImpacts of Climate Change Will Be Devastating If Nothing Changes‚Äù by Julia of Memphis,

 





Tennessee.


You may want to think critically about these questions:

Estimating from the graph, which risk (Ô¨Çooding, heat stress, water stress, wildÔ¨Åres, hurricanes and typhoons
and sea level rise) covers the greatest land area? Alternatively, based on what you know about where the
world‚Äôs population lives, which risk affects the most people?

The above graph is also from the report prepared by Four Twenty Seven.

What do you notice? What do you wonder? What is the greatest risk to each exposure category? For each
risk, which exposure category has the greatest risk? Write a summary that explains the global risks?

A 2020 survey by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication has found that while 61 percent of
Americans say climate change poses a risk in the United States, only 43 percent think it will affect them
personally. Why do you think that people tend to believe climate change is something ‚Äúfar away in time and
space?‚Äù What do you recommend to shift this mindset?Based on global climate risks, where is the safest
place to live? Of these places, where would you prefer to live?

Stat Nuggets for ‚ÄúEveryone Has Its Own Climate Risks. What‚Äôs Yours?‚Äù

To see the archives of all Stat Nuggets with links to their graphs, go to this index.

MAP AS A GRAPH

A map can be a graph when the map shows data or statistics with their geographic relationship.

In the Global Climate Risks map, the highest ranked climate risk for each region is the statistic shown on the
map. The color of the region indicates which climate risk - Ô¨Çooding, heat stress, water stress, wildÔ¨Åres,
hurricanes and typhoons and sea level rise, is ranked Ô¨Årst for the region. The region is marked with the
corresponding color for the greatest risk. Other risks are not noted. For example, the primary risk in California
is wildÔ¨Åres. These are caused, in part, by water and heat stress, which is not noted on the map. Globally,
wildÔ¨Åre risk regions are usually adjacent to water stress and heat stress areas.

His Game Made Beating a Pandemic Fun. Can He Do It for
Climate Change?

By Alex Marshall

Matt Leacock, the inventor of the hit board game Pandemic, has spent the past year making a game about
an even weightier subject.

The Earth‚Äôs average temperature unexpectedly leapt 0.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday afternoon, putting the
planet on the brink of catastrophe. Within hours, millions of people would be displaced, crops would fail and
sea levels would rise.

Until,   that   is,   Matt   Leacock   realized   that   the   four   people   playing   Climate Crisis,   a   board   game   he   is
developing, had gotten the rules wrong.

‚ÄúNo, divide it by four!‚Äù he told the players, who were testing the game. They had been counting a pile of
brown   cubes,   representing   greenhouse   gas   emissions,   to   calculate   how   much   the   world‚Äôs   temperature
would increase. They‚Äôd just forgotten to divide the Ô¨Ågure by the number of players.

The players ‚Äî all experts from the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center, playing online and linked up via a
video call ‚Äî looked relieved. But it wasn‚Äôt all good news. ‚ÄúThere might be some forest Ô¨Åres in China, and
Europe and the United States soon,‚Äù Leacock said.

Leacock, 49, is one of the biggest names in board games. In 2008, he brought out Pandemic, a game in
which players cooperate to stop outbreaks of Ô¨Åctitious viruses worldwide, while also developing long-term
cures. That game has sold over two million copies, and over the past year, interest and sales have surged ‚Äî
for obvious reasons.

If the idea of making a fun game about surging diseases sounds like a tall order, Leacock said making
entertainment out of climate change was even tougher. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt ever tried to create a game that was
faithful to science before,‚Äù he said in a telephone interview from Sunnyvale, Calif., where he lives.

Pandemic was about creating a sense of tension, he said, but the new game, with a working title of Climate
Crisis, has ‚Äúhigher ambitions.‚Äù In addition to being entertaining, he hopes it can change people‚Äôs actions in
the real world.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a big opportunity to come up with a cooperative game that makes a difference,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt
want to blow it.‚Äù

Three other board game designers said in telephone interviews that Climate Crisis sounded like a tough
project. ‚ÄúMost people think of games as a thing they do as an escape from everyday life,‚Äù said Elizabeth
Hargrave, the creator of Wingspan, in which players compete to attract birds to nature reserves. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to
wrap my head around how to make a game about a real life ‚Äî very dire ‚Äî situation fun,‚Äù she added.

But, she said, ‚ÄúIf anyone can do it, it‚Äôs Matt Leacock.‚Äù

Leacock Ô¨Årst considered making a game about climate change in August 2019 after a British academic sent
him an email suggesting that he tweak Pandemic to make it about that theme. Leacock dismissed the
notion, he said, ‚Äúbut then another person reached out with that idea, then another person.‚Äù

Last March, he decided to give it a go. So as much of the world went into lockdown and looked for escapist
entertainment, he began reading extensively on climate change.

‚ÄúI immediately fell into a big trough of despair,‚Äù Leacock said. ‚ÄúClimate crisis books are a rough bunch, in that
they all start with laying out the crisis, trying to make you realize the gravity of the situation.‚Äù

He dragged himself out of that hole, he said, only after he began collaborating with Matteo Menapace, an
Italian game designer in London. Together, they investigated proposed solutions to the crisis, reading up on

 





things   like   clean   energy   rollouts   and   geoengineering   projects   that   remove   carbon   dioxide   from   the
atmosphere.


Leacock realized that it wasn‚Äôt just a story of doom and gloom.

‚ÄúThat was really important, as in order to create any game, you need to Ô¨Ågure out how players can win,‚Äù he
said. ‚ÄúOnce we had a beat on that, we started making progress.‚Äù

As it stands, Climate Crisis (which is still in development) involves four players taking on the roles of the
United States, Europe, China and the Global South, with the collective goal of lowering greenhouse gas
emissions so that the Earth‚Äôs temperature stops increasing.

The game proceeds in rounds, representing four-year periods, from the present day to 2050. In each round,
players   lay   down   cards   representing   emissions-cutting   policies,   such   as   building   solar   power   plants   or
increasing food waste recycling. Their carbon totals are represented by brown cubes that get piled up in the
middle of the board, and red counters move along a cartoon thermometer as the Earth‚Äôs temperature goes
up.

Leacock said he was trying to make the game scientiÔ¨Åcally accurate by seeking feedback from experts, such
as the four Climate Center employees who played on Saturday. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be the climate dude who
comes in and says, ‚ÄòHey, I know the answer,‚Äô‚Äù he said.

But accuracy adds complexity. Leacock has to ensure that the game didn‚Äôt become overly detailed if he
wants it to be popular, said Vital Lacerda, another game designer.

Lacerda made his own climate change game, called CO2, and its rule book stretched to 26 pages, he said.
(The game‚Äôs audience was small, he added.)

Leacock said he had realized that pitfall. Climate Crisis has already gone through over 70 versions, and there
are   still   months   of   work   ahead.   He   spent   three   years   on   Pandemic   while   working   full-time   as   a   user
experience designer at Yahoo.

Menapace, Leacock‚Äôs collaborator, said the biggest issue they were now grappling with was how to create a
sense of pace and suspense. During one recent test run, the players thought they were doing well for three
rounds, but then the temperature shot up and the game came to an abrupt end.

‚ÄúWe almost simulated the idea the planet‚Äôs sleepwalking into disaster,‚Äù Menapace said, ‚Äúwhich might be a
good representation of how things are in the world, but it‚Äôs not great from a gameplay perspective.‚Äù

At Saturday‚Äôs test run, a lack of excitement did not seem to be a problem. After a few rounds, the players
from the Climate Center all piled their blocks into the middle of the board and worked out what that meant
for the climate. World temperatures jumped 0.2 degrees Celsius in an instant.

As the temperature climbed, a counter landed on a space representing a melting ice sheet: The Earth was
now reÔ¨Çecting less sunlight, and the temperature increased a little further. In the fallout from that, the
players now faced a refugee crisis.

Erin Coughlan de Perez, who was playing the United States, said the tumbling crises were ‚Äúan excellent way
of showing the feedback loops involved in climate change.‚Äù

Yet her smile as the disaster unfurled was a sign of something else: She was enjoying the game.

Riders Are Abandoning Buses and Trains. That‚Äôs a Problem
for Climate Change.

By Somini Sengupta, Geneva Abdul, Manuela Andreoni and Veronica Penney

Public transit offers a simple way for cities to lower greenhouse gas emissions, but the pandemic has pushed
ridership, and revenue, off a cliff in many big systems.

On the London Underground, Piccadilly Circus station is nearly vacant on a weekday morning, while the
Delhi Metro is ferrying fewer than half of the riders it used to. In Rio, unpaid bus drivers have gone on strike.
New York City subway trafÔ¨Åc is just a third of what it was before the pandemic.

A year into the coronavirus pandemic, public transit is hanging by a thread in many cities around the world.
Riders remain at home or they remain fearful of boarding buses and trains. And without their fares, public
transit revenues have fallen off a cliff. In some places, service has been cut. In others, fares have gone up and
transit workers are facing the prospect of layoffs.

That‚Äôs a disaster for the world‚Äôs ability to address that other global crisis: climate change. Public transit offers
a relatively simple way for cities to lower their greenhouse gas emissions, not to mention a way to improve air
quality, noise and congestion.

‚ÄúWe are facing maybe the most important crisis in the public transit sector in different parts of the world,‚Äù
said S√©rgio Avelleda, the director of urban mobility for the World Resources Institute and a former transport
secretary for S√£o Paulo, Brazil. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs urgent to act.‚Äù

But act how? Transit agencies that have been bailed out by the government are wondering how long the
generosity will last, and almost everywhere, transportation experts are scrambling to Ô¨Ågure out how to better
adapt public transit to the needs of riders as cities begin to emerge from the pandemic.

For now, people simply aren‚Äôt moving around much. Even in cities like Delhi, where most businesses are
open, many ofÔ¨Åce workers are working from home and universities haven‚Äôt resumed in-person classes. Paris
has a 6 p.m. curfew.

In some places, fear of the virus has driven people into cars. In the United States, used car sales have shot up
and so have prices of used cars. In India, a company that sells secondhand cars online saw sales swell in 2020
and its own value as a company jump to $1 billion, according to news reports. Elsewhere, bike sales have
grown, suggesting that people are pedaling a bit more.

The worry about the future is twofold. If commuters shun public transit for cars as their cities recover from
the pandemic, that has huge implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Most importantly,
if transit systems continue to lose passenger fare revenues, they will not be able to make the investments
necessary to be efÔ¨Åcient, safe and attractive to commuters.

There are a few outliers. In Shanghai, for example, public transit numbers took a nosedive in February 2020,
but riders have returned as new coronavirus infections remain low and the economy rebounds.

But the picture is grim in many more cities.

On the Paris M√©tro, ridership was just over half of normal in the Ô¨Årst two months of this year. √éle-de-France
Mobilit√©s, the transport agency for the greater Paris area, said it lost 2.6 billion euros, or over $3 billion, last
year. The agency is projecting a shortfall of an additional billion euros this year.

In Amsterdam, ridership numbers on the city‚Äôs trams and buses are around a third of normal, and the transit
agency‚Äôs   website   counsels   people   to   ‚Äúonly   travel   when   absolutely   necessary.‚Äù   In   Rome,   Metro   ridership
remains below half of prepandemic levels.



One of the busiest metro systems in the world, the London Underground, which normally clocks around four
million journeys every weekday, is currently operating at around 20 percent of its normal capacity. Buses are

 



a   bit   more   populated,   running   around   40   percent   of   normal.   The   city   transit   agency,   which   had   once
projected a budget surplus for 2020, has instead been relying on government bailouts since the pandemic
hit. It expects it will take at least two years to see public transit usage return to prepandemic levels.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been pretty devastating, to be perfectly honest,‚Äù said Alex Williams, director of city planning for Transport
for London. ‚ÄúOne of our concerns are substantial declines in public transport and higher levels of car use.‚Äù

London is one of a handful of cities around the world with a congestion tax designed to reduce car trafÔ¨Åc in
the city center. Both London and Paris sought to use lockdowns to expand bike lanes.

In the Indian capital, New Delhi, the subway reopened last September after a suspension of many months.
Ridership in February 2021 hovered under 2.6 million, compared with more than 5.7 million for the same
month the year before, and bus trafÔ¨Åc stood at just over half of prepandemic levels.

Lucky are those agencies, as in India and across Europe, that are subsidized by their governments. There‚Äôs
even more distress in cities where people rely in large part on private bus companies.

In Lagos, Nigeria, fares have doubled on private bus lines for rides longer than a kilometer, or a bit more than
half a mile.

In Rio de Janeiro, a once-celebrated bus network is in a shambles. The private company that runs the system
has cut over a third of its Ô¨Çeet and laid off 800 employees as the number of passengers has shrunk by half
since last March, according to the city transportation department. Strikes by bus drivers have made bus
travel even slower and more chaotic.

‚ÄúI have never seen anything like it,‚Äù said Jos√© Carlos Sacramento, 68, a leader of a bus workers union in Rio,
who has been working in public transportation for Ô¨Åve decades. ‚ÄúI think it might never go back to normal.‚Äù

City   ofÔ¨Åcials   said   they   hope   to   use   the   crisis   as   an   opportunity   to   revamp   the   system,   including   by
persuading   the   private   bus   companies   to   be   more   transparent   about   their   operations   in   exchange   for
possible Ô¨Ånancial help from the government.

After all, said Ma√≠na Celidonio, the head of the city transportation department, a clean, efÔ¨Åcient bus system is
critical for Rio to not only reduce its carbon emissions but also to clean its air. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just an environmental
issue, but a public health issue,‚Äù Ms. Celidonio said.

The bigger challenge for all cities is to Ô¨Åx their public transit systems now so that passengers will return, said
Mohamed Mezghani, head of the International Association of Public Transport. They could adjust peak hour
service as telecommuting from home becomes more commonplace, expand bus only lanes that make
commutes more efÔ¨Åcient and comfortable or improve ventilation systems to assure citizens that riding
public transit is safe.

‚ÄúThose cities that were investing, they will get out stronger,‚Äù Mr. Mezghani said. ‚ÄúPeople will feel more
comfortable traveling in a new modern public transit system. It‚Äôs about perception in the end.‚Äù

Shola Lawal and Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

Biden's Big Infrastructure Push Puts Climate Fight at
Forefront

By Lisa Friedman and Jim Tankersley

The president's plan, worth up to $4 trillion, represents a fundamental shift in the way Democrats talk about
tackling climate change: It's no longer a side issue.

WASHINGTON   --   President   Biden's   next   big   thing   would   fuse   the   rebuilding   of   America's   creaky
infrastructure   with   record   spending   to   Ô¨Åght   climate change,   a   combination   that,   in   scale   and   scope,
represents a huge political shift, even for Democrats who have been in the climate trenches for decades.

A guiding philosophy of the Biden proposal argues that the future of good jobs is the transition to an
economy that no longer churns out carbon dioxide through the burning of coal, oil and gas.

Aides are set to brief Mr. Biden this week on plans to invest between $3 trillion and $4 trillion in spending and
tax credits on a wide range of efforts meant to bolster the economy. The money is currently planned to be
split   between   two   packages,   starting   with   an   infrastructure   bill   that   is   rooted   in   the   effort   to   halt   the
emissions of planet-warming carbon dioxide. Administration ofÔ¨Åcials stress that the details remain in Ô¨Çux.

But as currently constructed, accelerating a clean energy transformation underpins nearly every part of the
plan, people familiar with it said. It includes building electric power lines that can deliver more renewable
energy,   building   electric   vehicle   charging   stations,   capping   oil   and   gas   wells   to   reduce   emissions   and
reclaiming abandoned coal mines. There is money to build a million new affordable, energy-efÔ¨Åcient housing
units and to make existing structures more energy efÔ¨Åcient. Hundreds of billions of dollars would go toward
""high-growth industries of the future,"" such as advanced battery manufacturing.

The underlying message -- that the next step of America's economic recovery is fundamentally tied to
countering the climate crisis -- represents a major pivot in the way Democrats make the case for tackling
global warming. No longer merely an environmental imperative like saving the polar bears, or a side element
of   a   stimulus   package   like   it   was   under   the   Obama   administration,   climate change   has   become   the
centerpiece.

Administration ofÔ¨Åcials say they view averting catastrophic warming and pursuing American dominance of
the emerging global industries as inseparable. That is a sharp break from even the most recent Democratic
administration, when Mr. Biden was vice president, let alone the Trump era, when the president denied the
existence of climate change.

""Thinking about addressing climate change through infrastructure is in itself not a revolutionary idea, but if
you said to most people, 'Is America's infrastructure in trouble?' I think the Ô¨Årst words they would mention to
you are bridges and roads, not E.V. charging stations,"" said Robert N. Stavins, an environmental economist at
Harvard University.

White House ofÔ¨Åcials would not put a dollar Ô¨Ågure on the amount dedicated to climate change, but one
person familiar with the talks said climate and clean energy spending could exceed $2 trillion.

Some climate activists say the plan suffers from a lopsided approach that would increase the supply of clean-
energy   projects   and   products   while   doing   little   to   spur   demand   by   forcing   reductions   in   fossil   fuel
consumption.

Republicans, who unanimously opposed Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package, and even
some independent analysts recoil at wrapping climate policy in the widely popular mantle of infrastructure,
which raises old arguments against government-driven industrial policy.

Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said in a statement that Mr. Biden should focus on working
with Republicans ""to Ô¨Åx America's crumbling roads and bridges,"" rather than ""raise taxes while also spending

 





trillions on a bill that includes the punishing regulations of the Green New Deal.""


But Mr. Biden is not straying from his recent positions. He promised during his campaign to ""build a more
resilient, sustainable economy"" that puts the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions by
midcentury, while creating ""millions of good paying jobs."" He has continued to hit the theme since his
inauguration.

""Today is climate day at the White House, which means that today is jobs day,"" the president said in January
before signing a suite of executive orders to combat warming.

Along with more than $600 billion for the construction of roads, bridges, rail lines, and electric vehicle
charging stations, the infrastructure package will incorporate some form of a rebate program championed
by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, to replace millions of gas guzzling cars in the
next decade with electric vehicles.

Some environmental groups on Monday criticized Mr. Biden for not proposing an even bigger package for
climate change. But Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, who has championed
the Green New Deal, an aggressive plan to address climate change and revamp the economy, called reports
of the infrastructure package ""encouraging.""

""One of the big goals we had when we introduced the Green New Deal was to shift climate change from
being a billion dollar problem to a trillion dollar opportunity,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview.

""The fact that climate and infrastructure is seen as part of the same endeavor is, I think, highly reÔ¨Çective of
that shift,"" she said.

So far, the package excludes the one thing that economists agree is the most efÔ¨Åcient way to draw down
planet-warming emissions: taxing or otherwise putting a price on the carbon dioxide emissions that cause it.
Instead of a gasoline tax, for instance, the president plans to greatly raise fuel efÔ¨Åciency standards for cars,
forcing automakers toward electric vehicles through regulation, not legislation. Similarly, Mr. Biden plans to
reimpose strict emissions regulations on electric power plants to move the sector away from coal.

""Biden never made a carbon tax the center of his proposal,"" said John Podesta, a former adviser to President
Barack Obama on climate change. ""I think he believed that the combination of investments and standards
with a focus on equity was a winning formula both for the economy and was more politically viable.""

Others, though, said they worried that Mr. Biden's strategy -- long-term projects and regulation that could
take years to Ô¨Ånalize -- was too lengthy, too pricey and too uncertain to cut enough emissions.

""The scale of the climate problem demands the most economically efÔ¨Åcient response, and because it's
politically difÔ¨Åcult to talk about pricing carbon we're drifting toward a really expensive way of addressing
climate,"" said Alex Flint, executive director of the Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative nonproÔ¨Åt group
that supports a carbon tax.

""A carbon tax at least has to be part of the discussion,"" Mr. Flint added.

Mr. Stavins of Harvard University cautioned that using government spending to achieve both job creation
and climate change, while popular, isn't always compatible. Quick boosts to the economy rely on so-called
""shovel-ready"" projects -- and those aren't necessarily the ones that will lead to deep decarbonization.

But, he conceded, if Mr. Obama could not secure legislation to cap carbon emissions when he had 59
Democrats in the Senate, Mr. Biden cannot win a similarly tough plan with 50 Democrats, one of whom,
Senator Joe Manchin III, represents the coal state of West Virginia.

Supporters of the package say tying climate action to Ô¨Åscal growth is good politics and grounded in fact. A
federal   report   in   2018   found   that   failing   to   curb   planet-warming   pollution   could   result   in   more   record
wildÔ¨Åres,   crop   failures   and   crumbled   infrastructure   across   the   country,   shrinking   the   U.S.   economy   10
percent by the end of the century.

Jamal Raad, who co-founded the climate advocacy group Evergreen Action, said both the politics of climate
change and the market for clean energy have changed dramatically over the past decade.

""There's been a whole lot of work telling a broader story about what climate change means and what the
transition to clean energy would mean for our economy and jobs,"" he said. ""This investment package is about
telling a positive story about economic growth in clean energy.""

Senate Democrats plan to employ an obscure legislative
tool to reinstate an Obama-era climate change rule.

By Coral Davenport

Democrats hope to wipe out some of the executive-branch policies enacted in the last days of the Trump
administration.

Senate Democrats plan to deploy an obscure but powerful legislative weapon in the coming weeks to try to
quickly reinstate a major Obama-era climate change rule that the Trump administration had effectively
eliminated.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, is expected next month to invoke the 1996
Congressional Review Act with the goal of undoing a Trump rule Ô¨Ånalized in September that lifted controls
on the release of methane, a powerful planet-warming gas that is emitted from leaks and Ô¨Çares in oil and gas
wells.

Democrats argue that the move, which will be sponsored by Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, will
have the legal effect of immediately reinstating the Obama methane rules. That would be a far more rapid
timetable than the years-long regulatory process typically required to undo or reinstate regulations.

‚ÄúThe   Trump   rule   to   remove   limits   on   emissions   of   methane   from   oil   and   gas   was   an   illogical   and   a
devastating blow to one of the most important tools to curbing greenhouse gas emissions,‚Äù Mr. Schumer
said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Democratic Senate will hold a vote to overturn this rule, which is one of many
initiatives we are pursuing to Ô¨Åght the climate crisis.‚Äù

Under the Congressional Review Act, any regulation Ô¨Ånalized within 60 legislative days of the end of a
presidential term can be overturned with a simple majority vote in the Senate.

Before 2017, the review act procedure had been used only once, to undo a Clinton-era rule on workplace
ergonomics in 2001. Then, in the early months of the Trump administration, Senate Republicans used the
procedure to wipe out 14 Obama-era regulations in 16 weeks. Democrats now intend to employ it to wipe out
some of the executive-branch policies enacted in the last days of the Trump administration.

The most signiÔ¨Åcant of those would be the rules on methane, which were published by the Environmental
Protection   Agency.   While   most   climate change   regulations   target   carbon   dioxide,   the   most   damaging
greenhouse gas, methane is a close second, lingering in the atmosphere for a shorter period of time but
packing a bigger punch while it lasts. By some estimates, methane has 80 times the heat-trapping power of
carbon dioxide in the Ô¨Årst 20 years in the atmosphere.

For Democrats to repeal the methane rule, they will most likely need all 50 votes of their party‚Äôs razor-thin
majority ‚Äî including that of Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who often votes with Republicans on
matters of environmental policy. However, in 2017, Mr. Manchin voted with his party to retain a different
regulation on methane pollution.

Australia‚Äôs Worst Floods in Decades Quicken Concerns
About Climate Change

By Damien Cave

In a country that suffered the harshest wildÔ¨Åres in its recorded history just a year ago, the deluge has
become another awful milestone.

WINDSOR, Australia ‚Äî Kelly Miller stood in her doorway on Monday, watching the water rise to within a few
inches of the century-old home where she runs an alternative medicine business. The bridge nearby had
already gone under in some of Australia‚Äôs worst Ô¨Çooding in decades, along with an abandoned car in the
parking lot.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs coming up really quickly,‚Äù she said.

Two massive storms have converged over eastern Australia, dumping more than three feet of rain in just Ô¨Åve
days. In a country that suffered the worst wildÔ¨Åres in its recorded history just a year ago, the deluge has
become another record-breaker ‚Äî a once-in-50-years event, or possibly 100, depending on the rain that‚Äôs
expected to continue through Tuesday night.

Nearly 20,000 Australians have been forced to evacuate, and more than 150 schools have been closed. The
storms have swept away the home of a couple on their wedding day, prompted at least 500 rescues and
drowned roads from Sydney up into the state of Queensland 500 miles north.

Shane Fitzsimmons, the resilience commissioner for New South Wales ‚Äî a new state position formed after
last year‚Äôs Ô¨Åres ‚Äî described the event as another compounding disaster. Last year, huge Ô¨Åres combined into
history-making   infernos   that   scorched   an   area   larger   than   many   European   countries.   This   year,
thunderstorms have fused and hovered, delivering enough water to push rivers like the Hawkesbury to their
highest levels since the 1960s.

Scientists note that both forms of catastrophe represent Australia‚Äôs new normal. The country is one of many
seeing a pattern of intensiÔ¨Åcation ‚Äî more extreme hot days and heat waves, as well as more extreme
rainfalls over short periods.

It‚Äôs all tied to a warming earth, caused by greenhouse gases. Because global temperatures have risen 1.1
degrees Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit, over preindustrial levels, landscapes dry out more quickly,
producing severe droughts, even as more water vapor rises into the atmosphere, increasing the likelihood of
extreme downpours.

‚ÄúThere is a very strong link between global warming and that intensiÔ¨Åcation in rainfall,‚Äù said Andy Pitman,
director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs
good scientiÔ¨Åc evidence to say extreme rain is becoming more extreme due to global warming.‚Äù

Australia‚Äôs conservative government ‚Äî heavily resistant to aggressive action on climate change that might
threaten the country‚Äôs fossil fuel industry ‚Äî has yet to make that link.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to Ô¨Çee, and several dozen areas have already
been declared disaster zones.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs another testing time for our country,‚Äù he told a Sydney radio station, 2GB, on Monday.

Windsor may become one of the places hardest hit. Over the weekend, the Hawkesbury rose rapidly by more
than 30 feet, and it is expected to peak in the next day or so at 42 feet.

With rain continuing to fall, emergency workers wearing bright orange went door to door on side streets
with waist-deep puddles where the road dipped.



In and around the historic downtown, many of the businesses close to the river stayed shut on Monday, with

 



a few putting sandbags by their doors. The central meeting place seemed to be at the foot of the Windsor
Bridge, where television crews and crowds in rubber boots marveled at the view.


The new Windsor Bridge, which opened just a few months ago as a ‚ÄúÔ¨Çood-proof‚Äù replacement for an older
bridge, was completely underwater.

It was built 10 feet higher than the bridge it replaced, but the river Ô¨Çowed over it as if it did not exist. A red
Ô¨Çashing light on the top of a buried yellow excavator offered the only hint of the old bridge, or what had once
been solid ground.

Cameron Gooch, 46, a diesel mechanic from a town nearby, said he saw huge trees speeding downriver
toward the coast a day earlier. The water seemed to have slowed down, he said, becoming a giant bathtub
with water held in place and rising slowly from tributaries.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to keep building up.‚Äù

A few feet away, Rebecca Turnbull, the curator of Howe House, a home and museum built in 1820, put
handwritten notes on the furniture that would need to be removed if the water surged a few more feet.

She pointed to a line drawn on the doorway of a room that smelled of damp old wood.

‚ÄúThis is where the water came up to in 1867,‚Äù she said.

Like many others in Windsor, she said she doubted the river would reach quite that high this time around.
But that didn‚Äôt bring much solace to those closer to the rising brown sludge.

Rachael Goldsworthy, who owns a home and real estate business just behind Ms. Miller‚Äôs naturopathic clinic
‚Äî it‚Äôs a few feet higher on the hillside ‚Äî said she saw a new Mercedes washed downstream the night before
after a man had parked in a small puddle and then went into a grocery store to buy a roast chicken. In just
minutes, the rising water carried the car away.

On Monday, she tried to help Ms. Miller Ô¨Ånd a few milk crates ‚Äî the only defense for some of the heavy
furniture that could not be moved out.

Inside, Ms. Miller and her son collected oils and other products that she would normally be selling, with plans
to put them in a truck or a storage unit. The antique Ô¨Çowered carpet was still dry, and she‚Äôd taped up the
toilets to keep the septic system from backing up into the house.

She said she didn‚Äôt have Ô¨Çood insurance because she couldn‚Äôt afford it. So all she could do was learn from
YouTube videos about how to Ô¨Åght a Ô¨Çood.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to work out how to save what we can,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to lose everything.‚Äù

The Daily: When Climate Change Comes to Your Yard

Interviewing a climate change skeptic who brought wind power to his community. Plus, a dispatch from a
live concert and a new season of Still Processing.

Hi everyone, happy Friday. Last week, we asked you to tell us your favorite episode from the week, and our
team Slack channel was soon Ô¨Ålled with screenshots of your kind messages. So thank you, we appreciate you
listening and sharing.

In today‚Äôs newsletter, we have two notes from our recent guests: Dionne Searcey writes about the conÔ¨Çicted
reality of climate denialism in Rawlins, Wyo., and Isabel Kershner writes a letter from the future about
attending concerts in Israel. And Ô¨Ånally, Still Processing is back for a new season (!), with an episode both
provocative and personal. Check it out.

Meeting Mayor Terry Weickum

On Tuesday‚Äôs episode, we visited coal country via Terry Weickum, the mayor of Rawlins, Wyo., a town of 9,000.
He spoke to our correspondent Dionne Searcey about his town and what makes it beautiful, the pain of the
decline of the coal industry and why he‚Äôs come to embrace wind energy. We asked Dionne what made Terry
such a compelling character:

The minute Terry Weickum picked up the phone I knew I was going to focus a story on him. His folksy humor,
colloquialisms and general vibe was just a joy to engage with, even as he spoke on a difÔ¨Åcult topic: the
closure of coal mines in Carbon County.

Mr. Weickum loves his community and was cut up when his friends moved away after losing coal jobs. But
he didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúwalk around on his bottom lip,‚Äù as he likes to say. (That‚Äôs Wyoming-speak for pouting.) He did
something about it. He won a seat on the county commissioners board and got to work trying to decide
whether he should welcome renewable energy to an area built on coal ‚Äî and one that still proÔ¨Åts from fossil
fuel revenue.

After a lot of anguish and consultation with leaders and residents across the state, and after sifting through
the   particulars   of   pitches   from   wind   developers,   Mr.   Weickum   decided   to   vote   for   the   wind   projects,
including one that is on track to be perhaps the biggest in the nation.

Still, he isn‚Äôt so sure climate change is real. I got coffee at a local spot in Rawlins with Mr. Weickum and one of
his friends, a retired coal worker, as they explained their views that eschewed the veriÔ¨Åed science behind
human-induced climate change. Mr. Weickum told me about how he got a lot of Ô¨Çack for his decision to
support wind, even from his friends.

But he knew the revenues would help his community. Now, as mayor of Rawlins, he is seeing that come to
fruition with budget surpluses from wind revenue. His decision shows that selling communities on the moral
case for Ô¨Åghting climate change might not be the best path forward in some areas for pushing green
energy.

Climate change denialism in Rawlins is as widespread as mule deer. I saw the creatures with their teddy-bear
ears lounging in the cemetery, the high school football Ô¨Åeld and in front yards across town. Everyone had a
story about them. Mr. Weickum and his coal miner friend told me about how they had been chased by
charging mule deer. One deer even had stomped to death Mr. Weickum‚Äôs beloved six-pound Chihuahua,
Cujo.

I wondered why there were so many mule deer in town. It turns out climate change might be to blame.
Rawlins is seeing more deer munching on town grass, as drought overtakes their normal roaming territory.

Even as they continue to question if climate change is real, Mr. Weickum and the residents of Rawlins are
probably seeing signs of a warming planet every time they open their front door to Ô¨Ånd a 200-pound, round-
eared, antlered creature staring back at them.

Diary from a concert in Tel Aviv

At   the   top   of   Monday‚Äôs   episode   on   the   reopening   of   Israeli   society,   we   heard   audio   snippets   of   our
correspondent Isabel Kershner attending a concert in Tel Aviv ‚Äî her Ô¨Årst concert in at least a year. Below, she
describes what it was like to re-experience live music, and the return to normalcy in a country where nearly
half its population has been vaccinated:

As the lights were dimmed and the band started to play, a moment of emotion and exhilaration washed over
me. Immersed in live music, the tensions of a whole, bizarre year melted away.

This was what the Israeli government was dubbing ‚ÄúBack to Life‚Äù: a country emerging from the coronavirus
pandemic by virtue of its successful, nationwide vaccination campaign after 12 months stalked by infection
and death.

As a fully vaccinated Israeli, I had used my so-called Green Pass, via an app downloaded to my cellphone, for
the Ô¨Årst time to gain entry to the concert, one of a weekend series organized by the Tel Aviv municipal
authorities.   The   singer   was   Dikla,   a   popular   Israeli   chanteuse   of   Egyptian   and   Iraqi   parentage,   who
performed in Hebrew, English and Arabic.

A spokesman for the municipality said the Ô¨Årst concerts were sold out within 15 minutes of the tickets going
online.

Still, nothing was quite normal. The concert was taking place in the open air in a soccer stadium that seats
nearly 30,000, but the audience was limited to 500. The surrounding streets were deserted, save for one
small, Parisian-style cafe, with lights burning and tables out on the sidewalk. There was plenty of parking.

Alternating seats in one section of the stands had been sold, to allow for social distancing. The audience was
warned not to make their way down and gather in front of the small stage. They danced by their seats and
sang along through their masks.

By mid-March, more than four million Israeli citizens had been fully vaccinated and were eligible for a Green
Pass, out of a total population of nine million. But some two million people younger than 16 could not yet get
vaccinated, and another million or so Israelis, among them many ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab citizens, had
so far chosen not to.

An already divided society was being further divided between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, and the
two-tier system has raised some complicated legal, moral and ethical questions.

Still,   having   a   Green   Pass   at   my   Ô¨Ångertips   is   a   privilege.   After   bitter   wrangling   over   obligations   and
responsibilities, Israel‚Äôs Palestinian neighbors are, for the most part, just beginning to get vaccinated. My
mother in England is patiently awaiting her second shot.

But for a transcendental hour or so, the music drowned out the background noise.

The Return of Still Processing

Still Processing is back for its spring season! On the Ô¨Årst episode, the hosts, Jenna Wortham and Wesley
Morris, two culture writers for The Times, confront one of the most offensive words in the English language:
the N-word.

‚ÄúWhat happens when I, as a Black person, am in an environment where I don‚Äôt want to hear that word?‚Äù
Wesley asks in the opening of the episode.

As much as they‚Äôd like to escape hearing the N-word, Wesley and Jenna talk about how it surfaces over and
over in their lives: in an exercise class, on public transportation, in gatherings of friends and in childhood
memories. The word is ‚Äúso much bigger than one instance, one mistake, one rap lyric,‚Äù Jenna says. ‚ÄúIt really
enters your life even before you get a chance to Ô¨Ågure out how you want to live your life.‚Äù

Wesley   and   Jenna   remind   us   that   any   use   of   the   N-word   conjures   its   violent   beginnings   as   a   tool   of
oppression. But in this episode they also discover the ‚Äúimpossible beauty‚Äù ‚Äî yes, beauty ‚Äî of it.



Listen to the season premiere, and tune every Thursday for new episodes.

Chuck Schumer Stalls Climate Overhaul of Flood Insurance
Program

By Christopher Flavelle and Emily Cochrane

The Senate leader is objecting to a plan that would raise costs for some of his constituents by bringing Ô¨Çood
insurance rates in line with climate risks.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî One of the federal government‚Äôs main efforts to push Americans to prepare for climate
threats is in question after the Senate majority leader‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce objected to a plan to adjust Ô¨Çood insurance
rates.

The   Federal   Emergency   Management   Agency   was   preparing   to   announce   new   rates   for   federal   Ô¨Çood
insurance on April 1, so that the prices people pay would more accurately reÔ¨Çect the risks they face. The
change would very likely help reduce Americans‚Äô vulnerability to Ô¨Çoods and hurricanes by discouraging
construction in high-risk areas. But it would also increase insurance costs for some households, making it a
tough sell politically.

Last week, the ofÔ¨Åce of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic majority leader, pushed back
on the changes, according to several people familiar with the discussion. That pushback has caused FEMA to
pause the rollout of the new rates.

Senator Schumer objected to the Ô¨Çood-insurance overhaul when it was Ô¨Årst announced in 2019, citing its
potential to raise costs for people on Long Island. The new system would mean steeper rates for some high-
value homes, and the southern shore of Long Island includes the Hamptons, which have some of the most
expensive real estate in the country.

Senator Schumer‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce told FEMA that the new rates could have a ‚Äúsevere impact‚Äù on some communities
in New York, according to a person familiar with the conversation. The person said that the senator‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce
had asked FEMA to reconsider going forward with the plan and asked the agency for a follow-up meeting,
which, as of Wednesday, had not been scheduled.

‚ÄúFEMA shouldn‚Äôt be rushing to overhaul their process and risk dramatically increasing premiums on middle-
class and working-class families without Ô¨Årst consulting with Congress and the communities at greatest risk
to the effects of climate change,‚Äù Alex Nguyen, a spokesman for Senator Schumer, said in a statement.
‚ÄúCongress and the Biden administration must work together in a collaborative and transparent process‚Äù for
what he called ‚Äúaffordable protection‚Äù in communities nationwide including Brooklyn and Queens.

In a statement, a FEMA spokesperson, who asked not to be identiÔ¨Åed, said the agency would continue to
work with Congress to implement the plan, saying the changes would make insurance rates ‚Äúbetter reÔ¨Çect
an individual property‚Äôs unique Ô¨Çood risk.‚Äù

The objections from Senator Schumer‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce create a political dilemma for the Biden administration, which
has committed to address climate change. Unlike rejoining the Paris Agreement or banning drilling on
public lands, moves that have broad Democratic support, increasing the cost of Ô¨Çood insurance is unlikely to
generate a positive response from voters.

But Ô¨Çood insurance is one of the most powerful tools the federal government has to limit the damage done
by climate change, by inÔ¨Çuencing how and where Americans build homes. And even if the administration
succeeds at reducing United States greenhouse gas emissions, the buildup of those gases already in the
atmosphere means that Ô¨Çoods and hurricanes will continue to worsen for the foreseeable future.

That means the government must focus on warning homeowners about the Ô¨Çooding threat, according to
climate and disaster experts. That encourages people to take steps to reduce their exposure, like elevating
their homes or moving.



‚ÄúPremiums should be based on risk, so people can have accurate signals about the nature of the hazards

 



they face,‚Äù said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers. ‚ÄúI really
hope Congress is able to engage constructively here.‚Äù


Under the new approach, 23 percent of households with Ô¨Çood insurance would see their rates fall right away,
by an average of $86 a month, according to data provided by FEMA, because the updated formula shows
they have been overpaying based on their risk. Another 73 percent would see either no change or an
increase of no more than $20 a month.

But for some of the remaining households, costs would go up signiÔ¨Åcantly, according to others briefed on
the changes.

Congress prevents FEMA from increasing a household‚Äôs Ô¨Çood insurance premiums by more than 18 percent
a year. Under the new system, some households would face that maximum annual increase for 10 years or
more. As a result, their rates could increase at least Ô¨Åvefold over that time.

Those big rate increases would mostly apply to higher-cost homes, which under the current formula tend to
underpay for insurance. Many of the people that would see a decrease live in lower-cost homes.

The   pushback   from   Senator   Schumer   is   important   because,   as   Senate   leader,   he   can   exert   signiÔ¨Åcant
inÔ¨Çuence over FEMA. He controls the Senate Ô¨Çoor, so he holds sway over the timing of critical conÔ¨Årmation
votes ‚Äî including Deanne Criswell, the Biden administration‚Äôs nominee for FEMA administrator ‚Äî and other
senior roles.

FEMA also depends, like every agency, on congressional approval for its annual funding and must persuade
Senate leaders to support any requests for additional money or authority for new programs ‚Äî for example, to
better respond to disasters or prepare for the effects of climate change. For reasons like these, the agency‚Äôs
relationship with the Senate leadership is particularly important.

The dispute is only the latest delay for the overhaul.

When FEMA announced the change, in 2019, the new rates were supposed to take effect in October 2020.
But the Trump administration pushed back the new rates until this year, worried in part that increasing
premiums shortly before the election would hurt President Donald J. Trump politically, according to a person
familiar with the discussions.

But opposition also came from Congress, including from Senator Schumer.

After FEMA Ô¨Årst said it would overhaul rates to reÔ¨Çect the full Ô¨Çood risk homeowners faced, Senator Schumer
held a news conference criticizing the plan.

‚ÄúHow can we ram through a national Ô¨Çood insurance plan that could unfairly put a bull‚Äôs-eye on the backs of
Long Island and New York homeowners without more consultation?‚Äù Senator Schumer said at the time,
citing the potential effects on property values. The Long Island coastline is home to everything from modest
bungalows and suburban communities to multimillion-dollar waterfront estates.

Senator Schumer‚Äôs message for FEMA, he said then, was simple: ‚ÄúHalt. Stop. Stop this plan.‚Äù

The Rock Standing in the Way of China‚Äôs Climate Ambitions:
Coal

By Chris Buckley

Beijing‚Äôs new development blueprint is meant to steer the country to carbon neutrality before 2060, but
companies and regions dependent on the fossil fuel aren‚Äôt making it easy.

Xi   Jinping,   China‚Äôs   top   leader,   has   promoted   an   uplifting   vision   for   growth   increasingly   freed   from
greenhouse gas pollution, but turning that plan into action is already proving contentious.

The big issue is coal.

Mr. Xi‚Äôs climate-saving ambitions are a pillar of a plan for the country‚Äôs post-pandemic ascent that was
endorsed by China‚Äôs Communist Party-controlled legislature days ago.

The plan is designed to steer the country toward two signature commitments that Mr. Xi made last year.
China‚Äôs emissions of carbon dioxide would peak before 2030, he said, and the country would reach net
carbon neutrality before 2060, meaning it would emit no more of the greenhouse gas than it takes from the
atmosphere by methods like engineering or planting forests.

But unusually sharp debate has risen in China over how aggressively it should cut the use of coal, which has
fueled its industrial takeoff yet made it the world‚Äôs top-polluting nation in recent decades.

Prominent Chinese climate scientists and policy advisers want stricter emissions limits, including virtually no
new coal power projects, and they foresee a boom in solar and wind generation. Powerful provinces, state
companies and industry groups say China still needs to use large amounts of coal for electricity and industry
for years to come.

‚ÄúThere is absolutely a tension,‚Äù said Leon Clarke, a professor at the University of Maryland and a leading co-
author of a recent study on China‚Äôs options for curtailing emissions. ‚ÄúOn the one side, there‚Äôs a sense that
coal has driven the economy and you don‚Äôt want to give that up. On the other hand, coal is the biggest
target for climate action, particularly in the near term.‚Äù

China‚Äôs environmental pressures were brought to life last week as a thick smog hung over Beijing, reÔ¨Çecting
an uptick in industrial pollution.

Friction over fossil fuels goes back years in China, and the issue is far from unique to that country. But China‚Äôs
looming choices have outsize consequences for greenhouse gas levels and international negotiations.

The country‚Äôs annual carbon dioxide emissions are 28 percent of the global total, roughly the same as the
next three biggest emitters combined: the United States, the European Union and India. The accumulated
emissions of the United States and other rich economies across the entire industrial era, though, remain
much bigger than China‚Äôs.

Representatives of the coal industry attending the national legislative session in Beijing argued that China
needs to keep burning coal, albeit in cleaner, more efÔ¨Åcient plants.

The China National Coal Association issued a report this month proposing modest increases in its use for the
next Ô¨Åve years, reaching 4.2 billion metric tons by 2025, and also said China should create three to Ô¨Åve
‚Äúglobally competitive world-class coal enterprises.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe   principal   status   of   coal   in   our   national   energy   system,   and   its   role   as   ballast,   will   not   shift,‚Äù   the
association said in an earlier position paper about the industry‚Äôs outlook in the next Ô¨Åve years.

Provincial governments have recently proposed more new coal mines and power plants, while vowing that
their projects will limit emissions. In answer to the call for a carbon peak, Shanxi Province, one of China‚Äôs
biggest coal producing areas, announced plans for 40 ‚Äúgreen,‚Äù efÔ¨Åcient coal mines.

 





Chinese ofÔ¨Åcials in such areas also worry about losses of jobs and investment and the resulting social strains.
They argue that China still needs coal to provide a robust base of power to complement solar, wind and
hydropower sources, which are more prone to Ô¨Çuctuating. And many energy companies backing these views
are state-owned behemoths that have easy access to political leaders.


‚ÄúLocal governments see coal power as a robust energy shield,‚Äù Lu Zhonglou, a Chinese businessman who
sold his coal mines a few years ago and still keeps an eye on the industry, said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúYou
can‚Äôt write off coal too early.‚Äù

But proponents of China‚Äôs green transition, including government advisers, argue that rapidly abandoning
fossil   fuels   and   shifting   from   old-school   heavy   industry   will   beneÔ¨Åt   growth,   innovation,   health   and   the
environment. Some say China can ramp up wind and solar sources and reach a carbon peak much earlier
than 2030, which would lower the costs and technological hurdles of reaching carbon neutrality.

‚ÄúA lot of heavy lifting is being left for the time after 2030,‚Äù said Lauri Myllyvirta, who monitors Chinese climate
and energy policies as the lead analyst at the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Helsinki. ‚ÄúThe
central contradiction between expanding the smokestack economy and promoting green growth appears
unresolved.‚Äù

China‚Äôs new plan appears to give the different camps in the carbon debate a foothold. The plan promises
green growth and expansion of hydro, solar and wind power, in addition to nuclear power plant construction.
By 2025, the plan says, non-fossil fuel sources will provide one-Ô¨Åfth of China‚Äôs energy.

Yet the plan also appeared to hearten defenders of coal and disappoint environmental groups and climate
policy experts. It did not include an absolute ceiling on annual carbon dioxide emissions and indicated that
coal-Ô¨Åred power stations would keep being built.

‚ÄúMany areas still believe that before 2030 they can keep substantially increasing fossil fuel use,‚Äù Wang Jinnan,
the president of the government‚Äôs Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning and a senior member of the
national legislature, said in an interview with a Chinese magazine posted on the academy‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúThis will
have a big negative impact on China reaching carbon neutrality before 2060.‚Äù

Mr. Xi may face calls from abroad to offer more ways to curb emissions as China turns the plan into actual
policies. For China, action on climate change is also a way of building good will, including with the United
States and the European Union.

The crucial questions are not just when will China‚Äôs emissions peak, but how high will they reach and how
long they will take to fall drastically.

An   international   pact   to   limit   global warming   this   century   to   below   2   degrees   Celsius   (3.6   degrees
Fahrenheit), and to 1.5 degrees Celsius if possible, is not possible without more urgent efforts from China and
the other major powers to reach carbon neutrality by around midcentury.

‚ÄúThe longer the delay, the harder it is to achieve those midcentury targets. It‚Äôs just math,‚Äù said Kelly Sims
Gallagher, a professor at the Fletcher School of Tufts University who studies China‚Äôs climate policies. China‚Äôs
plan, she said, ‚Äúwill not have the effect of injecting new momentum into the global climate negotiations.‚Äù

Mr. Xi has a political stake in the issues. He has promoted himself and China as guardians of an ‚Äúecological
civilization‚Äù and has made cleaning China‚Äôs air, water and soil a basis for public appeal. When he announced
China‚Äôs pledge last year to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, he also called for a ‚Äúgreen recovery‚Äù from the
Covid-19 pandemic.

China‚Äôs air pollution has eased markedly in recent years. Mr. Xi created environmental inspection teams to
pressure ofÔ¨Åcials usually Ô¨Åxated on economic and political goals. The inspectors Ô¨Çashed their teeth early this
year when they issued strikingly blunt criticisms of the National Energy Administration, which helps oversee
power plant approvals.

‚ÄúEnvironmental protection has not been given the high priority it should be accorded,‚Äù the inspectors wrote
in their report on the administration. They criticized the administration for letting coal power projects go
ahead   in   eastern   China,   where   stringent   pollution   limits   are   supposed   to   apply.   In   recent   days,   the
environmental authorities also cracked down on steel makers in Tangshan, a northern industrial city, that
were found breaking pollution curbs, including submitting fake data.



But China‚Äôs post-Covid recovery has been far from pristine. After emissions fell in the Ô¨Årst months of last year,

 



when China‚Äôs outbreak was at its worst, they climbed back up as spending on infrastructure and industry
lifted the economy, as well as coal use. China‚Äôs approvals for new coal plants have picked up in the past
couple of years, and more are in the pipeline.


In the end, China‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1.7 percent in 2020 relative to the previous year,
the only major economy to show a rise that year, according to the Rhodium Group, an economic research
Ô¨Årm.

To transit away from coal, China must confront the costs of closing mines and plants, including the needs of
millions of potentially displaced miners and other workers. Many coal-dependent regions and their workers
seem unprepared for that possible shift.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never thought about the coal mine shutting down, never thought about leaving,‚Äù Gui Lianjun, a 39-year
old miner in Shenmu, a coal city in northwest China, said by telephone. He sounded nonplused when asked
about the link between coal and global warming.

‚ÄúThe government close down a mine because of global warming? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
never heard of that reason.‚Äù

New E.P.A. Head Says Agency Has Climate Regulations
Underway

By Lisa Friedman

Michael Regan says the E.P.A. is already working on new rules to control planet-warming emissions from
cars and power plants.

WASHINGTON   ‚Äî   Michael   S.   Regan,   the   new   administrator   of   the   Environmental   Protection   Agency,
conÔ¨Årmed on Monday that the agency is preparing new regulations on the electricity sector in an effort to
meet President Biden‚Äôs aggressive climate change goals.

Mr. Regan said his immediate priorities for the E.P.A. are ‚Äúrebuilding the morale‚Äù at the agency, restoring the
role of science ‚Äî and scientists ‚Äî in developing air and water rules, and ensuring new environmental
policies do not further hurt communities already disproportionately affected by toxic sites.

He was not speciÔ¨Åc on the precise new policies E.P.A. will undertake to rein in planet-warming carbon
dioxide emissions, or when they will be made public. But, Mr. Regan said, the agency will ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù
develop new rules for power plants and automobiles and that E.P.A. staff is currently working on those plans.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be hearing from staff very soon about the particulars,‚Äù Mr. Regan said.

Reducing   carbon   emissions   from   power   plants   and   vehicles,   which   are   the   largest   sources   of   planet-
warming pollution in the United States, is critical to meeting Mr. Biden‚Äôs goal of no net carbon emissions by
2050.

Unless   Congress   passes   legislation   ‚Äî   an   unlikely   scenario   ‚Äî   it   will   be   up   to   the   E.P.A.   to   create   new
regulations for both sectors. The Obama administration sought to reshape the electric power sector by
pushing utilities away from coal and toward electricity generated by natural gas, solar, wind and other lower
or no-carbon sources. That rule, the Clean Power Plan, was halted by the Supreme Court.

But the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts ran into trouble as well. The Clean Power Plan replacement ‚Äî a far
weaker rule that only asked utilities to make modest efÔ¨Åciency modiÔ¨Åcations at individual power plants ‚Äî
was struck down entirely by a federal court earlier this year.

That decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, afÔ¨Årmed that the E.P.A. has the
authority to regulate carbon dioxide from the power sector. Mr. Regan said he intends to take advantage of
that.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre starting with a clean slate but we‚Äôre not starting from scratch,‚Äù he said. In addition, Mr. Regan noted,
market forces have changed. Coal-burning power plants already are retiring at a rapid pace, and according to
the International Energy Agency, renewables could surpass coal as the world‚Äôs largest source of power by
2025.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not looking backward; we‚Äôre looking forward, and I‚Äôm really excited about that,‚Äù he said.

Republicans from fossil fuel states have indicated they are ready to Ô¨Åght any broad regulations that target
coal. Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who opposed Mr. Regan‚Äôs conÔ¨Årmation, said she did so
because ‚Äúhe did not commit to a different policy agenda than that of the Obama administration‚Äù ‚Äî which,
she said, ‚Äúabsolutely devastated my state and other energy-producing states.‚Äù

The agency is under time pressure. President Biden has scheduled a global climate change summit for April
22, where the United States will announce a new national emissions target. Foreign leaders also will be
expecting the administration to prove to the world how it plans to meet the goals it lays out.

Mr. Regan said it was too soon to promise there will be proposed regulations released by the time of the
summit. But, he said, ‚ÄúI do believe that we will have the scientiÔ¨Åc credibility to support the direction the
president wants to go.‚Äù

 





For now, Mr. Regan said, he is focused on staff morale that suffered under a Trump administration that often
ignored   career   scientists   and   scientiÔ¨Åc   Ô¨Åndings.   He   pointed   speciÔ¨Åcally   to   the   Trump   administration‚Äôs
approach   to   climate change   as   well   as   per-   and   polyÔ¨Çuoroalkyl   substances,   or   PFAS,   a   toxic   family   of
substances found in common household products.


‚ÄúMorale is not where we want it to be, not nearly where we want it to be. We‚Äôre going to spend some time
there,‚Äù he said.

He also said he intends to appoint an environmental justice adviser to revamp the agency‚Äôs approach to civil
rights and help develop deeper relationships with communities that most closely experience the burdens of
pollution and impacts of climate change. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be a signiÔ¨Åcant priority,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Regan had kind words for his immediate predecessor, Andrew Wheeler, and said that Mr. Wheeler left ‚Äúa
very kind letter‚Äù on his desk in the administrator‚Äôs ofÔ¨Åce.

Mr. Regan, who was sworn in on Friday, said he‚Äôs still learning his way around the building. One place he said
he‚Äôs not likely to have much use for, though, is the soundproof phone booth that Scott Pruitt, President
Donald J. Trump‚Äôs Ô¨Årst E.P.A. administrator, had installed at a taxpayer cost of $43,000.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know where it is or what it looks like. I guess the Ô¨Årst thing I should do is take a look at it,‚Äù Mr.
Regan said, adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using the phone on my desk.‚Äù

Biden Vowed to Make Climate ‚ÄòEssential‚Äô to Foreign Policy.
The Reality Is Harder.

By Lisa Friedman

So far, repairing alliances and restoring friendships seem to be taking precedence.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî In late January, President Biden pledged to make combating climate change ‚Äúan essential
element of U.S. foreign policy and national security,‚Äù appointing a high-powered global climate envoy and
salting the State Department with climate expertise.

In   the   weeks   that   followed,   the   administration   showed   that   more   immediate   demands,   like   bolstering
military security and repairing strained friendships will provide stiff competition.

When Mexico earlier this month passed an energy bill that set back the country‚Äôs climate goals, the Biden
administration raised no public objections. The White House has taken no fresh steps to block one of the
world‚Äôs highest-proÔ¨Åle fossil fuel projects, a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, despite assuring
Congress that Mr. Biden opposes it.

And on Friday, over the Ô¨Åerce protests of environmental activists, the Biden administration allowed a former
Australian Ô¨Ånance minister ‚Äî who tried to abolish Australia‚Äôs renewable energy targets and once called
carbon   pricing   a   ‚Äúvery   expensive   hoax‚Äù   ‚Äî   to   be   named   director   of   the   Organization   for   Economic
Co-operation and Development.

The   O.E.C.D.,   a   37-nation   body   based   in   Paris,   exists   to   help   coordinate   the   domestic   and   international
economic and trade policies of its upper-income member states.

The decisions have disappointed environmental leaders at home and abroad, who said they feared that Mr.
Biden was undercutting his own promise of elevating climate change.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essential this isn‚Äôt just words,‚Äù said Laurence Tubiana, France‚Äôs former climate change ambassador who
is now the chief executive of the European Climate Foundation.

Yet with concerns like immigration, containing China and rebuilding frayed alliances proving pressing for the
White   House,   foreign   policy   experts   say   it‚Äôs   no   surprise   that   climate change   has   chafed   against   other
priorities.

‚ÄúLook, foreign policy is about trade-offs: It‚Äôs about what‚Äôs desirable but also what‚Äôs feasible,‚Äù said Richard N.
Haass, a longtime U.S. diplomat who is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ‚ÄúClimate has to
compete with other issues and priorities in the U.S. agenda.‚Äù

There‚Äôs no dispute that the Biden administration has already elevated climate change across the U.S. foreign
policy apparatus, far beyond what the Obama administration did.

Mr. Biden rejoined the Paris climate agreement on Inauguration Day and canceled the Keystone XL oil
pipeline   to   the   disappointment   of   Canadian   leaders.   He   designated   the   Ô¨Årst   high-level   summit   of   his
administration to be focused on raising global climate ambition. He has discussed climate change in virtually
every call and meeting with foreign leaders, and in the most consequential sign of his commitment, Mr.
Biden tapped former Secretary of State John Kerry to be his presidential envoy for climate change with a seat
on the National Security Council, a Ô¨Årst for climate change.

On Friday when Mr. Biden met with the leaders of India, Australia and Japan, climate change shared the
stage with just two other priorities: Covid-19 vaccines and cyberthreats.

‚ÄúClimate is at the center of our foreign policy because it is one of the few existential challenges we face and
because the crisis is, by deÔ¨Ånition, a challenge we must work together with global allies and partners to
address,‚Äù Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in a statement to The New York Times.

 





In a speech last week, Mr. Blinken outlined his top-eight policy priorities; No. 6 was to ‚Äútackle the climate
crisis and drive a green-energy revolution.‚Äù


Structural changes are also weaving climate change into every part of foreign policy planning.

The N.S.C.‚Äôs director for climate and energy now reports directly to Mr. Biden‚Äôs top national security advisers
rather than to the director of international economics. And a member of Mr. Kerry‚Äôs climate staff also serves
on Mr. Blinken‚Äôs policy team at the State Department.

‚ÄúIn the Obama administration climate change was a huge priority, but climate generally was dealt with by
specialists, only in kind of a niche area in different departments,‚Äù said Jon Finer, Mr. Biden‚Äôs deputy national
security adviser and a former chief of staff to Mr. Kerry. He added that now the issue is ‚Äúa core element of our
overall strategy, not just a free-standing priority.‚Äù

But climate activists said they found it difÔ¨Åcult to square that assertion with some of the administration‚Äôs
recent decisions, particularly on the O.E.C.D.

According to multiple people familiar with the closed-door process under which nations selected Mathias
Cormann of Australia, the Biden administration supported his rival, Cecilia Malmstr√∂m of Sweden. But the
United States is typically the kingmaker in the international economic policy forum, with a traditionally
strong voice on the O.E.C.D. director. Activists have charged that Mr. Cormann could never have succeeded if
the Biden administration had strongly opposed him.

‚ÄúIf you want to be seen as a climate champion in the world, then you need to be Ô¨Åghting for a candidate that
understands climate science and is ready to act and lead an organization like the O.E.C.D.,‚Äù said Jennifer
Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International.

‚ÄúIt does not seem that the Biden administration made this a top priority, and that‚Äôs clearly disappointing,‚Äù
she added.

Climate  advocates  worldwide  had  mounted  a  Ô¨Åerce  campaign  against  Mr.  Cormann,  as  did  the  British
Labour Party and Australia‚Äôs Green Party. In a letter to the O.E.C.D., nearly 30 inÔ¨Çuential academics, activists
and leaders of research organizations said Mr. Cormann‚Äôs record of ‚Äúthwarting effective  climate action‚Äù
should disqualify him from leading the organization that must push developed nations to dramatically
reduce   emissions.   As   Australia‚Äôs   Ô¨Ånance   minister   from   2013   to   2020,   Mr.   Cormann   helped   abolish   the
country‚Äôs carbon pricing scheme, failed to take any steps to curb carbon pollution and described restrictions
that commercial banks had placed on coal lending as ‚Äúvery, very disappointing.‚Äù

Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, a European climate change think tank, said Mr. Cormann‚Äôs selection
‚Äúraises real questions about whether the countries that supported him are serious about transforming the
global economy as we need to do if we‚Äôre going to avoid climate catastrophe, or if they were just trading it off
against some other interest.‚Äù

The State Department declined to conÔ¨Årm the administration‚Äôs pick for the position, saying the United
States ‚Äúrespects the consensus‚Äù reached on Mr. Cormann and vowing that the administration would work
with the O.E.C.D. to pursue ‚Äúan active and ambitious climate agenda.‚Äù

In his own statement, Mr. Cormann said that one of his goals was helping countries achieve a goal of net-
zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äî something to which Australia has not yet committed.

Stuart   E.   Eizenstat,   who   was   President   Bill   Clinton‚Äôs   ambassador   to   the   European   Union   and   his   chief
negotiator on the 1997 Kyoto Protocol climate change accord, said decisions ‚Äúat the margins‚Äù that might cut
against climate goals should not overshadow the signiÔ¨Åcant changes on climate change that the Biden
administration is baking in to U.S. foreign policy.

He called Mexico‚Äôs energy package, which favors government-owned generating plants largely run on fossil
fuels, a ‚Äúgodawful bill.‚Äù But, he pointed out, it was already near passage by the time Mr. Biden held his virtual
bilateral meeting with President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, and that meeting focused primarily on
border control.

Nord Stream 2, the pipeline from Russia to Germany, may be too far down the road to reverse despite years
of U.S. opposition unrelated to climate change, Mr. Eizenstat said. Opposition to the project has centered
around fears that the pipeline would give Russia undue power over Western European energy supplies.



And, Mr. Eizenstat noted, the debate over the O.E.C.D. leader may have hinged as much on taxing digital

 



companies ‚Äî an issue on which the United States and the European Union have been on opposing sides ‚Äî
as climate change.


‚ÄúYou have to pick and choose where you Ô¨Åght,‚Äù said Mr. Eizenstat, who likened the Biden administration‚Äôs
climate policy efforts to President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs attempt to make human rights central to foreign policy in
the 1970s.

The Carter administration struggled to make human rights a cornerstone in foreign policy, Mr. Eizenstat
conceded, but it ultimately did elevate its importance on the world stage. Likewise, the Biden administration
is cementing climate change into the architecture of U.S. diplomacy.

‚ÄúOn every major decision now that comes to the president on foreign policy, climate change will be one of
the factors that will be considered,‚Äù Mr. Eizenstat said. ‚ÄúIt may not always be the one that‚Äôs chosen, but it will
be one of the singular issues that people will say, ‚ÄòWell, what does this mean for our climate change policy?‚Äô
That‚Äôs quite important, and it‚Äôs never been done before.‚Äù

Mr. Haass said ‚Äúsingle issue advocacy‚Äù policies like the promotion of democracy, human rights or climate
change almost always collide with traditional priorities like war and peace, energy security and alliances. But,
he added, the Biden administration will have an easier time weaving its climate goals into its diplomatic
agenda once the United States takes concrete steps to lower its own emissions.

‚ÄúForeign policy begins at home, and in many ways climate policy begins at home,‚Äù Mr. Haass said. ‚ÄúThe

Global Warming‚Äôs Deadly Combination: Heat and Humidity

By Henry Fountain

A   new   study   suggests   that   large   swaths   of   the   tropics   will   experience   dangerous   living   and   working
conditions if global warming isn‚Äôt limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Here‚Äôs   one   more   reason   the   world   should   aim   to   limit   warming   to   1.5   degrees   Celsius,   a   goal   of   the
international Paris Agreement: It will help keep the tropics from becoming a deadly hothouse.

A study published Monday suggests that sharply cutting emissions of greenhouse gases to stay below that
limit, which is equivalent to about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit of warming since 1900, will help the tropics avoid
episodes of high heat and high humidity ‚Äî known as extreme wet-bulb temperature, or TW ‚Äî that go
beyond the limits of human survival.

‚ÄúAn important problem of climate research is what a global warming target means for local extreme weather
events,‚Äù said Yi Zhang, a graduate student in geosciences at Princeton University and the study‚Äôs lead author.
‚ÄúThis work addresses such a problem for extreme TW.‚Äù

The study is in line with other recent research showing that high heat and humidity are potentially one of the
deadliest consequences of global warming.

‚ÄúWe know that climate change is making extreme heat and humidity more common,‚Äù said Robert Kopp, a
climate scientist at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. ‚ÄúAnd both of those things reduce
our ability to live in a given climate.‚Äù

Dr. Kopp, who was an author of a study published last year that found that exposure to heat and humidity
extremes was increasing worldwide, said a key contribution of the new work was in showing that, for the
tropics, ‚Äúit is easier to predict the combined effects of heat and humidity than just how hot it is.‚Äù

Ms. Zhang, along with two other Princeton researchers, Isaac Held and Stephan Fueglistaler, looked at how
the combination of high heat and high humidity is controlled by dynamic processes in the atmosphere. They
found that if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees, the wet-bulb temperature at the surface can approach
but not exceed 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit, in the tropics.

That region, a band roughly 3,000 miles from north to south that encircles Earth at the Equator, includes
much of South and East Asia, Central America, Central Africa. It is home to more than 3 billion people.

Above a wet-bulb temperature of 35 Celsius, the body cannot cool down, as sweat on the skin can no longer
evaporate. Prolonged exposure to such conditions can be fatal, even for healthy people. Lower but still high
wet-bulb temperatures can affect health and productivity in other ways.

Ms. Zhang cautioned that the effect on health from her study was uncertain, since she and her colleagues
looked only at how high wet-bulb temperatures would get, not how often the extremes would be reached or
how long they would last. ‚ÄúThorough knowledge on the health impact of intensity, frequency, and duration
of high wet-bulb temperatures is needed,‚Äù she said.

The study was published in the journal Nature Geosciences.

The target of 1.5 degrees of warming was the lower of two established by the 2015 Paris Agreement among
nations to Ô¨Åght climate change. But the world has already warmed by about 1 degree since 1900, and the
ability to stay beneath the target is slowly slipping away as nations‚Äô emissions reductions, both achieved and
pledged, have fallen far short of what is needed.

A growing body of research has found that global warming so far is taking an increasing toll on human
health indirectly through drought and crop failures, extreme storms and Ô¨Çooding, increased spread of certain
insect-borne diseases and other effects.



 



But heat also has direct effects on the human body. Even relatively dry heat can be enough to kill people, as
evidenced by the toll from heat waves in recent years. And the combination of heat and high humidity has
already reached dangerous levels in parts of the world.


A study last year that looked at weather data found two sites in the tropics that have already had numerous
occurrences   of   wet-bulb   temperatures   above   35   degrees,   and   many   sites,   including   some   along   the
southeastern coast of the United States, that have had TW readings from 31 to 33 degrees. But in most of the
occurrences, the extreme conditions lasted only for an hour or two.

The effects of heat and humidity are worse for women, older people and those with chronic conditions like
diabetes and hypertension, said Glen Kenny, a professor of physiology at the University of Ottawa who
studies how the body copes with heat stress.

Work or exercise generates heat, and the body has to dissipate it. If the air temperature is higher than body
temperature, the main source of cooling is through evaporation of sweat. But if the humidity reaches a point
where sweat cannot evaporate, ‚Äúessentially the body will gain heat,‚Äù said Dr. Kenny, who was not involved in
the new study.

That stresses the cardiovascular system. ‚ÄúThe strain that the heart is facing becomes progressively greater,
especially if there‚Äôs successive days of heat exposure,‚Äù he said.

The Climate Cost of Steel and Concrete

By Rebecca Dell

There are cleaner ways to produce the building blocks of the nation.

You've probably spent a lot of time over the past year looking out the window while staying clear of the
pandemic. If you're a city dweller like me, no doubt you see mostly concrete, steel and maybe sky.

Roads   and   sidewalks,   apartments   and   ofÔ¨Åce   buildings,   overpasses   and   embankments,   cars   and   buses,
streetlights and even statues -- they're all made of concrete and steel. And there's even more of it out of
sight, in sewer mains, electricity transmission lines, foundations, ducts and girders.

It's the stuff of modern life, and we use it in astonishing quantities. Last year, around the world, nearly two
billion tons of steel was produced -- more than 500 pounds for every person on earth. And at least 30 billion
tons of concrete, or nearly 9,000 pounds for each of us. The scale can be hard to believe, until you look at a
runway or a suspension bridge and contemplate what was required to build it.

But all the comfort, security and convenience provided by things made of steel and concrete comes at a cost.
Making steel and cement -- the main ingredient in concrete -- generates about 15 percent of all global
emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas most responsible for the climate crisis. In the United States, industrial
sources like steel mills and cement kilns are also the leading source of some of the most damaging types of
air pollution. We can't solve climate or pollution problems if we don't clean up these industries.

This is particularly urgent. In the coming years and decades, the United States will need a lot more steel and
concrete. Roads are crumbling, mass transit is unavailable, many communities still don't have access to high-
speed internet, drinking water is contaminated, and a nasty winter storm left millions of Texans without
power. Climate change is only going to increase the need for infrastructure, from wind turbines to Ô¨Çood
control systems.

Last month, in an Oval OfÔ¨Åce meeting to discuss infrastructure and workers' rights with the leaders of major
unions, President Biden noted that the United States ranks ""like 38th in the world in terms of infrastructure,
everything from canals to highways to airports."" On Wednesday, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave
American infrastructure a grade of C-, warning of ""signiÔ¨Åcant deÔ¨Åciencies.""

Both political parties want to turn that around.

But a single major infrastructure investment from Congress could increase U.S. carbon dioxide emissions by
200 million tons, or almost 4 percent of national annual emissions. For comparison, in the decade before
2019, the United States managed to decrease annual emissions by only some 220 million tons. We can't
afford to build in a way that emits huge amounts of climate-changing gases, adding to the climate problem
at the same time we're trying to Ô¨Åx it.

Fortunately, we don't have to. Most infrastructure is paid for with tax dollars, so the public can insist that we
build it in a cleaner way. This is the idea behind the Buy Clean campaign, an effort by a growing number of
governments and corporations to change the way products are made by demanding low-carbon production
and supply chains for what they purchase. This will hardly affect the cost to taxpayers, because steel and
cement are a very small portion of the total cost of projects. For example, the eastern span of the bridge
between San Francisco and Oakland, Calif., that was Ô¨Ånished in 2013 cost California taxpayers more than $6
billion, but less than $25 million of that -- less than one half of 1 percent of the cost -- was spent on cement.

States are starting to experiment with this approach. California has a policy that sets a maximum level of
greenhouse gas emissions per unit of material for some building materials. Lawmakers in New York and New
Jersey are considering a plan that would award a credit to contractors for public construction projects that
use cement and concrete produced with low greenhouse gas emissions.



There are things we can do to reduce emissions immediately. Concrete mixes are available that are just as

 



strong but have less of the ingredients that emit the most carbon dioxide. Multiple studies have found that
this could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent or more. These recipes are already in wide use in
Europe and elsewhere. We could use electricity from renewable sources to make recycled steel, like a steel
mill in Colorado, to reduce emissions from steel production by a similar amount.


Those 20 percent reductions are very valuable and we should get moving on them right away, but they're not
going to get us to the long-term climate goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. That's why the country
needs   to   make   serious   investments   in   the   many   new   ideas   for   making   steel   and   concrete   with   zero
emissions, to create incentives to buy them and to invest in the workers and communities that produce
them.

Meeting the nation's climate goals doesn't have to be a burden on American manufacturing -- it can make
our products and technology more competitive around the world. Smart climate standards can create new
manufacturing and construction jobs and with them new ladders to the middle class.

Infrastructure investment is one of the few things both political parties agree on. But how we build affects
how we breathe and what kind of climate we have to live in. Most people don't notice the steel and concrete
around them, and they don't see how it's changing the climate. We need to recognize the problem and then
recognize our power to Ô¨Åx it.

Rebecca Dell (@rebeccawdell) is the director the industry program at the ClimateWorks Foundation, which
works with philanthropies to slow climate change. She worked at the Department of Energy in the Obama
administration.

In Swift Actions Focused on Climate, Interior Department
Reverses Trump Policies

By Lisa Friedman

Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, Mr. Biden's nominee to lead the department, faces a showdown
vote in the Senate likely later this month, amid vocal Republican concern for her past positions against oil
and gas drilling. But even without her, an agency that spent much of the past four years opening vast swaths
of land to commercial exploitation has pulled an abrupt about-face.

The department has suspended lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico under an early executive order imposing a
temporary freeze on new drilling leases on all public lands and waters and requiring a review of the leasing
program. It has frozen drilling activity in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, delayed Trump-era rollbacks on
protections of migratory birds and the northern spotted owl, and taken the Ô¨Årst steps in restoring two
national monuments in Utah and one off the Atlantic coast that Mr. Trump largely dismantled.

As early as this week, one administration ofÔ¨Åcial said the Interior Department is poised to take the next steps
in preparing a review of the federal oil and gas leasing program.

Even critics of the administration's agenda said they have been surprised by the pace of the agency's actions.

""They're obviously moving forward quickly and aggressively,"" said Nicolas Loris, an economist who focuses on
environment policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

That aggressiveness, along with Ms. Haaland's long history of pushing to shut down fossil fuel drilling and
pipelines, has put the agency in the line of Ô¨Åre from Republicans and the oil and gas industry.

""I almost feel like your nomination is sort of this proxy Ô¨Åght over the future of fossil fuels,"" Senator Maria
Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, told Ms. Haaland during her conÔ¨Årmation hearing last week.

The Environmental Protection Agency will ultimately take center stage in the regulatory battles over climate
change because it is the lead agency policing emissions from the electricity and transportation sectors -- the
two largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

But the Interior Department, which decides when and whether to sell publicly owned coal, oil and gas, is at
the heart of the always contentious Ô¨Åght over keeping such resources ""in the ground"" -- that is, whether the
vast   majority   of   America's   fossil   fuels   should   remain   untapped   to   avoid   dangerous   concentrations   of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Mr.   Biden   already   has   appointed   nearly   50   top   Interior   ofÔ¨Åcials   across   the   vast   agency,   many   of   them
veterans of the Obama administration, adept at pulling the levers of policy. They include Kate Kelly, who
spent six years at the Interior Department before going to the liberal Center for American Progress where
she focused on public lands policy, and Laura Daniel Davis who served as chief of staff to former secretaries
Sally Jewell and Ken Salazar. This time around, she is a principal deputy assistant secretary over land and
minerals management.

Perhaps   the   most   signiÔ¨Åcant   driver   of   the   agency's   most   aggressive   early   action,   supporters   of   the
administration said, has been David Hayes, who served in both the Obama and Clinton administrations as
deputy secretary of Interior. Mr. Hayes worked on Mr. Biden's transition and ahead of Inauguration Day was
tapped to be a special adviser to the president on climate change policy.

""These are people who know how to get things done,"" said Sarah Greenberger, interim chief conservation
ofÔ¨Åcer at the National Audubon Society.

The appointments have had immediate effects. The day after Mr. Biden named a new offshore energy
regulator at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, for example, the ofÔ¨Åce revived the review of an

 





offshore wind farm near Martha's Vineyard that the Trump administration had moved to cancel.


Ms.   Greenberger   noted   that   actions   like   suspending   the   Trump-era   rule   that   gutted   protections   for
migratory birds required particularly fast planning since the Biden administration had only a short window
to act before the rule was set to take effect, on Feb. 8. Similarly when an Alaska Native group missed a
deadline to conduct a seismic survey in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the department moved to
effectively kill the survey.

""There was an enormous amount of thought put in during the transition, especially into understanding what
needed to happen and what were the opportunities,"" Ms. Greenberg said.

Critics took a dimmer view.

""Makes you wonder if they're treating the new secretary as a Ô¨Ågurehead and the deputies are going forward
with what they had planned regardless,"" said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, a
Denver-based oil and natural gas association.

In a statement Jennifer Van der Heide, chief of staff at the Department of Interior, said those already in place
at the agency are working to implement Mr. Biden's campaign promises until Ms. Haaland is conÔ¨Årmed.

""There are some actions we can or must move quickly on, but when we have a secretary, she will provide the
leadership, experience and vision to restore morale within the department, build a clean energy economy,
strengthen the nation-to-nation relationships with tribes, and inspire a movement to better conserve our
nation's lands, waters, and wildlife,"" Ms. Van der Heide said.

The   Interior   Department   manages   about   500   million   acres   of   public   lands   and   vast   coastal   waters.   Its
agencies lease many of those acres for oil and gas drilling as well as wind and solar farms. It oversees the
country's   national   parks   and   wildlife   refuges,   protects   threatened   and   endangered   species,   reclaims
abandoned mine sites, oversees the government's relationship with the nation's 574 federally recognized
tribes, and provides scientiÔ¨Åc data about the effects of climate change.

That sprawling range of authorities has allowed Interior to move more quickly than smaller agencies that rely
more on the slow churn of regulations, experts noted. Interior has initiated consultations with tribal leaders
to hear their suggestions on federal policies and reversed restrictions that Mr. Trump's Interior secretary,
David Bernhardt, had imposed on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which prevented money from
being used to buy public land.

But some major actions -- such as an expected revision of the Endangered Species Act, which Mr. Trump's
administration curtailed through regulation -- must await a Senate-conÔ¨Årmed secretary.

Mr. Biden's Interior Department will ultimately be deÔ¨Åned by its reversals on fossil fuels after four years in
which the Trump administration aggressively pursued energy production on public lands.

At Ms. Haaland's conÔ¨Årmation hearing Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, noted that she has
advocated for keeping fossil fuels ""in the ground."" He pressed her on where oil and gas workers in his state
and others that depend on drilling will work if Mr. Biden's drilling pause becomes permanent.

Ms. Haaland sought to reassure Republicans that she would enact Mr. Biden's policies of pausing future
fracking, not banning it. In fact, Mr. Biden's position is not far from Ms. Haaland's. He campaigned on a
promise of ""banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters,"" and it remains unclear for now
whether the Biden administration will move forward with a permanent moratorium.

Ms. Sgamma, whose group has Ô¨Åled a lawsuit challenging Mr. Biden's executive order, said she believes the
administration's review of the leasing program is actually designed to drag on for the duration of Mr. Biden's
term.

""In the meantime, we will expect no leasing and a slowdown in other permitted activity. That's why this is not
a pause' on leasing,"" she said, adding, ""Whether you call it a 'pause' or a yearslong ban, it is unlawful and I like
our chances in court.""

Drew Caputo, vice president of litigation at EarthJustice, an environmental group, said he hopes the early
pause will be a down payment on Mr. Biden's campaign pledge.

""The climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis isn't standing still,"" he said.

White House Says Trade Policy Will Focus on Workers,
Climate, Racial Gaps and Supply Chain

The Biden administration said Monday that it would try to use its trade policy to support American workers,
mitigate climate change, close racial gaps, make supply chains more resilient and expand opportunities for
American exporters.

In a report laying out its trade policy agenda for 2021, the administration said trade would be an essential
component of Ô¨Åghting the pandemic, buoying the economy and enacting President Biden's ""Build Back
Better"" agenda, which aims to strengthen U.S. infrastructure and innovation and close racial and economic
gaps. The administration said it would particularly focus on developing more resilient manufacturing supply
chains in the year to come to help the country better confront health crises.

The report, issued by the OfÔ¨Åce of the United States Trade Representative, said that promoting open markets
would   remain   a   fundamental   part   of   U.S.   policy   but   that   efforts   to   lower   foreign   barriers   for   American
exporters would be considered in tandem with the interests of American ""manufacturers, farmers, ranchers,
Ô¨Åshers and underserved communities.""

The administration also said it would review past trade policies for any ""unintended consequences"" for
workers, including effects on wage gaps, worker unionization, the safety of workplaces and the presence of
forced labor. And it pledged to try to better understand the impact of trade policies on communities of color
and the empowerment of women.

In a criticism of the Trump administration, the report said American agriculturalists had been burdened in
recent years ""by erratic trade actions that were taken without a broader strategy"" that triggered retaliation,
billions of dollars in lost exports and huge government payments to farmers.

The   report   also   said   the   Biden   administration   would   develop   a   more   comprehensive   and   systematic
approach to dealing with China ""than the piecemeal approach of the recent past.""

It promised to aggressively pursue unfair trade practices from China, ""using all available tools"" to take on
behavior that harms American workers and businesses. But the report provided few details on the concrete
policy tools the administration would use, saying that ofÔ¨Åcials were carrying out a comprehensive review of
U.S. trade policy as they develop an overall China strategy.

The administration also pledged to make addressing China's human rights abuses against Uighurs and
other minorities in the Xinjiang region a top priority, and said it would work with allied countries to try to
address global market distortions created by Chinese overcapacity in sectors like steel, aluminum, solar and
Ô¨Åber optics.

The Biden administration said it would engage with allies on issues like how trade policies can affect climate
change, build stronger supply chains and end unfair trade practices, among other goals. And it pledged to
work with the new director general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, ""to address the
challenges   facing   the   global   trading   system,   including   growing   inequality,   digital   transformation,   and
impediments to small business trade.""

Global Action Is ‚ÄòVery Far‚Äô From What‚Äôs Needed to Avert
Climate Chaos

By Somini Sengupta

New climate pledges submitted to the United Nations would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by less than
1 percent, the world body announced.

The global scientiÔ¨Åc consensus is clear: Emissions of planet-warming gases must be cut by nearly half by
2030 if the world is to have a good shot at averting the worst climate catastrophes.

The global political response has been underwhelming so far.

New climate targets submitted by countries to the United Nations would reduce emissions by less than 1
percent, according to the latest tally, made public Friday by the world body.

The head of the United Nations climate agency, Patricia Espinosa, said the Ô¨Ågures compiled by her ofÔ¨Åce
showed that ‚Äúcurrent levels of climate ambition are very far from putting us on a pathway that will meet our
Paris Agreement goals.‚Äù

The   Ô¨Ågures   offer   a   reality   check   on   the   many   promises   coming   from   world   capitals   and   company
boardrooms that leaders are taking climate change seriously.

The United Nations secretary general, Ant√≥nio Guterres, called the report ‚Äúa red alert.‚Äù

The tally was all the more damning because fewer than half of all countries submitted fresh targets to the
United Nations. The Paris climate accord, designed to limit an increase in global temperatures, had urged
them to do so by the end of 2020.

Still missing from the ledger is the United States, which has produced more greenhouse gas emissions than
any other country in history. It rejoined the Paris Agreement last week, after the former president, Donald J.
Trump, pulled out. It has yet to submit its 2030 targets and is under pressure from climate advocates to
reduce emissions by at least 50 percent compared with 2005 levels.

Likewise, China, which currently produces the largest share of emissions, has yet to submit new 2030 targets
to the United Nations. Its president, Xi Jinping, said in December that China would produce more of its
electricity from renewable sources (25 percent), grow more forests (six billion cubic meters) and reduce its
carbon intensity by over 65 percent, which means that as China‚Äôs economy grows, its carbon emissions
would grow at a slower pace than before.

Mr. Xi has said China will be carbon neutral by 2060, meaning it will remove from the atmosphere planet-
warming carbon emissions equal to the amount it still produces at that time.

The Biden administration has said it aspires to net-zero emissions by 2050 but has yet to detail how it will get
there.

All eyes are on an international climate summit that the White House is set to host on April 22. The United
States is expected to announce its 2030 climate targets by then, and China may well come forward with an
announcement of its own, too.

The diplomacy culminates with the next round of United Nations climate talks, scheduled to be held in
Glasgow in November.

Some of the biggest emitter countries ‚Äî including Australia, Brazil and Russia ‚Äî submitted new plans for
2030 without increasing their ambitions. Mexico lowered its climate targets, which the Natural Resources
Defense Council described as a signal that ‚ÄúMexico is effectively retreating from its previous leadership on
climate and clean energy.‚Äù



 



In contrast, 36 countries ‚Äî among them Britain, Chile, Kenya, Nepal and the 27 countries of the European
Union ‚Äî raised their climate targets.


The Paris Agreement is designed in such a way that the United Nations can neither dictate nor enforce any
country‚Äôs climate targets, or what are called nationally determined contributions. Each country is expected to
set its own, make regular reports to the world on its progress and set new targets every Ô¨Åve years. Diplomatic
peer pressure is meant to persuade each country to be more ambitious.

The end goal is to limit global temperature increase to within 1.5 degrees Celsius of 1990 levels. Any warming
beyond that, scientists have said in exhaustive studies, would risk widening wildÔ¨Åres and droughts, growing
food and water insecurity, and the inundation of coastal cities and small islands.

The Alliance of Small Island States, a group of countries that are among those most threatened by climate
change, issued a searing response to the report on Friday.

‚ÄúThis report conÔ¨Årms the shocking lack of urgency, and genuine action,‚Äù Aubrey Webson, a diplomat from
Antigua and Barbuda and the chairman of the alliance, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are Ô¨Çirting dangerously with
the 1.5 Celsius warming limit that the world agreed we need to stay within.‚Äù

The S.E.C. Ô¨Åres a ‚Äòwarning Ô¨Çare‚Äô on climate change.

By Ephrat Livni

The Securities and Exchange Commission announced this week that it would ‚Äúenhance its focus on climate-
related disclosure in public company Ô¨Ålings‚Äù and eventually update guidelines issued in 2010.

The timing of the announcement comes just days before the Senate conÔ¨Årmation hearings for Gary Gensler,
President Biden‚Äôs pick to lead the commission, puts the issue ‚Äúfront and center,‚Äù the securities law partner
Joseph Hall of Davis Polk told the DealBook newsletter.

The regulator ‚Äúis setting the stage, sending a signal that we are no longer in an administration where
‚Äòclimate change‚Äô is a forbidden term,‚Äù Mr. Hall said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a warning Ô¨Çare to let people know new disclosure
rules are coming down the pike.‚Äù He predicted that ‚Äúsenators will be all over this‚Äù issue during next week‚Äôs
hearings, and ‚Äúbattle lines will be drawn.‚Äù

Democrats will probably push Mr. Gensler on adopting speciÔ¨Åc disclosure requirements, tied to metrics,
which   are   more   burdensome   for   companies   but   make   cross-industry   comparisons   easier,   Mr.   Hall   said.
Republicans will probably lobby for a principles-based system that gives companies extra leeway but critics
say is too vague. The S.E.C. is likely to try to strike a balance, Mr. Hall believes, but whatever happens, any
move on climate-related disclosures will be ‚Äúhugely consequential.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a signiÔ¨Åcant statement and one companies can see as an opportunity,‚Äù said Wes Bricker a vice chair of
PricewaterhouseCoopers and a former chief accountant at the S.E.C.

Mr. Bricker said he thought that many companies had already moved beyond requirements under the old
framework, responding to the market‚Äôs increasing demands for transparency on their environmental impact.
For companies that are not there yet, the S.E.C.‚Äôs announcement is a reminder of the direction things are
heading.

Surveying the climate-related disclosure scene across companies and grappling with an understanding of
what matters to investors now is ‚Äúvery constructive,‚Äù Mr. Bricker said.

It may be some time before any changes are mandated, but he said that there was likely to be an immediate
effect anyway. He believes that the S.E.C.‚Äôs message will begin to subtly nudge any company that is on the
fence about a disclosure toward more transparency.

By talking about ‚Äòclimate change‚Äô but not ‚Äòillegal aliens,‚Äô the
Biden administration is changing the language of
government.

By Michael D. Shear

Days after President Biden took ofÔ¨Åce, the Bureau of Land Management put a scenic landscape of a winding
river at the top of its website, which during the previous administration had featured a photograph of a huge
wall of coal.

At the Department of Homeland Security, the phrase ‚Äúillegal alien‚Äù is being replaced with ‚Äúnoncitizen.‚Äù The
Interior Department now makes sure that mentions of its stakeholders include ‚ÄúTribal‚Äù people (with a capital
‚ÄúT‚Äù as preferred by Native Americans, it said). The most unpopular two words in the Trump lexicon ‚Äî ‚Äúclimate
change‚Äù   ‚Äî   are   once   again   appearing   on   government   websites   and   in   documents;   ofÔ¨Åcials   at   the
Environmental Protection Agency have even begun using the hashtag #climatecrisis on Twitter.

And across the government, L.G.B.T.Q. references are popping up everywhere. Visitors to the White House
website are now asked whether they want to provide their pronouns when they Ô¨Åll out a contact form:
she/her, he/him or they/them.

It is all part of a concerted effort by the Biden administration to rebrand the government after four years of
President Donald J. Trump, in part by stripping away the language and imagery that represented his anti-
immigration, anti-science and anti-gay rights policies and replacing them with words and pictures that are
more inclusive and better match the current president‚Äôs sensibilities.

‚ÄúBiden is trying to reclaim the vision of America that was there during the Obama administration, a vision
that was much more diverse, much more religiously tolerant, much more tolerant of different kinds of
gender dispositions and gender presentations,‚Äù said Norma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at
the   University   of   California,   Los   Angeles,   and   an   author   of   ‚ÄúLanguage   in   the   Trump   Era:   Scandals   and
Emergencies.‚Äù

Ms. Mendoza-Denton said Mr. Trump sought to ‚Äúremake reality through language‚Äù during a tumultuous
tenure.

Now,   ofÔ¨Åcials   in   Mr.   Biden‚Äôs   administration   are   using   Mr.   Trump‚Äôs   own   tactics   to   erase   the   words   his
predecessor used and return to ones that had been banished.

‚ÄúThe president has been clear to all of us ‚Äî words matter, tone matters and civility matters,‚Äù said Jen Psaki,
the White House press secretary. ‚ÄúAnd bringing the country together, getting back our seat at the global
table means turning the page from the actions but also the divisive and far too often xenophobic language
of the last administration.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs Climate Envoy, at U.N., Likens Global Inaction to a
‚ÄòSuicide Pact‚Äô

By Somini Sengupta

John Kerry‚Äôs remarks stood in sharp contrast to the American stance under the previous administration,
which tried to block even general mentions of global warming at the world body.

The United States climate envoy, John Kerry, on Tuesday warned that global warming was making the world
a more dangerous place and posed risks to peace and security around the world.

Failing to address the threats of climate change is ‚Äúmarching forward to what is almost tantamount to a
mutual   suicide   pact,‚Äù   Mr.   Kerry   said   in   a   session   of   the   United   Nations   Security   Council   attended   by
presidents and prime ministers from several countries.

‚ÄúWe bury our heads in the sand at our own peril,‚Äù he went on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs urgent to treat the climate crisis as the
urgent security threat that it is.‚Äù

Climate change has been coming up in the Security Council for more than a decade, but the Tuesday
meeting   was   notable   for   its   stark   contrast   to   the   last   four   years,   when   the   United   States,   under   the
presidency of Donald J. Trump, sought to block even general mentions of climate science in United Nations
proceedings.

‚ÄúClimate   disruption   is   a   crisis   ampliÔ¨Åer   and   multiplier,‚Äù   the   United   Nations   secretary   general,   Ant√≥nio
Guterres, told the Council.

Mr. Kerry noted the ‚Äúinexcusable absence‚Äù of United States leadership on climate in the previous four years.
As president, Mr. Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global accord designed to
limit emissions of greenhouse gases. President Biden began the process of rejoining as soon as he was
sworn in.

The Security Council has the power to impose sanctions and authorize peacekeeping missions to countries,
which is why countries argue about what it should and should not address.

Mr. Kerry‚Äôs remarks were part of a diplomatic squabble that broke out among powerful countries over
whether climate change should even be discussed in the world body, which was designed to tackle war and
peace.

Russia, India and China ‚Äî all among the world‚Äôs biggest producers of greenhouse gas emissions ‚Äî argued
that climate change could be addressed in other ways. New global fault lines began to emerge.

India‚Äôs environment minister, Prakash Javdekar, dismissed the idea of climate change as a driver of conÔ¨Çict.
China‚Äôs climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, framed climate change as a development issue. Russia‚Äôs ambassador to
the United Nations, Vassily A. Nebenzia, waxed philosophical about rising temperatures. ‚ÄúAre they really the
root causes of these conÔ¨Çicts?‚Äù he asked.

The session led to nothing concrete. But the fact that it happened at all, and that several presidents and
prime ministers participated, sent a signal that climate change is becoming increasingly important among
United Nations member states, particularly with the United States taking it on. ‚ÄúThe Biden team‚Äôs emphasis
on global warming has changed the incentive structure in the Council, and I think a lot of states are going to
be Ô¨Çagging the issue this year,‚Äù said Richard Gowan, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.

Of the 21 countries where the United Nations currently deploys peacekeepers, 10 are ranked as most exposed
to climate change,   according   to   the   Stockholm   International   Peace   Research   Institute,   an   independent
research group.



Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, whose country serves as the rotating chair of the Security Council
this month, opened the session by saying, ‚ÄúI know that there are people around the world who will say that

 



this is all kind of green stuff from a bunch of tree-hugging tofu-munchers and not suited to international
diplomacy and international politics.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt disagree more profoundly.‚Äù


Britain hosts the next United Nations climate negotiations, to be held in November in Glasgow.

The Climate Talk vs. the Walk

By Peter Eavis and Clifford Krauss

For   the   past   several   years,   BlackRock,   the   giant   investment   Ô¨Årm,   has   cast   itself   as   a   champion   of   the
transition to clean energy.

Last month, Laurence D. Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, wrote that the coronavirus pandemic had ""driven
us   to   confront   the   global   threat   of   climate change   more   forcefully,""   and   the   company   said   it   wants
businesses it invests in to remove as much carbon dioxide from the environment as they emit by 2050 at the
latest.

But crucial details were missing from that widely read pledge, including what proportion of the companies
BlackRock invests in will be zero-emission businesses in 2050. Setting such a goal and earlier targets would
demonstrate the seriousness of the company's commitment and could force all sorts of industries to step up
their efforts. On Saturday, in response to questions from The New York Times, a BlackRock spokesman said
for the Ô¨Årst time that the company's ""ambition"" was to have ""net zero emissions across our entire assets
under management by 2050.""

As the biggest companies strive to trumpet their environmental activism, the need to match words with
deeds is becoming increasingly important.

Household names like Costco and NetÔ¨Çix have not provided emissions reduction targets despite saying they
want to reduce their impact on climate change. Others, like the agricultural giant Cargill and the clothing
company   Levi   Strauss,   have   made   commitments   but   have   struggled   to   cut   emissions.   Technology
companies like Google and Microsoft, which run power-hungry data centers, have slashed emissions, but
even they are Ô¨Ånding that the technology often doesn't yet exist to carry out their ""moonshot"" objectives.

""You can look at a company's website and see their sustainability report and it will look great,"" said Alberto
Carrillo Pineda, a founder of Science Based Targets, a global initiative to assess corporate plans to reduce
emissions. ""But then when you look at what is behind it, you'll see there is not a lot of substance behind
those commitments or the commitments are not comprehensive enough.""

President Biden is also placing a big emphasis on climate change and has rejoined the Paris agreement. But
determining   how   hard   companies   are   really   trying   can   be   very   difÔ¨Åcult   when   there   are   no   regulatory
standards that require uniform disclosures of important information like emissions.

Institutional Shareholder Services, a Ô¨Årm that advises investors on how to vote on board elections and other
corporate matters, uses company data and its own analysis to assess what corporations are doing to reduce
emissions. Just over a third of the 500 companies in the S&amp;P 500 stock index have set ambitious targets,
it found, while 215 had no target at all. The rest had weak targets.

""To realize the necessary emission reductions, more ambitious targets urgently need to be set,"" said Viola
Lutz, deputy head of ISS ESG Climate Solutions, an arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. ""Otherwise, we
project emissions for S&amp;P 500 companies will end up being triple of what they should be in 2050.""

There has been some progress by companies that have rigorous targets. In a report last month, Science
Based   Targets,   which   was   started   by   the   environmental   groups   and   hundreds   of   businesses   brought
together by the United Nations, said the 338 large companies around the world for which it had sufÔ¨Åcient
emissions data collectively reduced their emissions by 25 percent between 2015 and 2019.

Often large companies in the same industry have very different records.

For example, Walmart discloses its targets for emissions reductions and the progress it has made to the
Carbon Disclosure Project, including a goal for emissions from its suppliers, and its plan has been vetted by
Science Based Targets. But Costco doesn't expect to have commitments to reduce emissions until the end of
next year. Costco executives declined to comment.

 





NetÔ¨Çix is often compared to technology giants like Google and Microsoft. But NetÔ¨Çix has yet to set a target
for reducing the emissions caused by its ofÔ¨Åces, production activities and the computer servers it uses.
""Climate action is important, and we'll announce our plans in the spring, which will include targets based on
climate science,"" the company said in a statement.


Slashing   emissions   is   difÔ¨Åcult.   Businesses   must   reliably   measure   how   much   carbon   dioxide   and   other
greenhouse gases they are responsible for. Then companies have to Ô¨Ånd cleaner energy sources without
hurting their operations. Where they can't Ô¨Ånd cleaner substitutes, businesses often pay others to reduce
emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.

The task gets even harder when companies begin the process of reducing so-called Scope 3 emissions --
pollution   caused   by   suppliers   and   customers.   At   oil   companies,   for   example,   Scope   3   would   include
emissions from cars that use gasoline.

BlackRock, with $8.7 trillion of assets under management, including stakes in many companies, clearly faces
a daunting task. The company doesn't directly own most of the shares or bonds it buys -- it manages them
for pension funds, other corporations and individual investors -- limiting how much climate activism it can
pursue. In addition, most of its investment products track indexes like the S&amp;P 500, so it inevitably ends
up managing stocks of fossil fuel companies.

Many Wall Street Ô¨Årms have made pledges to get to net zero emissions from their lending and other
Ô¨Ånancial activities but have not made clear whether that goal applies to the stocks and bonds they manage
for customers. BlackRock's decision to include all the assets it manages could pressure other Ô¨Ånancial giants
to make similar commitments, but it could rankle fossil fuel industries and their political supporters in
Congress.

Later this year, BlackRock is going to announce an interim target for how many of its investments will have
achieved, or be on their way to, zero emissions in 2030.

Still, BlackRock is careful about the language it uses when describing what it will do to push businesses in its
portfolios to reduce emissions -- for which it has been criticized by people who want the Ô¨Årm to take a more
activist   stand.   In   a   recent   letter,   the   company   said   it   was   intent   on   ""increasing   the   role   of   votes   on
shareholder proposals in our stewardship efforts around sustainability.""

""This could mean a lot of things and -- as always -- the proof is in the pudding,"" Ms. Lutz of ISS said.

Ed Sweeney, a company spokesman, said BlackRock had recently voted for a signiÔ¨Åcantly higher number of
shareholder proposals aimed at making companies greener compared with previous years. And in a client
memo sent Wednesday, the Ô¨Årm said it might vote against directors and management at companies that it
determines do not have clear climate disclosures and credible environmental plans.

""While we recognize that the transition to net zero is at different stages based on industry and region,
through   a   combination   of   engagement   with   management   teams   and   boards   of   directors   and   holding
companies accountable for insufÔ¨Åcient progress through our voting on director elections and shareholder
proposals, BlackRock will continue to focus on this important issue,"" Mr. Sweeney said in an email.

Other companies that have pledged to cut emissions face different challenges, including coordinating with
suppliers and partners.

Consider the apparel industry. Much of its contribution to climate change comes from its supply chain. The
clothes that Levi Strauss and others put their labels on are often made in factories in places like China,
Pakistan and India that remain reliant on coal-Ô¨Åred power plants. The clothes are transported on ships and
planes that burn diesel and jet fuel.

Even so, when Levi Strauss rolled out its 2025 climate action strategy three years ago, its chief executive, Chip
Bergh, said, ""We believe it's time for businesses to start playing a larger role in Ô¨Åghting the world's most
pressing problems, like climate change.""

The company set a Scope 3 emissions target. But Science Based Targets said in January that emissions from
Levi's supply chain were not falling and had grown by 13 percent between 2016 and 2019.

Jeffrey Hogue, Levi Strauss's chief sustainability ofÔ¨Åcer, said that calculation was incomplete because the
company could not yet take credit for many interventions and investments it has made with suppliers. He
said   that   would   happen   once   the   apparel   industry   decides   on   a   method   for   calculating   the   advances

 





suppliers have made in cutting emissions, particularly for factories that sell to multiple companies.


""We believe we are way better than 13 percent,"" Mr. Hogue said. But he said he could not conÔ¨Ådently give his
own estimate, adding, ""We are working with the industry to create more accuracy and precision in the
number.""

Gary Cook, the global climate campaigns director of Stand.earth, an environmental group, was skeptical.
""They set an aggressive target and they are struggling with that,"" he said.

Cargill, one of the largest privately owned American companies and a major middleman that works with
farmers and food companies around the world, has attempted to become a strong voice on climate change
but has struggled to meet its goals.

The company is a big purchaser of Brazilian soybeans, which are often grown on land that was previously
forested. In 2010, Cargill promised to meet a ""net zero"" deforestation goal by 2020, but the company did not
succeed and has extended its target to 2030. ""Our commitment on deforestation has not wavered,"" said Jill
Kolling, Cargill's vice president for global sustainability.

The company's plans show how emissions could go up over all even when a business has set a goal to cut
them. Cargill wants to reduce its emissions in its global supply chains by 30 percent per ton of production by
2030, a target it made no progress on at the time of measurement in 2019, according to Science Based
Targets. But overall emissions in its supply chains may not fall by that amount because of increases in
production. ""It depends on how our business grows, and that's hard to predict,"" Ms. Kolling said.

By contrast, deep-pocketed tech Ô¨Årms have probably made the most progress. Now they are setting even
more ambitious targets.

Google wants all its operations to be consistently powered by renewable energy by 2030, but that could be
difÔ¨Åcult to achieve because the output of wind and solar farms is still small in some countries. Microsoft
wants to be ""carbon negative"" by 2030 even including Scope 3 emissions. That goal will almost certainly
require extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those technologies are nascent and could be very
expensive.

And for all these ambitious targets, even some executives argue that the current voluntary approach won't
ensure the required reduction in emissions.

""If we are going to achieve a net-zero carbon economy for real, we will need everyone to act,"" said Lucas
Joppa,   Microsoft's   chief   environmental   ofÔ¨Åcer.   ""And   that   means   action   can't   be   voluntary.   We   need
requirements and standards that everyone is expected to meet.""

Climate Threats Could Mean Big Jumps in Insurance Costs
This Year

By Christopher Flavelle

The federal government is revising rates for Ô¨Çood coverage on April 1. New data suggests premiums need to
increase sharply for some homes.

WASHINGTON ‚Äî The cost of federal Ô¨Çood insurance will need to increase signiÔ¨Åcantly in much of the
country to meet the growing risks of climate change, new data suggests, creating a political headache for
the Biden administration.

The National Flood Insurance Program, which provides the vast majority of United States Ô¨Çood insurance
policies, would have to quadruple premiums on high-risk homes inside Ô¨Çoodplains to reÔ¨Çect the risks they
already face, according to data issued on Monday by the First Street Foundation, a group of academics and
experts that models Ô¨Çood risks.

By 2050, First Street projected, increased Ô¨Çooding tied to climate change will require a sevenfold increase.

The new data could point to higher Ô¨Çood insurance costs this year for homes at risk. On April 1, the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, which runs the Ô¨Çood program, is set to announce new premiums, using
modern Ô¨Çood-modeling techniques that more closely reÔ¨Çect the actual risks facing individual properties ‚Äî
the same approach that First Street said it had used in its calculations.

‚ÄúIf they took a purely risk-based approach, it would look like our numbers,‚Äù said Jeremy Porter, head of
research and development at First Street and director of the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences
program at the City University of New York. Several U.S. agencies, including the Federal Housing Finance
Agency and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, use First Street‚Äôs data.

FEMA has issued a statement warning people not to assume that its new system for setting premiums,
which it calls Risk Rating 2.0, will produce rate increases that match those modeled by First Street.

‚ÄúAny entity claiming that they can provide insight or comparison to the Risk Rating 2.0 initiative, including
premium amounts, is misinformed and setting public expectations that are not based in fact,‚Äù said David I.
Maurstad, who runs the Ô¨Çood insurance program for FEMA.

Still, most experts agree that a closer analysis of Ô¨Çood risks will lead to costlier insurance for owners of high-
risk homes than what they already pay. That presents a challenge for President Biden, who has promised to
pursue a climate agenda guided by science and data, but has also said he is focused on addressing the
economic concerns of middle-class households.

Climate and disaster experts argue the cost of Ô¨Çood insurance should reÔ¨Çect the full risk of living in Ô¨Çood-
prone areas, as a warning to prospective home buyers and a signal to local ofÔ¨Åcials to limit development in
those places. Because the federal government has no control over land-use planning or building codes,
which are set by state and local governments, the Ô¨Çood insurance program is one of its most powerful tools
to inÔ¨Çuence how and where Americans build homes.

But a big jump in rates may put more pressure on the household budgets of people who already live in
vulnerable areas, and also cause home values to fall.

‚ÄúFEMA recognizes and shares concerns about Ô¨Çood insurance affordability,‚Äù Mr. Maurstad said, adding that
rates for some people would fall under the new system and stay the same for others. ‚ÄúThe number of policies
that will see large annual increases is a minority of all policyholders.‚Äù

Any jump in costs for current customers would be spread out over years or decades, because Congress
prevents FEMA from raising individual homeowners‚Äô premiums by more than 18 percent annually. So even if
FEMA‚Äôs new system meant that ultimate rates doubled on paper for some people, those who already had

 





coverage would be protected from paying the full increase all at once.


But when a home that‚Äôs covered by Ô¨Çood insurance changes owners, many buyers must pay the full rate
right away. So big increases in Ô¨Çood insurance rates could scare off buyers for Ô¨Çood-prone homes, reducing
their value or even making them hard to sell.

‚ÄúWe want people to know the risks they face,‚Äù said Rebecca Elliott, an assistant professor at the London
School of Economics and Political Science and author of a book about Ô¨Çood insurance and climate change.
At the same time, she said, many people rely on steady or rising home values as the foundation of their
Ô¨Ånancial health.

Previous efforts to increase Ô¨Çood insurance rates have been delayed or rolled back in the face of public
pressure. In 2012, Congress passed a law that would have brought rates in line with the full risk people faced;
two years later, lawmakers backed down, replacing those changes with more modest increases.

FEMA‚Äôs new Ô¨Çood insurance system has prompted similar concerns. The new rates were initially supposed to
take effect last October, but members of Congress warned FEMA about the effect that increases would have
on their constituents. The Trump administration delayed the new rates until this year, worried in part that
increasing premiums shortly before the election would hurt President Trump politically, according to a
person familiar with the discussions.

The agency could theoretically Ô¨Ånd ways to further blunt those rate increases, according to Roy Wright, who
ran the insurance program until 2018. For example, FEMA could decide that insurance premiums should be
tied to a structure rather than a homeowner, so that annual limits on price increases would still be in effect
even if the house changed owners.

And experience suggests that home values keep increasing in the most desirable coastal areas despite rising
insurance costs, Mr. Wright said, because people‚Äôs desire to live near water is often unaffected by whether it
makes Ô¨Ånancial sense.

‚ÄúIs it going to depress property values?‚Äù said Mr. Wright, who now heads the Insurance Institute for Business
&amp; Home Safety, a research group. ‚ÄúIn attractive real estate markets, we haven‚Äôt seen that.‚Äù

Eli Lehrer, president of the R Street Institute, a research organization in Washington that advocates for
market-based policies, said the government could not ignore the Ô¨Ånancial burden facing people who already
live in Ô¨Çood-prone homes.

But rather than shielding those people by keeping insurance rates low, Mr. Lehrer argued that Congress
should offer direct subsidies, and only for people with modest incomes who would otherwise struggle to stay
in their homes. Everyone else, he said, should face the full cost of the risk they face.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been subsidizing people to live in areas that were dangerous when they moved there, and have
become more dangerous,‚Äù Mr. Lehrer said.

Institutions Have to Face Climate Change Reality, Top
OfÔ¨Åcial at Fed Says

By Jeanna Smialek

A top Federal Reserve ofÔ¨Åcial says climate scenario analysis could be valuable in making sure that banks
mind their climate-tied weak spots.

A top Federal Reserve ofÔ¨Åcial issued a stark warning on Thursday morning: Banks and other lenders need to
prepare themselves for the realities of a world racked by climate change, and regulators must play a key role
in ensuring that they do.

""Climate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to have a profound effect
on   the   economy   at   home   and   abroad,""   Lael   Brainard,   one   of   the   central   bank's   six   Washington-based
governors, said at an Institute of International Finance event.

""Financial institutions that do not put in place frameworks to measure, monitor and manage climate-related
risks could face outsized losses on climate-sensitive assets caused by environmental shifts, by a disorderly
transition to a low-carbon economy or by a combination of both,"" she continued.

The grim backdrop to her comments is the abnormally cold weather walloping Texas -- leaving millions
without electricity and underlining the fact that state and local authorities in some places are underprepared
for severe weather that is expected to become more frequent.

Such disruptions also matter for the Ô¨Ånancial system. They pose risks to insurers, can disrupt the payment
system and make otherwise reasonable Ô¨Ånancial bets dicey. That is why it is important for  the Fed   to
understand and plan for them, central bank ofÔ¨Åcials have increasingly said.

Ms. Brainard pointed out Thursday that Ô¨Ånancial companies were addressing the risk by ""responding to
investors' demands for climate-friendly portfolios,"" among other changes. But she added that regulators like
the Fed must also adapt. She raised the possibility that bank overseers might need new supervisory tools,
given the challenges associated with climate oversight, which include long time horizons and limited data
due to the lack of precedent.

""Scenario analysis may be a helpful tool"" to assess ""implications of climate-related risks under a wide range of
assumptions,"" Ms. Brainard said, though she was careful to distinguish that such scenarios would be distinct
from full-Ô¨Çedged stress tests.

Weighing in on climate risks publicly is new territory for the Fed. OfÔ¨Åcials spent years tiptoeing around the
topic, which is politically charged in the United States. The central bank only fully joined a global coalition
dedicated to research on girding the Ô¨Ånancial system against climate risk late last year. The possibility of
climate-tied stress tests has been especially contentious, and has recently drawn criticism from Republican
lawmakers.

""We   have   seen   banks   make   politically   motivated   and   public   relations-focused   decisions   to   limit   credit
availability   to   these   industries,""   more   than   40   House   Republican   lawmakers   said   in   a   December   letter,
speciÔ¨Åcally referring to coal, oil and gas. They added that ""climate change stress tests could perpetuate this
trend, allowing regulated banks to cite negative impacts on their supervisory tests as an excuse to defund or
divest from these crucial industries.""

Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Randal K. Quarles, the vice chair for supervision -- both named to their
jobs   by   President   Donald   J.   Trump   --   suggested   in   response   that   the   Fed   was   in   the   early   stages   of
researching its role in climate oversight.

""We would note that it has long been the policy of the Federal Reserve to not dictate to banks what lawful
industries they can and cannot serve, as those business decisions should be made solely by each institution,""

 





they wrote last month.


Mr. Powell and Mr. Quarles echoed the lawmakers' assertion that the Fed's bank stress tests measured bank
capital needs over a much shorter time frame than climate change, though they said the Fed was working
to help banks manage their risks, including those related to climate.

The central bank is quickly moving toward greater activism on the topic. Its Supervision Climate Committee,
announced last month, will work ""to develop an appropriate program"" to supervise banks's climate-related
risks, Ms. Brainard said Thursday. The Fed is also co-chair of a task force on climate-related Ô¨Ånancial risks at
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global regulatory group.

Though the central bank is politically independent, President Biden has placed climate at the center of his
administration's economic priorities. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen has pledged to ""Ô¨Åght the climate
crisis.""

Ms. Brainard, the Fed's last remaining governor appointed solely by President Barack Obama, has been a
leading voice in pushing for greater attention to climate issues, speaking on the matter at a conference in
2019. So has Mary C. Daly, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who held that conference.
(Mr. Powell was initially appointed by Mr. Obama, but then elevated to chair under Mr. Trump.)

""It is a fact that severe weather events are increasing,"" Ms. Daly said during a webcast event this week, noting
that ""half the country is in a winter storm, and then in the summer they'll be in a heat wave.""

She said the Fed needed to Ô¨Ågure out how to deal with potentially disruptive risks as they emerged given
that it is responsible for the nation&#39;s economic health, works with other regulators to protect the safety
of the Ô¨Ånancial system and is the steward of the payments system -- the guts of the Ô¨Ånancial system in
which money is transferred and checks are processed.

""We have to understand what the risks are, and think about how those risks can be mitigated,"" Ms. Daly said.
""Our responsibility is to look forward, and ask not just what is happening today, but what are the risks.""

U.S. formally rejoins the Paris climate accord.

By Elian Peltier and Somini Sengupta

The United States on Friday formally rejoined the Paris climate agreement, the international accord designed
to avert catastrophic global warming.

President   Biden   has   said   tackling   the   climate crisis   is   among   his   highest   priorities   and   he   signed   an
executive order recommitting the United States to the accord only hours after he was sworn into ofÔ¨Åce last
month.

‚ÄúWe can no longer delay or do the bare minimum to address climate change,‚Äù Mr. Biden said on Friday. ‚ÄúThis
is a global, existential crisis. And we‚Äôll all suffer the consequences if we fail.‚Äù

It was a sharp repudiation of the Trump administration, which had pulled the country out of the pact and
seemed eager to undercut regulations aimed at protecting the environment.

‚ÄúThe Paris Agreement is an unprecedented framework for global action,‚Äù Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken
said in a statement on Friday. ‚ÄúWe know because we helped design it and make it a reality.‚Äù

With some 189 countries joining the pact in 2016, it had broad international support and Mr. Biden‚Äôs move to
rejoin the effort was welcomed by foreign leaders.

‚ÄúWelcome back to the Paris Agreement!‚Äù Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, said in a Twitter
message at the time.

The galvanizing idea of the Paris climate accord is that only global solidarity and collective action can prevent
the ravages of climate change: hotter temperatures, rising sea levels, more powerful storms, or droughts
leading to food shortages.

President Biden has announced a plan to spend $2 trillion over four years to increase the use of clean
energies in transportation, electricity and building sectors, while rapidly moving away from coal, oil and gas.
He has set a goal of eliminating fossil fuel emissions from electricity generation by 2035 and has vowed to
put the entire United States economy on track to become carbon neutral by midcentury.

Former President Trump had announced in 2017 that the United States would withdraw from the Paris
agreement, but the exit could not be made ofÔ¨Åcial until Nov. 4 last year.

The United States was ofÔ¨Åcially out of the agreement for 107 days.

On Friday, Mr. Blinken said Ô¨Åghting climate change would be once again at the center of U.S. domestic and
foreign policy priorities.

‚ÄúClimate change and science diplomacy can never again be ‚Äòadd-ons‚Äô in our foreign policy discussions,‚Äù Mr.
Blinken said.

But, he added, ‚Äúas momentous as our joining the agreement was in 2016 ‚Äî and as momentous as our
rejoining is today ‚Äî what we do in the coming weeks, months, and years is even more important.‚Äù

Since the start of the industrial era, the United States has emitted more greenhouse gases than any other
country. And so, how the United States uses its money and power has both a symbolic and real bearing on
whether   the   world‚Äôs   roughly   7.6   billion   people,   and   especially   its   poorest,   will   be   able   to   avert   climate
catastrophes.

There are two immediate signals to watch for. First, how ambitious will the Biden administration be in its
emissions reductions targets? It is under pressure from advocacy groups to reduce emissions by 50 percent
by 2030, compared to 2005 levels.



And second, how much money will the United States provide to help poor countries adapt to the calamities

 



of global warming and shift their economies away from fossil fuels?


The answers to both are expected in the next few weeks, in time for the April 22 virtual climate summit that
President Biden has said he will host.

Frigid Weather and Global Warming

By David Leonhardt

And what else you need to know today.

Want to get The Morning by email? Here‚Äôs the sign-up.

Good morning. A Times reporter explains the connection between frigid weather and global warming.

Much of the PaciÔ¨Åc Northwest is blanketed in snow. Texas continues to endure frigid weather and electricity
outages. Another winter storm is spreading across much of the country. Today, snow or freezing rain may fall
on Washington, New York and Boston.

To make sense of this week‚Äôs cold spell and storms, I spoke with John Schwartz, a Times reporter who focuses
on the climate. Our conversation follows.

Question: Let‚Äôs start with a simple question on some people‚Äôs minds ‚Äî How do you think about record-low
temperatures hammering parts of the U.S. at the same time that we‚Äôre experiencing global warming?

John Schwartz: It does sound counterintuitive! Those who deny climate science love to declare that there‚Äôs
no such thing as climate change whenever the weather turns cold. But weather remains variable, and cold
weather in winter still happens, even if the overall warming trend means that winters are getting milder.

Q: And is there any relationship between this week‚Äôs storms and climate change? I noticed that the climate
scientist Katharine Hayhoe uses the phrase ‚Äúglobal weirding.‚Äù

John: There‚Äôs interesting science that suggests the effects of a warming world have something to do with
these sudden bursts of Arctic cold, as well. The cold air at the top of the world, the polar vortex, is usually held
in place by the circulating jet stream. The Northern Hemisphere‚Äôs warming appears to be weakening the jet
stream, and when sudden blasts of heat in the stratosphere punch into the vortex, that Arctic air can spill
down into the middle latitudes.

Q: Are there any other changing patterns of winter weather that may be connected to climate change?

John: A warming atmosphere can hold more moisture, so when you do get storms you can expect to see
heavier rain and snow. There‚Äôs also fascinating research that links a warming Arctic to increased frequency of
the broad range of extreme winter weather in parts of the United States. It‚Äôs known as ‚Äúwarm-Arctic/cold-
continents pattern,‚Äù a phenomenon that‚Äôs still being studied.

Q: What are the recent weather trends ‚Äî during winter or not ‚Äî where the evidence most strongly suggests
climate change is playing a role?

John: In the United States, we‚Äôre seeing longer wildÔ¨Åre seasons because of hotter, drier conditions, and our
hurricanes are becoming more destructive in several ways, including Ô¨Çooding and storm surge. It‚Äôs even
worsening the misery of pollen season. We‚Äôve always had Ô¨Çoods, Ô¨Åres and storms, but climate change adds
oomph to many weather events.

I realize I‚Äôm repeating myself here, but scientists are still hashing out all of this. While the science underlying
the links between human emissions and climate change is rock solid, some of the particulars, such as
whether climate change will cause us to see more frequent blasts from the polar vortex, are still being
debated. And that‚Äôs as it should be.

For more: Bill Gates tells The Times that ‚Äú‚ÄòWeather for Dummies‚Äô is probably the best book written for a
general audience‚Äù about the relationship between climate change and the weather.

Storm developments:



Hundreds of thousands of Texans are still without power, with more frigid temperatures expected into the

 



weekend.The crisis is a warning: As climate change  accelerates,   extreme  weather   events   will   put   many
electrical grids at risk of failure.Access to safe water is also a problem, with seven million people in Texas
under a boil water advisory.Freezing natural gas pipelines largely caused the state‚Äôs widespread electricity
failure. Fossil fuel advocates, including the governor, still tried to shift blame.


‚ÄúI‚Äôve been through Katrina, I‚Äôve been through Harvey, and this is by far the worst I‚Äôve ever seen it,‚Äù a hotel
manager in Austin said.

As winter wallops the South, a Fed ofÔ¨Åcial warns climate

A top Federal Reserve ofÔ¨Åcial delivered a stark warning on Thursday morning: Banks and other lenders need

the Fed must also adapt. She raised the possibility that bank overseers may need new supervisory tools
because of the challenges of climate oversight, which include long time horizons and limited precedent.

‚ÄúScenario analysis may be a helpful tool‚Äù to assess ‚Äúimplications of climate-related risks under a wide range of
assumptions,‚Äù Ms. Brainard said, making it clear that scenarios would be distinct from full-Ô¨Çedged stress
tests.

She noted that the Fed‚Äôs Supervision Climate Committee, which was announced last month, would work ‚Äúto
develop an appropriate program‚Äù to supervise banks‚Äôs climate-related risks. The Fed is also co-chair of a task
force on climate-related Ô¨Ånancial risks at the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global regulatory
group.

Weighing in on climate risks publicly is new territory new for the Fed. OfÔ¨Åcials spent years tiptoeing around
the topic, which is politically charged in the United States. The central bank only fully joined a global coalition
dedicated to research on girding the Ô¨Ånancial system against climate risk late last year, and it has recently
seen pushback from Republican lawmakers over the possibility of climate-tied bank stress tests.

As FEMA sends aid, the White House warns that America is
not ready for climate change.

By Thomas Kaplan

As   Texas   continues   to   struggle   with   cold   weather,   power   outages   and   water   shortages,   the   Federal
Emergency   Management   Agency   has   made   available   60   generators   and   fuel   for   critical   locations   like
hospitals and water facilities, a White House ofÔ¨Åcial said on Thursday.

The agency has also provided 729,000 liters of water, 225,000 meals and tens of thousands of blankets,
according to the ofÔ¨Åcial, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, the White House homeland security adviser.

Later Thursday, the White House announced that President Biden had declared an emergency in Louisiana,
following emergency declarations for Texas and Oklahoma.

Speaking   to   reporters   earlier   in   the   day,   Ms.   Sherwood-Randall   said   this   week‚Äôs   extreme   weather
demonstrated again that ‚Äúclimate change is real and it‚Äôs happening now, and we‚Äôre not adequately prepared
for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn particular, power grids across our country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are
placed on them under these circumstances, and the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme
conditions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGoing forward, we will be leading an effort to strengthen and harden our critical
infrastructure so that it can be prepared to meet the full spectrum of challenges that we‚Äôre likely to face in
the future.‚Äù

A Glimpse of America‚Äôs Future: Climate Change Means
Trouble for Power Grids

By Brad Plumer

Systems are designed to handle spikes in demand, but the wild and unpredictable weather linked to global
warming will very likely push grids beyond their limits.

Huge winter storms plunged large parts of the central and southern United States into an energy crisis this
week, with frigid blasts of Arctic weather crippling electric grids and leaving millions of Americans without
power amid dangerously cold temperatures.

The grid failures were most severe in Texas, where more than four million people woke up Tuesday morning
to rolling blackouts. Separate regional grids in the Southwest and Midwest also faced serious strain. As of
Tuesday afternoon, at least 23 people nationwide had died in the storm or its aftermath.

Analysts have begun to identify key factors behind the grid failures in Texas. Record-breaking cold weather
spurred residents to crank up their electric heaters and pushed power demand beyond the worst-case
scenarios that grid operators had planned for. At the same time, a large fraction of the state‚Äôs gas-Ô¨Åred
power plants were knocked ofÔ¨Çine amid icy conditions, with some plants suffering fuel shortages as natural
gas demand spiked. Many of Texas‚Äô wind turbines also froze and stopped working.

The crisis sounded an alarm for power systems throughout the country. Electric grids can be engineered to
handle a wide range of severe conditions ‚Äî as long as grid operators can reliably predict the dangers ahead.
But as climate change accelerates, many electric grids will face extreme weather events that go far beyond
the historical conditions those systems were designed for, putting them at risk of catastrophic failure.

While scientists are still analyzing what role human-caused climate change may have played in this week‚Äôs
winter   storms,   it   is   clear   that   global warming   poses   a   barrage   of   additional   threats   to   power   systems
nationwide, including Ô¨Åercer heat waves and water shortages.

Measures that could help make electric grids more robust ‚Äî such as fortifying power plants against extreme
weather, or installing more backup power sources ‚Äî could prove expensive. But as Texas shows, blackouts
can be extremely costly, too. And, experts said, unless grid planners start planning for increasingly wild and
unpredictable climate conditions, grid failures will happen again and again.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs essentially a question of how much insurance you want to buy,‚Äù said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems
engineer at Princeton University. ‚ÄúWhat makes this problem even harder is that we‚Äôre now in a world where,
especially with climate change, the past is no longer a good guide to the future. We have to get much better
at preparing for the unexpected.‚Äù

A System Pushed to the Limit

Texas‚Äô main electric grid, which largely operates independently from the rest of the country, has been built
with the state‚Äôs most common weather extremes in mind: soaring summer temperatures that cause millions
of Texans to turn up their air-conditioners all at once.

While freezing weather is rarer, grid operators in Texas have also long known that electricity demand can
spike in the winter, particularly after damaging cold snaps in 2011 and 2018. But this week‚Äôs winter storms,
which buried the state in snow and ice, and led to record-cold temperatures, surpassed all expectations ‚Äî
and pushed the grid to its breaking point.

Texas‚Äô grid operators had anticipated that, in the worst case, the state would use 67 gigawatts of electricity
during the winter peak. But by Sunday evening, power demand had surged past that level. As temperatures
dropped, many homes were relying on older, inefÔ¨Åcient electric heaters that consume more power.



The problems compounded from there, with frigid weather on Monday disabling power plants with capacity

 



totaling more than 30 gigawatts. The vast majority of those failures occurred at thermal power plants, like
natural gas generators, as plummeting temperatures paralyzed plant equipment and soaring demand for
natural gas left some plants struggling to obtain sufÔ¨Åcient fuel. A number of the state‚Äôs power plants were
also ofÔ¨Çine for scheduled maintenance in preparation for the summer peak.


The state‚Äôs Ô¨Çeet of wind farms also lost up to 4.5 gigawatts of capacity at times, as many turbines stopped
working in cold and icy conditions, though this was a smaller part of the problem.

In essence, experts said, an electric grid optimized to deliver huge quantities of power on the hottest days of
the year was caught unprepared when temperatures plummeted.

While analysts are still working to untangle all of the reasons behind Texas‚Äô grid failures, some have also
wondered whether the unique way the state manages its largely deregulated electricity system may have
played a role. In the mid-1990s, for instance, Texas decided against paying energy producers to hold a Ô¨Åxed
number of backup power plants in reserve, instead letting market forces dictate what happens on the grid.

On Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott called for an emergency reform of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the
nonproÔ¨Åt   corporation   that   oversees   the   Ô¨Çow   of   power   in   the   state,   saying   its   performance   had   been
‚Äúanything but reliable‚Äù over the previous 48 hours.

‚ÄòA DifÔ¨Åcult Balancing Act‚Äô

In theory, experts said, there are technical solutions that can avert such problems.

Wind turbines can be equipped with heaters and other devices so that they can operate in icy conditions ‚Äî
as is often done in the upper Midwest, where cold weather is more common. Gas plants can be built to store
oil on-site and switch over to burning the fuel if needed, as is often done in the Northeast, where natural gas
shortages are common. Grid regulators can design markets that pay extra to keep a larger Ô¨Çeet of backup
power plants in reserve in case of emergencies, as is done in the Mid-Atlantic.

But these solutions all cost money, and grid operators are often wary of forcing consumers to pay extra for
safeguards.

‚ÄúBuilding in resilience often comes at a cost, and there‚Äôs a risk of both underpaying but also of overpaying,‚Äù
said Daniel Cohan, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Rice University. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a
difÔ¨Åcult balancing act.‚Äù

In the months ahead, as Texas grid operators and policymakers investigate this week‚Äôs blackouts, they will
likely explore how the grid might be bolstered to handle extremely cold weather. Some possible ideas
include: Building more connections between Texas and other states to balance electricity supplies, a move
the   state   has   long   resisted;   encouraging   homeowners   to   install   battery   backup   systems;   or   keeping
additional power plants in reserve.

The search for answers will be complicated by climate change. Over all, the state is getting warmer as global
temperatures rise, and cold-weather extremes are, on average, becoming less common over time.

But   some   climate   scientists   have   also   suggested   that   global warming   could,   paradoxically,   bring   more
unusually Ô¨Åerce winter storms. Some research indicates that Arctic warming is weakening the jet stream, the
high-level air current that circles the northern latitudes and usually holds back the frigid polar vortex. This
can allow cold air to periodically escape to the South, resulting in episodes of bitter cold in places that rarely
get nipped by frost.

But this remains an active area of debate among climate scientists, with some experts less certain that polar
vortex disruptions are becoming more frequent, making it even trickier for electricity planners to anticipate
the dangers ahead.

All   over   the   country,   utilities   and   grid   operators   are   confronting   similar   questions,   as   climate change
threatens to intensify heat waves, Ô¨Çoods, water shortages and other calamities, all of which could create
novel risks for the nation‚Äôs electricity systems. Adapting to those risks could carry a hefty price tag: One
recent study found that the Southeast alone may need 35 percent more electric capacity by 2050 simply to
deal with the known hazards of climate change.

And  the   task   of  building   resilience   is  becoming   increasingly  urgent.   Many   policymakers  are   promoting
electric cars and electric heating as a way of curbing greenhouse gas emissions. But as more of the nation‚Äôs
economy depends on reliable Ô¨Çows of electricity, the cost of blackouts will become ever more dire.

 





‚ÄúThis is going to be a signiÔ¨Åcant challenge,‚Äù said Emily Grubert, an infrastructure expert at Georgia Tech. ‚ÄúWe
need to decarbonize our power systems so that climate change doesn‚Äôt keep getting worse, but we also
need to adapt to changing conditions at the same time. And the latter alone is going to be very costly. We
can already see that the systems we have today aren‚Äôt handling this very well.‚Äù

Climate change may explain frigid weather so far south,
experts say.

By John Schwartz

The notion that the global phenomenon of a hotter planet could be sending a shocking cold wave into the
southern United States might seem nonsensical. And every cold snap can be counted on to elicit quips and
stunts from those who deny the science of climate change.

But the weather patterns that send freezing air from the polar vortex plunging all the way to the Gulf Coast
could, like other forms of extreme weather, be linked to global warming ‚Äî which is why the climate scientist
Katharine Hayhoe prefers the phrase ‚Äúglobal weirding.‚Äù

Winter   storms   are   inÔ¨Çuenced   by   many   factors,   including   the   natural   variability   that   affects   all   weather
systems. The planet‚Äôs warming could be part of that icy blend, even while climate change is making winters
milder over all.

The air that usually sits over the Arctic is now sweeping down South because of changes to the jet stream,
the high-level air current that circles the Northern Hemisphere and usually holds back the frigid polar vortex.

Of course, bitter cold from the polar vortex has long been a part of the North American weather picture. Dr.
Amy Butler, a research scientist at the NOAA Chemical Sciences Laboratory, has said that she has yet to Ô¨Ånd
any  long-term   trend   in   polar   vortex  disruptions,   which  ‚Äúoccur   naturally   even   in  the  absence  of  climate
change.‚Äù

But Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, has
identiÔ¨Åed general trends in winter storms. He was an author of a paper last year in the journal Nature
Climate Change that found a sharp increase in Northeast winter storms from 2008 to 2018.

‚ÄúSevere winter weather is much more frequent when the Arctic is warmest,‚Äù Dr. Cohen said, adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not
in spite of climate change, but related to climate change.‚Äù

The current storm ‚Äúcould be one of the most costly natural disasters of the year,‚Äù he said, in part because of
its unusual geography: ‚ÄúTexas, which is known for hurricanes, is not known for snow and cold damage‚Äù like
burst water pipes.

Climate Activist Jailed in India as Government Clamps
Down on Dissent

By Sameer Yasir

Disha Ravi, 21, is facing sedition charges, accused of sharing a Google Doc about the farmers protest with
Greta Thunberg.

Before anyone outside her hometown knew her name, Disha Ravi spent four years raising awareness among
young people in Bangalore about the effects of climate change.

Now the 21-year-old activist is jailed in New Delhi. The allegation: She distributed a ‚Äútool kit‚Äù in the form of a
Google Doc containing talking points and contact information for inÔ¨Çuential groups to drum up support for
farmers who have been protesting against the Indian government for months.

The document ‚Äî which the police say she shared with Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish climate
activist   ‚Äî   resembles   the   kind   that   grass-roots   organizations   around   the   world   have   used   for   years   to
campaign for their causes.

But Ms. Ravi, the police contend, was using it to ‚Äúspread disaffection against the Indian State.‚Äù

The arrest, the latest in a series of broader crackdown on activists, has triggered anger and disbelief among
opposition politicians, student groups and lawyers, who say the government is using its law enforcement
agencies to increasingly stiÔ¨Çe dissent, in line with a broader deterioration of free speech in India. Ms. Ravi‚Äôs
arrest, they said, has raised the crackdown to a new level.

‚ÄúThere   is   a   method   to   this   madness,‚Äù   said   Manshi   Asher,   a   researcher   with   the   nonproÔ¨Åt   group
Environmental Justice, ‚Äúand a pattern that is so clearly telling us that those asking critical questions would be
silenced.‚Äù

Ms. Ravi is being held under a stringent sedition law that has been used to criminalize everything from
leading rallies to posting political messages on social media. Although she has not been formally charged,
she is to spend Ô¨Åve days in police custody.

In its response to other contentious policies ‚Äî including citizenship laws that worked against Muslims, a
clampdown on the disputed Kashmir region and the farmers‚Äô protests ‚Äî Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs
government has resorted to arrests, stiÔ¨Çing dissenting voices and blocking access to the internet. Groups
that track internet freedom say India‚Äôs has declined for a third consecutive year.

For months, thousands of farmers, many of them Sikhs from the agricultural heartland state of Punjab, have
camped out on the outskirts of New Delhi, protesting a slate of new laws that will dismantle a subsidy
system that has for decades protected them from the vagaries of the free market.

The protests have been largely peaceful. But on India‚Äôs Republic Day, as Mr. Modi watched a military parade
in central Delhi, farmers streamed into the city, using tractors to remove barricades. Clashes with police left
dozens injured. One farmer was killed when his tractor Ô¨Çipped over near India‚Äôs Supreme Court.

Members of Mr. Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party used the incident to claim the farmers‚Äô protest had been
hijacked by Sikh separatists. The farmers, in turn, say the violence last month was the result of a government
conspiracy to derail their movement.

The police opened an investigation into the violence and on Saturday they raided Ms. Ravi‚Äôs home in the
southern city of Bangalore, bringing her to Delhi.

On Sunday, Ms. Ravi appeared in court without a lawyer, telling the judge that she had edited two lines of the
Google Doc, but had not disseminated it.



‚ÄúThey are the ones who are providing us with our food,‚Äù she told the court, referring to the farmers. ‚ÄúAnd we

 



all need to eat.‚Äù The document described why Indian farmers were protesting, and included links to the
websites of organizations focused on agricultural issues worldwide.


Ms. Thunberg initially tweeted a link to the ‚Äútool kit,‚Äù which Indian authorities say was proof the young
Swedish activist is part of an international conspiracy against India. The tweet was later deleted.

Ms. Ravi‚Äôs career as an activist could be described as passionate, but fairly limited.

When she was 18, she led a campaign to clean Bangalore‚Äôs lakes and parks. She started a reforestation drive,
and organized vegan picnics to educate young people about the impacts of climate change.

Ms. Ravi was inspired to join the farmers‚Äô movement because of her grandparents, farmers whom she saw
struggle to tend land battered by both drought and downpours.

‚ÄúHer day starts with educating people about climate change,‚Äù Ms. Ravi‚Äôs friend Yuvan Aves said, ‚Äúand it ends
at speaking for politically and marginalized groups.‚Äù

Tamanna Sengupta, a climate activist who has worked with Ms. Ravi, said the government arrested Ms. Ravi
because they wanted to make her an example and dissuade others from helping farmers in their struggle.

‚ÄúThey will soon come for the protesting children,‚Äù she said.

Emily Schmall contributed reporting.

Winter Storm Brings Icy Temperatures and Cuts Power
Across U.S.

By Rick Rojas and Marie Fazio

At   least   2.5   million   customers,   most   of   them   in   Texas,   had   lost   electricity   by   early   Monday   as   weather
advisories extended from coast to coast.

NASHVILLE ‚Äî A coast-to-coast winter storm swept from Oregon and Washington to the Southeast on
Sunday, part of a frigid weather pattern that created record low temperatures in Minnesota and a 100-vehicle
trafÔ¨Åc pileup in Texas and that is now producing dangerous conditions across much of the country because
of heavy snowfall, perilous ice and dangerously low temperatures.

The National Weather Service said early Monday that at least 150 million Americans were under ice or winter
weather advisories. Hundreds of thousands of people were without power. Trucks slid off highways and cars
piled   up   on   ice-coated   roads.   As   the   storm   continued   to   intensify,   ofÔ¨Åcials   urged   residents   to   brace
themselves.

‚ÄúThe time to prepare for this storm was yesterday,‚Äù the National Weather Service in Texas said in an ominous
warning issued on Sunday.

By Sunday, the storm‚Äôs reach had already spanned the country. Just over 11 inches of snow fell in Seattle, and
a record low temperature ‚Äî minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit ‚Äî was set in one part of Minnesota. As the storm
pushed into Texas, it was expected to deliver the kind of sustained cold and icy conditions rarely seen in
places where winter tends to come as more of a glancing blow.

‚ÄúThis will be probably more snow over a larger swath of land to a higher degree than ever before in Texas
history,‚Äù Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said at a news conference. On Friday, he issued a disaster declaration for
all 254 counties.

Power failures plagued a number of states by early Monday. In Texas, at least two million customers had lost
power, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates data from utilities across the country. Some of the
outages were intentionally imposed and could last throughout the morning, according to the operator of the
state‚Äôs electricity grid, which faced record demand as wind chills were expected to reach minus 10 degrees.

Elsewhere, about 300,000 customers in Oregon and 150,000 in Virginia were also without electricity.

Across the storm‚Äôs path, ofÔ¨Åcials told people to run any last errands and make Ô¨Ånal preparations by Sunday
morning. In Nashville, forecasters told residents to avoid the roads if possible, and to ‚Äúdrive this morning the
way you did when you drove your newborn home from the hospital.‚Äù

The Texas Department of Transportation warned drivers to prepare for ‚Äúa marathon of historically cold air‚Äù
over the next few days that could make driving dangerous.

The   dangers   quickly   became   evident:   West   of   Odessa,   Texas,   as   many   as   25   vehicles,   including   some
eighteen-wheelers, were involved in crashes. In Oklahoma, a pileup northeast of Oklahoma City led to several
semi trucks catching on Ô¨Åre, the authorities said. A livestream video captured footage of overturned trucks
with smoke billowing from them.

‚ÄúEverybody in this state should have several collective goals over the next few days, one of which should be
that we will not replicate what happened in Fort Worth,‚Äù Mr. Abbott told reporters, referring to the pileup on
Thursday on Interstate 35 involving more than 100 vehicles that led to six deaths and dozens of injuries.

The conditions stemmed from a strong high pressure system that came from the Arctic Circle, bringing in
some of the lowest temperatures that parts of the country have experienced in years, said Michael J. Ventrice,
a meteorological scientist with IBM.



That allowed for energy to bring a ‚Äúa very impactful winter storm‚Äù from Texas up through the Gulf States

 



from Louisiana all the way up to the Northeast, he said.


After bringing heavy snow across the mountains and lowlands of Washington and Oregon, with signiÔ¨Åcant
icing in northwest Oregon on Saturday, the storm was expected to deepen in the Southern Plains, the
Weather Service said.

It was expected to shift into the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and upward into the Northeast
through Tuesday. The temperatures in the middle of the country were expected to approach record lows. In
Oklahoma City, the temperature on Tuesday is forecast to be minus 9 degrees; the record low of minus 17
degrees was set in 1899.

Temperatures in parts of Oklahoma were 40 degrees lower than usual for this time of year, the National
Weather Service said. The duration of the cold conditions is also unusual: Oklahoma may experience nine
consecutive days of temperatures below 20 degrees, the Weather Service said.

Most warnings for the storm should expire by Wednesday, but Mr. Ventrice warned that another winter
storm with a similar path appeared to be ‚Äúright on its heels‚Äù and was expected to form on Wednesday.

Winter storms are inÔ¨Çuenced by many factors, but the planet‚Äôs warming appears to be part of that icy blend
‚Äî even while climate change is making winters milder over all. The air that sits over the Arctic is now
sweeping down into the southern United States, as a result of a weakened jet stream, which circulates
around the pole and usually holds in the frigid air of the polar vortex.

But there is evidence that planetary warming is weakening the jet stream and allowing the cold air to escape
to the south ‚Äî especially when a blast of additional warming strikes the stratosphere and deforms the
vortex. The result can be plunging temperatures, even in places that rarely get nipped by frost.

‚ÄúThis could be one of the most costly natural disasters of the year,‚Äù said Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal
forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, a company that provides information to clients
about weather and climate-related risk. ‚ÄúTexas, which is known for hurricanes, is not known for snow and
cold damage‚Äù such as burst water pipes, he said, and ‚Äúit‚Äôs not in spite of climate change, but related to
climate change.‚Äù

In Texas, Austin was locked down for the worst winter storm in a generation. Tree branches laden with icicles
bowed toward the ground. Parked cars were covered by sheets of ice. The city with palm trees and typically
mild weather braced for possibly more than Ô¨Åve inches of snow, an amount not seen since 1966.

The parking lot at a grocery store in San Antonio was full as shoppers grabbed last-minute items before the
market closed four hours early.

For Zoe Waldron, 30, the polar vortex and gray sky made her nostalgic for La Conner, Wash., her hometown.
But in San Antonio? ‚ÄúIt feels like a once-in-a-lifetime event,‚Äù she said.

Ms. Waldron‚Äôs boyfriend, Patrick Attwater, 34, drove to the couple‚Äôs house in Austin on Saturday to heat it to
65 degrees and to let the faucets drip, insurance against burst pipes as temperatures were forecast to dip as
low as single digits on Sunday night, forecasters said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Kansas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen we look at our family
up there, it‚Äôs minus 20, so we feel luckier here.‚Äù

Parts of the Gulf Coast in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are quite familiar with brutal weather: hurricanes,
Ô¨Çoods, thick summer heat. But single-digit temperatures and ice-slicked roads were something different
entirely.

In Mississippi, ofÔ¨Åcials told residents they would probably need to stay off the roads until at least Tuesday.
They cautioned that the local authorities there were not as equipped as those in Northern states that
regularly encounter such wintry conditions.

‚ÄúWe have some plows on our trucks, but it‚Äôs not the kind like you have up North that is really designed to put
weight on that plow and dig down and get it off of the roadway,‚Äù said Melinda McGrath, the executive
director of the Mississippi Department of Transportation. ‚ÄúWe do not invest in those because this only occurs
like once every Ô¨Åve years or so.‚Äù

Business   owners   were   looking   at   forecasts   and   deciding   whether   to   close.   Jeff   Good,   who   owns   three
restaurants in and around Jackson, Miss., said two of his restaurants remained open Sunday night, but the
third,   a   bakery   that   opens   early,   would   certainly   be   closed   on   Monday.   ‚ÄúWith   the   weather   tonight   at
midnight, we just can‚Äôt see how we can do a 6 o‚Äôclock in the morning opening,‚Äù Mr. Good said.

 





Valentine‚Äôs Day celebrations had already been curtailed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, plans
had to be dialed back even more.


Deidre Head, 50, of Jackson said she and her husband had made ‚Äútentative plans‚Äù for a picnic brunch, but
their favorite restaurants were closing early or not offering curbside pickup. Instead, Ms. Head said the couple
‚Äúsettled for a lovely Valentine‚Äôs Day brunch in the parking lot of McDonald‚Äôs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou get what you can get,‚Äù she said.

But even that was disrupted: Rain and sleet started pouring down, so they gave up and went home.

Biden's Climate Team, Aiming to Restore 'Credibility,' Begins
Tackling New Goals

By Lisa Friedman

The high-level group's Ô¨Årst meeting focused on job creation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

WASHINGTON -- Vice President Kamala Harris and White House aides convened cabinet secretaries and the
acting heads of 21 federal agencies on Thursday to begin fulÔ¨Ålling President Biden's promise to mobilize the
entire federal government to confront climate change.

Gina McCarthy, who heads the White House ofÔ¨Åce of climate policy, said Thursday's meeting focused on job-
creation as well as ensuring that agency leaders understood their role in helping to set an aggressive new
target for cutting the United States' share of global emissions. The Biden administration wants to announce
those goals on April 22.

""Over the past four years we have not earned a lot of credibility on climate,"" Ms. McCarthy, who led Thursday's
meeting, said in an interview, adding, ""It's time we turn that around.""

The National Climate Task Force, which Mr. Biden created as part of a series of executive actions during his
Ô¨Årst week in ofÔ¨Åce, is meant to meet regularly to chart progress on a series of administration goals including
eliminating fossil fuel emissions from the electricity sector by 2035; transitioning federal, state and local
government Ô¨Çeets to zero-emissions vehicles; and increasing conservation while also increasing renewable
energy production on public land and waters.

Mr. Biden campaigned on a pledge to reach net-zero emissions across the economy before 2050, and to
eliminate fossil fuel pollution from the electricity sector by 2035.

Mr.   Biden   has   made   the   case   that   tackling   climate change   by   focusing   on   building   clean   energy
infrastructure will bring economic recovery and create ""millions"" of new jobs -- a goal economists said faces
serious challenges.

At Thursday's meeting the task force started a new working group to focus on speciÔ¨Åc challenges, such as
creating energy storage at a fraction of the current cost and developing sustainable fuels for aircraft and
ships. The administration announced $280 million in combined Energy and Transportation Department
grant opportunities for technology development.

The   talks   took   place   via   Zoom   among   about   50   people,   including   Treasury   Secretary   Janet   Yellen   and
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, as well as deputies for agencies still waiting for the Senate to
conÔ¨Årm their leaders, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department.

Ali A. Zaidi, the White House deputy national climate adviser, said the goal was a ""redeÔ¨Ånition of the way
government can operate in the face of great crises,"" like climate change.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry, now Mr. Biden's global envoy for climate change, spoke to the task
force about the upcoming international negotiations in which the United States, which once again is part of
the Paris Agreement, will take part.

The Obama administration pledged to cut America's emissions up to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.
Former President Donald J. Trump withdrew from the Paris accord and ended all federal efforts to try to
meet that target, leaving the country about halfway to the goal. Mr. Biden will be expected to put forward an
even more aggressive goal that he believes the nation can meet by 2030.

The administration intends to announce that new emissions target at a global leaders' climate summit that
it will host on April 22.



""We're going to look at every opportunity we have to capture the reductions we can defend,"" Ms. McCarthy

Janet Yellen says the U.S. will rebuild alliances and refocus
on climate change.

By Alan Rappeport

Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen told the world‚Äôs top economic ofÔ¨Åcials on Friday that the United States
intended to deepen international alliances and re-engage in the Ô¨Åght against climate change.

Ms. Yellen‚Äôs comments came during her Ô¨Årst Group of 7 meeting in her role as Treasury secretary and
reÔ¨Çected the Biden administration‚Äôs efforts to embrace the types of multilateral institutions that the Trump
administration tended to hold in low regard. The meeting of the leading industrial nations, which was held
virtually, came as the global economy continues to grapple with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic
and as countries are racing to deploy vaccines.

The United States ‚Äúplaces a high priority on deepening our international engagement and strengthening our
alliances,‚Äù Ms. Yellen said.

Ms.   Yellen  told  Ô¨Ånance   ministers   and   central   bank   governors   of   the   G7   that  further   Ô¨Åscal   support   was
needed, saying, ‚ÄúThe need to go big is now,‚Äù according to a summary of her remarks provided by the
Treasury Department. The sentiment echoes what Ms. Yellen has told lawmakers in the United States as
President Biden looks to push a $1.9 trillion stimulus package.

Ms. Yellen highlighted climate change as an issue where the United States will resume a position as a global
leader, noting, ‚ÄúWe understand the crucial role that the United States must play in the global climate effort.‚Äù
She indicated that the Treasury‚Äôs engagement on the issue would change substantially from the stance
taken by her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin.

At a Group of 20 summit meeting a year ago, Mr. Mnuchin resisted the inclusion of the phrase ‚Äúclimate
change‚Äù in a joint statement that was drafted at the conclusion of the meeting.

Ms. Yellen plans to appoint a senior climate ofÔ¨Åcial at the Treasury Department and create a hub within the
agency to focus on policies that will combat climate change.

The G7 is being hosted by Britain this year. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said climate
considerations should be a central part of the group‚Äôs agenda this year with a goal of a ‚Äútruly green economic
recovery.‚Äù

True Crime With a Climate Connection

The shift toward cleaner cars, combined with tighter pollution rules, is pushing up demand for the precious
metals in automobile antipollution gadgets. Crooks have taken note.

We‚Äôre also covering a deadly Ô¨Çash Ô¨Çood in the Himalayas and new research that shows allergy season is
getting worse.

Automakers are starting to get more serious about the transition to electric vehicles, and that means they‚Äôre
going to need rechargeable batteries. Lots of them.

To make those batteries, you need speciÔ¨Åc precious metals. And they‚Äôre getting more expensive. The price of
one, rhodium, has gone from about $640 an ounce Ô¨Åve years ago to a record $21,900 an ounce this year.

That steep increase isn‚Äôt only because of demand from battery producers. The rare metals are also used in
the catalytic converters that help to scrub emissions from traditional gas-powered car and truck tailpipes.
That means increasingly strict emissions rules are also increasing demand.

It also means that theft is rising sharply across the country.

In order to steal the rhodium and other metals, thieves are slithering under those vehicles in parking lots and
driveways around the country and hacking off the catalytic converters.

You can read more in this article, and tell us what you think in the comments section.

The bad news: Unless you‚Äôre fully insured, replacing a catalytic converter and Ô¨Åxing the damage thieves can
cause when they steal the device could set you back $2000 dollars or more in repairs.

The silver lining: Fully electric vehicles don‚Äôt require catalytic converters. So, once the country switches fully to
plug-in cars, you won‚Äôt need to worry about a thief swiping yours in the wee hours of the morning.

More: Our colleague Neal E. Boudette discussed the future of cars and whether traditional automakers or
tech companies, like Tesla and Apple, would rule the roads.

A very bad mix: mountains, ice and climate change

A Ô¨Çash Ô¨Çood killed dozens of people and left hundreds missing in the Indian part of the Himalayas on
Sunday. It was far from the Ô¨Årst such disaster to occur among the world‚Äôs high-mountain glaciers and, in a
world with a changing climate, it won‚Äôt be the last.

Glaciers around the world are shrinking and thinning, and that means water is being released. And it has to
go somewhere.

In the Himalayas, as elsewhere, some is trapped in lakes as it runs down mountainsides, dammed by rocky
debris   the   glaciers   leave   behind.   When   those   dams   break,   from   earthquakes   or   just   the   weight   of
accumulating water, the result can be a sudden, catastrophic burst of water that can wipe out communities
in valleys downstream. ‚Äî Henry Fountain

The big picture: Glacial retreat is happening in mountain ranges around the world and has been measured,
sometimes at a rate of 100 feet or more each year. In the Himalayas, the world‚Äôs most glaciated mountains
and home to about 600 billion tons of ice, the rate of retreat has accelerated over the past four decades.

Get the eye drops. Allergy season is getting worse.

Climate change is contributing to disasters around the world, like that Ô¨Çood in India over the weekend. But it
causes smaller, more personal bouts of misery, too. And scientists have now identiÔ¨Åed one: Climate change is
making pollen season longer.



That‚Äôs the message of a new study this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
What‚Äôs more, researchers said, the trend of higher pollen counts is accelerating. ‚Äî John Schwartz

 



The numbers: According to the paper, warmer air and higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
means springtime in North America has 21 percent more pollen than just a few decades ago.


Where: The most pronounced effects were seen in Texas, the Midwest and the Southeast.

Also important this week:

China‚Äôs emissions: New research conÔ¨Årmed that emissions of CFCs, a banned gas that harms Earth‚Äôs ozone
layer, have fallen sharply after dangerous spike.

A surprise in Africa: Air quality is improving in one of the continent‚Äôs fastest-growing regions, according to a
study. Usually, economic expansion means more pollution.Coal use falls: The share of energy generated from
coal   dropped   more   sharply   during   the   coronavirus   pandemic   than   that   of   any   other   power   source,
researchers found.Lost and found in Antarctica: A meteorologist lost his wallet at McMurdo Station in the
1960s. He just got it back.Island feud: The PaciÔ¨Åc Islands Forum is on the brink of collapse because of a
leadership dispute. The regional group has long been a megaphone on climate change.Climate anxiety: If
you‚Äôre feeling it, you‚Äôre not alone. Distress over global warming is increasing, but formal and informal support
networks are springing up, too.Lives lived: Paul Crutzen, a Nobel laureate who fought climate change, is dead
at 87. He warned the world of threats that certain chemicals posed to the ozone layer.

And Ô¨Ånally, we recommend:

Life on Venus? The picture gets cloudier

A team of astronomers made a blockbuster claim in the fall. They said they‚Äôd discovered evidence of a
molecule called phosphine on Venus, compelling evidence pointing to life Ô¨Çoating in the clouds of the
planet.

The members of the team are still certain of their Ô¨Åndings today, even after lowering their estimates of how
much phosphine may be present. At the same time, many of their peers remain just as resolute in their
doubts.

The debate could linger, unresolved, for years, much like past disputed claims for evidence of life on Mars.
But, if true, the Ô¨Ånding would be stunning.

‚ÄúFurther observations are warranted,‚Äù said Bryan Butler of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in
Socorro, N.M. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing you can point to that says, ‚ÄòOh, yeah, we absolutely see phosphine on Venus.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, you know, it‚Äôs tantalizing,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI would not bet my life savings that it‚Äôs not there.‚Äù You can read all
about it here. ‚Äî Kenneth Chang and Shannon Stirone

Getting Climate Issues to Resonate

By Lauren Jackson

How we tried to tell the story of a warming planet. Plus, the woman behind The Daily's crazy-busy calendar.

Hello! Phew, it's Friday. We had a big week on The Daily: GameStop. A vigilante mother's vengeance against a
Mexican cartel. A coup in Myanmar.

When not making the show this week, our team was sharing close looks at the history of collaging, getting
excited about NASA's new stamp collection and reading through your listening recommendations in our
inbox. One suggestion to listen to a ""sumptuous"" 1935 orchestral performance was a favorite (I'm listening as I
write this). As always, we're open to your recs.

This week in the newsletter, we take a look at how we're covering climate change -- and introduce you to one
of our beloved producers who helps make The Daily happen.

'No one story can capture the scale of this.'

The climate emergency does not sound like a siren. There are, of course, the alarms of erratic hurricanes,
uncontrolled wildÔ¨Åres and splintering ice shelves. But, for the most part, the crisis of our warming planet is
quiet. It is the slow death of forests that once hummed, the muted bleaching of coral and the silence of
governmental inaction.

This lack of audio, combined with the incremental nature of the crisis, makes climate change a tricky topic to
report   in   our   narrative-driven   medium.   ""How   do   you   cover   a   crisis   that   affects   everything   and   is   still
unfolding?"" producer Michael Simon Johnson asked. ""No one story can capture the scale of this.""

But last month, when President Biden announced sweeping plans to reduce American emissions in his Ô¨Årst
few weeks in ofÔ¨Åce, our team heard the possibility for an episode.

""While politics shouldn't be our only coverage angle, it at least opened up the possibility of being able to
report on how the administration is handling the issue and what they plan to do about it,"" Michael said.

Still, the story didn't immediately materialize. When Michael and editor Marc Georges teamed up to build an
episode around the news, they received the feedback that all of the focus on policy made the episode feel
""like homework,"" Marc said.

Then, a breakthrough: Marc had the idea of asking our environmental policy reporter, Coral Davenport, to
envision what an American morning routine in 2035 could be if Mr. Biden's agenda was fully realized -- a way
of personalizing the policy agenda.

The team worked together to ""put the listener in that world, get a sense of how different it could be,"" he said.
""Then one of the Ô¨Årst questions that comes to a listener's mind after that would likely be, 'Well, how do you
get there?""'

In the episode, we hoped to convey that the answer to that question isn't neat -- and that success will
ultimately touch almost all aspects of culture and society. ""Comminities are already being affected and will
likely be displaced by changes in the climate. There's likely to be knockdown effects across the justice
system, the economy and in the pace of technological innovation"" Marc said.

Which means there are many more stories to tell on the topic. We've been inspired by our peers across the
industry who are creatively pushing boundaries in climate change coverage (Michael recommends listening
to ""The Big One"" by KPCC, which focuses on the potential societal effects of a pending disaster). And while
we'll continue to evaluate whether the Biden administration is executing on its environmental ambitions, we
also hope to imagine new possibilities for how to capture the scope and scale of the climate crisis, and all of
its effects, in audio. We'd love your input as we do so.

 





Alexandra Leigh Young: Producer, Calendar Whiz, Author, K-Pop Stan


We wanted to give you more insight into the producers and editors who make the show happen. So we're
starting a series of proÔ¨Åles that will help you get to know them a little better. First up, senior producer
Alexandra Leigh Young.

First things Ô¨Årst, how did you make your way to The Daily?

I started on the audio team back when there were only two producers! On one of my Ô¨Årst days reporting to
work, I entered the building to see newly elected President Donald Trump in the lobby, surrounded by
hundreds of reporters and onlookers. I thought, ""Well, I guess it's real -- I work at The New York Times now!""

Before starting at The Times, I was a producer at WNYC's Radiolab and before that I had many jobs, one of
which was producing tours for pop bands like Third Eye Blind, New Kids on the Block and Nick Lachey.

Tell us a bit about your role on the show.

My role is very different from the other senior producers on The Daily. While I do produce episodes, I spend
much of my time looking at the weeks ahead, plotting out the show calendar and making sure that each
story is pushing ahead as planned and is properly staffed, juggling everyone's schedules to make sure our
incredible team gets some rest.

What is it like managing the calendar?

I think the technical term for it is ""bananas."" Typically, we have episodes planned out a week in advance, but,
of course, when news breaks we have to drop everything and turn to that story, rearranging schedules and
sometimes killing stories that get stale. Other times, we have to rerecord with reporters as a story that
missed its air date evolves. As my colleague Theo Balcomb always says, it means we constantly have to stay
""knees bent.""

What's the craziest experience you've had crashing on an episode?

I'll never forget the time I closed the Ô¨Årst Democratic debates in 2019. Debates are always guaranteed late
nights, and that night we were about 40 minutes away from our 6 a.m. deadline when my colleague Rachel
Quester yelled across her desk at me: All the tape in her audio editing session was suddenly corrupted.

With the Ô¨Årst morning light Ô¨Åltering into our ofÔ¨Åce windows, I frantically called our engineer Chris Wood in
London, who always has a solution for us. I will never forget his calm but puzzled ""hmmm"" that signaled to
me that we were screwed. We were not screwed -- he eventually sorted out our problem -- but there was a
moment there when Rachel and I thought we were going to have to blow past our deadline to start over,
something that has miraculously never happened on the show. My blood pressure still hasn't recovered from
that night.

And what episode of The Daily are you proudest to have been a part of?

I am deeply proud of the episode we made at the start of the pandemic, ""New York City Grinds to a Halt."" In
30 years, when I look back on this pandemic and all that we've been through, I will think of that episode.

Finally, is there anything else you'd like to tell newsletter readers about yourself?

My literary agent would be very unhappy with me if I didn't mention that I wrote a book! It's a young adult
novel about a Chinese-American girl who pursues her K-pop dreams in Seoul (because, yes, I stan for K-pop).
It's called ""Idol Gossip,"" and it comes out on Sept. 14. It's my Ô¨Årst novel and I'm very excited about it! I've also
started to write my second novel during quarantine.

Climate Change Is Lengthening Pollen Season in U.S., Study
Shows

By John Schwartz

New research suggests that climate change is responsible for longer pollen seasons in the United States and
more pollen in the air, as well.

Among the many disasters climate change is wreaking around the world, scientists have now identiÔ¨Åed a
more personal one: It's making allergy season worse.

That   is   the   message   of   a   new   study   in   the   journal   Proceedings   of   the   National   Academy   of   Sciences
published on Monday. The researchers found a strong link between planetary warming and pollen seasons
that will make many of us dread spring just a little bit more.

According to the new paper, the combination of warming air and higher levels of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere has caused North American pollen seasons since 1990 to start some 20 days earlier, on average,
and to have 21 percent more pollen.

Scientists have suggested for some time that the season is getting longer and more awful, and the new
research provides greater detail and estimates of just how much a warming planet is responsible for the
greater misery. They concluded that climate change caused about half of the trend in the pollen season, and
8 percent of the higher pollen count. What's more, the trend of higher pollen counts, the researchers said, is
accelerating.

The most pronounced effects were seen in Texas, the Midwest and the Southeast, said William Anderegg, an
assistant professor of biology at the University of Utah and the lead author of the new study. The effects were
less obvious in the northern United States, including New England and the Great Lakes states. The greatest
pollen increases came from trees, as opposed to grasses and weeds, he said.

The   researchers   employed   the   techniques   of   attribution   science,   which   is   commonly   used   to   state   the
degree to which extreme weather events like heat waves, wildÔ¨Åres or the amount of rain a hurricane brings
are worse than they would have been in a world without climate change.

Applying this branch of science to pollen was a novel and welcome idea, said Kristie Ebi, a professor in the
Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington who was not involved in the
study. ""It's a great piece of work,"" she said. ""There has been very little research on the application of detection
and attribution analysis to the health risks of a changing climate.""

Mountains, Ice and Climate Change: A Recipe for Disasters

By Henry Fountain

Shrinking and thinning of glaciers is one of the most documented signs of global warming caused by rising
levels of greenhouse gases.

The Ô¨Çash Ô¨Çood that killed dozens of people and left hundreds missing in the Himalayas of India on Sunday
was far from the Ô¨Årst such disaster to occur among the world‚Äôs high-mountain glaciers. In a world with a
changing climate, it won‚Äôt be the last.

Shrinking and thinning of glaciers is one of the most documented signs of the effects of global warming
caused by emissions of greenhouse gases, scientists say. Glacial retreat in mountains around the world has
been measured, sometimes at a rate of 100 feet or more each year. In the Himalayas, the most glaciated
mountain range and home to about 600 billion tons of ice, the rate of retreat has accelerated over the past
four decades.

Over the long term, there are concerns about what the loss of glaciers will mean for billions of people around
the world who rely on them at least in part for water for drinking, industry and agriculture. But the more
acute fear is for the safety of the people who live near them.

Ice lost is water released, and in the Himalayas, as elsewhere, some of that water is trapped in lakes as it runs
down mountainsides, dammed by rocky debris the glaciers leave behind. Worldwide, as more ice has melted,
the resulting lakes have increased in number, and the total volume of water in them has grown by 50
percent since 1990.

‚ÄúClimate change, we believe with 100 percent surety, has to be the reason these lakes are forming and
increasing,‚Äù said Umesh K. Haritashya, who studies glacial hazards at the University of Dayton in Ohio.

Glacial lakes are a serious hazard. The debris dam can collapse from the weight of the water or from an
earthquake; or an avalanche above the lake can send ice and rock rushing into it. Either way, the result can
be   a   sudden,   catastrophic   burst   of   water   that   can   wipe   out   communities   and   infrastructure   in   valleys
downstream.

Outburst Ô¨Çoods, as they are known, have occurred throughout history. In Uttarakhand, a 2013 outburst led to
Ô¨Çooding, destroyed villages and killed several thousand people. Elsewhere on the subcontinent, outburst
Ô¨Çoods in the mountains in 1929 affected the Indus River nearly 500 miles away. In the Andes in Peru, glacier-
related Ô¨Çooding has killed an estimated 30,000 people since the 1940s.

In Switzerland and some other countries, engineers have built siphons to drain lakes that pose particular
threats to communities or infrastructure. But worldwide such projects are few and far between and are
overwhelmed by the rise in the number of glacial lakes.

Rising temperatures affect more than glaciers, however. Thawing and refreezing of ice trapped in rock
fractures on mountain slopes can cause the slopes to become destabilized and more prone to collapse.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing more and more in the high mountains cases of the rock and mountains not being as stable as
we would have thought,‚Äù said Dan Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary in Canada.

While it is too early to directly link the disaster in Uttarakhand to climate change, destablilization resulting
from melting ice may have been responsible.

Although the Indian government claimed that an avalanche that poured into a river and created the Ô¨Çood
was caused by ‚Äúcalving,‚Äù or breaking, of a glacier at high elevation, scientists who analyzed satellite images
from before and after the disaster said the collapse of an equally high rock slope was more likely the cause.

Dave Petley, vice president for innovation at the University of ShefÔ¨Åeld in Britain who has long studied
landslides, said that such slopes often contain a lot of rock fractures, and ice acts like a glue that holds them

 





together. ‚ÄúAs the climate is warming, this ice is degrading in the summer,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe rock mass becomes
so weak because the glue that‚Äôs holding together isn‚Äôt there anymore.‚Äù


One mystery is the source of all the water for the Ô¨Çood, which combined with sediment to create a wall of
mud   that   traveled   down   the   Rishiganga   River,   sweeping   away   houses   and   people   and   leaving   two
hydroelectric projects in ruins.

Many scientists thought at Ô¨Årst that such a huge amount of water must be the result of an outburst Ô¨Çood.
But satellite imagery from before the disaster showed no signs of any large lakes.

Dr. Petley said it was likely that the rockfall ‚Äî which was probably on the order of tens of millions of cubic
yards of debris ‚Äî struck a glacier, fragmenting it. ‚ÄúThese rock avalanches are very energetic and chaotic,‚Äù he
said.

What was now a rock-ice avalanche continued downhill, generating immense heat from friction as it did so.
This heat likely melted much of the ice. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably where all the water came from,‚Äù he said.

Heavy snow cover in the region, some of which had begun to melt in the days before the disaster, may also
have contributed, some researchers said.

In addition, when this mass of rock and now-melting ice reached the valley Ô¨Çoor, it quite likely encountered
huge amounts of sediments deposited by a landslide in 2016, the scars from which are visible in satellite
images. That sediment would have mixed with the incoming debris, worsening the Ô¨Çooding‚Äôs impact.

‚ÄúFrom what I‚Äôve been able to see, the chain of events may have started in 2016,‚Äù said Myl√®ne Jacquemart, a
glacier researcher at the University of Colorado.

And while this particular chain of events may seem like a one-time event, it‚Äôs not, Dr. Jacquemart said. A
deadly 2017 mudslide that struck the village of Santa Luc√≠a in Chile followed a similar pattern, she said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we‚Äôve never seen anything like this before,‚Äù she said.

Outburst Ô¨Çoods and the collapse of slopes subject to thawing are not the only glacier-related hazards linked
to climate change. A glacier is a river of ice, and the ice acts as a buttress for the slopes on either side. As a
glacier retreats and thins, these slopes lose their support. The result can be a sudden collapse and an ice-
rock avalanche as the slope debris hits the glacier.

Scientists sounded the alarm last year over the potential for such a disaster in Prince William Sound in
Alaska, not far from Anchorage. A mile-long slope along a fjord had lost most of its support because of
retreating ice, raising the risk of a landslide into the fjord. The resulting sudden tsunami could be deadly for
any hunters or Ô¨Åshing boats in the area, and could destroy coastal villages.

Faster melting of glaciers is also causing some glaciers to Ô¨Çow faster, as meltwater acts as a lubricant
between the ice and the underlying rock. In some cases they have Ô¨Çowed so fast that the front of the glacier
simply breaks off unexpectedly, Dr. Jacquemart said.

Two such detachments occurred within two months of each other in 2016 in the Aru Range in Tibet, she said.

The Task Ahead for Biden on Climate

By The Editorial Board

The new president has shown a welcome interest in combating climate change. But more will need to be
done.

After four years of scorn, the issue of climate change has risen near the top of the American political agenda,
where it deserves to be and where, even accounting for the efforts of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack
Obama, it had never been.

That is the happy message contained in the blizzard of executive orders and press brieÔ¨Ångs emanating from
the Biden White House over the past couple of weeks. Put simply, the richest and most powerful nation in
the world is back in the Ô¨Åght to rescue the planet from the Ô¨Åres, Ô¨Çoods, famines, rising sea levels, human
dislocations and other consequences of a warming globe.

Though less noticed, there was one other uplifting development with important implications for the climate
that had little to do with President Biden. That was the announcement from General Motors' chief executive,
Mary Barra, that the company is getting out of the internal combustion game and plans to sell only zero-
emission cars and trucks by 2035. The company has already invested $27 billion to introduce 30 electric
models in the next four years and will build a plant in Ohio to make the batteries for these vehicles.

G.M.'s move was in part a competitive response to Volkswagen and other foreign automakers, including ones
in China, that have announced fundamental shifts toward electric vehicles. It Ô¨Åts nicely with some of Mr.
Biden's   climate   goals,   including   zeroing   out   greenhouse   gas   emissions   in   America   by   midcentury.
Importantly,   it   is   also   a   reminder   of   the   power   of   free   market   forces,   without   whose   constructive
engagement -- and the private investments necessary to build out clean vehicles and clean energy sources
like wind and solar -- the climate crisis cannot be solved. No government, however committed, can go it
alone.

Mr. Biden's executive orders on climate were nonetheless important. They do not have the permanence or
bipartisan imprimatur of laws, and are subject to reversal by later administrations, but they send powerful
policy signals to the federal bureaucracy. One needs only think back to the early Trump days, when a suite of
executive orders aimed at delivering on Donald Trump's boastful promise of ""energy independence"" -- which
in fact the country had mostly achieved -- consumed various federal agencies for the next few years. This led
to   weaker   regulations   on   coal-Ô¨Åred   power   plants   and   methane   emissions,   decimated   clean   water
protections, gave over large swaths of public land to oil and gas exploration and shrank two magniÔ¨Åcent
national monuments designated by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama. It is these actions -- which, along with Mr.
Trump's contempt for science, cost the country four years in what is essentially a race against time -- that Mr.
Biden, in his executive orders, is telling his cabinet ofÔ¨Åcers to review and reverse.

In many cases, that won't be easy. To take one example, Mr. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency
followed a legal path that took more than two years and involved many complex technical studies in order to
roll back Mr. Obama's rule ordering automakers to rapidly increase fuel economy standards, thus reducing
tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide. The same laborious timetable now awaits Mr. Biden's E.P.A. as it seeks
to reinstate the Obama standards. Similar obstacles will complicate efforts to restore rules on methane
emissions and the broad protections of the Clean Water Act narrowed by Mr. Trump.

On   the   plus   side,   the   president   can   fairly   quickly   restore   the   original   boundaries   of   the   shrunken
monuments, a matter that lies within presidential jurisdiction, and possibly prevent drilling from proceeding
in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Of course, nothing prevents Mr. Biden from acting unilaterally on
matters within his powers, as he has in rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change and canceling a
problematical oil pipeline from Canada. The moratorium he announced last month on new oil and gas
leasing on public lands and waters is similarly within his writ.



In the short run, that's a mere annoyance to the oil companies; only one-Ô¨Åfth of the nation's oil and gas is

 



produced on public lands and waters, and the industry is sitting on a cache of roughly 13.4 million acres of
undeveloped federal leases. It is also a disappointment to environmental groups that remain Ô¨Åxated on
ending hydraulic fracturing not tomorrow but yesterday. But it is a welcome Ô¨Årst step toward satisfying Mr.
Biden's campaign pledge to transition from fossil fuels, and one of many recent signs -- Ms. Barra's G.M.
pledge being another -- that fossil fuels' hegemony is slowly coming to an end.


One of the president's Ô¨Årst moves was to name John Kerry, a former secretary of state who helped broker
negotiations   at   the   Paris   climate   conference   in   2015,   as   his   international   climate   envoy,   charged   with
restoring America's credibility on the issue. In part because of Mr. Trump's intransigence, the United States
has struggled to meet its commitment in Paris to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by
2025; with the help of the coronavirus pandemic, which disrupted the economy, emissions have dropped by
20 percent, according to Rhodium, a consulting group. But the longer-term trajectory was not encouraging,
even with the dramatic drop in the costs of renewable fuels, the closing of many coal-Ô¨Åred power plants and
the determined efforts of states and cities to Ô¨Åll the void left by the federal government.

America is hardly alone. Only a handful of the nearly 200 countries that signed on to the Paris Agreement
have met their targets; among big emitters, the nations of the European Union come the closest. But even if
every country does meet its targets, it will not be enough, not by a long shot -- a scary truth that the Paris
negotiators acknowledged at the time and that an alarming 2018 report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change conÔ¨Årmed. The report warned that to avoid the worst effects of climate change,
the   world   would   have   to   hold   increases   in   atmospheric   temperatures   to   1.5   degrees   Celsius   above
preindustrial levels. In practical terms, this means a carbon-emission-free world by 2050, which in turn
requires a downward wrench in global emissions by 2030. Some experts believe that for the United States to
carry its share of the load, it will have to cut emissions by 40 to 50 percent over the next decade.

On April 22, Earth Day, the United States will host a Climate Leaders Summit. The expectation is that Mr.
Kerry will unveil a different set of targets. Those numbers have to be more than ambitious. They also have to
be credible -- meaning, as Robert Stavins, a longtime climate scholar at Harvard puts it, ""truly achievable
given existing and reasonably anticipated policy actions.""

Rolling back all of Mr. Trump's rollbacks on fossil fuel emissions, however necessary that is, simply won't cut
it. What might cut it is major new climate legislation that encourages serious investment dollars -- in millions
of emissions-free vehicles, in hundreds of thousands of new charging stations to service those vehicles, in a
reimagined electric grid carrying power from plants that rely not on fossil fuels but on rapidly growing
renewable sources, in a cleaner public transportation system and in millions and millions of weatherized
homes.

All that and more was envisioned in a $2 trillion climate plan presented by none other than Mr. Biden in a
speech in his home state of Delaware last summer. His problem is therefore not lack of imagination. It is the
political reality of a divided Senate that cannot bring itself to approve a plan to help ordinary people and local
governments weather the economic storms of the pandemic. If America's legislators cannot deal with a
present emergency, how likely is it that they can be persuaded to address a more remote one?

The president's pitch to Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, is that a credible climate plan   will
create the jobs the pandemic has destroyed, and many more. Let's hope it works.

In the meantime, it seems enough to celebrate what, as if in a fairy tale, has appeared in the White House: a
president who cares about the climate and other environmental issues, who has gathered around him
serious people, who has determined to follow science where it leads and who will try to do good and useful
things.

This Climate Deal Is Good for Earth and the Economy

By Stephen Yurek and Bob Keefe

More than 100 nations have approved an accord phasing down a planet-warming coolant. The U.S. isn‚Äôt
among them.

Tucked into the huge omnibus spending package that President Trump signed before leaving ofÔ¨Åce was
something out of sync with his administration‚Äôs regressive climate agenda: Legislation that authorized a
phase-down in the production and use of heat-trapping chemical coolants known as hydroÔ¨Çuorocarbons.

These greenhouse gases are enormously potent, 1,000 times more so than carbon dioxide in its warming
effect on the planet. The action, part of a huge appropriations bill, was widely seen as one of the most
important actions in years to slow climate change.

President Biden is now asking the Senate to take the next step: move forward with the ratiÔ¨Åcation of an
amendment to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which sets targets for the global phase-down of HFCs. The
amendment was agreed to at conference of nations in Kigali, Rwanda, in October 2016.

The Obama administration helped negotiate the deal, but the Trump administration never sent it to the
Senate. One hundred and thirteen nations have already ratiÔ¨Åed the agreement.

Winning Senate approval for a treaty is not easy. It requires a two-thirds majority of the vote. But industry and
environmental   groups   supported   the   phase-down   signed   by   Mr.   Trump,   and   we   support   the   Kigali
Amendment for the same reasons: It creates a level playing Ô¨Åeld.

U.S. manufacturers now know what equipment to build and states know the deadlines for the phase-down,
enabling them to plan their overall greenhouse gas reduction goals. But Senate approval is needed so
American industry will avoid potential trade penalties from treaty members and remain competitive with
their foreign counterparts.

HFCs are used mostly as refrigerants in refrigerators and air-conditioners, but also in a variety of other
commercial applications, such as insulating foams, cleaning solvents and Ô¨Åre suppression systems. These
chemicals were commercialized some 30 years ago as substitutes for chloroÔ¨Çuorocarbons, which were found
to be depleting the atmosphere‚Äôs ozone layer. HFCs don‚Äôt affect the ozone layer, but their effect on the
climate is pronounced.

Thanks to the well over $1 billion invested in innovation by American companies, alternatives exist or will soon
exist for all but a very small number of HFC applications. And because of mounting concern over the pace of
climate change ‚Äî and the economic costs that come with it ‚Äî making the transition away from HFCs as
soon as possible is a top priority for American manufacturers of refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment
and users of HFCs. The orderly, coordinated transition the treaty amendment provides for will save money for
manufacturers and consumers alike.

This will be a plus for the nation‚Äôs economy. U.S. ratiÔ¨Åcation of the treaty would create an additional 33,000
new American manufacturing jobs, stimulate an additional $12.5 billion increase in direct output per year by
2027, and result in a 25 percent boost in U.S. exports of refrigerants and related equipment, according to a
2018 industry sponsored study by the University of Maryland.

We now have the HFC legislation, which directs the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce the phase-
down schedule called for in the treaty amendment. It will reduce HFC use by 85 percent over the next 15
years and, according to an analysis by the research Ô¨Årm Rhodium Group, cut emissions over that period by
the   equivalent   of   900   million   metric   tons   of   carbon   dioxide,   more   than   the   total   annual   emissions   of
Germany. A global transition away from HFCs could avoid up to 0.5 degrees Celsius of projected warming by
2100. That is signiÔ¨Åcant.



But we also need the treaty amendment to keep U.S. manufacturers in the technological driver‚Äôs seat, create

 



jobs in the U.S. and expand market share abroad for the HFC alternatives that American manufacturers have
developed and are developing. Other countries where HFC markets are growing rapidly, such as India, Brazil
and China, seem to be waiting for the U.S. to take action. Those countries have among the fastest growing
markets for air-conditioning and refrigeration and offer a huge potential market for HFC alternatives once
they ratify the treaty amendment.


But, without approving the amendment, the U.S. is likely to struggle to sell its technology in countries that
have agreed to it, since those countries are likely to give trade preferences to fellow treaty members. The U.S.
would be left on the outside.

The Biden administration has promised to submit the treaty amendment to the Senate by the end of March.
Then it will be up to the Senate to take the next step and approve it.

Stephen Yurek is the president and chief executive ofÔ¨Åcer of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration
Institute, a trade association. Bob Keefe is the executive director of E2, a nonpartisan group of business
leaders and investors promoting policies that are beneÔ¨Åcial to the economy and the environment.

Climate Fear Is Growing, But So Are Ways to Cope

By Susan Shain

Distress over global warming is increasing, but formal and informal support networks are springing up, too.

After Britt Wray married in 2017, she and her husband began discussing whether or not they were going to
have children. The conversation quickly turned to climate change and to the planet those children might
inherit.

""It was very, very heavy,"" said Dr. Wray, now a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University and the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""I wasn't expecting it."" She said she became sad and stressed,
crying when she read new climate reports or heard activists speak.

Jennifer Atkinson, an associate professor of environmental humanities at the  University of Washington,
Bothell, became depressed after students told her they couldn't sleep because they feared social collapse or
mass extinction.

There are different terms for what the two women experienced, including eco-anxiety and climate grief, and
Dr. Wray calls it eco-distress. ""It's not just anxiety that shows up when we're waking up to the climate crisis,""
she said. ""It's dread, it's grief, it's fear.""

It's also not unusual. Over the past Ô¨Åve years, according to researchers at Yale University and George Mason
University, the number of Americans who are ""very worried"" about climate change has more than doubled,
to 26 percent. In 2020, an American Psychiatric Association poll found that more than half of Americans are
concerned about climate change's effect on their mental health.

Dr. Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist based in Washington, D.C., and co-founder of the Climate Psychiatry
Alliance, an organization building a directory of climate-aware therapists, said she had ""absolutely"" seen a
surge in patients seeking help with climate anxiety in recent years.

But as the prevalence of climate anxiety has grown, so has the number of people working to alleviate it, both
for themselves and those around them.

Dr. Wray, for example, who holds a Ph.D. in science communication, began reading everything she could
about anxiety and climate change, eventually shifting her own research to focus on it entirely. She shares her
Ô¨Åndings and coping techniques in a weekly newsletter, Gen Dread, with more than 2,000 subscribers. In the
spring of 2022, she plans to publish a book on the topic.

""My overall goal is to help people feel less alone,"" Dr. Wray said. ""We need to restore ourselves so we don't
burn out and know how to be in this crisis for the long haul that it is.""

Dr. Atkinson, in hopes of assuaging her feelings and those of her students, designed a seminar on eco-grief
and climate anxiety.

Eco-distress can manifest in a range of ways, from anguish over what the future will hold to extreme guilt
over individual purchases and behaviors, according to Dr. Van Susteren. Though its symptoms sometimes
mirror those of clinical anxiety, she said she saw eco-distress as a reasonable reaction to scientiÔ¨Åc facts -- one
that, in mild cases, should be addressed but not pathologized. (In cases of extreme anxiety, Dr. Van Susteren
said it was important to seek professional help.)

For many Americans, counseling for climate distress is relatively accessible. In some communities, however,
especially in less wealthy countries, it may seem more like a rare privilege.

Kritee, a senior climate scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, has feet in both worlds. Based in
Boulder, Colo., Dr. Kritee (she has a single name) leads workshops and retreats for people experiencing
climate grief. She also works with farmers in India whose livelihoods are directly threatened by the extreme

 





droughts and Ô¨Çoods that come with climate change.


Dr.   Kritee,   who   has   a   doctorate   in   biochemistry   and   microbiology,   said   she   believed   people   of   all
backgrounds should process their feelings about climate change. She makes her services affordable through
scholarships, scaled payments and donation-based classes. Some of her sessions are open only to people of
color, who are often on the front lines of climate change, and whose ecological grief, she said, is often
compounded by racial trauma.

Regarding the white and afÔ¨Çuent, who most likely will not feel climate change's worst effects, Dr. Kritee said
it was crucial they confront their grief, too. In doing so, she said, they can begin to contemplate questions
like, ""If I am hurting so much, what is happening to people who are less privileged?""

Some of her  past workshop participants have  been inspired to  make  lifestyle changes or  volunteer  for
environmental campaigns, choices that could, when undertaken collectively, beneÔ¨Åt the planet as a whole.
""We cannot encourage people to take radical action without giving them tools to express their anger and
grief and fear,"" Dr. Kritee said.

Sherrie Bedonie, a social worker and co-founder of the Native American Counseling and Healing Collective, a
group practice owned by four Native American women, shared that view. While her clients don't use terms
like eco-anxiety, Ms. Bedonie said Native people were ""always grieving"" the loss of their land and culture and
encourages her clients to face their feelings. ""If people aren't ready or they run from grief, it'll continue to
haunt them,"" she said.

As for non-Native people, Ms. Bedonie said she hoped part of their grieving process would be acknowledging
past and present traumas inÔ¨Çicted upon Indigenous communities. Then, she said, we'll be able to ""come
together"" and ""start the healing process of Mother Earth.""

And that's what people dealing with climate grief generally underscore: that grief for the planet shouldn't be
buried. In fact, when processed communally, it might actually be a potent weapon.

""What's really important is we start normalizing this,"" Dr. Wray said. ""Not only to help people who are dealing
with this very reasonable distress, but also because allowing those transformations to happen is hugely
energizing for actionable climate movement.""

According to Dr. Wray, the growing number of people worried about climate change could be the catalyst for
its solution -- so much so, that she and her husband have decided to try for a baby. ""As soon as we're not
alone in these feelings anymore,"" she said, ""it's not nearly as bad.""

Science backs her up: Studies suggest that social support can provide resilience to stress and that feelings of
belonging can increase motivation.

Dr. Atkinson, too, said she thought her seminar's greatest value has been its ability to connect like-minded
people. As she put it: ""Who wants to stand up and Ô¨Åght the system when they feel like they're doing it
alone?""

Over the years, however, her views on eco-distress have changed. ""Our anger comes from a desire for justice,
our grief arises from compassion,"" she said. ""If we got rid of those feelings, we'd lose the whole motivation to
stay in this Ô¨Åght. So that's been the real surprise: The thing I wanted to overcome turned out to be a kind of
superpower.""

McDonald and Alfonso Flores Berm√∫dez write:

HAULOVER, Nicaragua ‚Äî When the leaders of an Indigenous Miskito village returned to their homes days
after Hurricane Iota struck last November, they found their lush community in Nicaragua‚Äôs northeast laid to
ruin ‚Äî and the coastline itself transformed.

Their colorful, postcard-perfect wooden homes had been cut down, and the coconut-tree-lined beaches
devastated. The surrounding mangrove forests that supplied protection and nourishment to the village,
known as Haulover, were battered and broken. Drinking wells were contaminated with saltwater.

And a wedge of ocean the width of a football Ô¨Åeld now cut through the middle of town, leaving villagers with
an anguishing question: Stay and rebuild, or resettle inland?

Biden‚Äôs pick to run the E.P.A. tells lawmakers he will ‚Äòmove
with a sense of urgency‚Äô on climate change.

By Lisa Friedman

Michael S. Regan, President Biden‚Äôs nominee for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,
vowed during his conÔ¨Årmation hearing on Wednesday to ‚Äúmove with a sense of urgency‚Äù in reducing planet-
warming   greenhouse   gas   emissions,   while   facing   tough   questions   about   his   role   in   an   administration
crowded with high-proÔ¨Åle climate czars.

If conÔ¨Årmed, Mr. Regan, the secretary of North Carolina‚Äôs Department of Environmental Quality, will be
tasked with reinstating dozens of Obama-era regulations that the Trump administration scrapped, and in
many cases ensuring they are even more far-reaching. That includes reimposing national fuel-efÔ¨Åciency
standards; plugging oil and gas wells that leak methane, a powerful short-term greenhouse gas; and possibly
reimposing limits on emissions from power plants.

Yet Mr. Regan sought to allay Republican fears that the E.P.A. was poised to enact onerous new rules
intended to hurt the fossil fuel industries that bring jobs to many of their states.

‚ÄúI have also learned that we can‚Äôt simply regulate our way out of every problem we face,‚Äù Mr. Regan told
lawmakers, pledging to be ‚Äúcollaborative‚Äù with states and to ‚Äúwork transparently with responsible industries
eager to establish clear, consistent rules of the road.‚Äù

Mr. Regan will also be charged with rebuilding the agency, which lost nearly 5,000 employees during the
Trump era and saw the morale of career employees plummet.

He   is   intended   to   round   out   the   administration‚Äôs   climate   team,   joining   Gina   McCarthy,   who   served   as
President Barack Obama‚Äôs E.P.A. chief and will lead a new White House OfÔ¨Åce of Climate Policy to coordinate
domestic efforts, and John Kerry, the former secretary of state, who will be Mr. Biden‚Äôs international climate
envoy.

Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware, who will become the chairman of the Senate Committee on
Environment and Public Works, called Mr. Regan ‚Äúthe right person to lead the Environmental Protection
Agency during this critical time.‚Äù

Senator   Shelley   Moore   Capito,   Republican   of   West   Virginia,   said   the   Biden   administration‚Äôs   ‚Äúbarrage   of
executive orders‚Äù on climate change left her worried about the fate of her state‚Äôs economy.

‚ÄúI am concerned that this is shaping up to be a third Obama administration,‚Äù she said.

Noting that she was concerned that ‚ÄúunconÔ¨Årmed and unaccountable czars on climate‚Äù like Ms. McCarthy
and Mr. Kerry would not be subject to ‚Äúreally any congressional oversight,‚Äù she asked Mr. Regan how his role
would be distinguished from Ms. McCarthy‚Äôs, particularly if a dispute arises.

Mr. Regan sidestepped the question, saying that ‚Äúwith any complex issue, we anticipate healthy debates.‚Äù

Mr. Regan has won praise for working with both Republicans and Democrats on issues like a major coal ash
settlement in North Carolina. The state‚Äôs two Republican senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis, introduced
Mr. Regan, and both indicated they planned to support his nomination ‚Äî an early sign that his conÔ¨Årmation
is not likely to meet with serious opposition.

‚ÄúWe have to understand that the election produced a different leader down in the White House,‚Äù Mr. Tillis
said, adding that Republicans need to hope for ‚Äúpeople in the administration who have a track record of
listening‚Äù and Ô¨Ånding middle ground.

‚ÄúHe will sometimes take on initiatives that I will disagree with, most likely vote against,‚Äù Mr. Tillis added. ‚ÄúBut I
do believe he is somebody we can rely on to be fair.‚Äù

PERSONAL HEALTH

How Climate Change Affects Your Health

By Jane E. Brody

No matter where you live or how high your socioeconomic status, climate change can endanger your health,
both physical and mental, now and in the future.

Melting ice caps, warmer oceans, intense storms, heat waves, droughts, Ô¨Çoods and wildÔ¨Åres -- all these well-
documented effects of climate change may seem too remote to many people to prompt them to adopt
behaviors that can slow the warming of the planet. Unless your neighborhood was destroyed by a severe
hurricane or raging wildÔ¨Åre, you might think such disasters happen only to other people.

But what if I told you that no matter where you live or how high your socioeconomic status, climate change
can endanger your health, both physical and mental, now and in the future? Not only your health, but also
the health of your children and grandchildren? Might you consider making changes to help mitigate the
threat?

Relatively few Americans associate climate change with possible harms to their health, and most have given
little thought to this possibility. Even though I read widely about medical issues, like most Americans, I too
was unaware of how many health hazards can accompany climate change.

Studies in the United States and Britain have shown that ""people have a strong tendency to see climate
change   as   less   threatening   to   their   health   and   to   their   family's   health   than   to   other   people's   health,""
according to Julia Hathaway and Edward W. Maibach at the Center for Climate Change Communication at
George Mason University.

Two recently published reports set me straight. One, by two public health experts, called for the creation
within the National Institutes of Health of a ""National Institute of Climate Change and Health"" to better
inform the medical community, public ofÔ¨Åcials and ordinary citizens about ways to stanch looming threats to
human health from further increases in global warming.

The experts, Dr. Howard Frumkin and Dr. Richard J. Jackson, both former directors of the National Center for
Environmental Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned that recent climate-related
disasters, including devastating wildÔ¨Åres and a record-breaking hurricane season, demonstrate that our
failure to take climate change seriously is resulting in needless suffering and death.

The second report appeared just as I began investigating the evidence supporting their proposal: a full-page
article in The New York Times   on   Nov.   29   with   the   headline   ""WildÔ¨Åre   Smoke   in   California   Is   Poisoning
Children."" It described lung damage along with lifelong threats to the health of youngsters forced to breathe
smoke-laden air from wildÔ¨Åres that began raging in August and fouled the air throughout the fall.

Children are not the only ones endangered. Anyone with asthma can experience life-threatening attacks
when pollution levels soar. The risks of heart disease and stroke rise. And a recent study in JAMA Neurology of
more than 18,000 Americans with cognitive impairment found a strong link between high levels of air
pollution and an increased risk of developing dementia.

""While   anyone's   health   can   be   harmed   by   climate change,   some   people   are   at   greatly   increased   risk,
including   young   children,   pregnant   women,   older   adults,   people   with   chronic   illnesses   and   disabilities,
outdoor   workers,   and   people   with   fewer   resources,""   Drs.   Hathaway   and   Maibach   wrote   in   Current
Environmental Health Reports.

Alas, said Dr. Jackson, emeritus professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""Human beings respond
only to what is a threat to them at the moment. Californians are now much more aware -- the Ô¨Åres got
people's attention."" The wildÔ¨Åre season is now starting much earlier and ending later as a result of a warming
climate, an international research team reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in November.

 





Dr. Frumkin, emeritus professor at the University of Washington, told me, ""Lots of people who don't consider
climate change a major problem relative to themselves do take it seriously when they realize it's a health
concern. Heat waves, for example, not only kill people, they also diminish work capacity, sleep quality and
academic performance in children.""


""Our changing climate will have much more of an impact on people's health over time,"" Dr. Jackson said.
People of all ages will develop respiratory allergies, and those who already have allergies can expect them to
get worse, as plants and trees respond to a warmer climate and release their allergens in more places and for
longer periods.

Infectious diseases carried by ticks, mosquitoes and other vectors also rise with a warming climate. Even
small increases in temperature in temperate zones raise the potential for epidemics of Lyme disease, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, encephalitis and other tick-borne infections, as well as mosquito-borne West Nile
disease, dengue fever and even malaria.

Climate change endangers the safety of foods and water supplies by fostering organisms that cause food
poisoning   and   microbial   contamination   of   drinking   water.   Extreme   Ô¨Çooding   and   hurricanes   can   spawn
epidemics of leptospirosis; just walking through Ô¨Çoodwaters can increase the risk of this bacterial blood
infection 15-fold.

These are just a smattering of the health risks linked to global warming. They are extensive and require both
societal and individual efforts to minimize. Yes, society is changing, albeit slowly. The Biden administration
has rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement. General Motors, the nation's largest car manufacturer, announced
it would dedicate itself to electric vehicles and other green energy initiatives, and Ford, Volkswagen   and
others are doing the same.

Lest you feel you can't make a difference, let me suggest some steps many of us can take to help assure a
healthier future for everyone.

I assume you've already changed your light bulbs to more efÔ¨Åcient LEDs. But have you checked the source of
your electricity to see that it relies primarily on nonpolluting renewable energy sources? Can you install solar
panels where you live? If you can afford to, replace old energy-guzzling appliances with new efÔ¨Åcient ones.
And don't waste electricity or water.

Now tackle transportation. Drive less and use people power more. Wherever possible, commute and run
errands   by   cycling,   walking   or   scootering,   which   can   also   directly   enhance   your   health.   Or   take   public
transportation. If you must drive, consider getting an electric car, which can save fuel costs as well as protect
the environment.

How about a dietary inventory, one that can enhance your health both directly and indirectly? Cutting back
on or cutting out red meat to reduce greenhouse gases, relying instead on plant-based foods, is the perfect
start to a healthier planet and its human inhabitants.

Reduce waste. Currently, Dr. Jackson said, 30 percent of our food is wasted. Buy only what you need and use
it before it spoils. Support organizations like City Harvest, which distributes unsold food from stores and
unused food from restaurants to those in need.

Reuse or recycle materials instead of throwing out everything you no longer want nor need.

"
NYT-2021-75.txt," Wednesday, December 22, 2021 - 00:00 1661 mots  The Year in Climate News By The New York Times  2021 was yet another year that felt like five. It began with a presidential transition, riots at the Capitol and a blackout in Texas. Before summer had even begun, drought, heat and fires had already torn across the West. The Biden administration faced a number of challenges to its climate agenda at home. And then came the United Nations international climate conference in Glasgow in the fall.  Feel like a blur? Here‚Äôs a recap of the year in our coverage.  Climate Change Is Here  In February, Texas went dark. Huge winter storms plunged large parts of the central and southern United States into an energy crisis.  Climate Change Means Trouble for Power Grids  By Brad Plumer  Despite inaccurate claims from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, we explained: No, the reason for the blackouts was not frozen wind turbines. The main problem was frigid temperatures that stalled natural gas production, which is responsible for the majority of Texas‚Äô power supply.  Fast forward to early June, when it wasn‚Äôt technically summer yet, but the American Southwest was already baking and drying up.  It‚Äôs Some of America‚Äôs Richest Farmland. But What Is It Without Water?  By Somini Sengupta  How Severe Is the Western Drought? See For Yourself.  By Nadja Popovich  Droughts were really bad this year. We took a look at the conditions in California before fire season really took off, and in wine country specifically; in North Dakota; and in the whole American West over time.  The Pacific Coast had an off-the-charts heat wave, which caused hundreds of extra deaths and killed marine life en masse. Across the country, nights have gotten hotter.  By midsummer, fire season was in full force. Both the Bootleg and Dixie fires were so bad that they generated their own weather.  See How the Dixie Fire Created Its Own Weather  By Nadja Popovich, Noah Pisner, Nicholas Bartzokas, Evan Grothjan, Daniel Mangosing, Karthik Patanjali and Scott Reinhard  Meanwhile, other parts of the United States, and the world, were inundated with water. Record rain flooded subways and Hurricane Ida strengthened quickly into a monster, damaging fossil fuel infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and causing deaths from Louisiana to the Northeast.

Nor is the blame equally shared. We reported on some of America‚Äôs biggest, and maybe most surprising, methane emitters. And we took a look at the countries with the most greenhouse gas emissions in history.  Who Has The Most Historical Responsibility for Climate Change?  By Nadja Popovich and Brad Plumer  We covered how disaster aid often favors white people. And how Native Americans, forced into the most undesirable areas of America by white settlers and the government, are now on land that‚Äôs becoming uninhabitable.  Dispossessed, Again: Climate Change Hits Native Americans Especially Hard  By Christopher Flavelle and Kalen Goodluck  Though the science of climate change is settled and we have the technology to address it, the biggest question now is: Who should pay the bill? This year, calls for climate aid and reparations reached a boiling point at the COP 26 climate conference in Glasgow.  The World Needs to Quit Oil and Gas.

Electric cars will be key in reducing emissions, but when will they be here?  Whenever that is, they won‚Äôt be here without cobalt. And with more than two-thirds of the world‚Äôs cobalt production coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the country is taking center stage. The quest for Congo‚Äôs cobalt is caught in an international cycle of exploitation, greed and gamesmanship.

Here‚Äôs How It Works.  By Winston Choi-Schagrin  The Politics  Domestically, with a new administration, a big infrastructure bill and the perennial debate over how to address climate change, it was a busy year in politics.  While the Trump administration often dismissed science, the Biden administration attempted to restock the government with scientists, but it wasn‚Äôt easy:  Biden‚Äôs Climate Plans Are Stunted After Dejected Experts Fled Trump  By Coral Davenport, Lisa Friedman and Christopher Flavelle  Biden tightened pollution rules in a push to phase out gas cars, but worsening fires in California showed the limits of his power. Hitting climate targets will require a lot. Pretty much everything will need to change.  And change will require bipartisanship. As we reported this year, many Republicans in Congress no longer deny that Earth is heating because of fossil fuel emissions. In fact, some find the failure to grapple with climate change to be a ‚Äúpolitical liability‚Äù for the party. But they also say abandoning oil, gas and coal will harm the economy.  At the same time, Democrats can‚Äôt completely agree among themselves.

Climate Summit  By Keith Bradsher and Lisa Friedman  After two weeks of lofty speeches and bitter negotiations among nearly 200 nations, the question of whether the world will make significant progress to slow global warming still comes down to the actions of a handful of powerful nations. And those nations remain at odds over how best to address climate change.

NYT-2021-76.txt," Monday, December 20, 2021 - 00:00 1769 mots  Behind Manchin‚Äôs Opposition, a Long History of Fighting Climate Measures By Jonathan Weisman and Lisa Friedman  Senator Joe Manchin III noted climate policy when he said he would vote against the Build Back Better Act. In his life and career, West Virginia coal has loomed large.  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Senator Joe Manchin III on Monday cited a litany of issues that drove him to oppose President Biden‚Äôs $2 trillion Build Back Better bill, from Democrats‚Äô refusal to attach work requirements to social benefits to their failure to raise tax rates on the rich. But left almost unsaid was the issue that has always propelled his political career as a Democratic maverick: climate change.  The version of the bill that passed the House last month devoted $555 billion to shifting the nation to renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, and away from fossil fuels like West Virginia coal. Mr. Manchin, who defied gale-force political headwinds in 2010 by running for the Senate on his opposition to President Barack Obama‚Äôs climate change legislation, killed a provision in Build Back Better that would have imposed stiff penalties on electric utilities that continued to burn coal and natural gas.  But even with the stick dropped from the House‚Äôs bill, West Virginia‚Äôs coal interests were working hard to kill off the measure‚Äôs carrot, a package of tax credits to make clean energy more financially competitive, and, by extension, struggling coal even less so. Their lobbyists talked frequently to Mr. Manchin.  With every Republican opposing the bill in the evenly divided Senate, Democratic leaders could not afford to lose a single vote, and Mr. Manchin has said he had concerns about energy issues from the start.  ‚ÄúI said, this is absolutely a very, very far-reaching piece of legislation which changes so many categories in American culture and American society, revamping the entire tax code and revamping the entire energy policies for our country ‚Äî and the social platforms that we use to support people,‚Äù he told a West Virginia broadcaster on Monday.  West Virginia coal and gas, and policies designed to stop their burning, have always had a special place in Mr. Manchin‚Äôs politics. A Manchin family-owned business has made a small fortune selling waste coal from abandoned mines to a heavily polluting power plant in the state. The blind trust in which Mr. Manchin‚Äôs interests lie held between $500,000 and $1 million last year, according to his most recent disclosure form. The company, Enersystems, valued at between $1 million and $5 million, delivered the senator $492,000 in dividends, interest and business income in 2020, the May disclosure states.  He received more campaign donations from the oil, coal and gas industries than any other senator in the current election cycle.  His first run for the Senate featured an advertisement in which he promised, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take dead aim at the cap and trade bill because it‚Äôs bad for West Virginia‚Äù as he shoots a copy of Mr. Obama‚Äôs climate legislation with a rifle. Six years later, he reprised his performance for his re-election, saying: ‚ÄúHey, I haven‚Äôt changed. I might be a few years older, but I‚Äôll still take on anyone that messes with West Virginia.‚Äù  Democrats thought that the substantial weakening of the climate provisions in the House bill had gotten Mr. Manchin within shouting distance of yes.  ‚ÄúWe were close,‚Äù said Senator Tina Smith, Democrat of Minnesota, of her last conversation with Mr. Manchin, which she said occurred early last week.  Gregory Wetstone, president and chief executive of the American Council on Renewable Energy, a nonprofit group that supports green power, added, ‚ÄúWe had good conversations directly with him and with his staff.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAll of the prior conversations had been along the lines that he did not want to penalize fossil fuel but was fine incentivizing clean power,‚Äù Mr. Wetstone said. ‚ÄúWe had not seen indications of pushback from Manchin or elsewhere from the clean energy provisions.‚Äù  The bill, as passed by the House, includes about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and buyers of wind, solar and nuclear power. Electric vehicle customers would receive up to $12,500 in tax credits. Also included are $6 billion to make buildings more efficient and burn less fuel, $6 billion to replace gas-powered furnaces and appliances with electric versions, and billions more for research and development of new technologies to capture carbon dioxide from the air. Existing tax credits to lower the costs for homeowners of installing solar panels would be extended, as would credits for geothermal pumps and small wind turbines, covering up to 30 percent of the costs.  Though Mr. Manchin has always said his share of the coal brokerage is hidden in a blind trust, any general threat to coal power would impact that business.  A counteroffer that Mr. Manchin gave the White House last week did include scaled-back climate-related tax provisions, according to a congressional official familiar with it. But beyond scope, outstanding issues remained, such as a fee on oil and gas producers that emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Mr. Manchin on Monday mentioned tax credits for electric vehicles, which he said should not be available to higher-income families, and in a statement on Sunday, he said the House-passed bill would jeopardize the reliability of the electricity grid while increasing dependence on foreign supply chains.  Behind the scenes, coal interests were hard at work making the case against the clean energy provisions, and specifically the approximately $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and buyers of wind, solar and nuclear power.  Chris Hamilton, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said he had conveyed to Mr. Manchin that the clean energy tax credits would be a death knell for the state‚Äôs coal industry. Even though the clean electricity standard was stripped from the bill, Mr. Hamilton said the coal industry still saw the tax incentives as a threat to the state.  ‚ÄúThe credits that were in the bill would have resulted in an almost total displacement of coal generation within a relatively short period of time,‚Äù Mr. Hamilton said.  ‚ÄúThose provisions were more onerous and more likely to displace coal-fired generation than the clean energy standard,‚Äù he said.  Beginning in October, documents from America‚Äôs Power, a coal industry trade organization, began circulating among members of Congress, including Mr. Manchin, outlining arguments against the tax incentives, according to industry and congressional officials.  The analyses argued that tax credits for renewable energy would be a waste of taxpayer money and that China ‚Äúwill be the biggest winner‚Äù from the expansion of solar power in the United States resulting from the tax credits.  Michelle Bloodworth, chief executive of America‚Äôs Power, an industry group, said its main concern was that the tax credits would endanger reliability of the grid by speeding the retirement of coal and natural gas plants.  Mr. Manchin echoed those arguments on Sunday when he rejected the Build Back Better Act. In a statement he warned that the bill‚Äôs clean energy provisions could cause widespread blackouts like the ones Texas endured in February and which California suffered in 2020.  ‚ÄúWe have invested billions of dollars into clean energy technologies so we can continue to lead the world in reducing emissions through innovation,‚Äù he wrote on Sunday. ‚ÄúBut to do so at a rate that is faster than technology or the markets allow will have catastrophic consequences for the American people like we have seen in both Texas and California in the last two years.‚Äù  And Mr. Manchin recalled a 2011 warning from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff that the greatest threat facing the nation was its debt.  Energy experts said Mr. Manchin‚Äôs stated reasons for opposing the bill‚Äôs climate provisions did not stand up to scrutiny.  In October, the Pentagon and the intelligence community flagged climate change as a growing threat to national security.  The main cause of Texas‚Äôs blackouts this year was frigid temperatures that stalled natural gas production, which is responsible for the majority of Texas‚Äô power supply. In contrast, wind makes up just a small part ‚Äî 7 percent or so, by some estimates ‚Äî of the state‚Äôs overall mix of power generation in winter.  California‚Äôs rolling blackouts in August of 2020 were caused by a heat wave linked to climate change and poor planning by energy regulators, who, for instance, did not take into account how much the state‚Äôs drought would diminish hydroelectric power output by aging dams.  Mr. Manchin on Sunday argued that ‚Äúthe energy transition my colleagues seek is already well underway,‚Äù as the price of wind and solar energy drops, easing the utility and transportation sectors away from oil, gas and coal. But scientists say the pace must happen much more quickly if the world is to stave off the most catastrophic impacts from climate change and that‚Äôs what the incentives in the bill were designed to achieve.  ‚ÄúThese were exactly the same arguments he made when he opposed the clean electricity plan yet now he‚Äôs using them to oppose what are just sensible clean energy tax credits,‚Äù Ms. Smith said. She called them ‚Äúwrong‚Äù on both counts.  In some sense, the current standoff between most Democrats and Mr. Manchin is a drama foretold. In 2018, when the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Maria Cantwell of Washington, used her seniority to jump to the top of the Senate Commerce Committee, environmentalist Democrats pleaded with the next most senior liberal, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, to take the gavel ‚Äî and keep it from Mr. Manchin. But Mr. Sanders, an independent with national ambitions, chose instead to take the top post on the Senate Budget Committee. That, under strict rules of seniority, left the energy committee open for Mr. Manchin‚Äôs taking. As chairman, Mr. Manchin was responsible for writing several of the climate provisions in the Senate‚Äôs version of the Build Back Better Act.  Democrats said Monday they are just starting to discuss how to salvage the bill‚Äôs climate change provisions.  Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said he could see some parts, like the clean energy incentives, moving in smaller ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of conversation about the politics of this, and what it means for the specific bill,‚Äù Mr. Schatz said. ‚ÄúBut I feel like the fundamentals are in our favor on the climate side.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe science is more ruthless than the politics, and on climate there‚Äôs broad agreement that we have to do something big and bold,‚Äù he said. "
NYT-2021-77.txt," Sunday, December 19, 2021 - 00:00 1320 mots  Manchin Rejects Landmark Legislation, Putting Biden‚Äôs Climate Goals at Risk By Lisa Friedman and Coral Davenport  Senator Joe Manchin III said he was opposed to legislation that includes climate action designed to keep the planet from dangerously overheating.  WASHINGTON ‚Äî The declaration from Senator Joe Manchin III that he cannot support his party‚Äôs $2.2 trillion Build Back Better bill has significantly dimmed the prospects for the climate action that scientists say the United States must take to avert the most catastrophic effects of global warming.  Mr. Manchin, who comes from the coal-rich state of West Virginia and personally profits from his family‚Äôs coal brokerage, has received more campaign donations from the oil, coal and gas industries than any other senator in the current election cycle.  He first expressed his opposition to the legislation in an interview on Fox News Sunday, and then released a follow-up statement that echoed industry objections to its climate and clean-energy provisions, saying they ‚Äúrisk the reliability of our electric grid and increase our dependence on foreign supply chains.‚Äù  As the swing Democratic vote in an evenly split Senate where all Republicans are opposed to the legislation, Mr. Manchin is in the unique position of deciding whether the bill can pass.  News of his opposition alarmed environmentalists. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we can tackle the climate crisis at the scale that‚Äôs necessary without passing this law,‚Äù said Leah Stokes, an environmental policy professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who has been advising Senate Democrats.  While the administration can use executive action and regulations, without legislation, experts say it will be virtually impossible to achieve President Biden‚Äôs goal of aggressively cutting the pollution generated by the United States, the country that has historically pumped the most planet-warming gasses into the atmosphere. That would have dire stakes for the planet, environmentalists said.  Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said on Twitter that failing to pass the legislation ‚Äúwould be a climate disaster.‚Äù  Mr. Biden and other world leaders have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, compared with temperatures before the Industrial Revolution. That‚Äôs the threshold beyond which scientists have warned that the planet will tip into an irreversible future of frequent deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires and storms, rising sea levels, food shortages and mass migration. The planet has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius.  However vital the social programs in the Build Back Better bill, the climate crisis is an existential threat that demands immediate action, said Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt change the basic physics of the problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo there is a special urgency to this ‚Äî we can‚Äôt miss it.‚Äù  The bill rejected by Mr. Manchin would have made the single largest expenditure in the nation‚Äôs history to address the warming planet. About $555 billion of the $2.2 trillion bill would be aimed at moving the American economy away from its 150-year-old reliance on fossil fuels and toward clean energy sources.  Instead of penalties to punish polluters, the bill largely relies on incentives for industries, utilities and consumers to shift from burning oil, gas and coal for energy and transportation to tapping into wind, solar and other forms of power that do not emit carbon dioxide, the most plentiful of the greenhouse gases that are warming the world.  The Build Back Better bill would get the United States about halfway to Mr. Biden‚Äôs goal of cutting its emissions roughly in half from 2005 levels by the end of this decade, according to the Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan analysis firm.  It would provide about $320 billion in tax incentives for producers and buyers of wind, solar and nuclear power. Buyers of electric vehicles would receive up to $12,500 in tax credits. It included $6 billion to make buildings more energy efficient and another roughly $6 billion for replacing gas-powered furnaces and appliances with electric versions. And it provided billions of dollars for research and development of new technologies to capture carbon dioxide from the air.  The version of the bill that passed the House would extend existing tax credits to lower the costs for homeowners of installing solar panels, geothermal pumps and small wind turbines, covering up to 30 percent of the costs.  For months, Mr. Manchin opposed various provisions of the bill that advocates say are vital to reducing the burning of coal, oil and gas.  Mr. Manchin rejected part of the bill that would have been the single most effective tool to cut greenhouse gases, a clean electricity program that would have rewarded power plants that switched from burning fossil fuels to solar, wind and other clean sources and punished those that did not. He objected to a provision that would have imposed a fee on emissions of methane, a powerful planet-warming pollutant that leaks from oil and gas wells. And he opposed the provision that would have given tax credits to consumers who purchase electric vehicles produced by union labor.  He also rejected a provision that would have banned future oil and gas drilling off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as the Gulf of Mexico.  Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who leads the Senate Finance Committee and who wrote most of the clean energy tax incentive package, noted that it was backed by major electric utilities. ‚ÄúThis is our last chance to prevent the most catastrophic effects of the climate crisis, and failure is not an option,‚Äù Mr. Wyden said on Sunday.  Climate activists, particularly from the youth-led groups that had campaigned for Mr. Biden during his run for the presidency, said on Sunday they were furious and they blamed the president and Democratic leadership just as much as Mr. Manchin.  ‚ÄúBiden and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have failed us,‚Äù said Paul Campion, 24, who joined a hunger strike outside the White House in November to push for passage of the spending package.  ‚ÄúThey enabled Senator Manchin to set the terms of the bill and ultimately derail it,‚Äù Mr. Campion said. He added that failing to enact climate legislation would have ‚Äúenormous consequences next year for the Democrats when they have nothing to show for their trifecta government.‚Äù  Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a climate advocacy group, blamed Mr. Biden for not fighting harder for the climate provisions on which he campaigned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs frustrating to see the ways he hasn‚Äôt gone out and championed and fought for his agenda in the ways he could have,‚Äù Ms. Prakash said.  With the possibility that Democrats may lose control of the House in midterm elections next year, the prospects for climate action are quickly disappearing, she said. ‚ÄúFrom here on out, the political map just looks more competitive and less promising,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is our moment and they‚Äôre blowing it.‚Äù  Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president of energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said it may be possible to salvage the main elements of the climate package. While the $2.2 trillion version that passed the House isn‚Äôt likely to move forward, she said that aspects or another version of the bill could still pass.  ‚ÄúBuild Back Better is not dead. We‚Äôve been on the Manchin roller coaster for a long time now, and we see that he shares his emotions in public,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs incredibly important now is that Biden and Manchin start to discuss what is acceptable.‚Äù  Others were less sure there was additional room for compromise. ‚ÄúThe climate provisions are both historic and urgent and necessary and already a compromise,‚Äù said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president for government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters. ‚ÄúThere really isn‚Äôt more to give there.‚Äù "
NYT-2021-78.txt," Friday, December 17, 2021 - 00:00 1246 mots  Examining the Role of Climate Change in a Week of Wild Weather By Brad Plumer, Winston Choi-Schagrin and Hiroko Tabuchi  The science suggests that the United States can expect more unusual and severe storms as the world heats up, increasing the urgency for action to protect communities.  Hurricane-force gusts in nine states. Immense dust storms in Colorado and wind-fanned wildfires in Kansas. The first-ever December tornadoes observed in Minnesota and western Iowa. Temperatures soaring past 70 degrees in cities like Omaha and Des Moines, a record.  The powerful storm that swept through the Midwest on Wednesday was extraordinary in many respects, with 100 million Americans under some form of weather alert.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve not seen that combination of heat and dry, followed by an extended period of strong wind,‚Äù said Grady Dixon, who teaches geosciences at Fort Hays State University in Kansas. ‚ÄúIt was so unusual for the month of December ‚Äî it has to make you ask questions.‚Äù  One key question is what role global warming might have played in fueling such an extreme weather event. Scientists cautioned that it could prove difficult, if not impossible, to untangle the precise links between this week‚Äôs storm and climate change, although it appeared to be helped in part by record warmth across much of the country.  And there is evidence that the United States can expect more unusual severe storms as the planet heats up, potentially striking in new places or at unexpected times of year. While some questions are difficult to answer ‚Äî such as whether that will mean more tornadoes in the future ‚Äî scientists say the risks of increasingly wild weather make it all the more urgent that cities and states take steps to protect people and property.  ‚ÄúWe do expect an increase in favorable conditions for severe storms,‚Äù said John Allen, an associate professor meteorology at Central Michigan University. ‚ÄúAnd that means we have to be aware that we can have these extreme events in places or at times that we haven‚Äôt necessarily thought of before.‚Äù  Two key ingredients for severe storms are warm, moist air creating updrafts and wind shear, a change in wind speed and direction that can allow storms to become stronger. But storms also need a trigger to form, such as a hot day or a cold front, which can be somewhat more unpredictable, Dr. Allen said.  Some studies have concluded that as global warming advances, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, favorable conditions for severe storms in the United States will increase this century. The increase is expected to be more pronounced during cooler seasons that don‚Äôt traditionally see as many thunderstorms, such as early spring, fall and winter, thanks to the presence of more warm, humid air during periods of higher wind shear.  It remains less certain as to whether those increasingly severe storms might lead to more tornadoes. These complex events are harder to model, and so far there doesn‚Äôt appear to be clear evidence that, for instance, tornadoes have changed in frequency or intensity over the past 40 to 60 years.  Even so, scientists have seen some evidence that tornado behavior seems to be shifting: In recent years tornadoes seem to be occurring in greater ‚Äúclusters,‚Äù and the region known as tornado alley in the Great Plains, where most tornadoes occur, appears to be shifting eastward.  There‚Äôs also the possibility that derechos ‚Äî groups of intense and fast-moving wind storms like those that caused havoc in the Midwest on Wednesday ‚Äî may shift into new regions or even become more common as the planet warms, particularly during cooler seasons where they haven‚Äôt traditionally been as common.  Derechos ‚Äúare primarily a summer phenomenon,‚Äù said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration‚Äôs National Severe Storms Laboratory. ‚ÄúIf you make it more summery, you might expect them to increase.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe thing that makes derechos painful is that while their winds are frequently not strong enough to destroy buildings, they take out power lines and trees over a large area,‚Äù Dr. Brooks added. ‚ÄúTornado paths may have intense destruction in the middle of it. In a derecho, it covers a much broader area.‚Äù  The week‚Äôs ominous weather shocked even professional weather watchers. Zach Sharpe, who heads the Iowa Storm Chasing Network, said he had never experienced such bizarre weather in December.  Much of Wednesday was unseasonably warm ‚Äî ‚ÄúIt felt like spring; there were people wearing shorts,‚Äù he said ‚Äî but once the storm front approached, a blast of cold air brought instantly freezing temperatures and 80-miles-per-hour winds. ‚ÄúIt was eerie to be chasing tornadoes 10 days before Christmas,‚Äù Mr. Sharpe said. ‚ÄúWe were out in our vehicles, listening to Jingle Bells, while tornado sirens were going off.‚Äù  Still, scientists said, this week‚Äôs storm was so unusual and had so many different forces behind it, including a strong jet stream moving across the central states, that it can be difficult to disentangle the impact of global warming compared to other factors like La Ni√±a, an intermittent climate phenomenon in the Pacific Ocean that can influence winter storms.  This storm was ‚Äúabout as messy an event as you can get,‚Äù Dr. Brooks said. ‚ÄúIs this a weird one-time event? Or maybe it won‚Äôt repeat for a long time? Will the seasonality change a lot? I don‚Äôt think we know.‚Äù  Victor Gensini, a professor of meteorology at Northern Illinois University, pointed out that all extreme weather events are now taking place against the backdrop of an atmosphere that has been profoundly shaped by humans burning fossil fuels. ‚ÄúAssume that all extreme weather events are impacted by climate change,‚Äù he said.  The better question is to what extent climate change might have enhanced the extreme weather event or how likely was the event to occur in the absence of climate change, he said.  Scientists have been able to answer those questions for numerous other extreme weather events, such as this year‚Äôs deadly heat wave in the Pacific Northwest or severe flooding in Germany and Belgium, by using computer models to determine if global warming made them more likely or worse. Whether any researchers try to do something similar for this week‚Äôs storm remains to be seen.  For some scientists, however, arguing about the precise role of climate change is only part of the story. Whether or not scientists ultimately settle on an answer, they say, society should do as much as possible to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather.  ‚ÄúWe might not know exactly how climate change is going to affect tornadoes going forward, but we do know that there are lot of things we can do to protect people today,‚Äù said Stephen Strader, a disaster scientist at Villanova University.  For instance, he noted, many states in tornado-prone areas still aren‚Äôt doing nearly enough to strengthen and enforce building codes in ways that have been proven to save lives. And, while meteorologists have improved the accuracy of tornado warnings, there is still far more work that needs to be done in understanding how to make those warnings as effective as possible so that people take them seriously and get out of harm‚Äôs way.  ‚ÄúThere are always two sides of the coin when it comes to disasters,‚Äù Dr. Strader said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the climate itself, but there‚Äôs also society vulnerability. We can work to address climate change, but we shouldn‚Äôt lose focus on what we can do today to improve survivability against these extreme events.‚Äù "
NYT-2021-79.txt," Friday, December 17, 2021 - 00:00 830 mots  Climate Change an ‚ÄòEmerging Threat‚Äô to U.S. Financial Stability, Regulators Say By Alan Rappeport  The Financial Stability Oversight Council issued a formal warning on the economic damage that global warming could inflict.  WASHINGTON ‚Äî Federal regulators warned for the first time in an annual report to Congress on Friday that climate change was an ‚Äúemerging threat‚Äù to the U.S. financial system, laying out how the costs associated with more hurricanes, wildfires and floods caused by global warming could lead to a cascade of damage throughout the economy.  The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of top financial regulators led by the Treasury secretary, offered a grim assessment of how the fallout from rising temperatures could spread, hurting property values and saddling insurers, banks and pensions that are associated with the sector with heavy losses. The report follows a similar analysis of climate risk that the council released in October.  ‚ÄúIncreased frequency and severity of acute physical risk events and longer-term chronic phenomena associated with climate change are expected to lead to increased economic and financial costs,‚Äù the new document said.  However, the report stopped short of the kinds of policy prescriptions that environmental groups and progressive Democrats have been calling for, such as tougher rules requiring banks to assess their ability to withstand climate-related losses, new capital requirements or curbs on extending financing to fossil fuel companies. Instead, it echoed a set of recommendations from the October report that called for improved data for evaluating climate-related financial risks and more uniform disclosure requirements to help investors make better informed decisions.  Climate change was not mentioned last year in the Trump administration‚Äôs final F.S.O.C. report.  The warning on climate change was one of several looming threats to the financial system, which faces ongoing uncertainty nearly two years into a global pandemic that is being gripped by a new variant.  In its annual report, the panel also issued a warning about the risk of higher than expected inflation, suggesting that it would lead to higher interest rates and losses at some financial institutions, blunting the momentum of the recovery.  The report comes as the Federal Reserve said this week that it would accelerate the end of its monthly bond buying program, which it has used to buttress economic growth during the pandemic, and raise interest rates three times next year to combat inflation.  The F.S.O.C. regulators attributed inflation in advanced economies to ‚Äúan increase in commodity prices, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages.‚Äù They warned that a rapid or unexpected rise in interest rates to blunt rising prices could induce ‚Äúsharp contractionary forces‚Äù and acknowledged that it was unclear how long inflation would persist.  ‚ÄúThe advent of higher inflation also raises the question of whether longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses will rise or become unanchored,‚Äù the report said.  The trajectory of the global economy is also a concern, as lockdowns and downturns in other countries could spill over into the U.S. financial system. Regulators pointed specifically to the prospect of a ‚Äúhard landing‚Äù in China as a potential worry and noted that the Chinese real estate sector is ‚Äúheavily leveraged.‚Äù A slowdown in the real estate market there could hurt global commodity markets because China is such a major consumer of steel, copper and iron ore.  The report also highlighted the fact that the pandemic has ushered in changes to the economy that remain hard to grasp.  The F.S.O.C. is closely watching the commercial real estate sector, for instance, out of concern that the rise of teleworking could permanently shift demand away from office space in cities. If this shift leads to a rapid drop in valuations at some point, it could deal a blow to small and midsize banks that hold property loans and destabilize the financial system.  Corporate credit also remains a concern, with leverage at non-financial corporations elevated compared with historical levels. Regulators are watching the airline, hospitality and restaurant industries, which have been hit hard by the pandemic, and warned that a wave of defaults or downgrades could be difficult for the financial sector to absorb.  The financial system is also facing an array of new threats.  Digital assets, known as stablecoins, are another potential source of vulnerability, regulators said, adding that more coordinated oversight is needed because the sector is evolving so quickly. They said that the value of digital assets remained highly volatile and that they could be subject to ‚Äúthe risk of operational failures, fraud, and market manipulation.‚Äù  The new technology could pose risks to the broader financial system if investors in digital currencies are suddenly unable to cash them in. The regulators also said that stablecoins could pose risks related to cybersecurity and illicit finance.  The F.S.O.C. does not have rule-writing power but it can prod regulators into addressing market vulnerabilities, and it has the power to designate certain entities or activities as ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù and in need of stricter oversight.

NYT-2021-80.txt," Thursday, December 16, 2021 - 00:00 707 mots  Google Pledged to Remove Ads From Climate Denial Sites, but Many Still Run By Hiroko Tabuchi  Researchers found ads placed by Google on sites that falsely call global warming a hoax. The revenue those sites earn from the ads can fund further misinformation.  Ahead of last month‚Äôs United Nations global climate summit, Google, the world‚Äôs biggest provider of ads online, made a big announcement: It would stop placing ads on sites that deny the scientific consensus on climate change.  Banned from profiting from its advertising program, Google said, were sites and videos falsely referring to global warming as a hoax or a scam. Also no longer welcome to run Google ads: Content falsely claiming that greenhouse gas emissions, or human activity, do not contribute to climate change.  But new research shows that Google‚Äôs policy has had limited effect so far.  As of Wednesday, ads placed by Google were still running on scores of articles, including ones on major right-wing sites like Breitbart, that falsely called global warming a hoax and described the United Nations climate conference last month as ‚Äúa gigantic eco-fascist gaslighting operation.‚Äù In reality, diplomats from nearly 200 countries struck a major agreement to intensify efforts to fight the serious hazards posed by a hotter planet.  The Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit group based in London, said on Thursday that it had counted at least 50 new climate denial articles on 14 different sites, all published after Nov. 9, when Google‚Äôs new policy was to have taken effect. An earlier report by the center‚Äôs researchers found that 10 of the most prominent publishers of climate denial content had received nearly 1.1 billion visits in the six months before the climate conference.  That‚Äôs a concern because the ad revenue that these denial sites earn by running Google ads then helps to fund more denial content, said Imran Ahmed, the center‚Äôs chief executive. ‚ÄúThe more ad revenue they get, the more they can pump out articles and they can get it in front of as many eyeballs as possible,‚Äù he said.  In fact, Google‚Äôs business model, to maximize its reach on the internet and to use personal data and algorithms to optimize ad placements, had made it ‚Äúa major route for the monetization of malignant content, whether it‚Äôs vaccine denial, identity-based hate, climate denial,‚Äù Mr. Ahmed said.  Michael Aciman, a spokesman for Google, said the company had reviewed the pages in question and had taken ‚Äúappropriate enforcement actions.‚Äù Early on Thursday, Breitbart climate denial articles that had displayed ads placed by Google were no longer displaying them.  ‚ÄúWhen we find content that crosses the line from policy debate to promoting climate change denial, we stop serving ads on that page or site,‚Äù Mr. Aciman said.  The findings underscore how Google has struggled to rein in even blatant examples of climate denialism, experts said. The company‚Äôs latest pledge was triggered by mounting pressure on Google to stop monetizing the worst examples of online climate denial.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no ambiguity that these pages are out of sync with mainstream climate science,‚Äù said John Cook, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University, whose research encompasses using machine learning to identify climate misinformation. ‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to blacklist.‚Äù  And even though much of the rest of the world has moved on from more blatant forms of climate denialism, the United States has remained particularly vulnerable, Dr. Cook said. ‚ÄúThere are parts of the country where science denial is still flourishing, and those tend to be the markets for these types of web pages,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúClimate misinformation confuses and polarizes the public, delays climate action and reduces trust in scientists.‚Äù  Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, has also come under pressure to counter election-related misinformation across its platforms, which include the video sharing site YouTube.  Google has said that it is using a mix of automated detection and human review to evaluate content, including YouTube videos. It normally disables ads on a page-by-page level, though egregious or persistent violations can trigger action against an entire site. Publishers have the option of appealing a decision or addressing their violations and applying for reinstatement"
NYT-2021-81.txt," Wednesday, December 15, 2021 - 00:00 969 mots  Was Climate Change to Blame for the Tornadoes, or Was It Just Really Bad Weather? By James B. Elsner  I‚Äôm a tornado climatologist, and it is not unusual for people to ask me after a spate of storms like the ones that ripped through the center of the country on Friday whether climate change has anything to do with it. The answer is: It‚Äôs complicated.  We have started to detect changes in collective tornado activity, including more powerful storms, and are beginning to understand how these changes might be related to global warming. But much more work needs to be done to gain a fuller understanding of how the changing climate is influencing these deadly storms.  Let‚Äôs start with what we know. A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air inside a thunderstorm. A thunderstorm that lasts more than 20 minutes and is energized by continuously rising air is called a supercell. The rising air is fueled by warm, moist conditions and changes in wind speed or direction associated with the approach of a frontal system where warm and cool air collide. The warm, moist air and that wind shear can generate a series of supercells, some of which produce tornadoes.  Connecting tornadoes to climate change is complicated because those twin conditions are necessary but not sufficient together for tornadoes to occur. A close-packed group of supercells, for instance, might produce straight-line winds rather than tornadoes. What‚Äôs needed to generate an outbreak of tornadoes ‚Äî say, six to 10 of them ‚Äî is ample heat, moisture and wind shear. But too much of any one or two of those conditions can disrupt the process of tornado formation.  Although tornadoes across the years do not appear to have become more common, an increasing percentage of them are occurring in outbreaks. The tornadoes that included Friday night‚Äôs so-called quad-state tornado ‚Äî which crossed four states and devastated the town of Mayfield, Ky. ‚Äî are an example of an outbreak. These are on the rise. On a day with at least one tornado, the chance that there are at least seven more increased to more than 15 percent on average by 2015 from 10 percent in 1990. These increases are even more substantial for larger outbreaks like the one that occurred on Friday night.  Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve also been seeing: A below average number of tornadoes this year; outbreaks becoming more common during cooler months in recent years; and tornadoes occurring more often across the Southeast compared with the Great Plains. Cities with the largest decreases in the number of strong tornadoes since 1984 include Dallas, Oklahoma City and Houston. Cities with the largest increases in the number of strong tornadoes since 1984 are Atlanta, Nashville and Augusta.  There is also evidence that tornadoes are getting stronger. Tornadoes are rated based on the severity of damage they inflict, using what‚Äôs known as the EF scale. The rating is made after the fact by forensic experts, and it depends on factors including the type of object struck and how the object was constructed.  The damage rating can be converted to a range of wind speeds. For example, a tornado rated as inflicting EF2 damage likely had wind speeds between 111 to 135 mph in a three-second gust. But the subjective nature of the rating process and the randomness of where a tornado tracks make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about tornado activity by counting the number of these storms in each rating category.  An increase in the number of large clusters does imply a larger threat of damaging tornadoes, however: The percentage of violent tornadoes (EF4, with winds of 166 to 200 miles per hour or more) increases with the size of the outbreak. Historically in an outbreak with between 16 and 32 tornadoes, fewer than 4 percent of them on average get rated EF3, with winds of 136 to 165 miles per hour or worse. In an outbreak with at least 60 tornadoes, more than 8 percent of them get rated EF3 or worse.  What is causing these changes in tornado behavior is still unclear, but global warming is probably playing a role through changes to the environments that support supercell clusters. Specifically, the extra heated moist air fueling the supercells on Friday was associated with an exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico caused by climate change.  Also, the interaction between the extra heating and increased wind shear is associated with larger outbreaks, which produce the strongest and longest-track tornadoes, on average. We found that tornado power, estimated using damage path characteristics, increased at a rate of 5 percent per year from 1994 to 2016. At least some of the upward trend can be associated with changes to the outbreak environment.  Attributing causation is difficult. But it is a big and an important step beyond the associations and pattern matching work that we and others have done. Attribution studies are now routinely done on heat waves and floods, but it may take some time before such studies of tornadoes are reliable because these storms still are too small in size for weather forecast models to see.  The ability to determine whether particular tornadoes bear the signature of the changing climate will be important not only to understanding the shifting dynamics of our warming world but to our ability to predict these storms with greater precision.  James B. Elsner is a professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee, where his research focuses on tornadoes, hurricanes and climate change. "

See How the Antarctic Is Signaling Major Climate Disruption

We‚Äôve visualized recent data from the Southern Ocean that has scientists increasingly worried.

We‚Äôre also covering tornadoes and new U.S. rules to bolster clean energy and electric vehicles. Plus: We show how scientists are using cutting-edge conservation technology.

Circling Antarctica, the huge Southern Ocean is out of sight of most of the world. It‚Äôs been mostly out of mind, too: It plays a critical role in Earth‚Äôs climate, but because conditions are so wild and dangerous, there‚Äôs been far less research there compared with other oceans.

That‚Äôs now changing, thanks in large part to autonomous water-measuring floats that drift up, down and around the ocean, bobbing to the surface regularly to send data to satellites. With so much new information at hand, oceanographers and climate scientists are now learning more about the Southern Ocean. And what they are learning is worrying. The ocean is changing as the world warms as a result of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

As I wrote in an article this week ‚Äî one that is accompanied by fascinating visualizations, created by my colleague Jeremy White, of some of the new float data ‚Äî the changes have huge implications for the future. The Southern Ocean may eventually release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making it harder for the world to reduce emissions enough to stem global warming. And the ocean may accelerate the melting of Antarctic ice, which over the long term threatens to be by far the biggest contributor to sea level rise.

Key numbers: By some estimates the oceans have taken up about 25 percent of the excess carbon dioxide, and more than 90 percent of the excess heat, that has resulted from burning of fossil fuels and other human activities since the 19th century.

Scientists called climate trends in the Arctic ‚Äúconsistent, alarming and undeniable‚Äù in their latest assessment, issued this week.

Tornadoes and climate change

In recent years, attribution studies have allowed scientists to understand how climate change is worsening hurricanes, heat waves, floods and droughts. But, so far, the same can‚Äôt be said of tornadoes like the ones that tore through six states this month.

Even as scientists are learning more about tornadoes and their behavior, it remains unclear exactly what role warming plays. Why? One reason is that tornadoes are small. That makes them harder to model, and modeling is the primary tool that scientists use when attributing extreme weather events to climate change. Another is that tornadoes are incredibly complicated, forming only when the perfect conditions come together.

Quotable: ‚ÄúThis is the hardest phenomenon to connect to climate change,‚Äù said Michael Tippett, an associate professor of applied physics and mathematics at Columbia University.

Here‚Äôs what we know, and don‚Äôt know, about tornadoes.

From the Opinion section

The climate crisis is reshaping the planet. Here‚Äôs what it looks like in 193 countries.

A cleaner, greener federal government

The Biden administration announced this month that every United States government building would have to be powered by clean energy within 10 years and that, by 2035, all new cars and trucks in the federal fleet would have to be zero-emissions.

Achieving those goals, officials said, would make the government carbon neutral by 2050 and bolster the market for clean energy and vehicles. ‚ÄúAs the single largest landowner, energy consumer and employer in the nation, the federal government can catalyze private sector investment,‚Äù the White House said in a statement laying out the new rules.

What‚Äôs next: The procurement rules, issued by executive order, can go into effect without a lengthy regulatory process. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the effort will be easy. Several Republicans have criticized the plan and, if their party wins control of either chamber of Congress next year, they could withhold funding. A future Republican president could also easily reverse the plan.

Also important this week:

New York City is set to ban gas-powered stoves, space heaters and water boilers in new buildings.Employees at the public relations firm Edelman, which has worked with Exxon and Shell, had some sharp questions about the company‚Äôs climate pledges at a recent meeting.Many parts of Australia that saw horrific bush fires in 2019 and 2020 are now dealing with heavy rainfall that could leave residents stranded for weeks.Russia has blocked a United Nations resolution that would have defined climate change as a threat to peace.

As scientists race to slow a catastrophic decline in biodiversity, technology offers them cutting-edge tools. After all, to conserve wild species, it helps to understand them. But, according to a new study in Conservation Biology, researchers aren‚Äôt making the most of new technology.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not really leveraging it as well as we need to be to keep up with these conservation challenges,‚Äù said Talia Speaker, one of the authors and research lead at WildLabs, a group focused on conservation technology. ‚ÄúWe need to more effectively work together and share data and be able to ask these big global scale questions.‚Äù

N.Y.C.‚Äôs Gas Ban Takes Fight Against Climate Change to the Kitchen
By Anne Barnard

New York will become the nation‚Äôs largest city to enact a ban on gas heat and stoves in new buildings. It‚Äôs a major step away from fossil fuels that is expected to influence wider markets.

New York City will ban gas-powered heaters, stoves and water boilers in all new buildings, a move that will significantly affect real estate development and construction in the nation‚Äôs largest city and could influence how cities around the world seek to reduce the burning of fossil fuels, which drives climate change.

The City Council on Wednesday approved a bill banning gas hookups in new buildings ‚Äî effectively requiring all-electric heating and cooking ‚Äî after what council members and lobbying groups described as weeks of intense negotiations. The ban takes effect in December 2023 for buildings under seven stories; for taller buildings, developers negotiated a delay until 2027.

Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who called for the ban two years ago, will sign the bill ‚Äúenthusiastically,‚Äù said Ben Furnas, the director of climate and sustainability for the mayor‚Äôs office.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a historic step forward in our efforts to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,‚Äù Mr. Furnas said. ‚ÄúIf we can do it here, we can do it anywhere.‚Äù

New York will be the largest American city to enact such a law, though New Yorkers currently attached to the blue flames of their gas stoves and their cozy gas-powered heaters will not be affected unless they move to a new building. State lawmakers have proposed a measure to ban gas infrastructure in all new buildings starting in 2024, but a vote has not yet been scheduled.

Variations of gas bans have spread from liberal enclaves like Berkeley, Calif., and Brookline, Mass., to bigger cities, including San Jose, Calif., Seattle and Sacramento, as efforts to curb climate change increasingly take aim at the burning of gas as well as oil. What made the bill a harder sell in New York ‚Äî where 40 percent of carbon emissions come from buildings ‚Äî was winter.

Until recently, gas was promoted as the cleanest option for heating, and proponents had to convince lawmakers that new and quickly improving electric technologies could heat and cook as well and at least as cheaply.

Real estate developers argued that the added demand for electricity in winter might lead to blackouts. Developers ‚Äî along with National Grid, a utility that supplies gas in the city ‚Äî said the ban‚Äôs effect on the climate would be limited until the city stops getting most of its electricity from fossil fuels, and that improved gas equipment should remain an option. A state law requires a shift to renewable sources like solar, wind and water power, but that transition is expected to take years.

Still, the proposal gained momentum from a yearlong grass-roots campaign; from candidates running on climate issues for city and state office; and from growing concerns about storms, floods and fires. It also drew support from less predictable quarters: independent energy analysts, real estate businesses betting on green development, and even Consolidated Edison, the city‚Äôs other main utility, which, unlike National Grid, supplies electricity within New York City as well as gas.

Con Ed, along with proponents like the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable building, argued in Council hearings that the city‚Äôs grid could handle the increase, partly because its biggest strains come in summer, from air conditioning. The shift to electric heating actually has the potential to reduce demand in summers, the groups‚Äô analysts argued, because many builders are expected to turn to heat pumps, which are already common in Europe, and which both heat and cool spaces and use less energy than air-conditioners.

‚ÄúTo my mind, this new law would be the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel industry in America‚Äôs biggest city and a world capital,‚Äù said Pete Sikora, the climate director of New York Communities for Change, which is part of a coalition of community and environmental groups whose yearlong campaign of street protests and rallies helped bring council members on board.

‚ÄúNew York City is responsible for 5 percent of gas burned in buildings, nationwide, which is huge,‚Äù Mr. Sikora said. ‚ÄúAs the world fails to seriously confront the crisis, N.Y.C. will take a major leap forward.‚Äù

The measure‚Äôs lead sponsor, Councilwoman Alicka Ampry-Samuels, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said it would reduce air pollution and climate dangers that disproportionately kill and harm vulnerable groups like Black and poor people.

‚ÄúWhen we prioritize profits and property over people, we might as well put a bullet in everybody‚Äôs head,‚Äù she told activists rallying before the vote in front of City Hall.

Bans on gas hookups are the latest challenge for an industry already besieged by campaigns against fracking, pipelines and gas-fueled power plants; permits for two such plants were recently denied by state regulators. The fuel long known as natural gas, which climate advocates prefer to call methane gas or fracked gas, is less harmful to respiratory health than oil and emits less carbon, but producing it releases methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

In fact, the trends have made the gas industry nervous enough to lobby states to forbid localities to enact gas bans. So far, 20 state legislatures, all of which are controlled by Republicans, have passed laws preventing the bans.

But in New York, where city and state leaders emphasized that the law will help the state reach its ambitious climate goals, its main skeptics, National Grid and the Real Estate Board of New York, were relatively muted in their criticism.

James Whelan, the president of the real estate group, which lobbied to slow the law‚Äôs rollout and narrow its scope, emphasized in a statement that it supports reducing greenhouse emissions, but ‚Äúin a way that ensures that New Yorkers have reliable, affordable, carbon-free electricity to heat, cool and power their homes and businesses.‚Äù

Eric Adams, the mayor-elect, said through a spokesman on Tuesday that he supports the compromise delaying the ban three years for larger buildings.

The law, passed 40 to 7, covers gut renovations that require new building permits. It allows exceptions for emergency power; businesses like restaurants, bakeries and laundromats; and residential buildings where at least half the units are classified as affordable.

Without substantially raising building costs, proponents say, the law will also reduce air pollution and the danger of gas explosions, create jobs in clean energy and redress environmental inequalities.

A recent study by the think tank RMI found that the law would prevent 2.1 million tons of carbon emissions by 2040 ‚Äî equivalent to what 450,000 cars spew in a year ‚Äî and save electricity consumers several hundred million dollars in gas connections, whose costs are passed on to them.

Supporters also include companies like BlocPower, a company based in Brooklyn that installs energy-efficient systems in buildings, and Alloy Development, which is erecting the city‚Äôs first all-electric residential tower, a 44-story building in Brooklyn that aims to open in 2024.

‚ÄúWe are living in a climate emergency, and it‚Äôs time for leaders in government and industry to respond accordingly,‚Äù Alloy‚Äôs chief executive, Jared Della Valle, said in a statement. ‚ÄúBanning new natural gas connections will not only significantly reduce new carbon emissions and improve air quality in our neighborhoods ‚Äî it will also make New York City a leader in sustainable development nationally and internationally.‚Äù

Russia Blocks U.N. Move to Treat Climate as Security Threat
By Rick Gladstone

The Russian veto of a widely supported Security Council resolution pointed to the difficulty of achieving a unified response to global warming.

Russia on Monday blocked a United Nations Security Council draft resolution, under negotiation for many months, that for the first time would have defined climate change as a threat to peace.

The resolution, which enjoyed wide-ranging support, would have significantly expanded the criteria used by the most powerful U.N. agency to justify intervening in armed conflicts around the world.

Russia‚Äôs derailment of the measure underscored the challenges faced by the United Nations in uniting the global community to combat climate change, which Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres and others have called an existential threat.

Despite progress made to counter greenhouse gas emissions with an agreement reached at the U.N.-sponsored climate summit in Glasgow last month, that accord fell far short of what many scientists say will be required to curb rising temperatures and disastrous changes in weather patterns from a warming planet. Among other weaknesses, the agreement left unclear how the most vulnerable nations will be able to afford the enormous investments needed to adapt.

The possible role of climate change in armed conflicts has long been a subject of discussion at the United Nations and elsewhere. Droughts and desertification aggravated by climate change in Mali, Niger and other parts of Africa, for example, are thought to be integral to the competition for water, food, farmland and pasture land that can lead to violence and instability.

The Security Council draft resolution, co-sponsored by Ireland and Niger, the council‚Äôs current president, was a version of what was initially proposed in 2020 by Germany but never put to a vote.

The Ireland-Niger draft would have obliged the 15-member body to include climate change as a factor regarding ‚Äúany root causes of conflict or risk multipliers.‚Äù It also would have asked the secretary general to make regular reports on how to address the risks from climate change in preventing conflicts.

The vote on the resolution in the 15-member council was 12 in favor, with Russia and India opposed and China abstaining. Because Russia is one of the council‚Äôs five veto-wielding permanent members, its negative vote blocked passage.

Vassily A. Nebenzia, Russia‚Äôs U.N. ambassador, said it regarded the resolution as a pretext by wealthy Western powers to justify meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. ‚ÄúPositioning climate change as a threat to international security diverts the attention of the council from genuine, deep-rooted reasons of conflict in the countries on the council‚Äôs agenda,‚Äù Mr. Nebenzia said.

Reinforcing his statement on its website, Russia‚Äôs U.N. Mission criticized the resolution as a ‚Äúproposal to establish this automatic link while neglecting all other aspects of situations in countries in conflict or countries lagging behind in their socio-economic development.‚Äù

Both Mr. Nebenzia and India‚Äôs ambassador, T. S. Tirumurti, said any climate issues were best left to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body responsible for dealing with the global threat posed by warming temperatures.

Mr. Tirumurti asserted that India was ‚Äúsecond to none when it comes to climate action and climate justice, but that the Security Council is not the place to discuss either issue.‚Äù

Russia‚Äôs veto was the first on any resolution put to a vote this year in the council, the only body in the United Nations with the power to impose sanctions and order the use of armed force when deemed necessary.

Russia has been the most prolific user of its Security Council veto in recent years to block actions it perceives to be manipulative by Western powers to intervene in the internal disputes of other countries. The change began after 2011, when Russia abstained in a Security Council vote on a resolution that authorized force in the Libyan conflict, which Russia later said was grossly abused by the West.

U.N. diplomats said at least 113 of the global body‚Äôs 193 members had supported the resolution, putting Russia in the position of having blocked what would have been a relatively popular decision.

The American ambassador, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, assailing Russia‚Äôs veto, said it had ‚Äústopped the world‚Äôs most important body for maintaining international peace and security from taking a small, practical and necessary step to combat the impacts of climate change.‚Äù

Ireland‚Äôs ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason, told reporters after the vote that both Ireland and Niger were ‚Äúextremely disappointed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe know very well that this resolution would have been a historic and an important ‚Äî not to mention necessary ‚Äî move for the council at a critical point in time,‚Äù she said.

The Climate Crisis Is Raging, but We Are Not Powerless
By Margaret Renkl

This article is part of Times Opinion‚Äôs Holiday Giving Guide 2021. For other ideas on where to donate this year, please see the rest of our guide here.

NASHVILLE ‚Äî At this point, you‚Äôre probably trying very hard to tread more lightly on this weary and fragile earth. But no matter how much organic produce you buy, or how much plastic you‚Äôve eliminated, or how many native trees you‚Äôve planted, the future seems bleaker and bleaker. The relentless destruction of wildlife habitat picks up pace. The extinction of species escalates. The rapidly heating planet has gone into overdrive.

It‚Äôs easy to feel powerless in a situation like this. For the companies raking in piles of money in a fossil-fuel-based economy ‚Äî and for the politicians whose campaigns they fund ‚Äî that‚Äôs the whole point. If even the people who are trying to do better by the planet give up in despair, what hope is there for making the kinds of global changes that must be made to preserve our planet‚Äôs remaining biodiversity and prevent the worst effects of climate change?

Fortunately, saving the planet isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôre obliged to manage on our own. Our collective efforts can make a huge difference, even as the greatest differences will be made in ways that are far beyond the reach of average citizens. And in supporting these efforts, we are far from powerless.

I don‚Äôt mean simply voting for green candidates. I‚Äôm talking about supporting the environmental nonprofits that turn donations into collective action. The nonprofit news sources that inform the public about environmental hazards in their own community. The legal organizations that hold industry accountable and push for greater conservation measures in the private sector and at every level of government. The conservancies that work to protect ecosystems while they are still intact.

Donating to conservation nonprofits is every bit as important as voting for conservation candidates. If we can‚Äôt save the planet and the species who call it home, including us, every other issue we care about will go up in flames, too. That‚Äôs why I support a variety of nonprofits working to preserve and repair wildlife ecosystems, and not just those that work on a global level.

The American South has been my home for my entire life. It is also a region that has suffered terribly from industrial exploitation and political perfidy, a region that stands to suffer even more terribly from the effects of climate change. So I‚Äôve chosen three environmental nonprofits to support financially that are working explicitly to save my homeland.

As Lyndsey Gilpin, founder and editor of Southerly magazine, points out: ‚ÄúIn this region, we have some of the most biodiverse ecosystems and the most deserted news ecosystems. We are bearing the brunt and will lose the most from extreme weather, heat and flooding, but those in power have done the least to stop it.‚Äù

That‚Äôs where Southerly steps in. In the news desert that is much of the rural American South, this rigorously fact-checked nonprofit media organization is growing like kudzu, adding reporters, partnering with other media outlets and reporting environmental news that other news organizations ignore. Southerly, which began as a newsletter in 2016, is especially committed to covering how pollution and climate change affect Black and brown communities.

Southerly‚Äôs recent articles include reports on dangerous lead levels in Mississippi children, how the oil and gas industry is manipulating Louisiana‚Äôs climate task force for its own benefit, Black Georgians holding polluters accountable, and faith leaders in Key West confronting climate change.

Despite the many reasons to despair, Ms. Gilpin‚Äôs team ‚Äî reporting from North Carolina to Texas, West Virginia to Louisiana ‚Äî never gives up hope that accurate information will empower Southerners to demand environmental justice for their own communities.

Demanding justice requires resources, and resources are what too many Southern communities lack. That‚Äôs why I also support the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit, nonpartisan legal advocacy organization for conservation and environmental justice. (Disclosure: My first book, ‚ÄúLate Migrations,‚Äù won the group‚Äôs 2020 book award.) With offices in six states, S.E.L.C. focuses on strengthening environmental protections across the region and holding government and industry accountable.

The organization‚Äôs attorneys, now more than 80 strong, have forced utility companies to clean up unlined coal ash pits leaking toxins into Southern rivers, helped to return captive-bred red wolves to their native habitat, defended millions of acres of national forests from logging and fracking, worked to transform utility policy to make solar energy more widely available to homeowners, and required the federal government to enforce the Clean Water Act. And that‚Äôs just the shortest possible representative list I could manage.

The real list goes on and on because S.E.L.C.‚Äôs impact is truly national: For the last 35 years, the group‚Äôs cases have helped to establish legal precedents that other regions benefit from as well.

There‚Äôs another way to protect the environment that may be less apt to inspire headlines but is nevertheless vital. The Land Trust for Tennessee, like other land trusts around the country, offers one of the simplest, least contentious and most effective ways to preserve the privately held fields and forests that serve as wildlife ecosystems and carbon sinks: Convince landowners to save them.

A conservation easement is a legal mechanism for keeping land in owners‚Äô hands while also limiting what future generations may do with it. It‚Äôs entirely voluntary, allowing conservation work to be tailored to landowner preferences while still working toward the ultimate goal of protecting the land and its ecosystems from development. The landowner remains free to sell the land, donate it or will it to someone else, but the land itself must be maintained according to the terms of the conservation easement. The trust monitors the site to be sure those terms are being honored.

The Land Trust for Tennessee is incredibly effective in using this flexible legal tool to a variety of good ends. The organization has protected not only thousands of acres of individual tracts of land but has also been able ‚Äî by working in partnership with government agencies ‚Äî to add new tracts to existing protected land, enlarging critical wildlife ecosystems in the state.

When 68 acres of grassland along the Hiwassee River were designated as the site of a wastewater treatment plant for a planned high-density residential development, for example, the Land Trust for Tennessee responded by working with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency to raise funds to buy the land. It‚Äôs a small tract by state standards, but it lies along a flyway used by threatened sandhill cranes during migration to their wintering grounds at the nearby Hiwassee Wildlife Refuge. Today that land is part of the wildlife refuge, protected for generations of sandhill cranes. And Tennesseans.

In another example of such partnerships, the Land Trust for Tennessee worked with the University of the South in Sewanee to buy 3,000 acres of timber company land in and surrounding Lost Cove on the Cumberland Plateau. This purchase protects not only the biodiversity-rich cove itself but also enlarges the land already protected by the adjacent Franklin State Forest and Natural Bridge State Natural Area. Combined with conservation easements on three neighboring private tracts, these protected spaces create a large wildlife corridor and protect several rare plant species, some of which exist nowhere else on earth.

It‚Äôs widely believed by people outside the South that our science-denying elected officials represent rank-and-file Southerners‚Äô views about the environment, but that‚Äôs not true. Most people here understand that the climate is warming, whatever their ‚Äúleaders‚Äù profess to believe, and that extreme weather will keep coming. Liberal or conservative, they expect their governments to safeguard their drinking water. Old or young, if a factory is belching out pollutants that make them sick, they want someone to make it stop. Black or brown or white, wealthy or struggling, they are troubled to see a sign on a riverbank warning that the fish are contaminated and unsafe to eat.

Southerly, the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Land Trust for Tennessee are just three of the many regional organizations that are working, through a variety of strategies, to secure a future for everyone that is safe from environmental hazards. More important, they are working to secure a future for the planet that is safe for all its inhabitants, human and nonhuman alike.

What we know, and don‚Äôt, about the effects of climate change on tornadoes.
By Winston Choi-Schagrin

Scientists have been able to draw links between a warming planet and hurricanes, heat waves and droughts, but the same can‚Äôt be said for tornadoes yet.

The deadly tornadoes that pummeled six states on Friday, killing more than 80 people and leaving dozens missing, came at the end of a year of compounding extreme weather events, from heat waves and hurricanes to flooding and wildfires.

Scientists have been able to draw links between a warming planet and hurricanes, heat waves and droughts, attributing the likelihood that climate change played a role in individual isolated events. The same can‚Äôt be said for tornadoes yet.

‚ÄúThis is the hardest phenomenon to connect to climate change,‚Äù said Michael Tippett, an associate professor of applied physics and mathematics at Columbia University who studies extreme weather and climate.

Even as scientists are discovering trends around tornadoes and their behavior, it remains unclear the role that climate change plays. ‚ÄúFor a lot of our questions about climate change and tornadoes, the answer is we don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration‚Äôs National Severe Storms Laboratory. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt see evidence for changes in average annual occurrence or intensity over the last 40 to 60 years.‚Äù

What causes a tornado?

Tornadoes form inside large rotating thunderstorms and the ingredients have to be just right. Tornadoes occur when there is a perfect mix of temperature, moisture profile and wind profile.

When the air is unstable, cold air is pushed over warmer humid air, creating an updraft as the warm air rises. When a wind‚Äôs speed or direction changes over a short distance, the air inside the clouds can start to spin. If the air column begins spinning vertically and rotates near the ground, it can intensify the friction on Earth‚Äôs surface, accelerating the air inward, forming a tornado.

How are they measured?

Like hurricanes and earthquakes, tornadoes are rated on a scale. The Enhanced Fujita, or EF, scale, runs from 0 to 5.

The tornado that traveled across Northeast Arkansas, Tennessee and western Kentucky over the weekend was estimated to be three-quarters of a mile wide with wind speeds that peaked between 158 and 206 miles per hour, giving it a EF rank of at least 3.

Because it‚Äôs challenging to measure the winds in a tornado directly, surveyors usually evaluate tornadoes by their level of damage to different structures.

For instance, they may look to see if the damage is limited to missing roof shingles or whether entire sections of roofs or walls are missing. Based on the level of damage, scientists then reverse-engineer the wind speeds and assign a tornado a rating on the scale.

Have tornadoes changed over the years?

Researchers say that in recent years tornadoes seem to be occurring in greater ‚Äúclusters,‚Äù and that the region known as tornado alley in the Great Plains, where most tornadoes occur, appears to be shifting eastward. The overall number of tornadoes annually is holding steady around 1,200.

Tornadoes in the United States in December are unusual. They typically occur in the spring. Friday‚Äôs tornadoes may have occurred because the wind shear was high (it tends to peak in the winter) and the weather was warmer than normal. This year, the region has experienced an uncharacteristically warm December, and temperatures in Arkansas and Kansas on Friday were in the 70s and 80s.

Is climate change the cause?

The ingredients that give rise to tornadoes include warm, moist air at ground level; cool dry air higher up; and wind shear, which is the change in wind speed or direction. Each of these factors may be affected differently by climate change.

As the planet warms and the climate changes, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt think they are all going to go in the same direction,‚Äù said Dr. Brooks of NOAA. For instance, overall temperature and humidity, which provide energy in the air, may rise with a warming climate, but wind shear may not.

‚ÄúIf there is not enough shear to make something rotate, it doesn‚Äôt matter how strong the energy is.‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there is all kind of wind shear, but you don‚Äôt have a storm, you won‚Äôt get a tornado, either.‚Äù

Although we know that climate change may be playing a role in making some storms more powerful, the complexity of tornadoes means that it is hard to extend that connection with certainty, especially for an individual event.

Scale is everything

A tornado‚Äôs relatively small size also makes it harder to model, the primary tool that scientists use when attributing extreme weather events to climate change. ‚ÄúWe are working at such small scales that the model you would use to do the attribution studies just can‚Äôt capture the phenomenon,‚Äù Dr. Brooks said.

First Fires, Then Floods: Climate Extremes Batter Australia
By Damien Cave and Matthew Abbott

WEE WAA, Australia ‚Äî Two years ago, the fields outside Christina Southwell‚Äôs family home near the cotton capital of Australia looked like a dusty, brown desert as drought-fueled wildfires burned to the north and south.

Last week, after record-breaking rains, muddy floodwaters surrounded her, along with the stench of rotting crops. She had been trapped for days with just her cat, and still didn‚Äôt know when the sludge would recede.

‚ÄúIt seems to take for bloody ever to go away,‚Äù she said, watching a boat carry food into the town of Wee Waa. ‚ÄúAll it leaves behind is this stink, and it‚Äôs just going to get worse.‚Äù

Life on the land has always been hard in Australia, but the past few years have delivered one extreme after another, demanding new levels of resilience and pointing to the rising costs of a warming planet. For many Australians, moderate weather ‚Äî a pleasant summer, a year without a state of emergency ‚Äî increasingly feels like a luxury.

The Black Summer bush fires of 2019 and 2020 were the worst in Australia‚Äôs recorded history. This year, many of the same areas that suffered through those epic blazes endured the wettest, coldest November since at least 1900. Hundreds of people, across several states, have been forced to evacuate. Many more, like Ms. Southwell, are stranded on floodplain islands with no way to leave except by boat or helicopter, possibly until after Christmas.

And with a second year of the weather phenomenon known as La Ni√±a in full swing, meteorologists are predicting even more flooding for Australia‚Äôs east coast, adding to the stress from the pandemic, not to mention from a recent rural mouse plague of biblical proportions.

‚ÄúIt feels constant,‚Äù said Brett Dickinson, 58, a wheat farmer who lives not far from Ms. Southwell in northwest New South Wales, about a six-hour drive from Sydney. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre constantly battling all the elements ‚Äî and the animals too.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a tendency to think of such extremes as ‚Äúnatural disasters‚Äù or ‚Äúacts of God‚Äù that come and go with news reports. But Australia‚Äôs nightmares of nature ebb and flow. Its droughts and floods, though weather opposites, are driven by the same forces ‚Äî some of them timeless, others newer and caused by humans.

Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Center of Excellence for Climate Extremes at the University of New South Wales, said the ups and downs of weather had been severe for millenniums on the Australian landmass, which is as large as the continental United States and surrounded by powerful climate-driving oceans, from the tropical South Pacific to the colder Southern Ocean off Antarctica.

As a consequence, the El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a patterns tend to hit Australia harder than they do other places, with harsh droughts that end with major floods. Some scientists even suggest that the way marsupials reproduce, with the ability to put active pregnancies on pause, shows that the El Ni√±o-La Ni√±a cycle has been around long enough for flora and fauna to adapt.

On top of that already-intense variability, Professor Pitman said, are now two additional complicating factors: ‚Äúclimate change and human decisions around building things.‚Äù

Both make fires and floods more damaging.

‚ÄúA small change in climate coupled with a small change in landscapes can have a large impact on flood characteristics,‚Äù Professor Pitman said.

The results are already visible in government budgets. The cost of climate disasters in Australia has more than doubled since the 1970s.

Ron Campbell, the mayor of Narrabri Shire, which includes Wee Waa, said his area was still waiting for government payments to offset damage from past catastrophes. He wondered when governments would stop paying for infrastructure repairs after every emergency.

‚ÄúThe costs are just enormous, not just here but at all the other places in similar circumstances,‚Äù he said.

More viscerally, the impact of a ‚Äúsupercharged climate‚Äù is drawn on the land itself. Across the vast tracts of farmland and small towns between Melbourne and Sydney where much of the country‚Äôs food, cattle, wine ‚Äî and coal ‚Äî are produced, the effects of fire, drought and flood coexist.

Even in areas that did not burst into flames, the heat waves and lack of rainfall that preceded the bush fires killed as much as 60 percent of the trees in some places. Cattle farmers culled so much of their herds during the drought that beef prices have risen more than 50 percent as they rush to restock paddocks nourished (nearly to death) by heavy rain.

Bryce Guest, a helicopter pilot in Narrabri, once watched the dust bowls grow from above. Then came ‚Äújust a monstrous amount of rain,‚Äù he said, and new kind of job: flights to mechanical pumps pushing water from fields to irrigation dams in a last-ditch effort to preserve crops that had been heading for a record harvest.

On one recent flight, he pointed to mountains of stored grain ‚Äî worth six figures, at least ‚Äî that were ruined by the rains, with heavy equipment trapped and rusting next to it. Further inland, a home surrounded by levees had become a small island accessible only by boat or copter.

‚ÄúAustralia is all about water ‚Äî everything revolves around it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere you put your home, your stock. Everything.‚Äù

The flood plains in what is known as the Murray-Darling basin stretch out for hundreds of miles, not unlike the land at the mouth of the Mississippi River. The territory is so flat that towns can be cut off with roads flooded by less than an inch of additional rain.

That happened a few weeks ago in Bedgerabong, a few hundred miles south of Narrabri. On a recent afternoon, a couple of teachers were being driven out of town in a hulking fire truck ‚Äî equipment for one disaster often serves another. Across a flooded road behind them, three other teachers had decided to camp out so they could provide some consistency for children who had already been kept out of school for months by pandemic lockdowns.

Paul Faulkner, 55, the principal of the school (total enrollment: 42), said that many parents craved social connection for their children. The Red Cross has sent in booklets for those struggling with stress and anxiety.

‚ÄúCovid has kept everyone from their families,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis just isolates them even more.‚Äù

He admitted that there were a few things they did not discuss; Santa, for one. The town is expected to be cut off until after the holidays as the waters that rose with surging rains over a few days take weeks to drain and fade.

In Wee Waa, where the water has started to recede, supplies and people flowed in and out last week by helicopter and in a small boat piloted by volunteers.

Still, there were shortages everywhere ‚Äî mostly of people. In a community of around 2,000 people, half of the teachers at the local public school couldn‚Äôt make it to work.

At the town‚Äôs only pharmacy, Tien On, the owner, struggled with a short-handed staff to keep up with requests. He was especially concerned about delayed drug deliveries by helicopter for patients with mental health medications.

Ms. Southwell, 69, was better prepared than most. She spent 25 years volunteering with emergency services and has been teaching first aid for decades. After a quick trip into Wee Waa by boat, she returned to her home with groceries and patience, checking a shed for the stray cats she feeds and discovering that only one of her chickens appeared to have drowned.

She said she wasn‚Äôt sure how much climate change could be blamed for the floods; her father had put their house on higher stilts because they knew the waters would rise on occasion.

All she knew was that more extreme weather and severe challenges to the community would be coming their way.

‚ÄúThe worst part of it is the waiting,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd the cleanup.‚Äù

A P. R. Giant Is Caught Between Climate Pledges and Fossil Fuel Clients
By Tiffany Hsu

Edelman has worked for Exxon Mobil and Shell while making strong public statements in favor of environmental sustainability. At a recent companywide meeting, employees had some sharp questions.

After last month‚Äôs United Nations-sponsored environmental conference in Glasgow, the public relations giant Edelman praised the participants for reaching ‚Äúa new level of international consensus that climate change is an existential threat to humanity.‚Äù

In a statement posted on its website, Edelman also called for ‚Äúmore scrutiny on corporate climate lobbying efforts‚Äù and argued that many of the pledges that resulted from the conference ‚Äúfall far short of what is necessary to avert global climate disaster.‚Äù

Coming from a company that has worked with Exxon Mobil, Shell and trade groups that lobby for the fossil fuel industry, the pro-environment stance rang hollow to some people inside and outside the company.

Some of the criticism leveled at Edelman came in the form of a petition from Clean Creatives, an initiative led by the environmental activist Jamie Henn that takes aim at public relations companies and advertising agencies that work with oil and gas corporations. The petition was circulated at the time of the conference, known as COP26, and was signed by more than 100 people, including activists, academics, authors, actors, diplomats and filmmakers.

‚ÄúSeveral private conversations with Edelman to ask them to drop these clients have led nowhere,‚Äù the petition said. ‚ÄúGiven the stakes, we are now going public with our demand to Edelman: Drop Exxon Mobil and all other fossil-fuel clients.‚Äù

Public relations companies are nothing if not image conscious, and the petition prompted the company to schedule a videoconference for its employees on Nov. 15 to address the issue.

Richard Edelman, the chief executive and the son of the company‚Äôs founder, led the meeting, which was attended by thousands of employees. On the call, he described climate change as the greatest threat facing humanity and said that business leaders should take the lead in trying to solve it, according to three employees who described the meeting on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. He also said Edelman had started a 60-day review of the companies it represents to make sure they are environmentally responsible, according to the people.

One employee posed a question: Would Edelman potentially walk away from its fossil fuel clients? According to the three employees, Mr. Edelman‚Äôs answer was blunt: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

He added that the energy industry was in transition and needed Edelman‚Äôs services. He went on to say that Edelman will reject projects that delay progress toward a future with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

Mr. Edelman and other company leaders did not address more than 50 questions about Edelman‚Äôs oil and gas work submitted by employees in a chat room accompanying the video meeting. Many of those questions expressed skepticism about Edelman‚Äôs work for fossil fuel companies while championing environmental initiatives.

As global warming takes a worsening toll on the planet, the energy industry is working to reduce climate-damaging emissions by investing in a technology known as carbon capture and storage, among other ventures. At the same time, 45 banks, insurers and asset managers have pledged to use the $130 trillion they control to hit net-zero emissions targets in their investments by 2050, a goal that critics have said doesn‚Äôt go far enough because the financial institutions continue to invest in fossil fuel companies.

A number of public relations companies and advertising agencies have cut ties with the oil and gas industry in recent years, wary of burnishing the images of companies that have played a role in damaging the environment. Edelman‚Äôs strategy is less clear-cut. It says on its website that it thinks ‚Äúvery carefully about which businesses we work for.‚Äù

The 69-year-old company has a longstanding relationship with fossil fuels. It began working with Shell, Europe‚Äôs largest oil company, more than 15 years ago. This fall, as Edelman prepared to move its headquarters out of the Aon Center in Chicago, Mr. Edelman wrote a blog post that described how his father had loved the location: ‚ÄúHe was so proud that his company was in the same building as giant Standard Oil of Indiana.‚Äù

In a statement to The New York Times, Edelman said that it was ‚Äúunable to comment on specific client engagements due to confidentiality commitments with all of our clients,‚Äù adding that it would not work with climate change deniers, a policy the company established in 2015.

Companies in the business of shaping public opinion are likely to side with oil and gas companies for as long as they can keep taking their money, which can be significant, said Christine Arena, who resigned as an executive vice president of Edelman‚Äôs corporate responsibility division in 2015 along with five colleagues who had expressed concerns about the company‚Äôs work for fossil fuel clients.

‚ÄúThe agency was more weighted toward fossil fuel clients and, therefore, the interests of those clients, and that will probably continue as long as fossil fuel marketers don‚Äôt face the types of restrictions that tobacco or pharmaceutical companies face,‚Äù said Ms. Arena, who now runs a production company, Generous Films.

She said that Edelman‚Äôs pledge not to work with climate change deniers was empty. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a convenient thing, to say they don‚Äôt work for climate deniers, because none of the big trade organizations for fossil fuel corporations are saying they believe climate change is a hoax,‚Äù Ms. Arena said.

Edelman has long had unpopular clients. In 2019, after objections from its own employees, Edelman decided to stop working with GEO Group, a private prisons business that had government contracts with the Trump administration to run immigrant detention centers. For decades, Edelman helped promote cigarettes and only stopped in 1997, after Mr. Edelman was urged to drop British American Tobacco as a client.

In 2019, the Massachusetts attorney general filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil accusing it of deceiving investors about the dangers of climate change. In a section on Exxon Mobil‚Äôs efforts to hide what it knew about the fossil fuel industry‚Äôs role in the problem, the lawsuit notes that Edelman was among the public relations companies hired by the oil and gas giant, which the attorney general accused of running ‚Äúa tobacco industry-style campaign to sow doubt and confusion among the public.‚Äù

In 2018, Edelman was paid $4.4 million by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbyist group, making it the trade body‚Äôs second-highest paid independent contractor, according to the group‚Äôs tax filings.

Casey Norton, a spokesman for Exxon, declined to comment on its dealings with public relations companies and advertising agencies. Mr. Norton said in an email that Exxon has ‚Äúa responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to represent their interests in public policy discussions that impact our business.‚Äù

Debbie Davis, an assistant dean at the college of media and communication at Texas Tech University, said that many public relations companies remain eager to work with all kinds of clients, even if it means criticism.

‚ÄúThere are still agencies that work with casinos and tobacco companies ‚Äî those are the choices made through capitalism,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEdelman has multiple choices. They can choose to take a stand, they might go more middle of the road, or they might decide not to change at all.‚Äù

Earth Is Getting a ‚ÄòBlack Box‚Äô to Hold Humans Accountable for Climate Change
By Livia Albeck-Ripka

When a plane crashes, its flight recorder is critical to piecing together the missteps that led to calamity. Now the planet is getting its own in case it self-destructs.

In a remote part of Australia, a steel vault about the size of a school bus will record the Earth‚Äôs warming weather patterns. It will listen to what we say and do. It will create an archive that could be critical to piecing together the missteps, its creators say, should humanity be destroyed by climate change.

The vault, known as Earth‚Äôs Black Box, will be constructed in Tasmania, an Australian island state off the south coast. It will operate much like a plane‚Äôs flight recorder, which records an aircraft‚Äôs final moments before crashing. But the makers of this new black box ‚Äî including data researchers from the University of Tasmania, artists and architects ‚Äî say they hope it won‚Äôt have to be opened.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm on the plane; I don‚Äôt want it to crash,‚Äù said Jim Curtis, the executive creative director of an Australian advertising agency where the project was conceived. ‚ÄúI really hope that it‚Äôs not too late.‚Äù

Many questions remain, such as whether Earth really needs a black box and how future generations would decipher it. Mr. Curtis said the box would be designed ‚Äúto hold our leaders to account.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIf civilization does crash, this box will survive with a completely objective data story.‚Äù

Climate change is one of the gravest threats humanity faces, scientists say. It is exacerbating economic and health inequalities, increasing the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and, the United Nations has warned, threatens the world‚Äôs food supply.

In November, negotiators at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow reached a consensus that all countries had to act more swiftly to prevent a catastrophic rise in world temperatures. Scientists have warned that if they rise beyond a threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, the risk of disasters like water shortages, deadly heat waves and ecosystem collapse will grow immensely. (The world has already warmed by 1.1 degrees Celsius.)

And so some conceived of a black box.

The project is not alone in its attempt to jolt human beings out of what the creators suggest is short-term thinking about global warming. It is not the first to try to salvage pieces of human civilization for posterity. Scientists have built repositories for everything from essential food crops to glacier ice to frozen animal embryos, some of them already extinct. Others have tried to hide our nuclear waste so that future generations can avoid the deathly toxic material.

The box‚Äôs creators say it will record leaders‚Äô actions (or inaction) by scraping the internet for keywords relating to climate change from newspapers, social media and peer-reviewed journals. It will collect daily metrics, including average oceanic and land temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and biodiversity loss.

The vault ‚Äî a 33-foot-long box made of three-inch thick steel ‚Äî is not expected to be completed until the middle of next year. But creators say they have already begun to gather information. Eventually, the data will be stored on a giant, automated, solar-powered hard drive with a capacity to collect information for about 50 years.

Tasmania was chosen for its relative geopolitical and environmental safety, and the monolith will be designed to be resilient against threats including cyclones, earthquakes and, with its sloped walls, attacks by vandals.

David Midson, general manager of the local council overseeing much of Tasmania‚Äôs rugged west coast, where the box will be constructed, said the response from residents to the project had been largely positive.

‚ÄúThere has been a lot of curiosity and interest around the box,‚Äù Mr. Midson said, adding that though permits were yet to be approved, he was optimistic.

Some scientists doubt that climate change will wipe us out completely.

Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University, who says that though the effects of climate change are extremely grave, ‚Äúit would be a real mistake to confuse whether or not climate change poses an extinction risk to humans with whether or not climate change poses a very real, present and intensifying risk to humans and to ecosystems.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs very little evidence,‚Äù Professor Diffenbaugh stressed, ‚Äúthat global warming threatens the survival of the human species.‚Äù

A more likely scenario if humans do not significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he added, would be a world in which some places disappear below sea level, many others become too hot for humans to comfortably inhabit, and hazards like heat waves, droughts and storms become more common.

Some also note that climate change data are already being recorded by scientists and other researchers.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easily accessible or comprehensible to most people,‚Äù Daniel Kevles, a historian of science at Yale University, said of the black box. Though it may have some merit as a document for the future, he added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not all that impressed with regard to its consequential impact for warning us.‚Äù

Though the information can be found elsewhere, the creators insist, it is not stored for posterity in one immutable place.

How will future visitors retrieve the contents of the box?

The creators say they are working on it. One option is to encode the contents in various formats, such as in script or binary code that would be unraveled. The creators say that if the planet is nearing cataclysm, instructions for opening the box would be etched on its exterior. The message can‚Äôt be included beforehand, they say, because of the risk that vandals would attempt to crack it open.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in Beta,‚Äù said Michael Ritchie, who runs a production company based in Sydney, Australia, that is managing the project. For now, ‚Äúpeople are on notice,‚Äù Mr. Ritchie said, adding, ‚ÄúWe want to make sure that we don‚Äôt crash this earth.‚Äù

Scotland to 'phase out' petrol and diesel cars

Target for next 10 years laid out in climate change plan, amid concerns expensive targets will hurt poorest
By Georgina Hayes

THE sale of new petrol and diesel cars in Scotland is to be ""phased out"" in the next 10 years, prompting concerns over the affordability of government plans to fight climate change for ordinary Scots.

Scottish ministers published a 255- page Climate Change Plan yesterday, setting out more details of how they aim to achieve targets set by an earlier programme in 2018. Among the targets include a commitment to cutting the distance travelled in car journeys by a fifth by 2030 alongside more than 100 other policies to help Scotland reach its emissions reduction targets.

With a goal of reaching ""net-zero"" by 2045, other announcements in the ""world-leading"" aspiration to tackle climate change include ¬£180million in funding for carbon capture and hydrogen technologies. It also includes ¬£120million towards zero-emission buses and ¬£50million for ""active freeways"" along major travel routes.

However, while the plan acknowl edges that persuading Scots to use their cars less often will require a national effort with better digital connectivity and more flexible and remote working needed to cut commuting, concerns have been raised over how to make the plan affordable for ordinary people.

""There are serious amounts of money committed here, and you've got to spend the money in the right way and have a plan,"" said Professor Karen Turner, director of Strathclyde University's Centre for Energy Policy.

""We need to make sure that we can deliver net zero in a way that doesn't disproportionately affect people on low-income jobs,"" she told The Daily Telegraph. ""I'm concerned about how we keep the economy going and narrow some of those inequalities.""

Prof Turner said that while climate change policy has often been domi nated by finding ""the right technological solutions"", the plan is also a ""societal transition about how people live and work"", which affects ordinary people ""beyond reaching targets"".

""It's difficult to achieve these things if you don't have affordable options for them,"" she added.

For example, public transport infrastructure must first be up to scratch if people are to reduce the number of miles travelled in cars, she said.

""In the Central Belt we have lots of choices but it's quite expensive, and people living in more rural communities might not have an awful lot of options,"" said Prof Turner, adding that people may also have ""range anxiety"" about electric cars. Moving away from petrol and diesel cars to electric can be expensive and if people can't afford a new vehicle then that ""runs the risk of boosting the secondhand market"".

Prof Turner also warned an ""affordable alternative"" to current heating systems is needed now to achieve the targets, as the most cost-effective option is still to buy another gas boiler.

""Heating is a really big challenge we face,"" she said. ""It's all very well to offer a subsidy, but if you subsidise someone to put in a new system that doesn't help them with their bills.

""There's so much attention at the moment on both government spending to do the upfront spend part, but the solution involves increased costs. That could end up being a bigger problem than the upfront cost."" Announcing the new blueprint, Climate Change Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said Scotland's targets were ""rightly ambitious and extremely stretching"".

She added: ""We will need to be innovative, to learn as we are going and to utilise new and exciting technologies and ideas, seizing on the multiple benefits our journey to net-zero presents.""

However, while ambitious, the plan has been criticised by campaigners as falling short of the action necessary to tackle climate change quickly.

Jess Cowell of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ""While there are welcome policy improvements, unfortunately there are very real doubts that this plan as a whole will actually deliver on these commitments.""

Kerry set to take on US climate envoy role
By Tony Diver

JOE BIDEN is set to appoint John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, as his special envoy on climate change, The Daily Telegraph understands.

Mr Kerry, who has been vocal on the issue of climate change, is expected to be appointed to represent the United States at international events including the UK's COP26 conference next year.

Mr Kerry worked with Mr Biden, the president-elect, during their time in the Obama administration, as secretary of state and vice-president respectively.

A British figure close to Mr Kerry told The Telegraph his appointment would likely be announced after Mr Biden's cabinet is formed, but hiring decisions for the next administration are not expected for some weeks.

If he is offered the role, Mr Kerry's appointment would not need to be confirmed by the US Senate. He would work under the secretary of state, the equivalent of the UK's foreign secretary.

Since leaving the Obama administration and ostensibly retiring, Mr Kerry has signed an agreement to publish his memoirs and commentated on American politics.

He has been a fierce critic of Donald Trump's presidency and a cheerleader for Mr Biden.

Asked about Mr Biden's suitability for the presidency in December 2019, Mr Kerry said: ""He'll be ready on day one to put back together the country and the world that Trump has broken apart."" As special envoy, Mr Kerry would be responsible for attending events designed to reach consensus on climate issues, including COP26, which is being hosted in Glasgow next year.

Boris Johnson has invited Mr Biden to attend COP26 himself. In a call to the president-elect on Tuesday, Mr Johnson congratulated Mr Biden and suggested the UK and US could work together on climate policy.

A statement released by Downing

Street said the leaders share priorities on ""tackling climate change, promoting democracy, and building back better from the pandemic"".

Mr Biden has pledged to rejoin the Paris accords, an international agreement on climate and emissions Mr Trump abandoned.

The Paris accords were originally signed by Mr Kerry on behalf of the US.

Mr Biden has also vowed to make US electricity production carbon-free by 2035 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The UN Climate Change Conference was delayed by the pandemic.

Common ground on climate can help Johnson dispel 'Trump clone' claims
By Emma Gatten environment editor

CLIMATE change could prove the Government's best in-road to the new Biden administration, and help dispel the incoming president's impression that Boris Johnson is a Trump ""clone"".

While the Government squares up for a clash on post-Brexit trade talks, there are already moves to tackle what both leaders see as one of the greatest challenges society faces.

Donald Trump may have sung the Prime Minister's praises during his presidency, but on climate change the two have never seen eye-to-eye.

Mr Trump pulled America out of the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming below 1.5C, vowed to protect fossil fuel industries and rolled back environmental protections.

Meanwhile, the UK became the first major economy to commit to net zero emissions by 2050 and next year will host the COP26 summit, the most important climate meeting since the Paris accord was reached in 2015.

In contrast to Mr Trump, Joe Biden has said climate change is the ""number one issue facing humanity"" and has a $2trillion plan for a low-carbon transition. He also pledged to re-enter the Paris Agreement on his first day in office.

Speaking about Mr Biden's win on Sunday, Mr Johnson said he was ""really excited"" for the global consensus on climate change.

""With President Biden in the White House in Washington, we have the real prospect of American global leadership in tackling climate change,"" he said.

The Prime Minister is personally invested in the success of COP26, which he sees as the perfect moment for the UK to emerge on the diplomatic stage post-Brexit.

Britain will be hoping to pull off a diplomatic victory by securing new commitments at the summit on meeting the Paris climate aims.

Unable to work directly with the Trump administration, the Govern ment has quietly continued talks with Democrat-led state governments and city administrations ahead of the summit. It can point to commitments on net zero from Ford and Facebook, among others, as direct wins from those efforts.

Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, has become a particular ""friend"" of the COP26 team. He co-chaired the Biden campaign and is tipped for a cabinet post.

That could help grease the wheels with the Biden camp as the Govern ment works to secure more deals on reducing emissions over the next year.

Mr Johnson also will be hoping that a long-awaited speech setting out his green ambitions that is expected in the next few weeks will catch the new president's ear and put some distance between himself and Mr Trump.

Climate change 'has doubled disasters'
By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

CLIMATE change is largely responsible for a doubling in the number of natural disasters since 2000, the United Nations said yesterday, as it warned that the Earth was becoming uninhabitable for millions of humans.

Three quarters of a billion more people were affected by catastrophic events of nature over the past two decades than in the 20 years before, the UN's office for disaster risk reduction said.

Calling humanity ""wilfully destructive"", it said the data was a wake-up call to governments that had failed to take the threat of climate change seriously or to prepare for more natural disasters.

""It is baffling that we willingly and knowingly continue to sow the seeds of our own destruction, despite the sci ence and evidence that we are turning our home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people,"" the authors said.

The report found that there were 7,348 major recorded disaster events between 2000 and 2019, compared with 4,212 between 1980 and 1999.

Climate-related disasters explained the bulk of the rise, increasing from 3,656 to 6,681. Floods and storms were the most common events. The inci dence of flooding more than doubled, from 1,389 to 3,254.

Mami Mizutori, the UN's representative for disaster risk reduction, said that NGOs and emergency services were ""fighting an uphill battle against an ever-rising tide of extreme weather events"". She added: ""The odds are being stacked against us when we fail to act on science and early warnings to invest in prevention, climate-change adaptation and disaster-risk reduction,"" she said.

Asia was the worst-hit continent, and China the worst-affected country, followed by the US. Overall, just over 4billion people were affected by disasters, a rise from 3.25billion.

Though mobile phone technology and improved weather forecasting limited the lives lost to natural disasters, with the death toll growing from 1.19million to 1.23million, the economic impact grew significantly, with agriculture in particular disrupted. While they were less common, geophysical disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis were the most deadly, with the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which killed 226,400, recorded as the largest single event by death toll, followed by the 2010 earthquake in Haiti.

2020 was not included in the data, but has so far seen one of the most active fire and hurricane seasons the US has ever experienced, as well as significant flooding across Asia.

Climate scientists warned that a warmer climate makes hurricanes and severe storms more likely, and pro motes the conditions that allow forest fires to start and spread. "

No time to waste on tackling
climate change, says PM

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

THERE is ""no time to waste"" on climate action, the Prime Minister has warned, as he prepared to unveil a 10-point plan setting out the Government's priorities for the environment.

Boris Johnson called on other governments to disclose their own plans for action, calling climate change ""the most enduring threat to the futures of our children and grandchildren"".

""There is no greater duty for any nation than protecting our people and our planet,"" he said.

His comments were made a year ahead of the international COP26 cli mate summit, which was supposed to take place in Glasgow this week, but was delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic. Mr Johnson is expected to lay out the Government's priorities in an announcement within the next week.

The Government has previously announced its goal to reach net zero by 2050, and priorities including investment in wind energy, the protection and restoration of biodiversity, planting trees, and the restoration of peat bogs.

The plan is expected to prioritise the use of new technologies such as hydrogen fuel, nuclear expansion and an earlier date for the phase out of petrol cars, which is currently set at 2035 but is expected to be moved to 2032 or even 2030.

Greenpeace UK said: ""Boris Johnson is right to call on world leaders to waste no time in setting out their commit ments to cut carbon emissions, but the Prime Minister's actions will carry far more weight than his words."""

Climate change is blamed for record number of storms
By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

THE current Atlantic hurricane season has broken the record for the highest number of named storms.

Storm Theta, which formed over night on Monday, brought the 2020 season to 29 storms, breaking the record of 27 named storms set in 2005.

As well as Theta, which is not forecast to make landfall, storm Eta is also active, hitting Florida earlier this week after leaving around 200 people dead or missing in Central America.

It is unusual to have two storms active at the same time this late in the year, and this is the first time this has happened since 1932.

Scientists said the active season had been fuelled by man-made global warming as well as La Ni√±a, the natural weather event which creates favourable conditions for hurricanes.

Prof Michael Mann, director of the earth system science centre at Pennsylvania State University, said the total outstripped his pre-season forecast of 24.

""As we continue to warm the planet and the tropical Atlantic, there is more energy to fuel more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes.

""When we get a La Ni√±a event, as with this year, it reinforces the impact that climate change is having and we get the sorts of devastating storm seasons that we are witnessing,"" he said.

Storms are typically named from the Latin alphabet but this year scientists had to begin using the Greek alphabet after running out of letters for only the second time in history.

Prince William is right about climate change

Rather than tired, statist greenery, his Earthshot prize will use incentives to fix environmental issues
matthew lynn

Amillion for coming up with ways to reduce carbon emissions. Another six-figure sum for smarter ways to recycle waste. And yet more for devising ways of capturing the force of the wind and the waves to replace fossil fuels. There will be plenty of big prizes on offer from Prince William's Earthshot project, designed to reward breakthroughs in the battle against climate change.

But the biggest prize of all might be something entirely different. In truth, the Prince is harnessing the power of competition and incentives to fix the challenge posed by global warming. That is far better, and far more likely to be effective, than the stale, joyless, anti-capitalist rhetoric of most of the environmental movement. If the project can convert the greens to markets, that really will be an achievement.

After the Nobel, Earthshot promises to be one of the most valuable prizes on offer globally. In total, it will make ¬£50 million available over the course of a decade. Every year, five prizes, each worth ¬£1 million will be awarded for examples of genuine innovation, with the competition open to individuals and teams from anywhere in the world. If you have a smart idea, and it shows some prospect of working, then the money will be yours both to reward the moment of inspiration and to take it into development.

It would be easy to be cynical, but that would be unfair. Prizes have a long history of solving tricky problems. The most famous of all was the Longitude Prize awarded by the British in 1714, and eventually won by an obscure clockmaker called John Harrison with an idea considered so outlandish at the time that no one used it for years. But they have been deployed far more widely than that. Most recently, the Netflix Prize awarded $1 million for coming up with an algorithm that could work out which shows we wanted to binge-watch next (and, boy, did that work). The Mercatus

Centre at George Mason University has launched a series of prizes for combating Covid-19, with up to $500,000 on offer for novel treatments and smaller rewards for achievements such as innovation in social distancing (and, heck, really it should be a billion at least, given the scale of the problem).

The point about prizes is this. They are a great way to encourage solutions to novel and difficult problems. In many ways, they mimic a free market. They provide incentives: invent something new and you get rich. And they are open to outsiders, allowing all kinds of new ideas to crash into the system. Top-down, state-led bureaucracies are very, very bad at innovation. When they see a new idea, the first instinct is to crush it, and the second is to regulate it. But prizes are the scientific equivalent of a start-up hub in Shoreditch or Silicon Valley. Lots of new ideas jostle against each other, sparking a round of creativity, and the best ones survive.

If you want to combat climate change, that is what will actually work. Over the past decade, we have started to find lots of different ways to reduce pollution while maintaining our lifestyles. Only this week, British Airways retired the last of its gasguzzling 747s, replacing them with planes that are 25 per cent more fuelefficient. In Germany, sales of hybrid and electric cars overtook diesels this month. The price of solar panels has dropped by almost 90 per cent over the past decade - power from the Sun is now close to undercutting any of its traditional rivals. Some of the ideas are big (like electric cars) and some are small (like biodegradable bags). But each one makes a difference at the margin. Taken together, they can add up to a transformation.

Most of the environmental movement, from Greta Thunberg to the Prince's collaborator on Earthshot, Sir David Attenborough, remain stuck in a tired anti-capitalist, anti-production groove. Sure, we could cut pollution by living in cold, dark caves, eating berries all day. But like a kind of green lockdown, that wouldn't be sustainable for very long, nor would it work for anyone other than a handful of fanatics.

With innovators and entrepreneurs using their imagination, we can clean up the environment and maintain growth, while also preserving the planet. The Prince's initiative might even convince a few of his fellow campaigners of that simple truth - and that really would be a prize worth having. "

Climate change brings warmer nights
By Helena Horton

CLIMATE change is causing more muggy evenings, scientists have found, as data shows nights are warming at a faster rate than days.

A new study by the University of Exeter, published in Global Change Biology, found that nights from 1983 to 2017 warmed at an average rate of 0.25 degrees more than the days in more than half of the areas surveyed.

The research shows this ""warming asymmetry"" has been driven primarily by changing levels of cloud cover.

Increased cloud cover cools the surface during the day and retains the warmth during the night, leading to greater night-time warming. Whereas, decreasing cloud cover allows more warmth to reach the surface during the day, but that heat is lost at night.

The areas in which the days were warming at a faster rate than nights had less cloud cover, but in general clouds are increasing due to climate change.

Warmer nights tend to be wetter, scientists explained, warning this could impact on plant and invertebrate life.

""Warming asymmetry has potentially significant implications for the natural world,"" said lead author Dr Daniel Cox, of the Environment and Sus tainability Institute on Exeter's Penryn Campus in Cornwall.

""We demonstrate that greater nighttime warming is associated with the climate becoming wetter, and this has been shown to have important consequences for plant growth and how species, such as insects and mammals, interact.""

Scientists also found that drier conditions in the day meant that animals could die of heat stress or dehydration.

Dr Cox said: ""Conversely, we also show that greater daytime warming is associated with drier conditions, combined with greater levels of overall warming, which increases species' vul-nerability to heat stress and dehydration. Species that are only active at night or during the day will be particularly affected.""

But warming, whether daytime or at night, caused fewer plants to grow. Increased night-time warming led to less vegetation growth where it rained more, probably due to cloud cover blocking the sun. Where the days warmed more, vegetation growth was limited by water availability due to less rainfall.

The global study examined hourly records of temperature, cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation.

The authors modelled different rates of change of daytime maximum and night-time minimum temperatures, and mean daytime and mean night-time cloud cover, specific humidity and precipitation.

Uncomfortably hot nights are on the rise in the UK, the Met Office said earlier this year. During the summer heatwave, we saw 16 ""tropical nights"" above 20C.

Climate change may wipe out UK garden birds by 2100
By Helena Horton

BRITAIN'S garden birds could be wiped out in 80 years if climate change continues to accelerate, research from the University of Oxford has warned.

Warmer weather earlier in the year could disrupt the ecosystem balance which keeps small birds which visit our gardens alive. Great tits and similar species rely on large amounts of larvae being born at around the same time in order to feed their young.

They have evolved to breed at the same time so they can keep their chicks alive. But if weather patterns shift, their food sources will come out earlier, and not be as abundant when the birds feed their young. The larvae feed on leaves, and when the temperature rises, the leaves come out earlier, causing the larvae to be produced earlier. While the great tit, below, can evolve to keep up with prey when change is slow, a faster change in temperature could see the birds left behind.

The ""breaking point"" is estimated to be when larvae and leaves are produced 24 days earlier than currently. If that happens, great tits could be extinct here by 2100, said lead author Prof Emily Simmonds, from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology which produced the report with Oxford University. ""If the changes happen too fast, species can become extinct,"" she said. ""Great tits won't always be able to keep up with changes in the larvae supply. The good news is that they can survive scenarios with lower or medium warming trends.""

GROWING CONCERNS

Will the planting of millions of trees really help to slow the rate of climate change, asks Ken Thompson

Anyone who can remember as far back as the last election will recall the various parties trying to outbid each other with how many trees they were going to plant. Many others have similar ideas - the National Trust is planning to plant 20 million over the next 10 years, and TSB Bank is promising to plant a tree for every mortgage sold. Whether any of these trees need planting is a question for another day (trees are very good at planting themselves, given the opportunity), but what will all these trees achieve?

One of the main motives is to absorb and lock up carbon from the atmos phere, thus helping to slow the rate of climate change. How good are trees at doing that? Before we can answer that, we need to think about where all those trees might go. In a crowded country like Britain, many would have to go in uninhabited (or sparsely populated) uplands; it's estimated, for example, that fully a third of Scotland could be suitable (biologically, if not politically) for establishing new woodlands.

At least some of this potential new woodland would replace heather moorland. And we don't have to guess what happens if you do that, because a variety of experimental plantings, of varying ages, already exist. Researchers have looked at four of these, planted with either birch or Scots pine, and aged from 12 to 39 years, to see how carbon storage is getting on. Their results are published in Global Change Biology.

The trees, naturally, store carbon as they grow, so the effect of planting trees is always to increase above-ground carbon storage. Unfortunately, there is a corresponding reduction in the amount of carbon stored in the soil, which more or less exactly matches the increase above-ground, so the net effect is zero. The underlying reasons for loss of soil carbon are complex, but there is cer tainly a big increase in soil respiration, i.e. in carbon lost from the soil as carbon dioxide. More dissolved organic carbon may be lost in drainage water too, but that hasn't been measured.

Disappointing as this result is, the reality is probably even worse. These results come from fairly small experimental plots and water flowing in from the surrounding moorland means that their effect on soil water content is negligible. But if whole landscapes are afforested, we know that trees have a powerful drying effect on the soil, which further increases soil respiration, so we can reasonably expect that planting trees on heather moorland would lead to an overall loss of stored carbon.

Of course, there are lots of other good reasons for planting trees, and planting trees in the right place can undoubtedly contribute to carbon storage. But concern about loss of soil carbon means that planting trees on peat more than 50cm deep is already prohibited, and these results suggest that if we want to maximise the benefits, we need to be even more careful about where we plant trees in the uplands. Incidentally, this work illustrates the importance of long-term research into issues like sustainability and climate change, where the ""obvious"" answer is not always the right one. Visit ecologicalcontinuity trust.org for more details on this.

Should any of this affect what you do in your garden? No, not at all. Your garden doesn't have the kind of soil where this would be a problem, and anyway the other impacts of trees, on biodiversity, temperature and flooding, mean that planting a tree is still one of the best things you can do for the environment.

Gilt-edged solution to UK's climate
change mission

Green bonds can help build the Government's infrastructure revolution and
preserve the planet

GARETH DAVIES

Margaret Thatcher helped define the mission on climate change when she said: ""Global warming is real enough for us to make changes so that we do not live at the expense of future generations."" While debt normally lets us live at the expense of tomorrow, issuing green gilts will allow us to invest in our planet's health - and future generations will need it.

As well as an environmental crisis, we face an unprecedented public health crisis, placing a huge toll on the UK economy. Many businesses are suffering despite the extensive government support offered. Billions in loans, furlough and other schemes have let us survive the crash, but now we need to thrive in the recovery.

The environment is not a separate problem to the economy, but an opportunity to invest and level up. It is a chance for the Chancellor to reframe our economy to meet the long-term needs of our people and the planet.

A renewed focus on capital investment will be critical. The planned ""infrastructure revolution"" outlined in the March Budget must go ahead, as must the wider ""levelling up"" agenda. But let's make it a green infrastructure revolution, and level up to create new green jobs. The UK Government should issue a sovereign green gilt to fund capital investment in infrastructure, creating new jobs, technology and transport.

A conventional ""gilt'"" or bond is simply a loan made to the government. Green bonds are different in that they ring-fence funding for green projects.

Issuing green bonds could be the tonic for all our ills - it will fight climate change, it will raise capital to invest in infrastructure, jobs and our economy and it might also lower the cost of our debt.

The capital raised from green gilts could help fund manifesto commitments including ¬£1bn for electric vehicle charging stations, ¬£800m for carbon capture, ¬£350m on cycling infrastructure and the ¬£640m nature for climate fund that will support planting 30m trees a year.

But it would also allow us to invest in nuclear power and low-carbon transport. France recently announced ‚Ç¨30bn (¬£27bn) of green spending as part of a comprehensive green recovery plan. This includes ‚Ç¨9bn on the development of the hydrogen industry and new green technology. Much of this will come from green bonds. Britain is the world's leading financial centre, yet we are surprisingly behind the curve when it comes to utilising capital markets to finance green growth.

Other countries have already seen the benefits of green bonds. The Netherlands, France, Poland, Ireland, Sweden, Belgium and Germany have all issued a sovereign green bond. Currently there is $1 trillion (¬£772bn) of green bonds in circulation. These saw oversubscribed demand from investors.

Despite not having our own government green bonds, UK investors are very active in the global green bond market. Some 28pc of money raised by French green bonds came from British investors. Yet, only 2pc of the world's outstanding green debt is denominated in sterling whilst over 40pc is denominated in euros.

Why has the British government so far held back on a green gilt? Well, it is partly down to concerns expressed by the Debt Management Office, which oversees gilt issues, about whether a green gilt will be more expensive to issue.

But if we look at the other sovereign green bonds on the market, they either trade at yields equal to or even slightly lower than their non-green peers. This means they might even reduce the cost of borrowing for governments.

In September, Germany made a twin issuance of green and conventional bonds. The green bonds traded with a lower yield. And even if investors lost interest in Germany's green bonds, they can swap them for conventional bonds with the central bank - ensuring green bonds could never be priced lower than conventional bonds.

The only real additional cost will be in the reporting on the use of proceeds, but these will be far outweighed by the benefits from the investment raised for our country's infrastructure. In any case, solid reporting on the environmental effects of our green investment should be implemented, with or without green gilts.

Finally, in addition to being a cost-effective way of fighting climate change, growing our economy and building jobs, green gilts would help position Britain as a future green finance leader, proof that the Government and the City of London can innovate, adapt and evolve to meet future needs.

Green gilts are an easy, tried and tested, solution to both levelling up and fighting climate change. With green gilts as a policy, we have no excuse not to honour Margaret Thatcher's words. Let us show the future that this generation did not live at the expense of theirs.

Mooted UK trade role for Australia's former PM is latest shot in the post-Brexit culture war

If true, Abbott seems an odd choice given his views on climate change and gender, says Lizzy Burden
says Lizzy Burden

If former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott is to be appointed joint president of the Board of Trade, it would make ""about as much sense as Australia asking Gavin Williamson to run its education system"".

That's according to Mike Rann, who was Australian high commissioner to the UK when Abbott was in office from 2013 to 2015.

The Department of International Trade (DIT) batted away speculation linking Abbott to the role, which The Sun reports he would share with the Liz Truss, the Trade Secretary.

DIT claims no decision has been made on the appointment, but according to The Sydney Morning Herald, Abbott had breakfast with Truss in London yesterday, having been granted an exemption from the Australian government's travel ban.

Scott Morrison, the current Australian premier, appeared to confirm the story, telling the Australian TV network ABC: ""Well done Boris! Good hire!"" But other sources say Abbott would hypothetically be no more than an adviser.

If it goes ahead, London-born Abbott's mooted arrival is a blatant shot fired in the post-Brexit culture war.

Against a backdrop of accusations the Government has a ""woman problem"", Abbott is an ostensibly odd choice as a sidekick to Truss, who is also Minister for Women and Equalities and former environment secretary, given his views on gender and climate change.

A trained priest, Abbott once urged support for one of his female Liberal party candidates because she had ""a bit of sex appeal"", was publicly accused of sexism by Julia Gillard as Australian prime minister in 2012 after a string of comments he made about her being childless and unmarried, and, when he took over from Gillard, appointed himself as women's minister. He has referred to the ""so-called settled science"" on climate change, an upgrade from his view of it as ""absolutely crap"" in 2009, and in a speech in London, credited global warming with ""probably doing good"".

None the less, Abbott can be relied upon to fly the flag for Brexit, of which he has been a vocal champion. After Parliament rejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal plan last year, Abbott tweeted: ""What's wrong with no deal? Australia does $100bn a year in trade with the EU without a deal.""

That stirred Dmitry Grozoubinski, former Australian trade negotiator at the World Trade Organisation during the Abbott government, to describe him as ""embarrassing"". There can be little doubt No 10 is revelling in trade experts' outrage at rumours of the appointment. Many were already miffed at being purged from Government's trade advisory committees.

Emily Thornberry, the shadow trade secretary, said she was ""disgusted that Boris Johnson thinks this offensive, leering, cantankerous, climate changedenying, Trump-worshipping misogynist is the right person to represent our country overseas"".

""He was ousted by his own colleagues after two years in power, and kicked out of Australian politics by his own constituents just last year,"" she added. ""They are the people who know him best, and they wanted rid of him - yet here we are, hiring him to negotiate our trade deals around the world. If it wasn't so downright humiliating, it would be almost hilarious.""

The Board of Trade has existed in various guises since the early 17th century when it was established to advise on matters colonial, under its formal title ""The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations"". Whether as an adviser or co-president, Abbott would be unlikely to be directly involved with negotiating trade deals. His role may be more ambassadorial, promoting ""Global Britain"" internationally, or perhaps more regionally focused, chairing quarterly meetings of the Board of Trade's advisers. However, since its relaunch in 2017, the Board has met only seven times and not since May last year, in locations around the UK, most recently Belfast.

DIT's in-tray is certainly full. Talks with Canada are expected to start imminently, a deal with Japan - at least in principle - is Truss's goal by the end of the month, and a second round of talks with Australia will start next month, while negotiations with the US and New Zealand rumble on.

Regardless of whether Abbott can help to push the deals over the line, the Government stirring rumours about his appointment is more likely for the benefit of onlookers at home.

'What's wrong with no deal? Australia does $100bn a year in trade with the EU without a deal'

The problems Extinction Rebellion still worry about are already solved

Environmental rebels appear not to have noticed, but the free market is cracking climate change
Ambrose Evans-Pritchard

Extinction Rebellion was an anachronism even before it began. The movement is a throwback to the early 21st century, before leaps in technology and the vast mobilising power of market capitalism entirely changed the climate equation.

The great catastrophe so feared by our new age Puritans has in a sense been averted already, if only they could see it. The free market is cracking the carbon challenge with a speed and efficiency that the environmental Left could never achieve.

We have the technical means to solve the problem at no net economic cost - indeed, the green switch can be levered into a net economic gain - and without any need to stop travel, live on beans, or to forgo our affluent lifestyle.

One defers to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the gravity of the threat facing mankind, specifically its shattering warning in October 2018 that the danger thresholds of global warming are lower than thought, and that we have a decade left to prevent unstoppable feedback loops.

But the IPCC was wrong to stray beyond its brief and to infer that ""limiting global warming to 1.5C would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". This quote has become the rallying cry of the Rebels. Curbing CO2 emissions requires no such thing.

The net-zero switch is already happening very fast. The most elegant way to bring it forward even faster is to give markets the signal of a Pigou carbon price that ratchets up systematically, as proposed by the International Monetary Fund.

Better yet, the proceeds should be recycled back to the people as a dividend to avoid the Gilets Jaunes problem of social consent. Such is the thrust of House bill HR 763 gaining support in the US Congress from both parties and a roster of Nobel economists of all stripes.

Free enterprise will work its magic once this structure is in place. We do not need to shut down the modern developed economy, causing mass unemployment, pauperisation and - let us be clear - starvation.

The drastic remedy of the Rebels would be a moral scandal. It would shatter consent and more or less guarantee the very nightmare that they most fear. It is the combined power of finance and technology that will save us. That requires economic growth. Even today we have the means to abate over 85pc of man-made emissions, and tomorrow will be yet better. Thanks to our engineers, inventors, capitalists and bankers - yes, even them - costs are plummeting along a discernible chain that runs through the 2020s and accelerates with scale.

Data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance shows that new solar and wind already undercut new coal on pure cost without subsidy in areas holding two thirds of the global population. By the middle of the decade they will start to undercut the marginal running costs of existing coal plants, at which point they will no longer be viable.

The economics of energy storage is tracking the gains of solar with a lag. Cryogenic compressed air already competes toe to toe with shale gas in Texas, the cheapest natural gas in the world, and will drive more costly liquefied natural gas out of the global market as a back-up for renewables.

Once global carbon taxes rise to $50 (¬£38) a ton, gas will struggle to compete at all unless carbon capture (CCS) comes to the rescue at viable cost, but that too is a solution.

The Holy Grail is green hydrogen from electrolysis. Goldman Sachs argues that it could abate 45pc of all greenhouse emissions and become the backbone of global decarbonisation once critical scale is reached. We are not there yet but the riches of Croesus are being harnessed in what is now a global arms race to dominate the coming hydrogen economy.

Blue and then pure green variants will start eating into market share by mid-decade, first mingled with natural gas in existing pipelines for heating (up to 20pc) before progressing towards a full hydrogen based system - unless something else comes along, such as Eavor's closed-loop geothermal technology: cheap, clean and beautifully simple like an underground heat pump.

We can argue about the timeline but the picture is clear enough: hydrogen fuel cells for new ships, trains and long-haul lorries are coming this decade, with clean synthetic fuel for jets taking a little longer.

Hydrogen will be used as a feedstock for steel, cement, glass, chemicals and fertilisers. We reach nearly every sector. Agriculture is the last nut to crack, but it is not uncrackable, and CCS can do the rest. Bingo.

The crossover point for the purchase cost of electric cars will arrive between 2022 and 2024, and will then become a cascade since operating costs are far lower. The switch is largely thanks to a free market entrepreneur named Elon Musk, not thanks to the chattering green classes, let alone the eco-Taliban. It is irrelevant whether or not Tesla itself survives to reap the reward. Volkswagen and Daimler have turned their backs on the combustion engine forever.

Tesla has already unveiled its million-mile battery. Later this month it will unveil a 500 mile-range battery on a single charge, now becoming de rigueur for premium models. Range angst is so pass√©. We flip instead in mounting angst over the nearest petrol stations, already becoming scarcer in Norway, the EV laboratory.

Personally I share the emotional leanings of Extinction Rebels. I don't like to see the planet trashed either. We used to call this sentiment conservationism, the natural reflex of Telegraph readers. However, I take umbrage at their assault on my journalistic free speech. I have been writing ""green"" articles for this newspaper for a long time without ever encountering a murmur of editorial disapproval. We are a broad church.

The Rebels have an inflated sense of themselves and they are late to the party. It is five years since the catalytic shift of the Paris Agreement, with its in-built ratchet effects on emissions. A $90 trillion alliance (PRI) of global investors and wealth funds is already operating on the assumption that the fossil economy is in terminal run-off.

Big Money switched its primary allegiance to the environmental cause long before the Rebels began their Ghandiesque offensive, not to save polar bears but because green energy is where future profit lies. The Alpine gathering of the world financial elites in Davos has been a sanctum of climate correctness for a decade.

Battered oil and gas executives huddle on the margins, complaining at the exorbitant cost of capital for drilling, lamenting that Big Wind can now raise equity and debt more cheaply than Big Oil. Opec leaders buttonhole one at the blueberry, celery and beet juice bar, plaintively explaining that an accelerated path to net-zero will leave a string of failed states across the Middle East and Africa, with northward migration to match. But nobody listens to them anymore.

Not all states are acting on known climate science, of course. China has again let rip on new coal plants, with 94 gigawatts in development this year, and it already emits more CO2 than Europe and America combined. So Rebels might more usefully focus their efforts on Xi Jinping (if they dare) rather than on the sins of this coal-free island, the first major state to set a net-zero target for 2050 in law.

China will soon be forced to the net-zero table in any case. The EU is launching its green deal with a carbon border adjustment tax. The Biden campaign in the US has pledged its own variant, explicitly to ""hold China accountable"". Chinese exporters will be squeezed out of the world's two biggest markets unless Mr Xi puts a stop to gratuitous eco-vandalism.

Joe Biden's $2 trillion blitz on clean energy over four years is above all a ""Buy America"" trade offensive aimed at China, the latest twist in the battle for superpower supremacy and control over 21st-century green technology. If the polls hold true and we see a Democrat clean sweep, the world energy order is going to look very different, very soon. There will be nowhere left to hide for global free-riders.

Sixth months into the pandemic, we can now see that the economic shock has accelerated the green switch rather than slowing it. ""Build Back Better"" is the near united refrain of the OECD bloc. The fossil industry is the greatest casualty of Covid-19.

So all I can say to Extinction Rebellion is thanks for your pious intentions, but our elected leaders and our creative capitalists already have the matter in hand. "

Get used to dramatic weather swings, experts warn

As strong wind and rain hit UK days after a heatwave, experts say climate change could make this the norm
By Jack Hardy

DRAMATIC swings between ""extreme"" weather events are to become more frequent as a result of global warming, forecasters warned yesterday as Storm Ellen unleashed 66mph winds. Britain has seen the weather lurch from a heatwave to heavy rain and flooding and high winds in the past two weeks - a pattern that is expected to appear less remarkable in future years.

Almost 194,000 homes and businesses in Ireland were hit by power cuts and roads were blocked by fallen trees when Storm Ellen arrived on Wednesday night.

Winds of up to 66mph were recorded in South Wales but Britain largely escaped the worst of Ellen's wrath. Today, however, the country is expected to be lashed by what the Met Office described as ""unusually strong winds for August"", potentially hitting speeds of 70mph in coastal areas.

A yellow alert for strong winds is in place for much of England and Wales, along with parts of Scotland, threatening to plunge transport routes into chaos and knock out power supplies.

It will be caused by another lowpressure system forming to the west of Ireland in Ellen's wake, leading to more windy weather over the next few days, particularly in Northern Ireland and western parts of the UK. The stormy conditions come just a week after scorching conditions when temperatures hit 34C for six consecutive days. Luke Miall, a forecaster at the Met Office, said Ellen will be felt ""for the next couple of days"" and is ""not going to move through really quickly so we will continue to see a really big area of low pressure through the rest of this week"".

He added: ""We have gone from one extreme to the other, the first thing that springs to my mind with these sorts of events is climate change. We are likely to see these swings in extreme events more frequently. Although I couldn't necessarily say these two events were directly caused by climate change, it's likely that these sorts of swings in our weather will become more frequent.""

Campers especially could experience a challenging few days.

""With this spell of unsettled weather coinciding with trees in full leaf and a peak in the camping season, windrelated impacts are more likely at lower wind speeds compared to other times of the year,"" the Met Office said. The unseasonably stormy weather has prompted warnings for motorists to ensure they are prepared.

Rod Dennis, a spokesman for RAC Breakdown, said: ""This spell of autumnal feeling weather is going to make driving conditions very unpleasant for a lot of us over the next few days.

""Strong winds will mean journeys by road will take longer than usual, and could be affected by fallen branches. Add in some very intense rainfall and drivers will need to take real care to complete their trips safely.""

Millennials 'should fear debt as much as climate change'
By Lizzy Burden

YOUNG people should be as concerned about surging public debt as climate change, a top economist has warned amid growing fears the country's borrowing levels could overtake Japan. Britain's ¬£2 trillion debt millstone poses a long-term threat to prosperity which bears comparison to global warming, according to Philip Booth of the Institute of Economic Affairs. NaChange tional debt smashed through 100pc of GDP in July. Mr Booth, who is due to appear before the Treasury select committee tomorrow to discuss tax after coronavirus, said borrowing could explode over the next 50 years as the population ages and growth stays sluggish. It could mean Britain overtakes Japan, currently the most heavily indebted of the G7 advanced nations. Mr Booth said: ""How can you, as a young person, be concerned about climate but complain about austerity, and not be worried about huge government debt which future generations will have to service?"" He also argued that Britain had more reason to fear its debt-to-GDP ratio rising than Japan where debt is largely financed by domestic savers, making it less reliant on international interest rates and foreign investors' confidence. Britain has failed to get to grips with its finances since the banking crisis over a decade ago, Mr Booth said, arguing ministers now have no choice but to introduce more public spending cuts. Paul Johnson, Institute for Fiscal Studies director, who will also give evidence to the committee, warned that Britain will be competing with other advanced nations for finance as they run up deficits to fund their own Covid-19 recovery packages. He said: ""There's a risk the UK becomes rather unattractive given the risks we face around our less than fully competent government, Brexit and possible Scottish independence.""

Economist James Sproule, a former adviser to the Prime Minister, said: ""If we're going to be working remotely more, do we really need this extraordinarily expensive rail line, HS2? I'd love to see the Government taking a more responsible line but at the moment, it's more likely to be focused on the short term than the strategic issues."" "

Press freedom, XR, is just as important as climate change
Bianca Jagger

Iwas born in Nicaragua, where the regime of Daniel Ortega, the murderous dictator, is carrying out brutal attacks on press freedom. Ortega's regime has occupied journalists' premises and confiscated their equipment; reporters have been murdered, imprisoned or have had to flee the country for daring to cover the repression Their horrific treatment is why freedom of the press is sacrosanct to me.

My philosophy has always been to reach out and try to persuade those who disagree with my arguments. I don't like only to speak to the converted; if we don't engage with people, we will never change their hearts and minds. Restricting freedom of speech is certainly never the way to go about convincing or persuading other people of one's arguments.

Climate change is the most pressing problem confronting mankind today: an existential threat that requires radical action. And I am the first to admit that we don't have a perfect media in the UK where climate change and the environment are concerned. I am also the first to take on the press and challenge it via social media.

But at the same time I will always be happy to do an interview or write an article for newspapers, whether that's the Financial Times, the Daily Mail or, indeed, the Telegraph.

People often ask me why I'm happy to publish articles in these newspapers. My reply is always the same: because their readership is an audience that I want to reach and persuade of the threat of climate change. I will always engage in debates with people who may have different opinions from mine.

That is why I was very surprised by the decision of Extinction Rebellion to blockade the printing sites of The Sun, The Times, the Daily Mail, The Telegraph, and the Evening Standard. It was such an irony that The Sun was publishing an amazing article in the following day's paper written by the great environmental hero Sir David Attenborough - the very issue that Extinction Rebellion prevented from being printed.

I think Extinction Rebellion's actions were a mistake. I hope they will realise that it was the wrong move, and not the most productive action they could have taken.

We need to protect freedom of speech. Yes, we can and should challenge the media when they are not being fair, and not reporting accurately, but we cannot shut them down. That is not how you gain respect and popularity.

I've done many things in my life that were not popular but were based on principle. The positions I've taken have not always been fashionable.

But, over time, I have witnessed the media and the public move closer to my views on climate change, the importance of restoring deforested and degraded lands; on moving investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy and on the critical importance of the survival of indigenous peoples.

We need to find common ground for democracies to work, and we must respect the difference between an enemy and an adversary.

As Schopenhauer's strategy put it, ""Persuade The Audience, Not The Opponent"". And we should never forget, as the author Lailah Gifty Akita said: ""A man can be converted when convinced.""

Golden state loses its lustre as the effects of climate change bite

Analysis
By Emma Gatten EnvironmEnt Editor

With wildfires raging across the state, threatening homes and turning the air a dystopian choking orange, the Californian Dream looks increasingly untenable.

The home of healthy outdoor living and aspirational wellness has had its vulnerabilities exposed by this year's wildfires, which have already burned through 2.5million acres just days into the wildfire season.

The link with climate change is simple, though quantifying it is harder: hotter air means drier vegetation, which acts as a tinderbox.

Wildfires are common in California, but as the state warms they are burning further and for longer.

Parts of the sunshine state have warmed 2C over 100 years, compared with the global average of 1C, and earlier this year Death Valley, California, had the highest global temperature on record, reaching 54.4C (130F). The 10 largest California fires since 1932 all occurred after 2000.

Residents now face something of a reckoning for their way of life. It has been exacerbated by Covid-19, which means people can't socialise indoors, while the state of the environment means they can't be outdoors either.

Instead, they go from airconditioned home to air-conditioned car, to office and back. Purifiers have sold out as smoke makes the air a health hazard, even hundreds of miles from the fires.

Demand for air conditioning has contributed to the pressure on the electricity grid, causing blackouts.

The state's national forests and many of its state parks, which for many are the big draw to life in California, have had to close.

The fires are also exacerbated by Californians' growing desire to live closer to nature, both putting them in the line of fire and raising the risk of starting one through an abandoned barbecue or a gender reveal mishap.

Californians now face the question of whether to leave - if they can afford to - or stay and try to adapt to what is likely to be a new normal. It's something that will face more communities as the effects of climate change become clearer.

Climate risk will become a factor we must consider when we decide where to move, or what kind of house to buy.

Homeowners are already struggling to get insurance against fire risk in California, just as many do in the flood-prone areas of the Humber, or along the UK's crumbling coastline.

This year's UK heatwave caused a run on air conditioners and came with warnings that the new risk of fuel poverty will be a summer rather than winter one, as people try to stay cool.

But climate change is not yet part of our everyday calculations. We still build poor housing on flood plains or next to forests, and homes and offices we know will overheat. We also continue to delay action on climate change that will limit these effects.

Californians who can leave are relatively lucky. Rich countries and their wealthier residents are not immune to climate change but they do have more options when it comes to dealing with them.

Environmentalists accuse protesters of setting back action on climate change
By Emma Gatten ENVIRONMENT EDITOR

FORMER and current Extinction Rebellion members and other environmentalists have accused the group of setting back action on climate change by blocking the printing of several newspapers.

One former prominent XR member said the move had turned environmental activism into a ""culture war"".

""Journalists from all the papers XR blockaded have been working hard to report the climate crisis while thousands of people from every part of the UK are tackling it,"" said the ex-activist, who stepped back from the group last year. ""More needs to be done, but it makes no sense to deliberately adopt divisive and partisan culture-war tactics at a time when bolder action on climate change is winning support across politics and across almost the full spectrum of public opinion in Britain.""

A current XR activist said the move risked alienating newspaper readers, including her grandfather. ""He wants to act on the climate,"" she said. ""If he reads Extinction Rebellion stopped his paper coming, that won't make him more positive about the movement.""

The decision to take direct action against newspapers it disagrees with is in contradiction to XR's earlier strategy, which sought to engage with all sections of the media. In a 2019 statement, it said: ""This is not a calling out of all media, but a calling in of those that work at the Daily Mail, Mail Online, Mail on Sunday, Daily Telegraph and The Sun.""

Greenpeace, which backed the group when it shut parts of central London last year, said ""a free, diverse press and the right to peaceful protest are both hallmarks of a healthy democracy"".

John Sauven, its executive director, added: ""Greenpeace has been working with the news media for five decades, and we know the vital role they play in informing the public, exposing environmental abuse, and holding powerful interests to account.""

UK breaks records for high temperatures six times in one year
By Emma Gatten environment editor

THE UK broke six records for temperature highs last year in evidence of the increasing influence of global warming on the British climate, the Met Office said yesterday.

Last July saw a new all-time high temperature of 38.7C (101.66F), recorded in Cambridge, while in February a new winter record-high of 21.2C was recorded in Kew Gardens, the first time 20C has been reached in the British winter.

December broke its one-day record high with an 18.7C temperature in Sutherland, and February had a record minimum temperature of 13.9C.

July and February's all-time and winter records also technically added two more records, for highest temperatures in those months.

In contrast, no national low-temperature records were set during the year, according to the Met Office's annual State of the UK Climate report.

It came as the country was braced to experience its warmest day of the year so far during a mini heatwave that will end as early as tomorrow. Temperatures are expected to reach up to 35C in London as a result of warm air drawn up from the continent.

But Saturday is expected to bring a return back down to temperatures in the mid-20s, with more rain and cloud, in a sign that typical British weather patterns prevail, despite the warming trends.

Commenting on the Met Office report, lead author Mike Kendon said it showed ""climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK's climate"". ""This year was warmer than any other year in the UK between 1884 and 1990, and since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series. By contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963; over 50 years ago.""

For only the second year, the report also examined changes in phenology - recurring events in nature and their relationships with climate - in recognition of the growing impact on our natural world. Using data sent in by volunteers, researchers found that the first leaves appeared on trees nearly 10 days earlier in 2019 compared with the average for the previous 20 years.

Worst case eased for climate
By Emma Gatten environment editor

THE UN's worst case scenario for how much the earth's temperature willincrease by has been reduced by 0.6C. A prediction of 1.5-4.5C warming if atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide are doubled has been the international standard since 1979.

But a new study authored by a 25-strong team of international climate scientists over four years suggests it is ""extremely unlikely"" that warming would stay below 2C above pre-industrial levels, and puts minimum warming at 2.3C. The likelihood of staying between 1.5C and 2C is 5 per cent.

The study maintains the top temperature at 4.5C, but says some recent predictions that warming above that will be reached are also ""unlikely"", with a 6-18 per cent chance. A less cautious analysis by the experts puts likely warming at an even narrower range of 2.6-3.9C.

A doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is predicted to happen within the next 60-80 years if current emissions are maintained.

That timeline will be extended by climate action such as that agreed in the Paris Accord.

""One of the most worrying aspects of climate change is that it is very much a roll of the dice,"" said Zeke Hausfather, one of the co-authors of the study published in Review of Geophysics. ? Sharks have disappeared from nearly a fifth of the world's reefs, leaving them ""functionally extinct"", according to a new study. Researchers placed more than 15,000 cameras in 371 reefs off the coast of 58 countries to track the sharks over three years, in the most in-depth study of the global population.

Call for ban on new gas boilers by 2025 to hit climate change targets
By Emma Gatten environment editor

NEW gas boilers must be banned from 2025 if the UK is to meet its climate change goals, a report from the Confederation of British Industry and the University of Birmingham has said.

Homes should be fitted with lowercarbon systems such as heat pumps - which can take energy from the ground, air or water - or a hybrid system, the report says.

Hydrogen-ready boilers could also be installed instead, the report says, despite ""significant uncertainty"" over the viability of the technology as a largescale low-carbon alternative. By 2035, it says, all boilers installed in any homes must be zero-emissions.

Heat counts for over a third of the country's carbon emissions, the biggest single source, and over half of that comes from domestic buildings.

Most homes are heated by natural gas boilers, posing a major challenge for the Government's commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

""Delivering decarbonisation of heating is the biggest energy challenge we face in getting to net-zero. Unlike electricity, which can be changed at a systems level, it requires over 20million households to adopt new energy efficiency measures,"" said Prof Martin Freer of the University of Birmingham.

The report, which was compiled by members of the CBI, researchers from Birmingham University and energy industry figures, calls for an ""Olympicstyle"" body to lead a decarbonisation strategy across different sectors in the UK, including heating and transport.

The report calls for the Government to go further than its pledge in March last year that gas boilers would be phased out in new homes by 2025.

Heat pumps are already deployable, using electricity to run. They cost between ¬£6,000 to ¬£19,000 to install, but can save on energy bills in the long run.

Hydrogen-ready boilers, which are expected to cost between ¬£50 to ¬£100 more than a regular boiler, would be ready to switch from gas if hydrogen is rolled out across the networks.

But there is still significant doubt over when this might happen, said Richard Lowe, an energy specialist at the University of Exeter.

Climate change 'wiped out earliest humans'

Paper argues our ancient cousins failed to adapt to new conditions, sending a message to modern man
By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

CLIMATE change wiped out early humans, a study has found, as scientists warn that global warming could have a greater impact than previously thought.

Cousins of homo sapiens failed to adapt to the cold tens of thousands of years ago, a new paper argues, leaving them vulnerable to extinction when temperatures dropped below the levels they were used to.

The reasons behind the disappearance of several species leaving only homo sapiens to survive has been a point of debate among scientists, who hypothesised that Earth's changing climate played a role, alongside competition between species.

But a new study published in the journal One Earth claims that a failure to adapt to a shifting climate was the main cause in the loss of three species, because they were unable to cope with colder conditions.

Shortly before they disappeared, homo erectus, homo heidelbergensis and homo neanderthalensis, more commonly known as neanderthals, all experienced sudden changes in their environment.

The team used climate modelling technology to emulate the shifts in climate going back five million years and compared them to fossil records, finding that for all three, conditions existed that would have been particularly hard for them to survive during their last known period of existence.

Climate change was the ""most likely candidate"" for the loss of the first two, and it combined with competition from homo sapiens to wipe out the neanderthals, the paper concludes.

Homo erectus, believed to have been adapted to warm and humid climates in

South East Asia, became extinct around the start of the last glacial period, which spanned the period from 115,000 to 11,700 years ago. This would have been the coldest period the species had ever experienced, the paper says.

Neanderthals, which died out later during the same period, disappeared from northerly latitudes first, adding evidence to the theory that they struggled to adapt to colder climates.

Earlier, homo heidelbergensis, often thought to be an ancestor both of modern humans and of neanderthals, experienced similar struggles. Pasquale Raia, the lead author, of Universit√† di Napoli Federico II in Napoli, Italy, said that neanderthals died out even despite their use of clothing, fire and tools.

""They tried hard; they made for the warmest places in reach as the climate got cold, but at the end of the day, that wasn't enough,"" he said. He said he believed the most likely direct cause was a failure to change the plants and animals they relied on for food. While advances in technology make us more resilient now, the paper concludes that ""the threat posed by the current, anthropogenic climate change for global wildlife and, by extension, ourselves, is possibly even more powerful than is generally appreciated"".

Scant fossil records make the earlier findings less reliable, Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, who wasn't involved in the research, told The Scientist magazine, but climate change ""probably was a significant factor in some of those extinctions"". Prof Raia said the findings were ""worrisome"" for modern humans, especially given our reliance on other species for survival.

Farmers angry as council bans meat in drive to help tackle climate change
By Helena Horton

A MEAT ban, as part of a local authority's ""climate change action plan"", has prompted criticism that it lacks ""understanding"" of British farming.

Enfield council in north-east London will not be serving meat at any of its catered events from this Christmas as it hopes to ""influence the behaviour"" of local businesses and suppliers.

The local authority is understood to be the first in the United Kingdom to announce such a move. Ian Barnes, the deputy leader of the council, said it had already announced a climate emergency and this is one of the steps being taken to make sure the local authority is carbon neutral by 2030.

Ensuring Enfield is carbon neutral in 10 years means ""taking bold and sometimes unpopular action"", he wrote in the council's climate report.

The report added: ""All events held by Enfield council, where catering is provided, are to offer only vegan or vegetarian options.""

The Labour-controlled authority uploaded the extensive ""Enfield climate action plan 2020"" online after holding a month-long consultation during the coronavirus lockdown.

However, countryside campaigners have said the policy ignores the ambitious efforts being made by British farmers to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040. This is the target set by the National Farmers' Union.

Farmers argue that a blanket ban on meat in this way makes no differentiation between the industrial farming systems in countries such as the United States and Brazil and the mainly grassfed systems in use in Britain.

The council's move comes after similar initiatives taken at both Goldsmiths and Cambridge universities, which have seen red meat removed from their campus menus.

Commenting on the proposal, Mo Metcalf-Fisher, spokesman for the Countryside Alliance, said: ""Banning meat is completely the wrong approach and demonstrates no understanding of how meat in this country is produced - which, thanks to UK farming practices, is among the most sustainable in the world.

""That this ban has gone through with what appears to be very limited public consultation, is damning.""

""Enfield borough council would do well to actually liaise with the farming community, properly consult their local residents and drop this proposed ban immediately,"" he added. "

Charles: Climate change will dwarf damage of pandemic
By Hannah Furness Royal CoRRespondent

THE Prince of Wales will today warn of a looming environmental crisis that will ""dwarf "" the negative impact of coronavirus, as he says the world risks missing an opportunity to ""reset"".

The Prince, who delivers the opening speech at Climate Week 2020, will say the pandemic is a ""wake-up call we cannot ignore"". In a message recorded at Birkhall, his Scottish home, and delivered online, he urges ""swift and immediate action"" to change the world for the better. He joins leaders and environ mental campaigners for the summit, which takes place annually alongside the United Nations General Assembly.

The Prince recently launched the ""Great Reset"" project at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, calling on business and political leaders to ensure global economies were rebuilt with the balance of nature at their heart.

The Prince will say: ""Without swift and immediate action at an unprece dented pace and scale, we will miss the window of opportunity to 'reset' for‚Ä¶ a more sustainable and inclusive future.

In other words, the global pandemic is a wake-up call we cannot ignore.

""[The] crisis has been with us for far too many years; decried, denigrated and denied. It is now rapidly becoming a comprehensive catastrophe that will dwarf the impact of the pandemic."" The Prince, 71, who tested positive for the virus in March, has previously urged the Commonwealth to tackle climate change. In June, he spoke at a virtual meeting of the 54 UN Commonwealth Ambassadors about ""The Great Reset"".

His concern for the environment has been echoed by other members of the Royal family. Next month, the Duke of Cambridge speaks at TEDX Countdown on climate change, regeneration and protecting nature. Before the pan demic, the Duke launched the Earth shot Prize to find solutions to the ""world's greatest problems by 2030"".

Last month, a study by Leeds university suggested that while lockdown meant a fall in greenhouse gases and pollutants from vehicles and industry, the impact would be only short-lived. Analysis showed global temperatures would be just 0.01C lower than expected by 2030 as a result of the pause.

'You can't run a business on a dead planet, right?'

Change isn't just cosmetic, believes Natura chief Roberto Marques - companies have to address the climate crisis, he tells Laura Onita
Laura Onita

Roberto Marques' life could have been starkly different. He had been composing his own songs and playing bossa nova in nightclubs in his native Brazil when he landed a marketing internship at Johnson & Johnson, the world's biggest drugs company. Shortly after, the twenty-something professional hung up his guitar to climb the corporate ladder.

""At one point I couldn't cope with both so I decided to stay with one,"" says Marques, who spent more than 25 years at J&J in several executive roles.

He now runs Natura & Co, the parent company of the eponymous brand as well as Aesop, Avon and The Body Shop.

The beauty group, the fourth-largest player in the world, purports to be the friendly face of capitalism thanks to its strong sustainability credentials and pledges to help tackle the climate crisis. It made R$14.4bn (¬£2bn) in sales last year. ""We truly believe companies should serve a higher purpose, create positive impact and be a force for good,"" Marques says without blinking over a video call from his home just outside New York. ""That's the only way we can operate, because to some extent, that's how we were formed.""

Natura started life in 1969 when Luiz Seabra and Pedro Passos opened a small beauty shop on an affluent street in S√£o Paulo. A decade later, friend Guilherme Leal joined them after he lost his job, with money he had from the sale of a plot of land.

The brand's reputation has been partly built on its ecological credentials and its commitment to protect the Amazon region.

The three founders are co-chairmen and controlling shareholders of Natura, with a 42pc stake. The firm has a dual listing on the S√£o Paulo and New York stock exchanges. They tapped Marques for a board role five years ago and he was subsequently put in charge of an expansion plan that led Natura to snap up The Body Shop in 2017 for $1.2bn (¬£940m) and Avon in January for $2bn, after it bought Australianfounded Aesop in 2013 for $71m. He is executive chairman and also holds the title of chief executive since closing the deal with Avon - a move that goes against corporate governance norms in the UK, but is relatively common elsewhere.

Marques says Natura has a balanced corporate governance - ""probably one of the best in class"" - and together with the founders they call the shots.

""The group firmly believes in the power of the collective. It's not about one individual making all the decisions. My role is to be an enabler.""

All four brands subscribe to the trio's credo that there has to be more to a conglomerate than just profits and fat returns for shareholders.

""Some people ask me, 'but have you guys had any difficulty sometimes making those trade-offs, when you have those conversations with the board?',"" says Marques. ""I always say ...

'We've been doing business this way since those [four] brands were created'.

""I think people are starting to realise that, you know, you can't run a business on a dead planet, right? So if you think about the longevity of a business in a sustainable way, you absolutely need to pay attention to what's happening in terms of the climate crisis, inequality and social injustice.""

Until now, few businesses have been taking climate change seriously. The pandemic has arguably given firms an opportunity to press the reset button after economies came to a halt and harmful emissions fell sharply as a result. The increasing demands of consumers and customers will play a part, too, thinks Marques, and ever more stringent laws driven by governments.

""The younger generation is much more aware of this notion that everything is somehow interconnected. The pressure is coming from all angles, you know, and I think this is a positive thing.""

Marques does not rule out more acquisitions, but he says that Natura's hands are full with the integration of Avon. Critics of the deal have argued that buying the cosmetics brand, which sells directly to consumers worldwide, often in person, was an expensive gamble at a time when debt has soared. Total net debt went from R$5.7bn to R$10.6bn over the past two years at the group.

Marques dismisses suggestions that the pandemic may have rendered Avon's business model obsolete. ""What people haven't realised is that [direct selling] has evolved to online, which we call social selling. So all those entrepreneurs, are now leveraging their social media platforms, through Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram, to sell and not having to do it physically.""

In the most recent quarter, e-commerce sales for the group rose by 225pc.

Marques, one of four siblings, was born and raised in S√£o Paulo. His father died when he and his brothers were very young, meaning he ""started to work very early"" to help the family.

He also taught himself how to play guitar growing up. ""I don't play anymore at all. A lot of people asked me why I was so radical to walk away from that. I used to play eight hours a day, for me that was my life.""

But when he landed the J&J job Marques decided to channel that same energy towards his marketing career. He left Brazil 20 years ago when he had to move to the Colombian city of Cali with his family to run a part of J&J's business there. He then relocated to the US and a string of senior global roles followed.

Natura came knocking to ask him to join the board as a director and he then rose to executive chairman.

His parents instilled his ""value-driven"" modus operandi since he was little, he says, which is why Natura is a good fit. ""It was a company that I always admired, especially as a Brazilian, and it was always a competitor when I was working at J&J. It was an easy decision,"" he says.

Marques' minder intervenes to say we have run out of time. He is due to speak at a Climate Week summit that afternoon to debate how society moves forward in a postpandemic world.

We can't be 'caught napping' on climate, Johnson tells UN
By Emma Gatten environment editor

THE world cannot be ""caught napping"" on climate change as it was with the coronavirus, Boris Johnson told the United Nations yesterday, as he outlined plans for a green industrial recovery for the UK driven by technology.

""Humanity was caught napping by coronavirus,"" the Prime Minister told a UN General Assembly climate roundtable. ""We were woefully under prepared. But for climate change, nobody can say that we have not been warned.""

He said the UK would ""build back better"" by pursuing a green industrial strategy that focused on ""putting a big bet"" on hydrogen to fuel vehicles including buses, trucks and planes, and on wind power. Mr Johnson said the UK would strive to become ""the Saudi Arabia of wind"" by developing its wind power capacity.

He also said he was now a ""complete evangelist"" for nascent carbon capture and storage technology, in which emissions are caught and sequestered, and said nuclear and solar power would have an important role to play in the country meeting its climate goals.

A mass rollout of energy efficiency retrofitting of British homes, and bringing forward the current 2040 date to phase out petrol, diesel and hybrid electric vehicles would also be part of the path to decarbonisation, he said.

Critics of hydrogen caution that it is a high-risk investment because to be truly green it is energy intensive and expensive, and otherwise depends on polluting natural gas.

Charles starts web channel with call for 'war footing' on climate
By Hannah Furness Royal CoRRespondent

THE Prince of Wales has launched his own ""content platform"", as he turned editor-in-chief to share videos and stories online to tackle climate change. The Prince has curated a series of films and articles on subjects close to his heart for RE: TV, an internet channel designed to ""champion inspiring solutions from around the world"".

As he launched it yesterday, the Prince also delivered a speech at the opening of Climate Week, in which he argued that leaders must develop a ""Marshall-like"" plan to be on a ""war footing"" to save the planet. He said countries must work together ""approaching our action from the perspective of a military-style campaign"", to ""combat this most grave and urgent challenge"".

The new online platform will cover the same issues, with subchannels named Re: Imagine, Re: Energize, Re: Balance, Re: Invigorate and Re: Invest.

It currently has more than a dozen short films and articles, with more to be added weekly at re-tv.org.

A spokesman said ""explainer films"" will clarify what carbon capture, the ""circular bioeconomy"" and other processes and ideas are, while articles are being commissioned from various ""thought-leaders in sustainability"". In an interview on the website, the Prince said: ""We've so degraded natural systems, ecosystems, biodiversity, that it's becoming increasingly impossible for nature to sustain us.

""At the moment it's all take, take. Now we've reached the situation where we really need four planets like Earth to survive or provide enough for everybody.

And there is a better world out there. We can operate our industries far better.""

In a separate speech, he said the impact of the climate crisis would ""dwarf "" the damage of coronavirus.

""At this late stage, I can see no other way forward but to call for a 'Marshalllike plan for nature, people and planet',"" he said. ""Without doubt we must now put ourselves on a war-like footing, approaching our action from the perspective of a military-style campaign. ""Billions of people around the world are waiting and longing for concerted action to right the balance of this planet that we have so rashly disrupted.

""It is their lives we are gambling with, as well as the ultimate survival of everything that tries to share this ailing Earth with us.""

He also called for global pledges to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 to be brought forward, as it ""suggests we have room to delay"". It chal lenges the Government's plan to cut emissions to net zero within 30 years. "

Gardening in autumn will bring mellow fruitfulness

Planting bulbs and trees now is better than spring, says RHS as climate change increases dryness
By Helena Horton

AUTUMN should be considered more important than spring for gardening as Britain becomes drier in the warmer months, the Royal Horticultural Society has suggested.

Climate change could mean greenfingered people will have to change the way they garden and the months when they plant their bulbs. By caring for their gardens now, people will be able to conserve water if there is a drought, the organisation said.

This new focus on autumn will require a shift in thinking for Britain's gardeners. A new survey by YouGov, commissioned by the RHS, found that almost seven in 10 people (68 per cent) think spring is the most important gardening season, compared with 8 per cent who think it is autumn.

The RHS explained that autumn is the ideal time for gardening as the soil is moist and warm, but not yet soggy, and so easy to plant while giving plants more time to grow new roots and be less vulnerable to dry periods in summer. Evergreens in particular establish well in autumn without the difficult fluctuations of spring weather and, when planted in spring, they usually need significant watering.

Trees are also better planted in autumn or winter. Autumn is especially best for planting trees in clay soils, which can be sticky in the winter and dry to very hard in spring. Just 22 per cent of UK adults think trees should be planted in autumn and only 8 per cent in winter, with one in three saying they do not know when to plant trees (32 per cent) and 30 per cent favouring planting in spring with 4 per cent in summer. Sue Biggs, RHS director general, said: ""Helping people to garden is core to the RHS's being, especially for the environment and their health, happiness and wellbeing.

""With the recent growth in gardening, many don't know that autumn is arguably the most important gardening season, which is something we're committed to changing by promoting and sharing the benefits of gardening now. Water is a critical issue and planting evergreens, trees and many perennials over autumn usually means that we can water a lot less, with cooler climates and higher levels of rain. We are seeing more dry and hot spring and summer months, when people can use a lot of water to keep newly planted plants alive.""

Fallen leaves can also be brilliant for growing plants in autumn, the RHS added, as leafmould compost can be made from them.

Just over half of UK adults who garden or grow plants outside (54 per cent) deal with garden waste in the autumn by putting it in their council green waste bin, followed by 30 per cent who will compost it, and one in 10 who will take it all to the green waste tip.

Of those who had fallen leaves to deal with, 8 per cent said they used them to make leafmould, but 29 per cent added their leaf waste to their compost bin. The council green waste bin was the most popular way to get rid of leaves with some 43 per cent using this method.

Guy Barter, the RHS chief horticulturist, said: ""Making leafmould helps the environment by eliminating the cost and carbon emissions associated with green waste collection. Equally beneficial is raking leaves into heaps under shrubs and trees - they rot away by July and won't promote slug damage or smother lawns and plants around woody plants. Garden compost makes brilliant soil improver, second only to leaf mould.""

Air miles for climate change research top other fields
By Emma Gatten environment eDitor

CLIMATE-change researchers fly more than their counterparts in other disciplines, a study has found, suggesting that it may undermine their credibility.

A survey of more than 1,400 university researchers found that climate specialists took about five flights a year compared with four among researchers in other fields before the coronavirus pandemic.

Rates among climate scientists were even higher. Flying tends to increase with seniority, with professors in particular flying more than others, in the study led by Cardiff University.

Pre-pandemic aviation accounted for just above 2 per cent of global emis sions, but that figure is predicted to increase to a quarter by 2050, assuming levels bounce back.

""Our findings highlight that climate scientists, like many other professionals, can struggle to square their environmental commitments with
 professional and personal demands,"" said Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh, the director of the UK Centre for Climate and Social Transformation, which carried out the study.

Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester and former director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said it made for ""uncomfortable"" reading. ""This paper must be a catalyst for rapid change,"" he added.

Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg is among those to have shunned flying for her global advocacy, travelling by yacht to New York last year where she addressed the United Nations climate change conference.

Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at LSE, warned about attempts to ""force or shame climate researchers into flying less"", which he said ""could be far more damaging if it reduces the quality and quantity of evidence and advice they provide to policy-makers about cutting greenhouse gas emissions"".

Darkest ocean depths prone to global warming
By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

GLOBAL warming may be heating up the almost freezing waters up to 15,600ft below the surface of the ocean, a study has found.

Temperatures recorded at four stations in the Atlantic off the coast of Uruguay were found to be warmer than they were 10 years ago.

The link with emissions caused by human activity is not confirmed, but the authors of the report said the 0.02C temperature rise was ""consistent with the sign of the well-documented planetary-scale global warming trend"".

Lead author Chris Meinen, said more data was needed to prove a link with warming in the wider atmosphere.

On land, scientists examine evidence from fossils, tree rings and ice cores to interpret temperature trends over thousands of years - a body of data that is not yet available in the ocean.

""In the deep ocean, we don't have that thousand years of information to compare to,"" Mr Meinen said.

""So while we're seeing a trend down there, we can say is consistent with the broader-scale picture of global warming that we're seeing, we have to be cau tious and not say more than what the data supports, in terms of the reason why we're seeing warming in the deep ocean.

""It's logical to say that it's consistent with global warming, but we can't prove that at this stage.""

The data, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, showed a surprising amount of shorter-term variation, with temperatures shifting over hours and days much more than expected, Mr Meinen added.

Since the middle of the last century, oceans have absorbed more than 90 per cent of the extra heat kept in the earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases.

This slows the warming trend on land, but also has consequences for marine life. It also raises global sea levels, contributing to melting ice caps and damaging ocean ecosystems.

Sea lion struck down by epilepsy connected to global warming
By Rozina Sabur in Washington

A SEA LION in California has had pio neering brain surgery for epilepsy, offering hope for the growing number of marine mammals suffering from the disorder as a result of climate change.

Cronutt, a seven-year-old sea lion, was treated by a team of 18 specialists from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) who have developed a cellular therapy aimed at reversing epilepsy in animals.

The procedure involved injecting embryonic pig brain cells into the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for seizures. Scientists hope that the injected cells will spread through Cronutt's damaged brain over the next few weeks and repair the area.

If successful, the treatment could offer a lifeline to the increasing num bers of sea lions and sea otters developing epilepsy due to exposure to domoic acid - a toxin released by algae blooms.

The algae has become more wide spread as the oceans warm, producing toxins that are ingested by small fish such as sardines and anchovies, which in turn are eaten by sea lions.

Sea otters have also suffered from brain damage after ingesting toxinladen shellfish. The animals suffering from the condition frequently get stranded on land, lose their appetite and often die.

The phenomenon was first discovered in 1998 but cases are on the rise as the world's ocean temperatures increase. According to the UCSF, hundreds of sea creatures are affected by domoic acid poisoning on America's west coast each year.

Researchers first discovered Cronutt in 2017 when it wandered into a car park after running aground. The sea lion was released back into the sea with a tag, but was shortly found again on a nearby beach, where it clambered on top of tables. Its condition deteriorated and it had a massive seizure last month.

Carers at the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo described the surgery as a last-ditch effort to treat the sea lion before considering euthanasia.

The procedure, performed on Oct 6, has previously proved effective in curing mice, but this was the first attempt to use the therapy on larger mammals.

""Over the years I've come to learn how many marine mammals can't be released into the wild due to domoic acid poisoning, and it's our hope that if this procedure is successful it will open the door to helping many more ani mals,"" said Scott Baraban, a professor of neurosurgery at UCSF.

The early stages of Cronutt's recovery suggest reasons for optimism - the sea lion was alert and appeared to have regained its appetite in the days following the procedure.

After a meal of 2lb of herring, he ""followed me all around, was super engaged, and really alert"", carer Dianne Cameron told The New York Times. ""His eyes look beautiful,"" she added.

However, even if the operation proves to be a success it is unlikely that the surgery will help people with epilepsy anytime soon, in part because of the challenges of using pig cells in human brains.

Paris Agreement on climate to be
built into Brexit deal

BRITISH and EU negotiators have moved closer to enshrining the Paris Agreement on climate change in the new Brexit free trade deal.

Either side can cancel the free trade agreement if the other reneges on their 2015 promise to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, under the terms of the potential breakthrough.

In March, Britain called for a climate agreement separate from the free trade deal that would affirm support for Paris.

The UK is now ready to hardwire respect for the Paris Agreement into the draft trade deal, sources on both sides said as negotiators met in London yesterday. There is disagreement over whether the Paris commitment should be enshrined in the ""provisions"" of the deal, the UK""s latest position, or the agreement""s ""essential elements"", where it would sit alongside rules forbidding crimes against humanity.

If put in the essential elements, the whole trade deal could be suspended as punishment if either side left the UN accord. If the commitment is the provisions, the punishment would be the triggering of dispute resolution procedures.

EU sources claimed UK negotiators were preparing to give in to their demands for Paris to be in the essential elements chapter of the deal. ""We don""t expect this to be a problem to resolve,"" an EU official said. UK sources said there were still differences over how to reflect the climate commitment. ""We have been clear from the start of negotiations that our future trading relationship with the EU should reaffirm both sides"" commitment to tackling climate change,"" a UK government official said.

The UK holds the presidency of the COP, the decision-making body for the Paris Agreement, and was the first major economy to pass a law to cut net carbon emissions to zero by 2050."

Hohn criticises lack of climate action
By Michael O'Dwyer

ONE of Britain's top hedge fund chiefs has hit out at the world's biggest money managers over their record on climate change, accusing them of a ""total greenwash"".

Sir Chris Hohn, who runs TCI Fund Management, wrote to asset managers urging them to pressure firms into setting out how they can speed up the shift to a lowcarbon world. In letters sent through his charity The Children's Investment Fund Foundation, he said big asset managers were taking ""insufficient and ineffective action"" on global warming, The Financial Times reported. He said BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs and State Street all had appalling voting records on climate resolutions.

Vanguard said it ""cares deeply about the long-term impact of climate change"".

BlackRock, whose boss Larry Fink announced a big push into sustainable investing this year, said climate change was an ""investment risk"".

Goldman Sachs is investing ¬£115bn in clean energy by 2025, while Fidelity and State Street both frequently vote against firms on climate change grounds in annual meetings and recently urged oil and gas firm Ovintiv to do more to reach climate change targets.

GROWING CONCERNS

A new film about tackling climate change takes a feelgood approach to the issue. By Tabi Jackson Gee

Whisper it, but a small shift is happening in the conversation around climate change. Perhaps it's born from desperation, but messages of hope are trickling through - even from unlikely sources like Woody Harrelson, the Hollywood actor and narrator of a Netflix documentary called Kiss the Ground. In it, scientists and celebrity activists unpack the ways in which soil may be the key to combating climate change and saving the planet.

In the feature-length film directed by Josh and Rebecca Tickell, the affable

Harrelson is joined by a slew of celebrities such as Patricia Arquette and Ian Somerhalder. Based on a book and campaign of the same name, Kiss the Ground wants to get farmers and growers to stop using chemicals on their fields and to help repair topsoil degradation - a threat to food security, water health and myriad other problems.

As the film charts the history of modern agriculture, it unveils a different, utopian vision to what we're used to hearing. If we learn to look after soil, it will look after us.

While persuasive computer modelling from Nasa shows how tilling soil leads to huge rises in CO2, Zimbabwean ecologist and livestock farmer Allan Savory demonstrates how growing cover crops can immediately help reduce temperatures on the ground. Other experts include soil health pio neers Ray Archuleta, Gabe Brown and Detroit Dirt's Pashon Murray.

There is nothing quite like listening to Harrelson's Texan drawl as he ponders the challenges of our time, and the salvational power of dirt. And have no doubt, this is a typical Hollywood movie; there are the goodies (concerned celebrities) the downtrodden underdog (the planet) and the baddy - a Nazi who invented tear gas and is blamed for bringing pesticides to the US.

During a brief cameo, model Gisele B√ºndchen tells us ""our health and the health of our planet are connected"" - thanks Gisele - but for all the glamour, the film has just enough of a message to make us think twice about that mucky stuff under our feet.

On a small scale, in our own gardens, while we often discuss the best com posts or plants for different pH levels, practices like ""no dig"" gardening are only just becoming mainstream. Yet soil health is essential to the success of every space we put plants into.

In scientific terms, it's very basic stuff, but perhaps this sort of straightforward clarity is what we need.

I'm sure many in agriculture will question how much of this information is new. And the film does put a big emphasis on the responsibility of farmers. But it also offers a glimpse of hope, and ""the science"" is presented in a digestible way that engages rather than intimidates.

With an overwhelming focus on food provenance, it's the same message that has been supporting organic farming for decades. But in this case the mes sage is supported on a larger level by showing the scale of the planet's own intelligence and the relative naivety of human beings. And that's something we can probably all agree on. "

Barclays   accused   of   bankrolling   oil   giants   despite   climate   pledge

By Lucy Burton

ACTIVISTS have  accused   Barclays   of   bankrolling  multibillion-pound deals that
expanded the fossil fuel industry last year  despite  the bank vowing to act on  climate
change.

The UK bank last year participated in deals that arranged $97.6bn (¬£70.6bn)  of  loans
and bonds for eight  of  the world's largest  oil  and gas companies, BP, Chevron, Eni,
Equinor, ExxonMobil, Repsol, Shell and Total,  despite  promising to shrink its car bon
footprint to net zero by 2050, according to  climate  campaigners Market Forces.

The figures come as shareholders pile pressure on to the bank over its  climate  change
policies for the second year in a row as it remains one  of  Europe's largest backers  of
fossil fuels.

Rev Canon Dr John Hall, who is among the 100 investors backing a resolution demanding
that  Barclays  phase out its financing for coal,  oil  and gas companies, said last week that
""the house is on fire but the financial institutions backing the fossil fuel industry are
acting like arsonists"".

Adam McGibbon, a UK campaigner for Market Forces who carried out the latest research,
said the bank is not breaking its  climate  change policies by financing these deals. But he
added: ""It's just the policies are so inadequate.""

"" Barclays  can say it's aligned with the Paris Agreement, or it can fund a massive
expansion  of  the fossil fuel industry - it can't do both,"" he said.

The campaign group has already tabled a resolution to be presented at the bank's annual
meeting in May, urging  Barclays  to detail clearer plans on how it intends to phase out
fossil fuel financing amid concerns little has changed since the bank was confronted with
a landmark resolution from a group  of  investors a year ago.

The world's biggest banks have come under mounting pressure to phase out the financing
of  dirty energy sources, with investor concerns coming up in board meetings and
Extinction Rebellion staging protests.



Earlier this month HSBC dodged a backlash from major investors by pledging to phase
out financing  of  coal-fired power by 2040.

However, some large financial companies have been  accused   of  ""green washing"" since
pledging to act on  climate  change.

In January a group  of  researchers argued that BlackRock's  pledge  to act on  climate
change did not cover the investment giant's passive investments, which account for
around two thirds  of  its assets under management.

Last week Extinction Rebellion activists posed as dead bodies outside two  Barclays
branches in Scotland and splashed black dye over the Bank  of  England.

A spokesman for  Barclays  said: ""We have made a commitment to align our entire
financing portfolio to the goals  of  the Paris Agreement, with specific targets and
transparent reporting, on the way to achieving our ambition to be a net zero bank by
2050.

""We believe that  Barclays  can make a real contribution to tackling  climate  change and
help accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy.

""We continue to discuss our ambi tion and progress with our investors.""

'Global warming' behind ¬£100k damage to Ô¨Åreplace Ô¨Åt for a
king

By Craig Simpson

THE National Trust has blamed climate change for water damage to a 10-ton marble Ô¨Åreplace, which has
cost ¬£100,000 to repair.

It said the Victorian gutters at Cragside in Northumberland were being overwhelmed by increasingly wet
winters and water damage was spreading through the property like a ""disease"".

The house, which was owned by Lord William Armstrong, a 19th-cen tury industrialist, was the Ô¨Årst to be lit
by hydroelectric power.

Its 3m-wide Ô¨Åreplace, completed to impress the future King Edward VII on a royal visit, is crumbling as a
result of heavy rainfall, and the trust said it had spent ¬£100,000 to conserve the structure, which has been
weakened by water seeping into the marble.

Clara Woolford, property curator at Cragside, said: ""Almost like a disease, it starts in a small area and spreads
through the weak sections of stone.

""If untreated, the Ô¨Åreplace could crumble quickly.""

She added: ""The Victorian drainage system doesn't support 21st-century weather conditions. Winters at
Cragside are wetter and much longer, due to climate change.

""We are more prone to signiÔ¨Åcant bursts of rain and stormy weather.

""The drainage system is now visibly overwhelmed by water, which pours from the gutters and cascades
down the outer wall.""

The pressure of moisture entering the stone forces out natural salts, making the structure crumble. The trust
has used donations to fund a ¬£100,000 project to draw out the salts and seal off the stone from future water
ingress.

A material called ""nano-lime"" will be used to penetrate the marble and restabilise the internal structure of
the Ô¨Åreplace, which dominates Cragside's drawing room and was Ô¨Ånished in time to warm the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, in 1884.

The property of Newcastle ship manufacturer Lord Armstrong was chosen for a royal visit because its hydro-
powered electric lighting and central heating made it more modern and luxurious than royal residences of
the time.

Electric tanks on the charge as they go to war on climate
change

By Danielle Sheridan DEFENCE CORRESPONDENT

ELECTRIC tanks and vegetarian options in the mess are just some of the ways the military plans to go
greener, the Ministry of Defence has revealed.

The MoD sets out in a report how it will respond to ""the threat posed by climate change"",   after   it   was
instructed to invest in environmentally friendly ways of operating.

It was published in response to an internal Climate Change and Sustainability review conducted by Lt Gen
Richard Nugee last year.

Lt Gen Nugee, who advises the MoD on making areas of defence more sustainable, told The Daily Telegraph
that one major factor under consideration was how renewable energy could replace fossil fuels.

He said that while it was not possible to turn the UK's Challenger 2 main battle tanks electric, there was a
""distinct possibility"" that in the next ""10 to 15 years"" 20-ton, uncrewed tanks could operate with renewable
energy.

Lt Gen Nugee said that in such a scenario ""that makes it possible... to be propelled by a green energy
solution"".

""Not all our vehicles are going to be susceptible to this, but what we should be doing is looking for the
mindset and the opportunity to develop different types of vehicles which are susceptible to renewable
energy over time,"" he said.

Lt Gen Nugee added that troops were being educated about the beneÔ¨Åts of vegetarianism for both a
healthy life style and the planet.

He said that they would look to educate the three services ""that eating less meat is a good idea"", adding that
they would also ""produce menus in our messes and so on that might offer more alternatives to meat"".

In the foreword of the report, Jeremy Quin, Minister for Defence Procure ment, said the department was
""determined to play our full part in helping the government address climate change head on and achieve
our legal commitment of net zero by 2050"".

Mr Quin said: ""The very scale of what Defence is called upon to do makes us a carbon-emitter. However, we
recognise both the necessity and opportunity to build on our existing successes in cutting carbon and
mitigating Defence's impact on the environment.""

Defence, which accounts for 50 per cent of the UK Government's emissions, will also look to rewild parts of
land   with   ""no-mow""   trials   to   see   how   it   can   encourage   pollination   and   enhance   biodiversity.   After   a
successful trial at Westdown Camp on Salisbury Plain where a ""nomow"" trial encouraged wild herbs, Ô¨Çowers
and shrubs to grow, work is under way to roll the initiative out across the Defence estate.

Lt Gen Nugee added: ""The reality is that we own a signiÔ¨Åcant chunk of the UK's land mass and I believe have
a responsibility to look after that land mass as best we possibly can to try and increase biodiversity and
improve environmental sustainability on it.""

Stalkers alarmed by deer culls 'to help environment'
Landowners fear that Scotland's ambitious plans in face of climate crisis may cause serious
difÔ¨Åculties

By Richard Baynes

SWEEPING changes to deer management designed to protect the environment in the face of climate and
biodiversity crises are to be brought in by the Scottish Government.

The move has been welcomed by environmentalists, but stalkers and some estate managers fear plans to
achieve big cuts in deer numbers could cause them serious difÔ¨Åculties. The changes were revealed yesterday
when the Scottish Government responded to an in-depth report on deer published last year.

The Deer Working Group (DWG) report was prompted by fears of environmental damage to carbon-storing
woodland and peat caused by the country's herd, which now stands at over a million. Conservationists want
to see numbers halved at least.

Among the report's recommendations accepted by the Scottish Government are keeping deer densities
below   10   per   square   kilometre   across   much   of   the   Highlands,   development   of   plans   to   impose   legally
enforceable cull targets via a ""planned cull approval system"" and use of existing powers to force culls.

This would take control of numbers out of landowners' hands, and some fear they could be left with too few
deer for commercial stalking.

A decision on whether to extend the hind-shooting season from mid-February into April, which led to fears
stalkers would have to shoot and disembowel heavily pregnant hinds, has been deferred - but stalkers are
angry it is not completely off the table, and concerned use of night-sights could be legalised.

In total the Scottish Government accepted 94 of the 99 recommendations in the DWG report. The plan for 10
red deer per square kilometre as the limit over large areas of the Highlands suggests this could be reviewed
""in light of developments in public policies, including climate change measures"" - likely to mean an even
lower density.

The Government is also backing measures to cut the number of deer starving to death in winter - which
could only be done with bigger culls.

Introducing the response, Roseanna

Cunningham,   the   environment   and  climate change   minister,   said   the   last   decade   has   seen   signiÔ¨Åcant
progress in dealing with the deer problem.

But she said protecting investments in natural solutions to carbon investment and boosting biodiversity
must now be the focus of deer management.

""We recognise that now is the time to step up our deer management work,"" she said. ""The twin climate and
biodiversity crises require a much greater urgency to our efforts to ensure sustainable deer management
and we must recognise more can and must be done to better realise our ambitious targets on vital issues
such as forestry regeneration, woodland creation, peatland restoration and habitat improvement.""

Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: ""The direction is clear: iconic deer
stand in the way. Wildlife and green groups will be rejoicing.""

He added: ""Sanctioning night scopes for culls will be endorsing something illegal across much of Europe.
Asking deer managers to cut large moving calves from the stomachs of pregnant hinds into mid-April must
be off the table if the Scottish Government wants to avoid public distaste.""

Climate policy revamp task for Bank and FCA raises
eyebrows

By Tom Rees

THE City watchdog and a core part of the Bank of England have been handed new climate policy remits as
they became the latest to be swept up by the Treasury's green drive.

The Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority's efforts to regulate the City will
have to consider the Government's goal to reach a net zero economy by 2050.

However, questions were raised over how the two regulators will revamp policy as the Treasury widened its
push to green Britain's Ô¨Ånancial institutions ahead of the COP26 summit. The PRA, set up after the Ô¨Ånancial
crisis, is primarily tasked with overseeing the stability of the Ô¨Ånancial system. ""It's great that they've done it
but we need to make sure that it actually translates into concrete action,"" said Simon Youel, head of policy at
Positive Money. ""We need to see more of the details of what exactly this is going to mean and look like for
regulation‚Ä¶ The ball's in their court in how they interpret it."" The Treasury said the Government wants to
mobilise ""private Ô¨Ånance behind sustainable"" growth and ""ensure every Ô¨Ånancial decision takes climate
change into account"". It has already given the Bank's monetary and Ô¨Ånancial policy committees an eco-
friendly mandate ahead of the UK's hosting of the COP26 summit in Glasgow later this year.

The PRA is already behind the Bank's climate stress tests on banks and insurers but delayed the Ô¨Åndings due
to Covid-19. Giving the Bank's monetary policy committee a green goal was criticised by former governor
Lord King earlier this month.

He warned that changing the Bank's policy to consider climate aims is a ""slippery slope to undermining the
inde pendence of the Bank"".

""What seems a harmless gesture today may prove damaging tomorrow,"" he said. ""I know climate change
arouses passions, but that is no reason to embroil the Bank of England in what should be the responsibility of
Government.""

'What seems like a harmless gesture today may prove to be more damaging tomorrow.'

Weeds pose greatest ever threat to crops due to climate
change

By Olivia Rudgard ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT

WEEDS are prospering as a result of climate change and are a greater threat to food crops now than at any
point in human history, scientists have warned.

Food security is under threat if weed resistance to herbicides becomes widespread, a study has said, because
crops are more badly affected by them than they were in the pre-herbicide era.

The paper from Rothamsted Research, the agricultural research institute, compared the progress of land
treated with herbicides since the 1960s and land where the chemicals had not been used.

On the herbicide-free land, weeds had cut the yield by more than half, up from a third in the Ô¨Årst 10 years of
the study. The weeds crowd out the wheat because they do better in a warmer climate and because modern
crops are shorter to maximise their productivity, the authors said.

At the Hertfordshire study site average temperatures have risen at a rate of 0.04 degrees per year and are
now around two degrees higher than in 1969, the scientists said in a paper published in the journal Global
Change

Biology.

""If we could no longer rely on herbicides, it could be argued that, in terms of weed pressure, the situation is
now worse than before their widespread introduction in the 1960s,"" the paper concludes.

Herbicide resistance is a growing threat to agriculture. In the UK, blackgrass has developed resistance to
many of the herbicides used to control it and can pose a serious threat to yields if not controlled.

The use of nitrogen fertiliser, widely applied to boost soil fertility, increased yields where herbicides were used
but caused a decline in yields on the non-herbicide areas because it boosted weed growth and caused
competition for resources.

Lead   author   Dr   Jonathan   Storkey   said:   ""Our   results   demonstrate   that   weeds   now   represent   a   greater
inherent threat to crop production than before the advent of herbicides and integrated, sustainable solutions
to weed management are urgently needed to protect the high yield potential of crop varieties.""

Drax pressured by climate activists for pellet maker tie-up

By Rachel Millard

DRAX shareholders are coming under pressure from environmental activists to oppose the biomass power
plant owner's purchase of a pellet producer.

Last month Drax announced a ¬£226m deal to buy Pinnacle Renewable Energy, which supplies biomass
pellets from Canada and the US to Drax's turbines in North Yorkshire, among other customers. Shareholders
are due to vote on the deal on March 31, but a group of 22 organisations, including ShareAction and Friends
of the Earth US, have written to them warning it creates ""Ô¨Ånancial and reputational risks"".

Drax has spent years switching four of its six turbines to run on biomass instead of coal, under climate
accounting rules that deem burning biomass to be carbon neutral on the basis that trees sequester carbon
during their lifetime.

Drax said: ""Climate change experts and scientists ... have stated sustainable biomass is critical to reach global
climate   targets   -   both   in   generating   renewable   electricity   and   in   delivering   negative   emissions   with
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS).""

Skewers out for 'climate risk' beach barbecues

By Daily Telegraph Reporter

BARBECUES could be banned on Brighton's beaches after the ""woke"" city council said they contributed to
climate change.

The council has come under Ô¨Åre over the proposal to stop people enjoying barbecues on all beaches, parks
and open spaces in the area.

The Green Party-run authority said that disposable barbecues are partly to blame for the world's rising CO2
levels. It says the move is part of the direction for action on climate change with the aim of making the
seaside resort carbon neutral by 2030.

The plans have been condemned by residents and tourists alike who have accused the Green-run council of
being ""the worst type of woke"" and trying to kill the summer tourism trade.

One said: ""The insanity on banning barbecues is just unbelievable. This will make zero difference.""

The council said the proposals were in their very early stages as part of a raft of environmental schemes
under consideration and would go to a consultation.

Climate change may cause dairy and potato shortages

By Emma Gatten

A SHORTFALL in milk and potatoes could occur within the next 30 years under worst-case climate change
scenarios, the Met OfÔ¨Åce has said.

Research published in the journal Climate Risk Management found that heat stress in dairy cattle, which can
lead to lower milk production, is projected to increase signiÔ¨Åcantly in key dairy regions of the UK, particularly
south western England.

While temperatures that cause heat stress currently occur around two to three days a year in the South
West, this could increase to more than 30 days between 2051 and 2070.

The study also covered the  climate change   impacts   on   the   potato   sector   due   to   late   blight,   a   disease
affecting potato crops, which occurs in warm, humid weather. It found that late blight was likely to occur
more often across the UK within 30 to 50 years, with the greatest increases in western and northern regions.
In east Scotland, which has a lot of potato farming, blight may occur around 70 per cent more often than it
does now.

The study was based on worst-case climate change scenarios, which the Met OfÔ¨Åce said were ""credible""
because current mitigation efforts, such as the net-zero pledge, were not guaranteed.

Dr Freya Garry, the study author, said there could be even greater impacts on dairy farms in other areas of
the country: ""Our study found that future dairy cattle in parts of the South East may be exposed to heat
stress for an extra two months per year. At the moment, cattle in the South East experience around a week
per year of these conditions.""

Climate change Ô¨Åght to pile higher costs on British
businesses

By Rachel Millard and Alan Tovey

COMPANIES face higher costs under plans to tackle climate change that could force many more Ô¨Årms to pay
for their carbon emissions.

The Government has unveiled a substantial package of proposals to encourage industries from steel-making
to car-making and pharmaceuticals to slash their carbon dioxide output.

Proposals include extending the emissions trading scheme to other sectors of the economy beyond the aviation, power generation and certain other heavy energy users to which it has applied.

Ministers did not set out speciÔ¨Åcs but it is thought the scheme could eventually cover farming, which along
with land use accounts for about 12pc of the UK's annual emissions, or 67 million tonnes.

The move is among efforts that could compel companies to label products with their carbon content, swap
natural gas for hydrogen and install carbon capture systems.

The Government said industry needed to to cut emissions by at least two-thirds by 2035 and by 90pc by 2050
compared with 2018 levels.

That will help the UK meet its legally binding target to cut national emissions to net zero by 2050, but the
plans are likely to be controversial with many businesses already saddled with high energy costs.

The Government concedes that ""in many cases, the Ô¨Ånancial cost of making low carbon industrial products
will be higher than the carbon intensive production methods used now"".

Ana Musat, head of policy at Aldersgate Group - a coalition of businesses including Siemens and National
Grid - said: ""Industry is really willing to play its part but in terms of the additional costs that are incurred there
needs to be a policy framework that allows them to remain competitive.""

The UK's emissions trading scheme was set up after Britain left the EU scheme due to Brexit. Businesses in
sectors covered by the scheme are allowed to emit a Ô¨Åxed amount and must have permits to cover those
emissions.

They can buy and trade the permits from others and can be allocated free permits by the Government.

In the new Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy released yesterday the Government said it wanted to ""use
carbon pricing as a tool to send a clear market signal"" and would review the emissions trading scheme next
year.

""This will include consulting on a net zero consistent emissions cap; reviewing the long-term role of free
allowances; exploring expanding the scope of the scheme to cover more sectors of the economy and linking
with other schemes internationally.""

Energy minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""The work we do in the next decade will be essential to ensure
industry can Ô¨Çourish during its transition to net zero, without moving emissions and businesses abroad.""

Climate crisis is 'like threat of nuclear war'
Environment Agency chief urges people to adapt their lives ready to survive the irrevocable
changes ahead

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

THE head of the Environment Agency will compare climate change to the Cold War, arguing that the world
needs to adapt to survive the ""existential threat"" of global warming.

Sir James Bevan will talk about his experiences as a child living under the threat of nuclear war in a speech to
be given today at a discussion hosted by the Whitehall and Industry Group.

Net zero goals will not be enough to halt the effects of climate change and adaptations will be necessary to
help humanity cope, he is expected to tell business leaders at the private event.

""When I was growing up in the Seventies and the Cold War was a reality, the government ran a public
information campaign to tell us all how to cope with nuclear attack, called Protect and

Survive. Those days are thankfully behind us, and it was always a moot point whether that was the best
response to the existential threat of nuclear attack. But if we want to respond to the existential threat we face
today - the climate emergency - then we could adopt a variation on that slogan: Adapt and Thrive.""

Protect and Survive was developed by the government to inform the British public about what to do in the
event of a nuclear strike.

As well as a booklet which could be bought for 50p, 20 short cartoons were also created, advising people on
how to choose a fallout room, stockpile and ration supplies and care for casualties.

Originally classiÔ¨Åed, they were leaked and broadcast on BBC's Panorama in March 1980.

An unavoidable threat is now posed by climate change, as the Earth has already warmed one degree above
preindustrial temperatures, causing extreme Ô¨Çooding, coastal erosion, serious droughts, water shortages and
wildÔ¨Åres,

Sir James will say.

The UK's target to reach net zero by 2050, he said, was ""not enough to save our planet"". We needed to ""adapt
how we live so that we are resilient to the irrevocable changes carbon has already wrought in our climate
and those still to come"".

Under the terms of the Paris Agreement, countries including the UK, have pledged to introduce measures to
limit warming to less than 2C and keep it as close as possible to 1.5C - goals that some scientists have said are
not attainable unless decarbonisation plans become more ambitious.

Sir James will say the crisis offers the ""opportunity to create a better world""

including ""cleaner, greener cities which are more beautiful and better to live in than the ones we have now"".

His call echoes the Government's ""build back better"" plan for economic recovery after the coronavirus, which
promises green jobs and investment in infrastructure.

Sir James has previously warned that some of Britain's coastal communities may have to be relocated due to
rising sea levels. Last summer he said that the UK was no longer a ""wet and rainy country"" and urged more
caution with water consumption.

Knebworth House cracks after being hit by climate change

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

A TURRET at Knebworth House has developed huge cracks after extreme weather due to climate change.

The Hertfordshire country house, parts of which date back to the 15th century, developed the faults in its
northwest turret as a result of changes to temperature and rainfall, Historic England said.

It was previously repaired in the 1990s but staff noticed the cracks reappearing and growing over the past
Ô¨Åve years, prompting an investigation by the government body, which has now awarded a grant of ¬£74,175
for repairs.

A set of foundations which combines Tudor and Victorian engineering is also thought to be at fault.

An ongoing programme of repairs which started in the mid-20th century has so far cost ¬£5million, ¬£1million
of which has come from Historic England.

The new cracks are ""thought to be associated with climate change: increased levels and cycles of rainfall
combined with periods of higher temperatures,"" it said. Rainfall can cause erosion, mould and leaks in old
buildings, while extreme temperature Ô¨Çuctuations put structures under stress.

Once owned by the 19th century writer and translator Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, famous for coining the
phrases ""it was a dark and stormy night"" and ""the pen is mightier than the sword"", in modern times it has
been used as a Ô¨Ålming location for The Crown, Paddington 2, The King's Speech and Batman the Movie.

Purchased by the Lytton family in 1490, the house has been remodelled several times and was redesigned in
the early 19th century by well-known architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, after he married Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton.

Tony Calladine, the regional director for Historic England in the east of England said: ""Knebworth House is an
important historic building and a major visitor attraction. We're pleased to support the urgent repairs to the
northwest turret of the house to ensure that this remarkable property can be enjoyed by visitors in the
future.""

Dr Robert Fernley, the chairman of the Knebworth House Education and Preservation Trust, said: ""We are
extremely grateful to have received this support from Historic England.

""This grant will allow us to carry out emergency repairs that will enable us to continue visitor access to
Knebworth House and retain employment.""

Military must help combat climate change, says Nato chief

By Danielle Sheridan Defence corresponDent

THE military must cut its emissions, the head of Nato has said, as he tried to woo the United States on
climate change.

Jens Stoltenberg, who yesterday morning met with John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, in Brussels,
tweeted that the two ""agree that climate change makes the world more unsafe"".

He went on to suggest that Nato ""needs to step up and play a bigger role in combating it - including by
reducing military emissions"".

The   UK,   one   of   the   military   alliance's   30   members,   has   committed   to   meeting   the   legally   binding
commitment to get to net zero by 2050.

As part of this target the Ministry of Defence is required to meet the Government's sustainability objectives.

The department's Climate Change and Sustainability Review, led by Lt Gen Richard Nugee, will be published
in the coming weeks.

In 2019, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the head of the Army, pledged that the army would undergo a green
revolution.

As a result, hybrid armoured 4x4s have been tested for the Ô¨Årst time.

Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, announced in December last year that algae, alcohol and household
waste would power RAF Ô¨Åghter jets to cut carbon emissions.

The British Army Training Support Unit Belize and the Defence Infrastructure Organisation have also collabo
rated with the conservation charity Panthera to protect endangered jungle wildlife by ensuring essential
military training does not disturb local habitats.

It is understood, meanwhile, that the MoD has invested in renewable energy on several defence sites.

An MoD spokesman said: ""We are committed to offering a greener culture in defence while maintaining
critical outputs and capabilities.""

Prince urges fund managers to Ô¨Åght global warming

By Rachel Millard

THE Prince of Wales has urged major institutional investors to use their Ô¨Ånancial Ô¨Åre power to help cut
carbon emissions.

He said the ""climate crisis"" was ""rapidly becoming a catastrophe that will dwarf the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic"". He added: ""I am very glad to know that the global investment community is responding to the
urgency of the situation we face...

""The global Ô¨Åre power of institutional investors must be harnessed and directed towards a net-zero future.""

The Prince made the comments in a foreword to a new blueprint to help fund managers pick assets that will
slow down global warming.

The Net Zero Investment Framework is being launched today by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate
Change. The IIGCC said 35 investors are now using the framework to guide their decisions, including Scottish
Widows, Royal London and Legal and General Investment Management.

Pride and Prejudice estate at risk from climate change

By Olivia Rudgard environment correSpondent

COLIN FIRTH's Mr Darcy caused hearts to Ô¨Çutter when he emerged from a lake at Lyme Park, Cheshire,
during the BBC's Pride and Prejudice.

But the famous estate is under threat from climate change and could be irreparably damaged in just a few
decades without preventative action, the National Trust has said.

The number of its sites at risk from a changing climate is expected to more than double by 2060, the charity
warned. Among those facing irreparable damage is the country mansion used as the setting for Pemberley
in the 1995 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel.

The Grade I listed country house is already under threat from Ô¨Çoodwater and suffered a major Ô¨Çood in 2019,
prompting the charity to plant trees on nearby moorlands in an attempt to protect the 16th century mansion
and its surrounding deer park.

The charity has mapped the climate risks faced by different sites and properties across the UK in order to
more effectively protect them.

If climate change is left unchecked, the number at high or medium risk of climate-related hazards could
increase from 20,457 today to 47,888 in 2060, out of a total 67,426 sites.

Other threats include invasive pests and diseases, heat damage, and land slides and coastal erosion.

Harry Bowell, National Trust director of land and nature, said: ""This map is a game changer in how we face
the threat climate change poses to the places we care for.

""While the data draws on a worst- case scenario, the map paints a stark picture of what we have to prepare
for. But by acting now, and working with nature, we can adapt to many of these risks. One of the most
exciting   opportunities   here   is   the   map   ensures   a   joine-dup   approach   in   which   neighbours,   landowners,
charities and developers can come together to identify risks and collectively intervene to tackle issues and
make large-scale change.

""Planting trees, restoring peatlands, slowing the Ô¨Çow of water in Ô¨Çood-prone river valleys and preparing our
places and collections for the increased heat and humidity are some of the measures this map can inform.""

Other properties at risk of damage from Ô¨Çooding include Fountains Abbey in Ripon, North Yorks, which the
charity hopes to protect in a ¬£2.5million project to slow the Ô¨Çow of the River Skell.

Natural landmarks under threat from coastal erosion include Birling Gap in East Sussex and the Giant's

Green savings bond allows investors to support climate
projects

By Rachel Millard

SAVERS will be able to invest in efforts to tackle climate change under a new national savings bond to raise
money for green projects.

The product will be launched through National Savings and Investments (NS&I) this year as the Government
tries to get the country behind its efforts to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Hitting the target will
require up to ¬£50billion in investment per year, according to estimates from the climate change committee,
which   advises   the   Government,   with   major   overhauls   and   changes   in   consumer   behaviour   required   in
sectors such as heating, power and transport.

Details have yet to be announced, but the Treasury said the new savings product would be closely linked to
the framework of a new sovereign green bond, also conÔ¨Årmed in yesterday's Budget, which should issue at
least ¬£15billion this year.

The NS&I product will ""give all UK savers the opportunity to take part in the collective effort to tackle climate
change, beneÔ¨Åting from the innovative reporting standards planned for the green gilt programme"", the
Treasury said. Green projects that could beneÔ¨Åt include those which would otherwise struggle to raise
money as they are at an early stage, such as carbon capture and storage schemes.

Returns are expected to be ""competitive"" but details have yet to be announced. Gareth Mee, UK Ô¨Ånancial
services partner at EY, said green bonds were ""interesting and innovative"" but must be managed carefully.

He said: ""The accounting and monitoring of both these initiatives are complex and will require best-in-class
accounting   and   reporting   frameworks   to   ensure   that   green   funds   are   used   appropriately   and   in   a
transparent manner. Overall, the beneÔ¨Åts to the taxpayer and to individual investors have the potential to be
far-reaching.""

The bonds are on top of a new UK

Infrastructure Bank, based in Leeds, to leverage billions into efforts to cut carbon emissions and develop
regional economies.

However, many in the energy sector were underwhelmed by the measures in the Budget, given the huge
investment needed to hit the legally binding net-zero target.

Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade body, welcomed the new bank as well as plans to
upgrade ports to help develop offshore wind turbines. But she added: ""Meeting the most ambitious climate
change targets of any major economy will require more ambition than was in today's Budget. We need a
concerted, cross-government approach.

""The energy sector is ready to continue reducing emissions, supporting jobs all around the country and
driving   economic   growth.   The   question   is   how   the   Government   plans   to   turn   their   ambition,   and   our
willingness to invest, into a plan of action.""

Alison Murrin, from the law Ô¨Årm Ashurst, said: ""It does feel that the measures announced today only scratch
the surface.""

'Slow' ocean may cause climate chaos
Atlantic 'conveyor belt' at its most sluggish in 1,000 years may lead to extreme weather, warn
scientists

By Emma Gatten environment editor

THE Atlantic current system that maintains mild weather in Europe is at its weakest in over a millennium,
most likely because of climate change, scientists have found.

The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc) is part of a system of ocean currents that acts as a
conveyor belt to move water around the Earth, redistributing heat and acting as a key link in maintaining the
world's climate.

It began a serious slowdown around 1850 and is now at its slowest in 1,000 years, according to a study in the
journal Nature Geoscience.

It is not certain what the impact of further weakening will be on weather patterns, but scientists believe it
could bring more heatwaves in Europe, and sea level rise on the east coast of the US.

The impact of changing water temperatures is also potentially devastating for some marine life, with the
slow down already linked to lower cod numbers off Maine.

Some evidence suggests there could be a ""tipping point"" sometime after 2100 when the system collapses,
which could cause intense winter storms in Europe and a signiÔ¨Åcant cooling effect across the northern
hemisphere that would not be offset by global warming.

Co-author Dr David Thornalley, from

University College London, said: ""This study shows the increasing evidence in support of the modern Atlantic
Ocean   undergoing   unprecedented   changes   in   comparison   to   the   last   millennium,   and   in   some   cases
longer.""

Scientists from Ireland, Britain and Germany looked at 11 different sources of data, including tree rings, ocean
sediment and corals.

The Amoc has only been directly measured since 2004, leaving scientists to rely on indirect measurements
such as these to monitor historic change, which produce imprecise results.

Dr Laura Jackson, a Met OfÔ¨Åce scientist specialising in Amoc who was not involved in the study, said there
were ""still uncertainties associated with using these indirect observations"".

But the paper adds to previous research that found a weakening of the Amoc, with one study suggesting
there has been a 15 per cent decrease since the mid-century.

Climate change models assume a slowing of the Amoc, because the water is driven by its density, which is
due to low temperatures and salinity.

Both of these are expected to change as greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere and melting ice and
increased rainfall reduces saline content. Dr Andrew Meijers, deputy science leader of polar oceans at British
Antarctic Survey, said: ""The Amoc has a profound inÔ¨Çuence on global climate, and particularly in North
America and Europe, so this evidence of an ongoing weakening of the circulation is critical new evidence for
the interpretation of future projections of regional and global climate."" But Tim Palmer, a professor in cli
mate physics at Oxford University, said: ""The extent to which Amoc variability affects European weather is a
matter of great uncertainty, as there are many other drivers for variations in European weather, including
atmospheric chaos.

""Overall, this is an interesting study.



 



However, it shouldn't be over-interpreted.""

Smile! Tech will Ô¨Åx it
Bill Gates delivers that rare thing: a cheerful book about climate change, which says we can
have it all. But is it wishful thinking?

By Emma GATTEN

HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE DISASTER by Bill Gates 272pp, Allen Lane, T ¬£16.99 (0844 871 1514), RRP ¬£20,
ebook ¬£9.99 .....

Climate change narratives tend towards doom, gloom and upheaval. Disaster is coming, and stopping it will
require a fundamental reshaping of our lives, and perhaps even of the global capitalist system. That message
has reached a critical mass in recent years.

But as climate change has hit the mainstream agenda it has spurred some new ways of thinking from those
who accept that something must be done, but who are hoping it doesn't require a revolution. Now Bill Gates
is here to tell you that you can have it all; consumption, growth and manageable sea levels. He's just not
exactly sure how yet.

How to Avoid a Climate Disaster starts from Gates's overarching belief that things are going pretty well for
humankind, all told, so long as we iron out some wrinkles. In Gates's world, climate change is deÔ¨Ånitely one
of the bigger wrinkles, but still a surmountable challenge that can be met with the right policy and, most
importantly, some snazzy tech Ô¨Åxes.

It's easy to get exercised by the impending catastrophe of climate change. One paper released in 2019 was so
doom-mongering it reportedly drove people into therapy. You're unlikely to be similarly agitated by Gates's
book, unless you feel heart palpitations at the thought of cutting edge battery technology and smart devices
(some people, I know, do). He runs through the solutions we already have in our grasp - mainly the switch to
renewables and electric vehicles.

There's little in this that will surprise anyone with a vague awareness of cli mate policy, and quite a lot
missing. His overview of food production, in particular, ignores developments in regenerative agriculture,
indoor farming, and our understanding of the importance of farmland biodiversity.

Throughout   the   book,   the   narrow   focus   on   Ô¨Åxing   greenhouse   gas   emissions   comes   at   the   expense   of
concern over the impact on our rapidly depleting ecosystems, despite a

REUTERS growing recognition that the fates of the two are intertwined.

But Gates, who has worked for 20 years on projects to alleviate global poverty, is laser focused on human
welfare. And having it all has to work for everyone, the developing world included. It's not enough to work out
how we feed the world on current diets in a sustainable way. We should expect the developing world to
catch up with our consumption of meat and dairy, though one recent study suggests this would require six
Earths.

Behaviour   change   is   largely   off   the   agenda   here.   We're   not   going   to   substantially   trim   our   meat   consumption, drive less, or pay more for our energy, argues Gates, so there's no point going down that route. Not
only that, but we'll have to work out how to accommodate billions more people doing the same. That leaves
some big gaps to Ô¨Åll, for which Gates's answer is largely technology that we don't yet have. He is cautious
here to distance himself from the idea that the climate optimists' great white hope, direct air capture of
carbon dioxide (in which he has heavily invested), is going to save us.

But he still leaves us hanging on how we're going to meet some of the great challenges ahead of us. On
chemical fertilisers, for instance, there's no question poorer countries should be using more, though we have
no way of capturing their greenhouse gas emissions.



 



Despite not having the answers, Gates is asking the right questions, which many of his fellow optimists tend
to overlook. Two thirds of the global economy are committed to a net zero plan, and policymakers are already
involved in many of the conundrums that Gates lays out: how to ensure a steady power supply as you make
the switch to renewable energy; how to incentivise the use of electric vehicles; how to shift whole cities off
the gas grid.


But Gates is concerned with how to ensure developing countries, many of which will be worse hit by the
impact of climate change created by richer nations, do not get left behind. That's not just a moral question;
without alternatives they will have no choice but to embed the same polluting behaviours as industrialised
nations did. The UK may be smug about its net zero goals, and its rapid decarbonisation. But, as with a
pandemic, we will eventually come to realise we're all in it together.

Expansion of Paris airport scrapped over climate fears

By Our Foreign Staff

FRANCE has announced it is cancelling the planned expansion of Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris on
environmental grounds.

Barbara   Pompili,   the   environment   minister,   said   that   building   a   fourth   terminal   to   boost   the   airport's
capacity by 40million passengers per year was ""obsolete"" and not in keeping with efforts to Ô¨Åght global
warming.

The government has asked airport operator ADP to scrap the current project ""and present a new one, more
consistent with its objectives concerning climate change and the protection of the environment"".

ADP said the move was ""one of the outcomes of the Covid-19 crisis"" and said it would now begin ""a period of
reÔ¨Çection"" about the airport's future.

The decision to disband the project, which was expected to cost at least ‚Ç¨7billion (¬£6billion), comes a week
after a French court ruled the government had failed to take sufÔ¨Åcient measures to halt climate change.

The plan to extend Europe's second biggest airport had already run into resistance from environmentalists.

Conservatives must not surrender post-Brexit climate policy
to Left
Markets will drive carbon prices but the Chancellor should be prepared to pay out a tax
bonus to public

AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD

There is a beautifully simple ""market"" way to lift the price of carbon, and there is a very bad interventionist
way. Choose the wrong one and you squander public consent for the net-zero transition.

Emmanuel Macron learnt this to his cost and has never fully recovered. The Gilets Jaunes began as a protest
against fuel taxes, and mushroomed into a cultural uprising by a neglected France profonde against a
metropolitan Paris elite that speaks with a different ideological accent.

The UK must not repeat that mistake as the Government draws up plans for its post-Brexit climate strategy.
Leaks suggest that the Treasury sees a carbon tax as money for the taking. Subtler statecraft is required.

The good way to keep the public on side is a rising carbon fee imposed on emitters that is handed back to
every household as a cash dividend. There is already such a blueprint in the US Congress (HR 763) backed by
all former chiefs of the US Federal Reserve and Nobel economists from Keynesian Left to free-market Right.

The fee starts at $15 a ton and ratchets up $10 every year until the task is done. The higher the fee, the bigger
the citizen bonus.

The   late   climate   entrepreneur   Ted   Halstead   argued   that   such   a   dividend   is   the   answer   for   political
conservatives to an issue that has been surrendered to the Left. If you want to gain democratic traction fast,
pay the Ô¨Årst Climate Bonus in advance as an aperitif. The price signal does the work without the need for a
dirigiste bureaucracy picking technology winners and losers, or overpromising with green new deals that are
never what they seem to be. Ursula von der Leyen's variant relies a lot on Putin's gas pipeline. Canada's
provinces have been experimenting with a carbon fee and dividend for years. Ottawa introduced a national
fee in 2018 starting at C$20, rising to C$50 by 2022, and in theory reaching C$170 by 2030 - but that will never
be necessary. Roughly 90pc is returned to households as a dividend. The rebate last year for a family of four
was C$888 (¬£506) in Alberta. The poorest 60pc of the population saw a net transfer on average because their
carbon footprint is lower. The fuel poverty argument collapses. The European Commission aims to siphon off
EU carbon revenues for its own use, much as Stuart kings used the Royal

African Company to secure an income without having to rely on Parliament. The funds will not be rotated
back to the people. They will be used for institutional empire building. The Treasury itch in this country is to
use the money to help plug big holes left by the pandemic, but that is to confuse objectives. A well-managed
transition to net-zero will create its own bonanza of cascading riches and revenue, but Ô¨Årst you have to get
the politics right.

The Citizens Climate Lobby says Britain should stop following the EU's emissions trading scheme - better
than it was but still full of exemptions - and instead go full throttle for the fee and dividend model. It should
act with the agility shown in the vaccine campaign.

""Coming out of Brexit, we can do what we want,"" said Wolfram Moebius, from the UK steering committee.
""The dividend should be as visible as possible. People need to see their cheque in the post.""

The Prime Minister has wisely vetoed a meat and butter tax. Such a deranged scheme plays to fears that
carbon abatement means giving up everything we like, the hair shirt future of Extinction Rebellion. No such
sacriÔ¨Åce is needed or desirable. Capitalism will solve the climate crisis more efÔ¨Åciently - and more quickly -
than austerity can ever achieve.



 



The International Monetary Fund estimates that green investment and a rising carbon price would together
lift global GDP by an extra 0.7pc over 15 years. It is a macroeconomic gain. It puts excess capital to work with
a relatively high multiplier effect.


It was long assumed carbon prices must rise to several hundred dollars to change behaviour. No longer.
Green technology keeps lowering the tariff, and there are swathes of activity where even a modest nudge in
prices has a radical outcome. A paper for Nature Climate Change argued $20 would mitigate much global
deforestation, and $50 would largely stop it.

Coal was driven out of the UK market once carbon prices reached $30.

Thresholds vary by region but new wind and solar are already cheaper than new coal for two-thirds of the
world's population, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Any carbon price would soon render
existing coal plants obsolete almost everywhere.

The Stern-Stiglitz High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices three years ago opted for a range of $40-80,
rising to $50-100 by 2030. Facts on the ground have already run ahead.

""We   think   $50   will   do   the   job.   All   you   need   is   a   realistic   signal   and   markets   will   come   forward   with
technologies nobody has even thought of,"" said Kingsmill Bond, from Carbon Tracker.

Markets have already delivered.

They have cut the cost of solar panels by 90pc in a decade. Strike prices on North Sea wind dropped from
¬£150 per MW/h to ¬£39.50 in Ô¨Åve years, with more to come. Energy storage is tracking the same cost curve
with a lag. So is green hydrogen, so is closed-loop geothermal, so is carbon capture, and so are nuclear
batteries. Electric vehicles will reach purchase cost parity with fossil cars by 2022-2024. Cheaper running
costs will then lead to an avalanche. No carbon price is even needed. What remains - minus farming - are the
tough nuts of heating, cement, steel, chemicals, haulage, ships, and aircraft. Each is reachable at some price
and, where not, a sledgehammer works Ô¨Åne. If you mandate that a rising share of jet fuel must be zero-
carbon (derived from green hydrogen) the market will create the supply. Costs will plummet with scale.
""Market principles are going to let us move faster than anybody ever imagined. CEOs have discovered that
there's   a   lot   of   money   to   be   made   out   of   this   transition,""   said   John   Kerry,   America's   new   climate
generalissimo.

Indeed, they have. Big Money has switched sides. It is pulling the plug on companies that have no business
plan for life after fossils. It is lavishing attention on the new climate titans instead. One can understand why
the Treasury has its eye on climate revenues, but it does not need the money as urgently as supposed.

Pandemic costs are already being paid in part by expropriating bondholders with negative real yields. The
long-tail legacy costs can wait.

Britain should opt for the Smithian purity of a tax-neutral carbon price, and let others bluster about green
deals. That would be the proper showpiece for COP26 in Glasgow, where Adam Smith taught the world.

Cumbria coal mine 'breaches climate pact'

By Emma Gatten ENVIRONMENT EDITOR

THE UK's Ô¨Årst deep coal mine in decades leaves Britain at risk of breaking the Paris Agreement if it goes
ahead, climate scientists have told Boris Johnson.

Lars   Nilsson,   a   professor   at   Lund   University   who   contributed   to   the   latest   report   from   the   UN's
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is one of 13 experts to have written to the Prime

Minister calling for him to intervene to stop the ¬£165million West Cumbria coal mine, near Whitehaven.

The mine was approved last year by Cumbria county council, and will supply coking coal for steel production
in the UK and for export before it closes by 2049.

Critics say the mine will undermine the UK's efforts to reach net zero by 2050 and its role as a climate change
leader ahead of COP26.

The Government's climate change advisers, the CCC, have criticised the decision by Robert Jenrick, the
Housing Secretary, to decline to intervene in the matter, on the grounds that it was a local issue for Cumbria.

In the letter to the Prime Minister, the 13 international climate and energy experts say it is also in conÔ¨Çict with
the UK's obligation to try to limit global warming to 1.5C, in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

""In order to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C, global emissions must peak by 2030 (sooner for the
UK and other industrialised nations) and then decline rapidly after this date,"" the letter says.

""It is clearly inconsistent for the UK government to claim that development of a coal mine, intended to fuel
emissions for almost three decades, is not a matter for national consideration,"" it adds. The group also says
the mine is incompatible with legal commitments to reach net zero under the Climate Change Act.

The Government has defended the mine on the basis that it reduces the need for imports to supply the
British steel industry, though the CCC says 85 per cent of the coal will be exported and have called for the UK
to phase out its use by 2035.

'It is inconsistent to claim the mine is not a matter of national consideration'

Global warming 'helped virus-carrying bats Ô¨Çourish'

By Sarah Knapton science editor

CLIMATE change may have helped to drive the emergence of coronavirus, scientists have suggested.

Researchers at Cambridge University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany
looked for hotspots where the changing climate has allowed bat species to Ô¨Çourish.

They found that the southern Chinese province of Yunnan has seen some of the biggest changes which
have likely led to an extra 40 species of bats.

Previous studies have shown that the greater diversity in bat species allows for more coronavirus to emerge.

Given that each bat carries an average of 2.67 coronaviruses, the experts estimate that about 100 more
viruses are now circulating in Yunnan com pared with the start of the 20th century.

Although Yunnan is around 120 miles distance from Wuhan, where the outbreak began, it is thought the
ancestral   virus   may   have   Ô¨Årst   evolved   there   and   could   have   been   exported   through   the   trafÔ¨Åcking   of
pangolins.

Dr Robert Beyer, a researcher at Cambridge's department of zoology, said: ""Climate change over the last
century has made the habitat in the southern Chinese Yunnan province suitable for more bat species.

""Understanding how the global distribution of bat species has shifted as a result of climate change may be
an important step in reconstructing the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak.

""As climate change altered habitats, species left some areas and moved into others - taking their viruses with
them.

""This not only altered the regions where viruses are present, but most likely allowed for new interactions
between animals and viruses, causing more harmful viruses to be transmitted or evolve.""

However, experts commenting on the research said other factors than climate change were also likely to
have played a role in the virus's emergence.

Kate   Jones,   professor   of   ecology   and   biodiversity   at   University   College   London,   said:   ""Climate change
certainly has a role to play in changing species distributions to increase ecological hazard.

""However, it may turn out that increases in human populations, human movement and degrading natural
environments through agricultural expansion have a more important role.""

The study was published in the journal Science of the Total Environment.

Malaria-like illness in UK 'due to global warming'

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

BRITAIN had its Ô¨Årst case of a tickborne disease similar to Lyme last summer - a parasite with malaria-like
symptoms known as ""babesiosis"" - thought to be due to climate change.

Illnesses more often associated with warmer climates will become more common as temperatures get
hotter and wetter, a report from the WWF and other charities, including Oxfam and the National Trust, say.

""The UK is at risk of the spread of infectious diseases like dengue fever, Lyme disease and West Nile fever -
which is already present in some European countries - and from an increase in cholera infections from
warming seawaters in Europe. The vectors of these diseases are mosquitoes, sand Ô¨Çies and ticks,"" the report
says.

Lyme disease, which can cause longterm heath problems such as joint inÔ¨Çammation and cognitive issues, is
increasingly being caught in gardens and parks as well as wilder places.

In 2016, the former England rugby player Matt Dawson had to have heart surgery after being bitten by a tick
in a

London park. Around 1,000 cases of Lyme are conÔ¨Årmed in the UK each year, but the true number is thought
to be higher.

Last July marked the Ô¨Årst recorded UK-acquired case of babesiosis, a parasitic disease often found alongside
Lyme. It attacks red blood cells and causes fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, though scientists say
it has likely been in the UK for much longer. Many cases are asymptomatic, but deadly infections can occur
in the elderly or those with an impaired immune system.

Prof Richard Wall, a tick-borne-disease expert at Bristol University, said: ""We think the changing climate will
have an impact on tick populations, but the evidence is really very difÔ¨Åcult to obtain, because we don't have
good historical surveillance.""

France guilty of missing climate change targets

By Henry Samuel in Paris

A FRENCH court has found the state guilty of inaction in Ô¨Åghting climate change, in a landmark ruling that
environmentalists have dubbed the case of the century.

The verdict yesterday was an embarrassment for Emmanuel Macron, the president, as it suggested his
administration was failing in its stated promise to ""make our planet great again"".

In what is seen as the Ô¨Årst major ""climate trial"" in France, judges at the administrative court in Paris ruled
that the state had displayed ""culpable failure"" by not meeting its goals.

Greenhouse gas emissions in France fell by 0.9 per cent in 2019, well below the annual target of 1.5 per cent,
which is due to rise to 3.2 per cent from 2025.

Juliette Binoche and Marion Cotillard, the actresses who are among celebrity supporters of the campaign,
published a video shouting, ""We won!""

The court ordered the state to pay a symbolic ‚Ç¨1 to the non-governmental organisations behind the lawsuit.
Judges   will   now   decide   whether   to   order   the   state   to   take   extra   measures   to   honour   its   climate
commitments.

Global warming threatens England's mountain hares

By Max Stephens

ENGLAND'S last surviving mountain hares are at risk because of global warming, conservation groups warn.

Studies suggest there are only 2,500 left in the Peak District. The People's Trust for Endangered Species say
""the hares could be in trouble"", after experts found declining populations.

Climate change was threatening the creatures' survival, making summers too warm and reducing food
sources such as heather, the trust said.

Reduced snowfall meant the hares, with their white fur, had lost their ability to blend in with winter scenery.

Nida al-Fulaij, a manager at the People's Trust for Endangered Species, said: ""The Peak District's altitude and
colder climate is ideal habitat for mountain hares, which have adapted perfectly. But with the onset of
warmer and more erratic weather, these hares could be in trouble.""

The trust hopes the study's soon-tobe published Ô¨Åndings will help with the successful reintroduction of the
""shy, but striking"" species, as well as safe guard those remaining.

Carlos Bedson, a biologist from Manchester Metropolitan University, leading the research, said: ""Mountain
hares are effectively an ice age Arctic animal and it is a privilege to see one in England, surviving here at
lower latitudes.""

He added it was amazing to think that in normal times ""you could be working in your ofÔ¨Åce or school or
factory, and then drive to the Peak District and go out and have an Arctic wildlife exploration experience"".

Mountain hares, a sister species to the Arctic hare, died out in England during the last ice age but managed
to survive in Scotland.

Landowners in the 1870s did attempt to reintroduce them to England but only those in the Peak District
survived.

The hare's fur turns from brown in summer to white in winter, which led early biologists to believe they ate
snow to turn white. In fact, it related to differences in daylight and air temperature, which stopped them
producing brown melanin in their fur.

PM's father defends rewilding as he takes on climate
change role

By Helena Horton

FARMING must return to traditional methods to help the environment, the Boris Johnson's father has said, as
he takes on a new climate change role.

Stanley Johnson, the new international ambassador for the Conservative Environment Network (CEN), has
long been a campaigner on green issues, and is a passionate advocate of ""rewilding"", recently visiting some
reintroduced bears in Italy. The author is expected to lobby for wilder farming at the major climate change
conference COP26 in Glasgow in November.

Mr Johnson told The Daily Telegraph about his vision: ""It's not rewilding as such but going back to methods
of farming which are very much the way things were. Rain-fed agriculture, grass-fed agriculture, even not
ploughing up. You may gain more in carbon terms from doing that than from planting a load of trees. There
is an absolute need for a change in the farming system in Britain and as we come out of the EU that's an
amazing way to do that. I have just agreed to be the international ambassador for CEN.

""We are going to be focusing on the Climate Change Conference. It's an honorary assignment of course. I'm
not going to ask to be paid at my age!""

His son, the prime minister, currently has no plans to ban intensive farming and force farmers to go back to
ancient methods, though the Government is bringing in a payments scheme for farms which use their land
to improve the environment.

One matter father and son seem to Ô¨Ånd consensus on is that of beavers. Boris is understood to have put in
place their procurement for his father's land for his birthday.

Stanley said he had tried to make his land suitable for the rewilded rodents, but it had been a struggle, and
he wanted to be allowed to release them on the river through his Exmoor estate. This is illegal under current
laws, which are designed to prevent them running amok.

He is pushing for his son to get the Government to publish its national beaver strategy to enable them to be
let loose in England's waterways.

""Beavers have been put on hold at the moment because of coronavirus,"" he said, ""but I need to think about
how I am going to do it. You have the pen, a biggish pen covering a couple of acres and some running water,
you could just make a pond.

""I need to be very careful because the pond could dry up or the whole place could Ô¨Çood and they could be
washed away down the river.

""Of course I have the river, but they can't be released there until we have a national beaver policy.""

Britons are world's most concerned by climate change,
study Ô¨Ånds

By Olivia Rudgard EnvironmEnt CORRESPONDENT

BRITONS are the most concerned people in the world about climate change, with four Ô¨Åfths believing it is a
global emergency, research has shown.

A survey of 1.2 million people by the UN Development Programme (UNDP)

found that UK respondents had the highest levels of concern, alongside Italy, with 81 per cent across all age
groups regarding the situation as an emergency.

In the UK, 86 per cent of under-18s and 78 per cent of over-60s believed this, compared with 69 and 58 per
cent globally.

The poll is thought to be the largest ever of public opinion on climate change and appeared as an advert on
mobile phone games including Words with Friends, Angry Birds, Dragon City, Temple Run, and Subway
Surfers.

In   all   countries   more   under-18s   than   over-60s   believed   that  climate change   was   an   emergency,   and   a
majority   believed   so   in   every   age   group.   More   than   half   of   respondents   supported   policies   such   as
investment in wind and solar and climate-friendly farming techniques. Among the least popular policies was
the promotion of plant-based diets, with just 30 per cent supporting this.

UNDP administrator Achim Steiner said: ""The results illustrate that urgent climate action has broad support
around the globe, across nationalities, age, gender and education levels.""

Last year, Boris Johnson launched a 10-point environment plan to cut emissions, with goals that include
banning new petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

But this week the Ô¨Çagship Environment Bill to create powers for new legally-binding targets in areas such as
air pollution and biodiversity conservation, was delayed for at least six months.

Richard Black, senior associate at the non-proÔ¨Åt think tank the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said of
the survey: ""This shows that ministers have a social licence to enact policies in the coming months that will
put the UK on track to its net zero target.""

InÔ¨Çuencers targeted to boost climate forum

By Olivia Rudgard environmental correspondent

ENGAGING the youth is a constant struggle for politicians - and the UK's upcoming climate change summit
is seeking expertise in a novel area.

The Cabinet OfÔ¨Åce is searching for someone to persuade social media inÔ¨Çuencers to help it promote the
international COP26 environment conference in Glasgow in November.

The ¬£65,000, one-year contract for a ""relationship manager - inÔ¨Çuencers and civil society"" asks for someone
to be the ""primary focal point for all the inÔ¨Çuencers we work with"". The hire, set to begin work in March,
would ""manage partnerships with high-proÔ¨Åle inÔ¨Çuencers around the globe to promote COP26 and climate
action. You will identify events and other opportunities to publicly promote COP26 and climate action,
tailored to the proÔ¨Åle of each individual, drawing on the support of our diplomatic network"".

The conference has previously engaged Blackpink, the South Korean pop group, to publicise the event,
which was due to take place last year.

Blackpink, who have popularised the genre ""K-pop"" around the world, have a strong audience among young
people and are the most followed girl group on

Spotify.   In   Instagram   and   Twitter   messages   last   month,   the   group   said   climate change   was   a   ""global
challenge"" and admitted that they were ""not experts, and we're not fully aware of all the issues, but we do
care about our planet and we want to learn more"".

Earlier this week, Full Fact, the factchecking charity, found ¬£63,000 had been spent paying 42 social media
inÔ¨Çuencers to post on Instagram about the Government's Covid-19 Test and Trace service. A Freedom of
Information   request   found   that   celebrities   including   those   from   the   reality   TV   show   Love   Island   and
professional sports players had been paid to promote the scheme.

THE DARK SIDE OF GREEN
The clean-energy revolution promises to herald a new era free from pollution. And both
Boris Johnson and Joe Biden are putting money on it. But a new book suggests that in our
race to save the climate, we are destroying the environment and starting a whole new war
over the planet's natural resources. Harry de Quetteville reports

It is a compelling vision: by 2050, this island nation will no longer contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. It
will grace the globe leaving no imprint, no carbon trail to threaten future generations, merely kissing the
surface of the silver sea. Not that we residents will be energy starved, husbanding our watts like misers,
parcelling out energy as if on wartime ration cards, shivering physically and shrivelling economically and
politically. No. Two months ago, Boris Johnson set out how we can have our cake and eat it, consuming at full
tilt as, over the next three decades, a green industrial revolution powers us forward with clean energy and
clean consciences. 'We will harness Mother Nature,' he said. 'Green and growth can go hand-in-hand.'

November was a big month for environmental policy on the other side of the Atlantic too, with Joe Biden's
presidential election victory meaning that America will rejoin the Trump-scorned Paris Agreement, that
landmark 2016 deal to keep global average temperatures from rising more than two degrees above pre-
industrial levels). Like Johnson, Biden has promised a green energy revolution, though on a far grander scale.
While Britain pledges ¬£12 billion of government investment, Biden's plan is to spend ¬£1.5 trillion ($2 trillion).

If Biden sticks to his plan, renewables - including wind, solar, nuclear and hydropower - could become the
world's   biggest   source   of   electricity   by   next   year,   according   to   Fatih   Birol,   head   of   the   International
EnergyAgency.Gasboilers couldbebanned in newly built UK homes from 2023, making way for hydrogen
boilers or heat pumps. Petrol and diesel cars will begin to disappear until sales of them, too, are banned, in
2030. The PM paints a picture of Britons cooking your breakfast using hydrogen power before getting in your
electric car, having charged it overnight from batteries made in the Midlands. Around you the air is cleaner,
and the trucks and trains, ships and planes are running on hydrogen or a synthetic fuel.'

GE Haliade-X 260m

It is a smorgasbord of options to help us generate, store and consume energy in cleaner, more efÔ¨Åcient ways.
And it's not impossible.

The UK is already doing well on renewables. Latest Ô¨Ågures show that in 2020 they collectively generated
around 45 per cent of our electricity, up nine per cent on 2019. If the dream of going carbon neutral is truly to
be

Big Ben 96m

realised, however, Britain will need to plug the remaining gap, and there is one obvious way to do that.

Our island makes us singularly wellplaced to capitalise on a wind boom offshore, where gusts are strong and
regular, and NIMBYs less likely to complain.

Eiffel Tower 324m

The Shard 310m

Already the UK is a global leader, with about a third of the globe's 29GW (gigawatt) offshore capacity. And we
are building more fast. The plan is to quadruple our production by 2030.

If completed, it will represent a remarkable endeavour, as we will need not only anchored, shallow-water
turbines but giant, deep-water Ô¨Çoating platforms, too. The turbines themselves will be vast. Currently the
most powerful offshore turbine in the world is GE's Haliade-X, which can power a house for two days with a
single rotation of its blade - it stands 260 metres



 



tall, two-and-a-half times the size of Big Ben. Installation of the Ô¨Årst Haliade-X Ô¨Åeld in the world, comprising
190 turbines, will begin in 2023 on Dogger Bank off the Yorkshire coast.


Atop these vast machines, behind the rotors, is a giant 'nacelle', which houses all of the components required
to generate the electricity. On the Haliade-X, this nacelle is 11 metres wide and contains the generator, known
as a PMG. The 'M' stands for magnet. A vast magnet. And it is here, at the pinnacle of a technology that
promises to liberate us from pollution and the pressure of poisoning the planet, that the clean green dream
begins to tarnish. For offshore turbines typically use no ordinary magnets.

Firstly, they are enormous in size - the Haliade-X turbine requires seven tonnes of permanent magnets, says
Paul Atherley, chairman of Pensana, a British mining company. Most offshore turbine magnets weigh about
650kg for every MW (megawatt) of power they generate. And for most, about a third of the magnet is
composed of materials with exotic names like neodymium and dysprosium, from a group of metals known
as rare earths. And while rare earths are not rare, they can be very, very dirty. Yet they are very special too.

'They have such amazing properties,' says Guillaume Pitron, a French journalist and documentary-maker
who reports on the global commodities trade, and has now written a book, The Rare Metals War. 'Magnetic,

revolution without them.' In wind turbines it is the magnetic power of rare earths that is prized. 'They are
seven to 10 times more powerful' than standard magnets, says Pitron, dramatically increasing electricity
generation. But rare earths aren't critical only to turbines. Their unique properties are vital in solar panels,
rechargeable batteries, catalytic converters, energy- efÔ¨Åcient light bulbs - as well as a vast array of hitech
products unrelated to green energy, including smartphones, camera lenses and missile defence systems -
plus they power the motors in electric cars. Such magnet motors are 'incredibly powerful for their weight,'
says Atherley. 'It's why the [electric] Porsche Taycan can accelerate 0 to 60 faster than Lewis Hamilton's F1
McLaren Mercedes.'

Indeed many forms of green energy are dependent on these rare earths, along with 20 or so cousins called
'rare metals' or 'critical raw materials'. Though known as 'rare', scarcity is not an issue, as they are about as
abundant as silver, and found around the world, including in Britain, says Andrew Bloodworth of the British
Geological Survey. The problem arises, however, in getting them out of the ground.

As these rare elements are distributed in tiny quantities, vast piles of ore need to be dug up, processed and
reÔ¨Åned to produce minuscule amounts. For a single kilo of gallium - used in energy-efÔ¨Åcient light bulbs - 50
tonnes of rock needs to be excavated, according to Pitron.

Much of this rare earth excavation happens in Baotou, a large city in China's autonomous province of Inner
Mongolia; its population has swollen from under 100,000 to more than 2.5 million as the city has become the
epicentre of the globe's rare metal dependence. China supplies around 98 per cent of these critical resources
to Europe, and Baotou has paid the price. North of the

dug up, to its west are the reÔ¨Åneries and alongside, a vast artiÔ¨Åcial tailings lake, black and sludgy: 'Ten square
kilometres of toxic efÔ¨Çuent,' as Pitron puts it. For Atherley, who has spent his career in mining, Baotou is
'horrible environmental disaster'.

'There's no getting away from the fact that we need to reduce the environmental footprint of rare-earth
extraction,'   says   Bloodworth.   Especially   because,   as   he   concedes,   they   are   irreplaceable.   'Nothing   else
performs as well as they do.'

There are obvious solutions. We could consume less. But the green revolution just beginning. 'This is the
biggest energy transition in history,' says Atherley. Bloodworth agrees. 'We're going to be increasingly reliant
on renewable technologies,' he says. 'There's no doubt we're going to need lot more rare earths in the future.'
Pitron says growth of demand 'is exponential', with consumption for various metals increasing Ô¨Åve-, nine- or
20-fold in the next few years.

What about reuse? 'The big one that everyone wants to do is recycle these things [rare earths] more,' says
Bloodworth. But that is extremely hard, precisely because they are so magnetic. And they are often used in
tiny quantities, combined with other materials. 'It's hard to separate.' Consequently, current recycling rates
are pitiful, writes Pitron: 'would be a stunning achievement for manufacturers to one day be able to recycle
just 10 percent of rare-earth metals.'

Many renewables are, it turns out, particularly difÔ¨Åcult to renew themselves. 'We tend to think of solar panels
as clean, but the truth is that there is no adequate plan to deal with solar panels at the end their 20- or 25-
year life,' notes Michael Shellenberger, author of Apocalypse Never. 'In the effort to try to save the climate, are

 





we destroying the environment?'


Extraction and recycling are just two

several problems with renewables, says Shellenberger. Threat to wildlife is also an issue - and not only a result
of mining. As solar farms need to be extremely large, building them can involve displacing animals; wind
farms threaten birds, in particular, says Shellenberger, 'big, slow-to-reproduce birds: kites, raptors, eagles and
hawks and owls'.

Another downside is reliability or, in the jargon, 'intermittency' - wind power can only be generated when it's
windy,   and   solar   power   when   it's   sunny.   A   recent   McKinsey   report   detailed   how   Germany's   increasing
reliance on solar and wind almost led to blackouts in June 2019. When largely nuclear France tried to
integrate a lot of wind energy on to its grid, says Shellenberger, it had to expand fossil fuel provision as a
backup. 'The result was actually an increase in carbon emissions.

'Renewables are just not what people think they are. People think that they harmonise society with the
natural world but that's fantasy. Renewables can't save the planet, are we going to keep letting them destroy
it?'

The high environmental price of rare earths would seem prohibitive for Britain - yet British companies are
interested in onshoring parts of this currently dirty process, including Pensana, which recently announced a
processing site outside Hull to produce a 'sustainable rare earths supply chain' from ore mined in Angola.
'The processes we're using are super-clean, different to those elsewhere in the world, notably China,' insists
Atherley. There is, of course, also a strategic element to securing new supply lines beyond China. 'The North
Sea power hub? is going to be six times bigger than China's Three Gorges

Dam. The biggest energy installation on the planet ever,' he continues. 'You can't have that reliant on just one
country.'

Annual trade of rare earths is currently a mere $6.5 billion - some 276 times less valuable than oil, says Pitron.
However, they are beginning to assume black gold's geopolitical signiÔ¨Åcance. 'We have to get them, but how
are we going to secure them?' he asks. 'Which countries will become the new Saudi Arabias of rare metals?
Argentina,

Indonesia,   South   Africa,   Russia,   China,   Kazakhstan   will   try   to   gain   inÔ¨Çuence   because   they   have   these
resources we need. And we're going to be competing with other countries for access, which will bring
tensions. There is a risk that all the conÔ¨Çict around oil access in the 20th century will repeat itself over this
""new oil"".'

Last September, the EU announced an Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials. Commissioner Thierry Breton
talked of 'strategic autonomy' by 'forging alliances' with Canada and Australia - both known to have reserves
of rare earths - and also by digging for the metals in Europe. Though there is no recent history of mining rare
earth elements in Europe, deposits have been identiÔ¨Åed in Greenland and Sweden.

Indeed, sourcing rare earths closer to home will become increasingly important as pressure on companies to
change   their   practices   grows.   The   era   of   'greenwashing'   (using   superÔ¨Åcial   corporate   gestures   of
environmentalism) is over, says Michelle Davies, international head of clean energy and sustainability for
global law Ô¨Årm Eversheds Sutherland. 'The level of scrutiny is going to be far beyond anything that business

 





people have had to experience today.'


As for the argument that it affects wildlife, she says, 'Don't underestimate how difÔ¨Åcult it is to get one of
these   projects   permitted.'   This   hurdle,   together   with   the   others   associated   with   green   energy,   such   as
recycling and reliability, can be overcome, she says. 'It's not a deal-breaker for renewables.'

After all, extraction of anything has an environmental cost. 'The world produces about a billion tonnes of iron
and steel every year,' points out Andrew Bloodworth. 'It produces about 200,000 tonnes of rare earth [ore].'
Volume alone dictates that 'the environmental impact of the production of those big industrial metals is far,
far greater'.

Pound for pound, however, rare earths are vastly more intensive to extract and reÔ¨Åne. To Shellenberger that,
in combination with renewables' unreliable, diffuse power, makes the entire green-energy revolution - Boris's
billions and Biden's trillions - a vast mistake.

'Renewables are going to have to fail, and they will fail spectacularly everywhere over the next several years,
before we discover that really there's no alternative, in terms of climate change, to doing a lot of nuclear.'

Pitron is not so sure. 'I am not against green energy,' he says. But he is concerned that we are escaping one
trap merely to fall into another. 'We will have so many environmental impacts to get these metals. Bigger
mines, deeper mines, even in the oceans. We are moving into a situation where, in 20 years, the cost of green
technologies will actually be superior to the beneÔ¨Åts. It's crazy.'

People think renewables harmonise society with nature but that's fantasy' 'There's no alternative, in terms of
climate change, to doing a lot of nuclear'

ButterÔ¨Çy population cut by half over past 45 years
Destruction of meadows, drought and climate change leads to extinction of one in 10 UK
species

By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent

ALMOST one in 10 British butterÔ¨Çy species has become extinct due to meadow destruction, scientists claim
in a new study.

Eight per cent of species have been lost in the UK, researchers said, with the overall butterÔ¨Çy population cut
in half since the Seventies.

Two of the Ô¨Åve species that went extinct became so in the past 45 years, though conservation efforts have
successfully revived one of them, the Phengaris arion, or large blue.

Lead author Martin Warren, head of development for ButterÔ¨Çy Conservation Europe, said the Ô¨Årst extinction
took place in the 1850s after the large copper butterÔ¨Çy lost its habitat, the East Anglian fenland, which was
mechanically drained for agricultural purposes.

Since then, other species have been affected as wildÔ¨Çower meadows were replaced with farmland, depriving
the creatures of food sources and breeding grounds. In the Sixties, it led to the decline to extinction of the
large tortoiseshell butterÔ¨Çy.

Dr Warren said: ""Most people look across the landscape and think it looks green and lovely, which it does in
many respects. But of course, the green is usually just one or two species of grass. Most grassland has now
been reseeded with perennial ryegrass because it's more productive for animals. It looks nice at a distance
but it doesn't have wildÔ¨Çowers.""

Species   started   to   decline   at  the   turn   of   the   20th   century   due   to   intensive   agriculture,   said   the   study,
published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Of species currently found in the UK, 20 are in decline, 21 are stable, and just nine Ô¨Çourishing.

Some of the most threatened species, such as the pearl-bordered fritillary, thrive in open spaces in woodland
and have been hit by the decline in coppicing, the traditional method of cutting trees right back to allow
regrowth.

Fragmented habitat is also a signiÔ¨Åcant issue for British butterÔ¨Çies, as is pollution from insecticides and
nitrogen from intensive agriculture and vehicle pollution. Despite these issues Dr Warren was hopeful the
British butterÔ¨Çy would recover.

Recent efforts have helped some species - in particular, the Hamearis lucina, or Duke of Burgundy ButterÔ¨Çy .

Numbers have trebled in the North

Downs in Kent after a project to create woodland clearings and boost plants such as the cowslip to provide
habitats and food.

Dr Warren said a growing interest in rewilding was welcome, but smaller landowners and farmers could be
urged to promote insect life on their land.

""ButterÔ¨Çies live in very speciÔ¨Åc areas. They need a certain type of management, so if that doesn't carry on,
they will disappear. But on the plus side, if you restore those habitats and management, then they come
back,"" he said.

ButterÔ¨Çies are better studied than other species and have been monitored for longer, meaning they stand a
greater chance of recovery, he added.



Aporia crataegi, the black-veined white butterÔ¨Çy, which became extinct in the 1920s, was a favourite of

 



Winston Churchill, though his attempts to reintroduce it at Chartwell failed.


While habitat loss is the biggest concern, the modern decline in species has been linked to the 1976 drought
- the driest summer since 1772 - from which some species never recovered.

In   a   separate   paper   also   published   in   Proceedings   of   the   National   Academy   of   Sciences,   American
researchers   warned   that   insects   were   vulnerable   to   the   effects   of   climate change,   citing   several   UK
population ""crashes"" of butterÔ¨Çies and moths linked to extreme weather over the past 50 years.

The study stated: ""Climate change impacts on insects have the potential to be considerable, even when
compared with changes in land use.""

Paulson to run Bono's climate change fund

By Lucy Burton

FORMER US Treasury secretary Henry Paulson has taken up an offer by Bono to run a fund focused on
combating climate change despite telling the U2 frontman last year that his ""dance card is full"".

Mr Paulson has agreed to run a new global fund with US private equity Ô¨Årm TPG, called TPG Rise Climate,
according to The New York Times, returning to the Ô¨Ånance sector months after Bono Ô¨Årst approached him.
""He told me, 'My dance card is full',"" Bono told the newspaper of the initial call last September. ""I thought he'd
be amazing.""

Bono and TPG Ô¨Årst teamed up Ô¨Åve years ago when the U2 singer began advising on ""impact"" investments.
Mr Paulson's move to TPG means he is returning to the Ô¨Ånance sector for the Ô¨Årst time since he left Goldman
Sachs in 2006. Eschewing publicity, his rise to the top of Goldman Sachs was little noticed until he became
chairman and chief executive in 1999.

While at Goldman and the Treasury, his passion for the environment caused controversy among global
warming sceptics, particularly after he became chairman of an organisation buying land to stop it from
being developed.

UK heatwaves to intensify as climate change accelerates

By Olivia Rudgard

BRITISH summer temperatures are set to rise faster than the global average, as scientists warn heatwaves
will be more intense.

The climate is expected to warm up to 50 per cent more quickly than the average rate of global warming,
with extremely hot days getting even hotter.

A study by researchers at the University of Bristol found that for every half degree that global temperatures
rise, UK temperatures are likely to rise by 0.75C in the summer months.

Data analysis for Wales suggests that if the world on average warmed by 3C, the hottest days would increase
to 28.9C (84F), up from 25.1C (77F) over the past 30 years. Its climate would shift from being similar to north-
west England to being more similar to the south, with temperatures exceeding those seen in London over
the past three decades.

The difference is because global average warming models include Ô¨Ågures for oceanic areas, which are not
warming as quickly as land areas. This means the temperatures that many people are likely to experience are
not fully represented in global warming projections.

The   team   analysed   a   simulation   produced   by   the   Met   OfÔ¨Åce   and   compared   it   with   recent   summers,
concluding that it was a reliable indicator of future UK temperatures.

Dr Alan Kennedy-Asser, report lead author, said: ""It's useful to see how the UK climate relates to these global
targets. A global target is kind of meaningless to an individual person, a city or a small country like the UK.""

Warming in the northern hemisphere and further from the equator is also more pronounced, with the
Arctic circle warming at twice the global average rate. The British climate is affected by the north Atlantic,
which is warming more slowly than other parts of the world, while Europe and Russia are warming more
quickly.

Last year, a Met OfÔ¨Åce study found that temperatures exceeding 35C (95F) were becoming more common in
the South East, and that areas in the North were likely to exceed 30C (86F) at least once per decade by 2100.
The UK record temperature of 38.7C (101.7F) was set in Cambridge in July 2019.

0.75C UK temperatures are likely to warm up by this amount in the summer months for every half degree rise
in the global average

TEL-2021-69.txt," Business, Tuesday, December 21, 2021 682 mots, p. 32  North Sea oil rules will ruin UK's energy independence  'Climate change compatibility checkpoint' will not open the way to new fields. It is another nail in the coffin of the sector's security Ben Marlow  Whatever you think about this Government, it has become a world leader in saying one thing and doing another: lockdown by stealth; covert cheese-andwine parties while the rest of us stay at home or are prevented from seeing loved ones; and now the latest thing - a gutless plan to wind down the North Sea oil industry and another nail in the coffin of what remains of UK energy security.  As if that were not bad enough, Greg Hands, the energy minister, is attempting to dress the whole thing up as a climate-friendly scheme to help the sector with some nonsense about how it is evidence that the Government remains pro-oil and gas. You couldn't make this stuff up.  The clue is in the name: a ""climate change compatibility checkpoint"" that all new applications to explore for fossil fuels in the North Sea will be subjected to before approval is, or isn't, granted. How this will ""open the door"" to a flurry of new fields being developed, as Mr Hands protests, is anyone's guess.  If the Government doesn't want further development in the North Sea then it should have the courage to say so, instead of introducing yet more hurdles that will either discourage investment, or worse, simply prevent it because they are impossible to clear.  But the very notion that net-zero-obsessed ministers are about to pave the way for a new era of exploration in the region is in itself laughable. Recent evidence alone would tell you that is emphatically not the case.  First, the regulator rejected Shell's plans to develop the Jackdaw field, east of Aberdeen, which is estimated to hold gas resources equivalent to between 120m and 250m barrels, on the basis of environmental grounds yet to be made public.  Then, Shell was also forced to pull out of plans to extract oil from the Cambo field, off the coast of Shetland, after fierce opposition from green campaigners, and even the threat of legal action from Greenpeace against the Government if exploration went ahead.  Mr Hands says he is ""aware"" that ""home-grown oil and gas is more climatefriendly than imports"", as if that alone is proof of the Government's support for North Sea producers, but this is little more than an attempt to spin away the reality.  'If the Government doesn't want further development, it should say so'  Shell's difficulties tell us everything there is to know about the direction of travel and there's nothing positive about it for the people employed there, for the Scottish economy, or indeed for energy security.  There are two giveaway lines in the White Paper proposal: future licences will be granted ""only on the basis that they are compatible with the UK's climate change objectives"", which means any found to ""undermine the UK's climate goals or ability to reach net zero"" will be blocked.  As the Department for Business itself acknowledges, this means ""an additional layer of scrutiny"" will be applied to future licences, alongside an ""environmental assessment"" carried out by the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning, and a ""net-zero impact assessment"" undertaken by the Oil and Gas Authority as part of the consent process for new drilling.  How that is proof that the Government is ""supporting the industry in the transition to a lower-carbon future, while also working to achieve the UK's net-zero commitment"" is anyone's guess.  On the contrary, the likelihood is that any steps to wind down the North Sea by stealth will rob Britain of its energy independence. Furthermore, by making us even more reliant on imports from unsavoury foreign regimes such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, it will do nothing to help us reach net zero. In short, yet another spectacular own goal from Westminster as it barrels blindly ahead with a green agenda with scant regard for the economic and social consequences. "

Fish typically swim in schools, making them less likely to be eaten. But a study by the University of Adelaide has found the defensive characteristic is being disrupted by ocean acidification, caused by climate change, making it easier for whales, dolphins, seabirds and other predators to target them.  Typically schools will head right when under threat from a predator, but scientists found this tendency was much more diminished as a result of ocean acidification.  The rising concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is driving up sea surface temperatures, which is causing more acidic and corrosive water to rise towards the surface.  Researchers carried out experiments in order to evaluate how species interact and behave in different ways with changing water temperatures and acidification. Fish were exposed to one of 12 treatments over a 38-day period. These included a combination of temperatures and different shoal types.  Professor Ivan Nagelkerken, lead author of the study, said: ""Fish show gregarious behaviour and cluster in shoals which helps them to acquire food and for protection against predators. Many gregarious tropical species are shifting poleward under ocean warming and interacting in new ways with fish in more temperate areas.""  Angus Mitchell, a PhD student, said: ""We found tropical and temperate fish species tend to move to the right when co-ordinating together in a shoal, especially when spooked by a predator. But this bias significantly diminished under ocean acidification.""  The study also discovered that ocean acidification led tropical fish to become bolder after four weeks, while temperate fish became bolder with increasing temperatures and ocean acidification dampened their boldness.  The study's co-author, Professor David Booth of the University of Technology, Sydney, said: ""Our findings highlight the direct effect of climate stressors on fish behaviour and the interplay with the indirect effects of new species interactions.""  Professor Nagelkerken added: ""Strong shoal cohesion and co-ordi nated movement affect the survival of a species.  ""Tropical species may initially fare poorly when moving into new temperate areas.""  'Many gregarious tropical species are shifting poleward under ocean warming and interacting in new ways' "

Parts of the region, including Co Durham and Tyne and Wear, have seen annual sunshine hours rise by more than 13 per cent since 1991 relative to the previous 30 years, compared with a rise of 5.6 per cent across the UK as a whole.  Met Office scientists said it was not clear why the North East had seen such an increase, nor whether it was attributable to man-made climate change.  Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office National Climate Information  Centre, said human-induced global warming was likely to be a ""contributing factor"". But he added that the increase could also be the result of a reduction in the use of aerosols, which increase cloud cover, and the natural variability of the weather in Britain.  The 30-year period from 1991 to 2020 will form the Met Office's new benchmark for measuring future changes to the UK climate.  Researchers found that the average temperature increased by 0.8C and rainfall by 7.3 per cent. High temperatures previously experienced mostly in the South are now more likely in the North of England and Scotland.  The statistics show that the UK is also experiencing fewer bouts of frost, with the number of days when the temperature drops below 0C falling by an average of 11.1.  ""The result of human-induced cli mate change in the UK is that higher temperatures are felt further north than they used to be,"" said Dr McCarthy. ""If you look at the average temperature, Hull has been warmer between 1991 and 2020 than Heathrow in London was between 1961 and 1990.  ""So average temperatures previously limited to London and parts of the far South of England are now experienced as much as 155 miles further north.""  But temperature and rainfall also showed significant variation, with parts of central and eastern England rising by more than 1C, and areas of Scotland seeing rainfall increase by 10 per cent.  Argyll and Bute saw the greatest increase in rainfall by volume, at over 200mm per year, compared with South Yorkshire with a rise of just over 14mm annually. Glasgow saw days with rainfall over 1mm increase by 12, compared with just one in Cambridgeshire.

TEL-2021-72.txt," The Daily Telegraph (London, UK) Business, Saturday, December 4, 2021 1094 mots, p. 41  North Sea's future in doubt as Shell says bye to Cambo  Rachel Millard and Matt Oliver report on an industry caught between climate activists and geopolitical fears  It was less than a month ago that Kwasi Kwarteng was celebrating Shell's plans to move its group headquarters out of the Netherlands and to the UK. The Business Secretary heralded the decision as ""a clear vote of confidence in the British economy as we work to strengthen competitiveness, attract investment and create jobs"".  Today he may have more complex feelings towards the FTSE 100 oil giant - and greater uncertainty about the challenges ahead for the economy.  On Thursday evening, Shell announced its decision to pull out of the controversial major Cambo North Sea oil and gas field which has come under sustained attack from fossil fuel critics - including Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland. It had planned to be a 30pc licence holder for the project.  The project 75 miles west of Shetland was expected to create 1,000 jobs and pump 178m barrels of oil, but had become a flashpoint in the increasingly bitter debate over fossil fuels. Although Cambo is a relatively small project for the supermajor, it has potentially large consequences for Britain as it tries to chart its path towards a greener economy.  Critics insist that new projects will only add to emissions and prolong the life of oil and gas amid a climate emergency; supporters argue that without it we will be in growing hock to the likes of Russia and the Gulf for energy at a time of soaring gas bills.  Shell's choice to wave goodbye hands a victory to the former but does little to silence the overall debate, and raises further doubts over the future of an industry that employs more than 100,000 and whose skills will also be essential in helping the country move towards greener energy.  ""I urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry,"" oil industry veteran Sir Ian Wood said last night.  ""We must not create an adverse investment environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey. The future prosperity of our region and the country's ability to meet net zero, depends on it.""  Shell blamed a weak economic case for its decision not to invest in the Cambo project but added that it also had ""the potential for delays"" - widely interpreted as a nod to potential legal and regulatory entanglements.  It is believed to have told Siccar Point Energy - the private equity backed firm that majority owns the project - on Thursday morning that it planned to pull out, blindsiding its 70pc partner and the rest of the industry after several publicly supportive statements.  Attention is turning to what might happen next, both for Cambo and the wider industry. Jonathan Roger, chief executive of Siccar Point Energy, said on Thursday that it was talking with the regulator and others about taking the project forward.  Industry sources are split on the likelihood of that happening. What's clear is that any new partner is unlikely to be among majors such as Exxon and BP, all of whom face the same reputational struggles over climate change as Shell. ""Cambo risks being seen as poisoned chalice,"" says one industry source.  The North Sea has, however, in recent years attracted growing interest from private or state backed players who may well find the funding and the appetite to take it on, such as China's Cnooc or Sir Jim Ratcliffe's Ineos, which has been snapping up new fields.  In reality, roads have led in the direction of Shell's departure from Cambo for a long time. The company, which accounts for about 10pc of UK oil and gas production, has been under growing pressure over its own emissions - 63m tonnes last year - and to do more to invest in green energy products.  A Dutch court has ordered it to go faster to cut its emissions following a case brought by climate activists, and it is also under attack from activist investor Dan Loeb.  But the picture is also not straightforward. The UK Government has refused to set an end date for oil and gas exploration and supports the industry - recognising that oil and gas still supplies more than 75pc of UK energy - while plans to shift to electric cars and electric heat pumps are some years off.  And the Government has pledged to continue to support the oil and gas industry, as long as it also slashes emissions from production and invests in green energy such as hydrogen and carbon capture.  Yet as the tensions over Cambo rose in the run-up to the UK hosting the international climate change conference Cop26 in November, ministers stopped short of a fullthrottled defence.  Boris Johnson told Cop26 that we want to ""move beyond hydrocarbons completely in the UK, and do it as fast as possible"". Senior figures at Shell are understood to have become frustrated by the UK Government's unwillingness to give Cambo public support.  A Whitehall source, however, accused Shell of bowing to a ""vocal minority"" of activists who have blocked the projects.  In Scotland, meanwhile, Sturgeon has taken an increasingly strident stance against fossil fuels amid her power-sharing deal with the proindependence Green Party.  Over the summer she demanded the UK Government review approved oil and gas licences while last month she said Cambo should ""not get the green light"". Political signals from Scotland are also thought to have been important in Shell's decision.  In October, Shell was further disappointed when UK regulators declined to approve development plans for its Jackdaw field in the North Sea. ""They can do these projects anywhere in the world - why would they do it somewhere where they are going to spend all of their time fighting?,"" said an industry source. Shell is revising plans to get approval.  Whether the giant's recent move signals a wider caution towards the North Sea is harder to predict.  One industry executive said it was ""absolutely"" still a great place to invest. Other sources echoed Sir Ian Wood's warning about creating a hostile environment, stressing this placed investment in cleaner energy at risk, too.  ""It's either an investable destination or not and you make that decision based on stability of fiscal and regulatory policy,"" said one industry source.  'I urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry' "
TEL-2021-73.txt," News, Friday, December 3, 2021 423 mots, p. 11  Raise tax on gas to reflect cost of global warming, ministers told By Olivia Rudgard environment correspondent  GAS for boilers should face higher taxes to meet net zero pledges, the Government's climate advisers have said.  Fossil-fuel heating should be more expensive to reflect the costs of global warming, according to the Climate Change Committee (CCC).  A clause in the Glasgow Pact, signed last month, requires countries to phase out ""inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies"".  The lack of a levy on gas to reflect the cost of carbon emissions is a form of subsidy, the committee said, and the Treasury should review tax policy and how it could better help reach the UK's goal of reaching net zero by 2050.  Currently, electricity is artificially expensive, with almost a fifth of the domestic cost made up of levies funding decarbonisation projects, as well as subsidising energy for poorer households, while just two per cent of the price of gas comes from these costs. On average, households currently spend ¬£159 on green levies on their electricity bills.  Domestic energy bills also have a reduced rate of VAT with householders paying five per cent rather than the usual 20 per cent. The Government plans to ""review the imbalance between gas and electricity prices"", the CCC said, but a more fundamental shift in policy was needed.  The Government's position is that the UK does not have fossil-fuel subsidies because it does not have a policy to artificially lower prices to below market rates. But the CCC said the failure to introduce carbon pricing was effec tively a subsidy because it meant prices did not reflect the cost of the climate change caused by fossil fuels.  ""By this definition, reduced VAT and the lack of a carbon price on gas and other fossil fuels used for heating buildings, and the lack of VAT or a carbon price on aviation fuel are all post-tax subsidies,"" the committee said.  Chris Stark, chief executive of the committee, said: ""No fossil-fuel subsidies should be classed as 'efficient', given there are other ways to support vulnerable consumers with fuel bills.""  Tony Juniper, of the Government's nature adviser Natural England, said the ""downsides"" of environmentally unfriendly and unhealthy diets and dirty rivers were ""hidden"" from con sumers because of cheap food prices and water bills and that prices should rise to reflect environmental costs.  The Government also unveiled the first stage of its new farming subsidy programme, to reward farmers for environmentally friendly practices. "

The latest plans were, unfortunately, no exception. Yet again, the meeting has been cancelled, this time because of the advent of the omicron variant.  The conference, it would seem, is fated, as indeed may be the World Trade Organisation itself, where the cancellation can be seen as a metaphor for much wider deficiencies.  The purpose of the WTO is to uphold the principles of free trade, and to act as their policeman on the world stage. On both counts, the WTO is failing as rarely before.  It matters little that its ministerial meeting has again been postponed; it was in any case very unlikely to achieve anything of significance. The omicron variant has saved its officials from the embarrassment of having to admit as much.  The progressive destruction of the free-trade agenda together with the steady ebbing away of the WTO's authority is one of the great sadnesses of our time.  Applied fairly, free trade is an unarguable public and economic good; it is both the best guarantee there is of economic progress, and of peace between nations. Those that trade freely with each other are also less likely to fight each other.  Hopes were high for the WTO when it first came into being 26 years ago as the successor body for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The aim was to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on global trade in goods, and eventually services too. With the accession of China to the WTO in 2001, about 98pc of global trade would be covered by its rules and judgments. As multilateral organisations went, this one looked like a winner.  But it's not worked out that way. Far from cementing a new global order, China's membership has ended up breaking it asunder. Trade liberalisation has stalled, and the WTO has progressively lost legitimacy. Up went the cry: free trade yes, but fair trade too.  What China was doing seemed far from fair, with widespread abuse of intellectual property rights and often massive state subsidy to key industries. A fierce political backlash soon ensued.  Most analysis finds that technology has been far more important in undermining traditional Western jobs and livelihoods than Chinese competition, but it is a ""lying, cheating and stealing"" China that tends to get much of the blame for the social dislocation globalised trade has given rise to. The WTO became widely viewed as China's poodle.  In bulldozing its way into Western markets, China has run rings round the rules-based system the WTO is meant to uphold, taking advantage of its ""developing world"" status to gain favourable judgments and dispensations. This should have ended a long time ago, but China still tends to get treated with kid gloves.  With the election of Donald Trump as US president, America signalled that it had had enough. In this regard, not much has changed with the transition to Joe Biden. In some respects, he's more protectionist than Trump; he speaks the language of international engagement, while practicing something quite different.  Just recently, Biden unilaterally imposed swingeing tariffs on imports of Canadian lumber, apparently oblivious to the fact that by doing so he is further adding to already intense inflationary pressures in the US construction sector. American sawmills love him for it, consumers not so much.  The supposed adjudicator, the WTO, has become little more than an irrelevance in the game of superpower muscle flexing being played out between the US and China. With key appointments still blocked, its appeals procedures are in a state of paralysis. As for the organisation's still relatively new director-general, Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, she has utterly failed to turn the tables.  So stitched up by Third Worlders has the appointments process become that no Western candidate for the job ever stood a chance. They could, on the other hand, scarcely have failed to do a better job.  Instead of tackling the burning issues of free and fair trade, Okonjo- Iweala finds herself pursuing largely unrelated, and intractable, grandstanding causes such as ""vaccine equality"" and fishing rights, not to mention our old friend climate change.  All these things do admittedly have some bearing on free and fair trade, but are also distractions from the WTO's core purpose - to stand firm against the incoming tide of protectionism and unfair practice.  I'd like to think otherwise, but I fear that Trump was right about the WTO. Multilateralism of the type that is meant to be championed by the WTO is not up to the task of advancing free trade; there are simply too many parties involved to achieve globally gainful outcomes.  The basic principle - that signatories are not allowed to pick and choose between those they apply restrictions to, but must treat everyone the same - is fine as far as it goes, but it is very hard to maintain in practice. The future lies instead in bilateral free trade agreements between likeminded nations of preferably similar levels of economic development. These are much easier both to police and to deepen into a more integrated economic relationship.  Making the argument for free trade becomes harder when dealing with countries with lower labour and environmental standards. The perceived need for greater resilience in supply chains, and the political pressures for decoupling from the Chinese economy, make the case for global free trade harder still. Worse, political leaders increasingly use access to their domestic markets as a tool for extracting non-economic concessions. Free trade as an economically advantageous end in itself is a dying faith.  Yet we shouldn't altogether despair. We can go a long way with bilateral arrangements, and with big free trade blocs, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-  Pacific Partnership, originally set up as a bulwark against Chinese domination of the Pacific.  The WTO may have lost its way, but free trade is not yet entirely dead.  'Far from cementing a new global order, China's membership has ended up breaking the WTO asunder' "

Get rid of the private jets (""elitist and out of touch"") or it's a no-deal for their media conglomerate. The family baulked. ""First they came for the PJs and I said nothing,"" protested Roman Roy, the clan's amoral comedian. ""Then they came for the outsized compensation payments.""  But powerful people refusing to let go of their private jets is not a theme that is isolated to the screen. The corporate elite's green preaching is currently being drowned out by the roar of their private jets. Just like the fictional Roy family, billionaire bosses around the world do not appear willing to let this luxury status symbol go.  That makes a lot of the recent rhetoric feel like hot air. Failing to practice what they preach on global warming, hundreds of wealthy leaders recently flew into Glasgow for the Cop26 climate change conference in private jets and have continued to fly privately since. Last week, days after environmental campaigners staged a ""die in"" outside JP Morgan's Glasgow office and fresh from the climate summit ending, JP Morgan's influential boss Jamie Dimon used the Wall Street bank's private plane to visit employees in Hong Kong, London and Frankfurt. Insiders justified the choice of travel by saying the planes are used as ""efficiently as possible"", with several executives on board rather than just one.  Such convenience comes at a damaging cost to the environment. Small jets emit 10 times more greenhouse gases per passenger than scheduled flights and are 50 times more polluting than trains, according to campaign group Transport & Environment. A four-hour private flight emits as much as the average person does in a year.  Andrew Murphy, aviation director for the group, said travelling this way is ""probably the worst thing you can do for the environment. And yet, super-rich super polluters are flying around like there's no climate crisis.""  Despite the obvious hypocrisy, this is a comfort that just seems too good to give up for large companies that are brandishing their green credentials. Goldman Sachs, whose boss David Solomon was arguing how important a transition to a green economy was last week, bought two new corporate jets last year and is not expected to get rid of them any time soon.  It is not just businesses failing to lead by example. Boris Johnson, who told world leaders at Cop26 to stop ""quilting the Earth in a suffocating blanket of CO2"" and to ""get real"" about their responsibilities to the planet, flew back to London by private jet instead of taking the four-and-a-half-hour train. Downing Street defended the decision by saying he had ""significant time constraints"", which meant the train was not an option. He was not alone. The conference is thought to have generated as much carbon dioxide as 4,200 Britons emit in a year, mainly due to the amount of private jets flying in. Lavish limousines were also spotted dropping wealthy delegates off at the conference before parking with their engines running.  Instead of turning their backs on elite travel as the Earth warms, even more people have hopped aboard in recent years. CO2 emissions from private jets in Europe rose by nearly a third between 2005 and 2019, according to Transport & Environment, while data provider WingX said there has been a record number of private flights every month for the last six months. Private jet use shot up 54pc in the first week of November compared to a year ago, showing that appetite for on-demand travel remains strong despite restrictions lifting.  The pandemic has encouraged more people to fly private. Forbes' latest annual world billionaires list shows that the rich have only got richer, with almost 90pc of the world's billionaires wealthier than they were a year ago. There are a total of 2,755 billionaires in the world whose fortunes add up to $13.4trillion (¬£10 trillion), a significant jump on the year before when there were 660 billionaires worth a combined $8trillion. Some companies that have their own corporate jets, such as the world's largest banks, have also made significantly more money during this crisis.  The private jet sector has been boosted by a combination of wealthier clients, a sudden lack of commercial options due to restrictions and a fear of coronavirus transmission on busy flights. AirX, one of Europe's largest private jet operators, which charges around ¬£30,000 for a plane seating eight people to fly to Malaga, said last year that it was spending an extra ¬£50,000 a month cleaning its fleet. Some of the uber-rich who previously snubbed the idea of flying private for fear of showing off or damaging the environment have joined the club to avoid the extra baggage of getting sick. With cases still raging, it will be hard to change their minds.  But high-profile business executives who have become newly hooked on flying this way, or are used to it having done so all their careers, must wean themselves off. Boasting about going green while jetting around in a private plane is not a good look as the planet burns.  In Succession, when Roman Roy was told that the jets his family's company uses are ""elitist and out of touch"", he responded by simply saying ""duh"". Leaders who still refuse to change their direction of travel amid a major climate crisis may as well be using the same argument.

While 50 per cent of people believe the summit was useful for getting countries to agree to tackle climate change, only 28 per cent think it will be effective.  Only a quarter think it will make a big difference to them and their family, according to the survey of 2,000 people across the UK conducted by Opinium for The Telegraph. But more than 40 per cent of people either said they were not sure, or did not have an opinion on the impact of the summit.  The findings reflect a lack of public confidence in world leaders to take action on climate change. They also reflect a lack of awareness over the summit, despite an extensive government engagement campaign and widespread media coverage.  The conference reached a dramatic end last weekend when a global agreement to phase out coal was watered down at the last minute under pressure from China, India and the US.  The UK said it had achieved its aim at the summit to ""keep alive"" the target of the Paris Agreement to limit warming to 1.5C. But critics said the vague wording of many of the pledges gave countries leeway to continue to pollute.  Sam Hall, of the Conservative Environment Network, said the results reflected an understandable scepticism of the process. ""Significant progress was made at Cop26, with the historic Glasgow Climate Pact. But the public is rightly sceptical that we haven't yet seen sufficient ambition and action to limit warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. "
TEL-2021-78.txt," The Daily Telegraph (London, UK) News, Saturday, November 20, 2021 1509 mots, p. 16  Saturday  Your guide to the wildlife winners and losers of 2021  Gardening A year of changeable weather has seen some species decline - but climate change may have given others a boost, says Kate Bradbury Kate Bradbury  For many of us, the cold, wet spring of 2021 is but a distant, albeit unpleasant, memory. If you're lucky enough to have forgotten, many locations around the UK saw more than twice the average amount of rainfall for the month of May, while Wales experienced its wettest on record. On top of that, the average mean temperature was around 2C lower than normal. We gardeners were stuck indoors, willing temperatures to increase so we could get the season started. It was frustrating, yes, but on the whole we remained unscathed.  Spare a thought, then, for the garden wildlife that lived - and tried to breed - through the freezing deluge. From birds to bees, butterflies and amphibians, the unusually cold spring had a knock-on effect on populations, many of which are already declining.  Most species are emerging from hibernation and/or breeding in spring, and for them the cold, wet conditions wreaked havoc. In my garden, frogs spawned for the first time - exactly on time - but the red mason bees were four weeks later than usual, while the small tortoiseshell and peacock butterflies that usually breed on my allotment disappeared entirely. But did my experiences match those up and down the country? I caught up with data recorders at some of Brit ain's leading conservation charities to find out how wildlife has fared through our changeable year.  BUTTERFLIES & MOTHS It's been a mixed year for lepidoptera. Butterfly Conservation's Big Butterfly Count was published last month, con- firming long-term declines in many species. Overall, the number of butterflies recorded per count was at the lowest it has been since the citizen survey began 12 years ago. This is despite more than 150,000 counts taking place - the highest number in the survey's history.  ""This year's results show that the average number of butterflies and moths per count is the lowest we've recorded so far,"" says Dr Zo√´ Randle, senior surveys officer at Butterfly Conservation. ""On average people counted nine butterflies or moths per count, which is down from 11 in 2020, and down again from 16 in 2019. More counts are undertaken and submitted year on year, but it seems that there are fewer butterflies and moths around to be counted.""  ""Many species were hit by the very wet May,"" explains Butterfly Conservation's associate director of recording and research, Richard Fox. ""Two species that suffered particularly badly were the green-veined white and holly blue butterflies,"" he continues. ""Both of these species are double-brooded and will have been mating (or trying to) during the month-long deluge.""  Other species that fared badly in 2021 include the small tortoiseshell, which has been in steady decline for many years. Interestingly, Fox notes there is anecdotal evidence pointing to the small tortoiseshell doing better in northern parts of the UK, compared with the south. ""It's something we need to look at but, from personal observations, there are many more small tor toiseshells up north than down south."" This could be a climate change response, he suggests.  Conversely, the red admiral and small copper butterflies have had a reasonably good year, while the peacock butterfly looks like it's now having a second brood in the south. ""Again, this is in response to climate change,"" says Fox.  Butterflies' less colourful cousins - moths - typically aren't faring well, but a few species are bucking the trend. ""The Clifden nonpareil had a spectacular autumn,"" says Fox. This moth, with a wingspan of nearly five inches, was last recorded in 1964 and declared extinct some time after. But it's been back in the UK since the mid 2000s. ""It's now widespread, from Kent to Cornwall and up into the Midlands,"" explains Fox. ""It's a spectacular moth, huge and with a bright blue underwing. Seeing one is a really memorable experience."" Fox suggests setting moth traps in September in gardens near their poplar tree foodplants, for a good chance of seeing one.  While the garden tiger continues to decline, the Jersey tiger expands. Originally found only in south Devon, it's now spreading into Dorset, Sussex, Kent and South Wales, and is ""going mad in London"". The similar-looking scarlet tiger moth is also expanding out from the West Country, says Fox. Look for its caterpillars on comfrey, lungwort and green alkanet.  BUMBLEBEES The Bumblebee Conservation Trust won't announce findings from its 2021 BeeWalk data until next Easter. But science manager Richard Comont told me the earlier species, particularly the early bumblebee, Bombus pratorum, ""really seemed to suffer from the abysmal spring weather"".  By contrast, he says, the later species (which emerge from hibernation in June) look like they've fared quite well: ""The fairly damp but warm summer kept flowers around for longer than normal, and so we saw very high numbers of some species, including England's most endangered bumblebee, the shrill carder, on the Gwent Levels and other Welsh areas, including Cas tlemartin and Kenfig, plus it was recorded in areas where it hasn't been seen for decades.  ""Another late-flying species, the broken-belted bumblebee, Bombus soroeensis, was found in a new area of Wales, while very good numbers were recorded on Salisbury Plain at the end of September, helped by the warm endsummer period.""  AMPHIBIANS The chaotic weather affected our frogs, toads and newts, too: ""We received so many enquiries about a lack of frog spawn and frogs this spring,"" says Froglife's chief executive officer, Kathy Wormald. ""And then we had lots of reports of amphibians spawning in late summer.""  ALAMY  It seems, says Wormald, that weather changes are affecting the behaviour of our amphibians to the point where they don't know what season it is. ""Just last month someone emailed us with reports of a frog spawning in their garden. Of course, tadpoles in ponds now will likely not survive winter.""  IMAGES;  GETTY  DRAGONFLIES It's been a good year for dragonflies. The State of Dragonflies in Britain and Ireland 2021 report shows that most dragonflies are bucking the trend of declining species in Britain and Ireland, largely due to climate change. Around 40 per cent of resident and migrant species have increased since 1970, while only 11 per cent have declined.  ""Emperor dragonflies have increased the most,"" says co-author of the report, Dave Smallshire, ""with many moving north and west."" He notes also the southern hawker, which ""used to live up to its name"" is now found in Scotland, while the broad-bodied chaser is now common in gardens.  ""You need only dig a hole and fill it with water, and the broad-bodied chaser will turn up,"" he says. Con versely, the blue-tailed damselfly is in decline. ""We need to do more research but it could be neonicotinoid pesti cides running off farmland and into streams and rivers,"" says Smallshire.  BIRD LIFE For birds, the picture has been variable. Richard Broughton, ecologist and ornithologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, tells me blue tits and great tits suffered due to the cold spring, as there were fewer caterpillars to feed their chicks.  ""Many broods were abandoned or died due to a lack of food,"" he says. It was worse for willow and marsh tits: ""In our Wigan study, more than 80 per cent of willow tit nests were lost due to blue tits stealing nest holes and woodpeckers eating chicks."" At another site, he notes marsh tits have had their worst year ever, in a 20-year study.  However, tawny owls and kestrels have had a good year, as has ""anything that eats voles"". Broughton notes that both bank and field voles have had an excellent year, with their predators reaping the benefits. ""There are lots of juvenile tawny owls out at the moment,"" says Broughton, ""while our kestrel nest cam shows a brood of five chicks - their best year yet, with the chicks largely being fed voles.""  HOW TO HELP STRUGGLING WILDLIFE As temperatures fall, ensure there's enough food to see species - particularly birds - through winter. Leave windfall apples for migrant birds arriving in the UK now, and plant berry-bearing trees like hawthorn and rowan for future autumn sustenance ? Birds tend to leave ivy berries until last, when they need it most. Ivy berries are extremely high in nutrients and calories, so avoid cutting back ivy until spring in order that birds can get into good shape for breeding ? Leave compost heaps and long grass intact, so that hibernating wildlife such as insects and amphibians can remain safe and undisturbed throughout winter. ? Plant nectar-rich bulbs such as crocus and alliums, so queen bumblebees have a good source of food when they emerge from hibernation in spring. Choose organically grown bulbs, as many commercial bulbs are drenched in bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides  EMPEROR DRAGONFLY  A GOOD YEAR FOR?

The former BBC and GB News pre senter also said British broadcasters had colluded in the ""conspiracy theory"" that the Kremlin helped Donald Trump to win the presidency and refused to tell the truth about the origins of Covid-19.  In a speech to a media forum, Neil took a swipe at his most recent employer, GB News, saying the station had become a ""Ukip tribute band"".  Addressing media coverage of the environment, he said: ""In covering climate change, we are no longer journalists - we are basically the PR department of Greenpeace. You don't need to be a global warming sceptic to challenge what's coming out.  ""Look at the BBC and Sky, and coverage of the [foreign minister] of Tuvalu. He does a press conference [at Cop26] standing in water to make out his islands are about to go under.  ""Nobody pointed out there was a report that came out in 2018 which showed, in the last four years, the land mass in his islands has increased by 70 hectares. Wasn't that worth looking at? But, no, we just did it as a piece of PR.""  Speaking to the Freeview Outside the Box conference, Neil said that the BBC, Sky and US broadcasters ""peddled, basically, conspiracy theories for two-anda-half years that Mr Trump had only got to the White House because the Kremlin was behind him"".  He went on: ""For the first year or so of the Covid crisis, if you raised questions that there was more to it than just coincidence that Wuhan and Covid were in the same place, you were a sinophobe, a conspiracy theorist, and you weren't allowed to get on to the mainstream media. It's quite clear now that Wuhan played a major part.  ""If we want to be referees, if we want to be gatekeepers to call 'the nutters' to account - and there are plenty on the right and the left, the anti-vaxxers and all the rest - we need to get our own house in order.""  Speaking of his acrimonious departure from GB News he said hehas one last TV job in him, because ""I don't want GB News to be a full stop in my broadcasting career"".  Joining the station was ""the biggest single mistake of my career,"" he said. The launch was a ""shambles"" and there is a danger that the station will ""just slide into irrelevance and obscurity"".

A key clause in the Glasgow Climate Pact asks countries to set out fresh plans to cut emissions between now and 2030 by the end of 2022, in an effort to push more ambitious action over the next decade, seen as crucial to stem the most dangerous effects of global warming.  A joint statement released by Australia's foreign and emissions reduction ministers on Sunday read: ""Australia's 2030 target is fixed and we are committed to meeting and beating it, as we did with our Kyoto-era targets.""  Australia has come under fire for failing to set ambitious climate targets, with its aims barely updated ahead of this year's conference. The country is still heavily reliant on coal.  Appearing on ABC talk show Insiders, Greg Hunt, Australia's health minister, also hinted that the country might not make its aims more ambitious.  ""We've set our target. But what we'll continue to do is update our projec tions,"" he said. The country's plan involves cutting emissions by 26 to 28 per cent compared with 2005.  The pact also states that global emissions need to fall by 45 per cent by 2030 compared with 2010 levels in order to limit global warming to 1.5C. During the  Cop26 process, other countries also suggested that they might not update their plans, including New Zealand, whose climate minister said during the talks that just because they had been asked to strengthen them ""it doesn't mean you have to"", prompting criticism from environmental groups.  The US cited language in the agreement that ""requests"" parties update their plans ""as necessary"" and ""taking into account different national circumstances"". John Kerry, the US climate envoy, said that the country's existing climate plans fulfilled the requirements in the Paris Agreement to limit temperature rises to below 2C and make efforts towards limiting them to 1.5C.  Hours after the agreement was finalised on Saturday, Mr Kerry said: ""The language is 'necessary', I don't expect it's going to be necessary, because our ambitious goal is 50 to 52 per cent [emissions cuts] and that's stretching the limits right now. We need to see what's doable.""  Yesterday in the House of Commons Boris Johnson also suggested that the UK would not update its targets.  'The UK is already compliant with 1.5 as a result of pledges made by 2030 and 2035', so if we can deliver on those we believe we will be able to restrain our emissions,"" the Prime Minister said.  The Glasgow Pact was also hailed for mentioning a phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and a ""phase-down"" of coal for the first time in a UN pact, though the coal language was watered down at the last moment following an intervention by India and China.  Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a think tank, said he thought it was also ""very unlikely"" that the EU would update its pledges. ""Their priority should be to get stuff done that they've pledged already,"" he said.  ""China very unlikely, I think, given the geopolitics. India very unlikely. They'll feel they've made their contribution here. I think the opportunity lies in some other countries,"" he added, naming South Africa and Brazil.  During the conference South Africa secured US, UK and EU funding to help it transition away from coal, and Brazil and Australia have elections next year in which challengers may make more ambitious climate pledges as part of their pitch to voters, he said.  'The UK is already compliant with 1.5 as a result of pledges made by 2030 and 2035' "

In an interview with The Telegraph, Tony Juniper said the ""downsides"" of environmentally unfriendly and unhealthy diets and dirty rivers were ""hidden"" from consumers because of cheap food prices and water bills.  Penalties for environmentally damaging practices should be harsher, he said, suggesting that there should be higher taxes on wealthy people, who cause more waste and pollution, through ""ecological taxation"".  Mr Juniper has been chair of Natural England, the Government's nature adviser, since 2019. He was previously director of the environmental charity Friends of the Earth.  He said: ""The cost of climate change is going to be catastrophic. It's going to destroy the economy, potentially - two, three, four degrees of global warming. Is that visible anywhere in a consumer bill?  ""The loss of the benefits we get from clean rivers - for angling, for tourism, for public health and well-being - where is that in the bill?  ""The mass extinction of animals and plants being principally driven by our food system, where is that?  ""What about the public health dimension, in terms of the people suffering from diet-related illnesses that's costing countries absolute fortunes on their public health services?  ""This is a deficiency in the way we do economics, insofar as we can't see the downsides of things which are basically hidden from the numbers that appear in the prices.""  Water companies and the Govern ment have been criticised in recent weeks for failing to upgrade Britain's  Victorian water system over several decades, leading to thousands of litres of untreated sewage being dumped in UK rivers and the sea each year.  Under pressure from campaigners and the public, the Government placed a duty on water companies to reduce the negative impacts from sewage dumps in the Environment Act, passed last week.  But fixing Britain's water infrastructure is likely to cost millions, and water companies have called on regulator Ofwat to allow it to raise consumer bills to pay for upgrades. "

Scientists at the Louisiana State University weighed and measured 15,000 individual birds from 77 different species, including the Amazonian Motmot and the thrush-like Antpitta.  On average, researchers found the birds were 8 per cent lighter than 40 years ago, down from 30g to 27.6g.  Longer wings and smaller bodies enable the birds to flap less and in turn use less energy and keep cool.  Experts warn that if the birds cannot keep rapidly adapting to the increase in global temperatures then they could be driven to extinction.  The study in Science Advances is the first to discover the trend in non-migratory birds.  Ecologist Vitek Jirinec, who led the study, said: ""Even in the middle of this pristine Amazon rainforest, we are seeing the global effects of climate change caused by people, including us.""  Prof Philip Stouffer, co-author, explained: ""These birds don't vary much in size. When everyone in the population is a couple of grams smaller, it is significant."" "

The deal could unlock difficult negotiations toward a successful conclusion to the summit, which Boris Johnson said was hanging ""in the balance"".  It included pledges from China on tackling methane and deforestation, a joint recognition of the ""seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"" and to cut emissions in the next 10 years, but had little detailed policy.  The move was seen as an attempt by the two powers to claim a role in the last days of the summit, during which action from both has been lacking.  ""The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade,"" John Kerry, the US climate envoy, said. The deal came hours after the UK released its draft text for the final agreement at the end of the summit, calling for big polluters including China to return with more ambitious climate plans next year, and for a phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and coal.  Mr Johnson made a brief, last-minute visit to Glasgow yesterday to rally the final days of talks, due to end tomorrow but expected to run into the weekend.  ""We need to pull out all the stops, if we're going to do what we came here to do, and keep 1.5C alive,"" the Prime Minister said. ""If we fail to deliver, the backlash from people will be immense and it will be long-lasting and frankly, we will deserve their criticism.""  But he added: ""The Cop26 summit here in Glasgow is not going to fix climate change in one go. We're not going to arrest climate change right here, right now."" Getting countries to return as soon as next year with updated plans to cut emissions before 2030 is seen as one of the best ways to limit warming, but is likely to prove controversial with major emitters.  The text will go through several revisions before a final document is released over the weekend, when it will become more clear whether the UK Govern ment has achieved its aims at the summit to ""keep 1.5C alive"".  One veteran observer of the talks said the joint China-US deal would help to reach a final agreement at the talks because it would prevent Beijing blocking significant elements of the text.  The countries have criticised each other throughout the summit, with President Joe Biden saying that Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, had made a ""big mistake"" by not attending. "

The former US president, in an address to Cop26 delegates in Glasgow, called for rival countries and opposing political factions to come together to address the climate emergency, but warned that ""international cooperation has waned"".  The Scottish Tories claimed that Mr Obama was ""absolutely right to highlight that nationalism poses a danger in our fight against climate change"".  The SNP faced criticism last week when it took out Cop26-themed newspaper adverts to promote independ ence, with the First Minister welcoming visitors to what she described as a ""nation in waiting"".  In his speech, Mr Obama said that greater global tensions had been caused ""in part because of the pandemic, in part because of the rise of nationalism and tribal impulses around the world"".  He added: ""I understand that it's harder to get international cooperation if there are more global tensions. But Continued on Page 2  Continued from Page 1 there is one thing that should transcend our day to day politics and normal geopolitics - and that is climate.""  Donald Cameron, the constitution spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives, said: ""The SNP should listen when he says it is critical everyone puts aside their narrow tribal interests if we are to hit net zero targets.  ""The SNP are too focused on pushing for another divisive independence referendum, rather than on the climate emergency, or they wouldn't have missed their own emissions targets three years in a row.""  While in the White House, Mr Obama intervened in the 2014 Scottish inde pendence campaign with comments that were widely seen as supportive of a No vote.  He said that ""from the outside at least, things had worked pretty well"" in the UK and that the US had a ""deep interest"" in its ally remaining ""united"".  Alex Cole-Hamilton, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said that Ms Sturgeon had ""exploited her position on the global stage to push her divisive independence agenda rather than green sustainable solutions"".  Mr Cole-Hamilton added: ""We are all in this together and we can only find solutions to the climate emergency if we all cooperate, within the UK and at global level.  ""Mr Obama is quite right in saying that nationalism is a barrier to that.""  Shortly before Mr Obama arrived at the Cop venue, there were dramatic scenes near by when armed undercover police officers blocked off a car and arrested two men.  Several vehicles blocked off a dark coloured Volkswagen car and more than half a dozen plain clothes officers, some carrying assault rifles and covering their faces with masks, dragged the men from the car and threw them to the ground face down.  Police Scotland later said that a 43-year-old had been arrested in connection with firearms offences after a previous search of his home.  An SNP spokesman said: ""The Tory and Lib Dems' claims are nonsense. As President Obama says, the risk to the Paris Agreement and to the climate has come from the likes of Donald Trump - not a Scottish Government that is leading on climate change, stepping up to fight for climate justice and calling for urgent, multilateral action during this Cop summit.""

TEL-2021-85.txt," Business, Tuesday, November 9, 2021 1242 mots, p. 8  Business  China failing to reopen old wounds at Cop26  Beijing has become Glasgow's awkward customer as it tries to pin the climate blame on the West, writes Ambrose Evans-Pritchard Ambrose Evans-Pritchard  In one corner are the guilty: the rich emitters of the industrial West that account for the vast majority of the 2,500 gigatons of atmospheric carbon accumulated since the mid-19th century.  In the other corner are the victims: developing countries that were passive bystanders (or colonies) while the ""North"" gobbled up 87pc of the allowable carbon budget, and are now expected both to forgo catch-up growth as well as sharing the full costs of the clean-up.  That was the toxic dichotomy written into the text of the early Cop meetings in the 1990s and that framed the visceral confrontation at Copenhagen in 2009, when the industrialisation of rising Asia was already stretching the narrative to its limits.  Chinese officials in Glasgow are trying to keep this fraying North-South conflict alive, meeting every morning and afternoon in Glasgow for team pep talks with the ""G77 plus China"" bloc of developing countries. But the faux alliance is riven with internal differences.  Many are members of other intersecting blocs that want tougher CO2 curbs, with a hard target below 1.5 degrees. These include the 55-strong ""staying alive"" group or Climate Vulnerable Forum now led by Bangladesh, one of many to forswear new coal plants in Glasgow.  It includes the 48 members of the Least Developed Countries group and most emphatically the Small Island Group, whose leaders have made the greatest splash at Cop26. Tuvalu's leader delivered a virtual address standing thigh-deep in the sea around his eroding island.  Premier Mia Mottley of Barbados stormed the summit in person, telling the hall that the difference between 1.5¬∞C and 2¬∞C is the difference between survival and a death sentence. ""Are we so blinded and hardened that we can no longer appreciate the cries of humanity?  ""So I ask you, what must we say to our people living on the front line, when ambition and regrettably some of the needed faces at Glasgow are not present?"" she asked. The reference to the absent leaders of China, Russia and Brazil was lost on nobody.  The developing states of the South have a tactical interest in holding Western feet to the fire until creditor states meet their pledge for $100bn (¬£74bn) of annual funding, although that figure is a formulaic piety. Lord Nicholas Stern, high priest of global climate economics, said external funding needs are closer to $1 trillion every year this decade, achievable from the vast pool of private global capital, once the plumbing is sorted out.  But the wrath of the South is turning on China, currently responsible for 85pc of all coal plants in development across the world. It already accounts for 28pc of global emissions and this is heading rapidly for the mid-30s.  The old argument that China's CO2 emissions per capita are far lower than in the West wears thinner each year. It has already overtaken the UK, France, Italy and Spain by a wide margin, and will be twice as high within a couple of years.  Beijing is instead trying to weaponise the argument of historical legacy, with help from Jair Bolsonaro's government in Brazil and a shrinking group of business-as-usual emitters. But research released this week by Carbon Brief shows that China and Brazil account for a larger share of the accumulated carbon legacy since 1850 than claimed, once you include deforestation and land abuse.  The US is still the great emitter. It has gobbled up a fifth of the carbon budget used so far. China is at 11.4pc, Russia 6.9pc, Brazil 4.5pc and Indonesia 4.1pc, with the UK well behind at 3pc and drifting down each year.  Crucially, India is no longer going along with China's script, even though they are nominally in the same Cop negotiating bloc with Russia and Brazil known as Basic. It has an extremely low share of per capita legacy emissions - a quarter of Chinese levels - yet Narendra Modi has committed to a drastic change in India's mid-term CO2 trajectory with a target of 50pc renewable power by the end of this decade. Lord Stern says it is possible that India will achieve peak emissions before 2030 despite a fast-growing population and even though it is still in the early catch-up phase of economic growth. This is the under-appreciated miracle of Glasgow. But it also reshuffles climate geopolitics.  ""We cannot compare India and China. It's time we de-hyphenated the two,"" said Sunita Narain, of New Delhi's Centre for Science and Environment.  China has become Glasgow's awkward customer. While legacy emissions matter - and may end up at the International Court of Justice - current emissions have greater moral potency. What grates is the pattern of  China's behaviour since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned in late 2018 that critical tipping points are closer than previously supposed.  It is worth viewing the Cop26 press conference on the ""10 New Insights in Climate Science 2021"" for a quick tour d'horizon of what is going on at the cutting edge of global research. Basically, everything experts were worried about last year, they are even more worried about a year later. The risks are hardening.  The warming threshold deemed likely to trigger feedback loops and unstoppable ""cascade"" effects keeps falling as the science evolves, with a ""very high risk"" at barely above 2 degrees. It becomes a graver matter to build new coal plants in the face of this broad consensus, and in the knowledge that the world will use up the IPCC's remaining carbon budget within eight years on pre-Glasgow trends.  China may wish to hide behind the vulnerable South but the traditional lines of cleavage have broken down at Cop26. Old habits die hard, of course. Bolivia's Luis Arce won the prize for neo-Marxist tub-thumping by denouncing ""green capitalism"" as the latest form of colonialism, while at the same time accusing the rich North of behaving ""without any sense of responsibility to nature and mankind"".  But blaming the West does not really capture the mood in Glasgow. No country is at greater risk of annihilation if we blow much through 1.5 degrees than the Maldives, yet President Mohamed Nasheed refused to rise to the bait when asked to play the North-South guilt card.  ""The people of the Maldives did nothing to the planet but we are in the front line. There's coastal erosion in almost every island; our water is contaminated; our reefs are bleached; we're losing our fisheries; we're losing our livelihood; we're losing a country,"" he told a Cop26 event held by the Atlantic Council.  ""There is a moral argument for us to reach out to richer countries but I don't want to frame the climate change issue in anticolonial language. You did not invent the internal combustion engine to murder us,"" he said.  President Nasheed said a 1.5 degree increase is still attainable and what matters is what we do from now on. The imperative is clear.  ""We have to open the arsenal of technology,"" he said.  'There is an argument for us to reach out, but I don't want to frame climate change in anticolonial language' "
TEL-2021-86.txt," News, Monday, November 8, 2021 1096 mots, p. 16  It's wrong to take the politics out of climate change. We must debate it  We ought to be engaged in how we can respond to the challenge - and not rush towards hasty solutions NICK TIMOTHY  Climate-change policies have been officially designated above politics. The Royal family make their views known. Television news will ""nudge"" viewers into changing behaviour. Policy is driven by the Climate Change Committee, with little challenge or scrutiny from the Government or Parliament.  That climate change is real, and is caused by human activity, is not disputed by anybody credible and does not need to be subject to political debate. But the same cannot be said for what we must do about it. Answering the question of what to do - which requires us to address issues of geopolitics, complex science, new technologies, economic geography, the distribution of costs and social fairness - is intensely political.  Our response depends on fundamental judgments about human ingenuity and competing values and interests.  And before we answer, we need calm, rational debate about what climate change entails. Some activists, for example, tell us it heralds a real risk of human extinction, yet many of those same activists also insist that we must not countenance solutions - such as the wider adoption of nuclear power - which would help to save us from the fate they fear.  And we are told that the effects of climate change will be catastrophic. Actors and celebrities insist that we need to save the world itself. The Archbishop of Canterbury says that if world leaders fail to reach agreement at Cop26, they will be worse than the politicians who appeased Adolf Hitler. Terrified primary-school children are informed about the imminence of devastation and death, and the responsibility of their parents' generation to stop it.  In fact, we do not know exactly how climate change will change our world. To take one example, we do not know how so-called feedbacks will work. As ice melts, for instance, the world will heat up faster, further reducing the remaining ice, contributing to more global warming.  Some suggest that other feedbacks might in fact limit the pace of climate change. But all we know at this stage is that the effects of feedbacks are a known unknown and that they present a serious risk.  Many of the predictions made by politicians, public figures and the media come from a model produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ""RCP 8.5"", which was based on a worst-case scenario in 2014 that assumed there would be no climate policies to reduce carbon emissions.  The scenario was perceived to be unrealistic when the model was first produced, and is all the more unrealistic now, with technologies changing - from renewable energy to electric vehicles - and prices falling.  To demonstrate the absurdity of believing that RCP 8.5 reflects ""business as usual"", the science writer Tom Chivers explains that for emissions to reach the scenario envisaged in the model, global per capita coal use would have to increase by 700 per cent. Yet this is the model that leads the media and politicians to talk in the most catastrophic terms.  So we need rationality and calm, but we also need to be honest that the threat from climate change is real. We know temperatures will rise, and as they do so, we will see more extreme weather events, such as flooding and fires, rising sea levels and the loss of plants and wildlife.  We ought to be engaged in a serious debate about the choices we face in deciding how we respond. What, for example, is the right balance between mitigation, in which we attempt to limit the increase in global temperatures, and adaptation, in which we minimise the negative effects and exploit opportunities?  As Cop26 shows, there is a limit to what the United Kingdom - responsible for 1 per cent of global emissions - can do alone.  We should be debating what we believe we can do unilaterally, what can be done collectively with other Western countries, and what must be done globally. We talk about China - absent from Cop26 - and India - promising to get to net zero by 2070 - but in Germany, coal generates 24 per cent of electricity, and a new coal plant opened last year. Six of the 10 biggest carbon emitters in Europe are German power stations.  We should be debating the speed of our actions, too. Do we have to rush into policies early - especially when other countries will not do so - and accept a lower quality of life and a higher cost of living? Or are we able to give new technologies - such as battery storage and green hydrogen - the time to reduce the cost of cutting our emissions?  And whatever path we choose, who is going to take the pain? The earlier we move, the greater the cost of the changes and the less reliable the alternatives to the things we use and do now will be. Higher industrial energy costs will hurt communities more reliant on manufacturing jobs than others. Higher domestic energy bills, petrol prices, driving charges, aviation taxes and various other pricing signals will hit lower-income families less able to take the financial hit. The one-off cost of buying electric vehicles, replacing gas boilers or insulating houses will simply be too much for some people.  Some taxpayers - already facing high taxes thanks to the pandemic and long-term demographic change - will be forced to pay up three times: to change their cars, their boilers and their way of life, and through the tax system to both subsidise changes for others and to fund a transition away from carbon in poorer countries.  Few policy programmes are more expensive and far-reaching. Yet anybody who raises these questions risks being written off as a ""climatechange denier"".  The more ideological green activists do not want climate-change policy to be a political matter, because they want to force the most radical, dramatic and costly change onto the country. But politics is the means by which we reconcile competing values and interests, and give legitimacy to the big calls we make about our future.  We should not want to take the politics out of climate-change policy - we need a serious debate about what to do, and we need to put politics at its very centre.  read more at telegraph.co.uk/ opinion  We need rationality and calm, but we also need to be honest that the threat from climate change is real "

Politico has the intel on potential cabinet nominees, and departments with the largest impact on the environment aren't looking nearly as progressive as the left had hoped. Bloomberg reports that Biden is expected to quickly unload on Trump's years of environmental deregulation. Meanwhile, Grist has the details on the personnel making up the environmental portion of his transition team.  Perhaps my favorite bit of early news, though, is that Biden's recently updated transition plan calls for the plugging of oil wells and rehabilitation of abandoned mines, issues I have investigated for years.  Here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Identity politics. Neil Chatterjee, until recently the chairman of the powerful Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was demoted from his post by Trump. Chatterjee, a Republican, held moderate views on energy, and many observers were quick to assume his demotion stemmed from his openness to allowing renewable energy to compete in the marketplace. The true reason for knocking down the Indian American, at least in part, appear to be racist. E&E reports that key to the decision was Chatterjee's ""unwillingness to go along with the Trump administration's governmentwide edicts against diversity training.""  Intention vs. reality. The Nevada Independent writes that the Silver State's governor is aiming for a plan to reduce emissions ""to zero or near-zero by 2050,"" but current policies are misaligned with that hopeful thinking. A new study argues that to meet the     lofty goals, the state must accelerate the retirement of coal power plants, shift to electric vehicles and halt the use of gas in buildings.  Funding freeze. In another small strike against fossil fuels, Reuters reports, Toronto- Dominion Bank said it will refuse project-specific financial services for any oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Circle. Several other banks have come out with similar decrees, while drillers look ever-farther north as warming temperatures melt ice and make more land accessible for exploration.  Just Transition. Friend-of-the-newsletter Ryan Randazzo at The Arizona Republic is out with a new story about Arizona Public Service's proposal to make $144 million available for three communities that rely on employment at the utility's still-active coal- fired power plants. APS is Arizona's largest utility and has a history of throwing cash into elections to build itself a more favorable regulatory environment, making this positive announcement all the more significant. Several of the impacted communities are within the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe, and the plan would ""retain workers, electrify regions of the Navajo reservation that are off the power grid, and develop renewable energy projects like solar and wind plants.""  POLITICAL CLIMATE  Interior influence. The Arizona Daily Star reports that Department of the Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, in a previous posting, attempted to influence another agency's decision to require a developer to analyze its project's impacts on a local river. Bernhardt's spokesperson, however, called the topic a ""nonissue.""  Clinching on climate. The post-election takes are coming as hot and fast as climate change, with pundits and writers trying to unpack the results of another wild political wide. Environment publication Earther got in on the action, trying to determine whether the Green New Deal ‚Äî the audacious plan to address climate change and the Just Transition with the same energy as FDR's New Deal ‚Äî hurt its supporters, as some politicos predicted. ""Of the 93 House co-sponsors (of the Green New Deal) who ran for a seat in Congress‚Äôs lower chamber in 2020, only one lost reelection,"" they found. Questions remain whether other environmental questions such as fracking hurt Biden's vote count, but evidence points to climate at least not being a losing issue for liberals.  Feel the burn. It might sound backward, but in the oil and gas industry, burning off its own product instead of sending it to market is sometimes the most profitable decision. There are business reasons for this practice, but environmentalists believe that allowing it incentivizes the release of more climate-warming gas. The Colorado Sun reports that state regulators recently outlawed this in most cases, making it the state with the country's most comprehensive regulations on the topic.  THE REAL WILD WEST  It's often difficult to imagine what landscapes looked like before humans introduced the     built environment, molding the world into straight lines and visually pleasing geometry. But the West ‚Äî far from the East Coast's cities and the Midwest's flat sprawl of corn, wheat and soybeans ‚Äî still holds easier-to-identify natural treasures. This week, I'm highlighting news on Western wildlife.  It ain't easy being green. Erin Stone at The Arizona Republic reports that the Phoenix Zoo is at the heart of a 25-year push to save the Chiricahua leopard frog. Since 2002, the amphibian has been listed as a threatened species under the federal Endangered Species Act. ""Habitat degradation caused by development and human- driven climate change may prove to be longer-running threats than disease. These are the same threats many species face in the midst of what scientists call a sixth mass extinction,"" Stone writes.  Welcoming the wolves. Gray wolves, native to Colorado, have been markedly absent from the Centennial State for 75 years. That's now set to change, Colorado Public Radio reports. By narrowly passing Proposition 114, voters mandated that the state reintroduce the species by 2023. In a twist, the measure's supporters actually outspent the opposition, leaving hunters and ranchers on the losing end.  Where the buffalo roam. This one's just plain cool. High Country News used a map from environmental group The Nature Conservancy to analyze the potential for public and private dollars to be used to purchase land rights and keep important migration corridors clear. Take a look at what migration pathways look like in the West and how development threatens to bottleneck species' movements.  AND ANOTHER THING  So, what now? I don't typically share opinion pieces in this newsletter, but with the election results in, this one from Leah Stokes, a political scientist who works on climate change issues at UC Santa Barbara, is an important read. Climate change was a key issue in the presidential election, and Biden will take office with a mandate to address the matter, from electrifying transport to retiring coal plants. ""The best time to cut emissions was decades ago; the second-best time is today,"" she wrote in The Boston Globe.  Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We‚Äôre above that and rising dangerously.       "
USA-2020-10.txt,"Climate Point: Low-emission metal, green hydrogen and electric buses    buses/3651983001  Mark Olalde .  COVID-19 numbers in the U.S. are once again trending very much in the wrong direction. We first hit a peak number of cases in April. Then we hit a higher peak in July. Now, after making progress, we're going backwards, with the number of new cases identified each day edging back toward the summer high.  Against that backdrop, USA Today Network reporters teamed up to dig into inequities across the country that are fueling the virus' spread through low-income communities and neighborhoods predominantly populated by people of color. Too often, we're seeing that environmental woes and public health are intertwined. In this must-read series, reporters found that factors such as proximity to heavily polluting industries seem to be making the pandemic worse.  Here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Can green go blue? The jury's still out on hydrogen's place in the clean-energy world, as forming hydrogen gas is an energy-intensive process that can come with heavy carbon emissions. But there is ""green hydrogen,"" where hydrogen is pulled from water using power from renewables. If that can be scaled, it could be an important slice of a green future. Bloomberg reports that Spain recently committed $10.5 billion to spur development in this field. In related news, CNBC reports that a hydrogen fuel cell plane with room for several passengers flew a maiden trip, signaling another step forward in the use of hydrogen for power.  Uprooted. For reasons ranging from long-standing legal rights to an often traditional connection to the area, indigenous land holders are one of the strongest defenses against widespread development. But that truism is losing some of its hold in the Amazon, where Mongabay reports a new study found mining now covers more than 20% of indigenous land. While in some cases it's indigenous groups living in poverty who are doing the mining themselves, in more instances the disparity comes from federal governments loosely enforcing land rights and providing minimal policing of land appropriation.     When the wells run dry. We're at a turning point in the history of oil and gas. Even petroleum companies predict we've hit ‚Äî or aren't far off from ‚Äî peak oil, which is the moment demand begins to finally drop. As this global shift coincides with temporary demand drop due to COVID-19 and an ill-timed price war, the name of the game is bankruptcy, with dozens of companies going under recently. For The Desert Sun, I've been tracking California Resources Corp., which is teaching investors some hard lessons. It was given the green light to emerge from bankruptcy this week, but how long will it last? Two states east, the New Mexico Political Report writes that its state's oil and gas companies are also struggling, but the feds are buying their corporate debt even with no immediate rebound in sight.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  Bidding for Santa Fe. The Albuquerque Journal is out with a dive into the latest campaign finance reports around the Land of Enchantment. The newspaper found that about a third of all political donations came from Chevron. The money went to Democrats and Republicans alike, and the state with a Democratic trifecta continues having trouble kicking a historical reputation of doing the industry's bidding. Other large petroleum companies including Occidental Petroleum and ConocoPhillips were also major donors.  It's electric. Clean Technica reports that Anaheim will become California's first city to employ an all-electric fleet of buses. The city's 46 new electric buses will pull a quarter of the power they need from a solar canopy over their own parking lot. This comes as Democrats in the Golden State are pushing to electrify many sectors, transportation key among them, in response to climate change.  Judicial juke. A colleague of mine in the environment reporting world ‚Äî Chris D'Angelo of HuffPost ‚Äî recently tweeted the perfect summation of Amy Coney Barrett's nomination hearing for a spot on the Supreme Court. ""If someone begins their answer to a climate question with 'I'm certainly not a scientist,' brace yourself for some denial,"" he wrote. The deeply conservative justice, who is being pushed through a nomination process weeks before the election, is expected to be no ally to the environment. Ellen Knickmeyer of AP digs into Barrett's deflection, explaining how the judge's answer is a soft form of climate denial.  CLIMATE CHANGE CHECK-IN  Sue level rising. Yet another shot has been fired in the legal barrage against oil and gas companies based on claims relating to climate change. Hawaii News Now reports that Maui County filed a suit on Monday against 20 fossil fuel companies, alleging they hid the dangers of their products. According to the story, ""Maui county says as a result of climate change ocean levels are rising (and) the wildfire season is now year-round.""     Marketing metal. Even though the shift from fossil fuels to renewables in the energy sector gets the lion's share of the attention, there are myriad parts of the economy that need to be decarbonized, from transportation to home cooking. The Wall Street Journal profiles one of the world's largest aluminum manufacturers that uses a low-carbon process in energy-intensive smelting. Although the idea is good for humanity, it's yet to pay economic dividends. There's not a separate, higher price incentivizing the production of this cleaner form of the metal, highlighting how market-based approaches only go so far in pushing industries to go green.  Fueling the flames. ProPublica is out with another analysis of wildfires during California's record-setting season. The news isn't great. As the climate continues to change, the number of dangerous fall fire weather days ‚Äî which the publication describes as ""days with high temperatures, low humidity and high wind speeds"" ‚Äî will double in some parts of California by the end of the century. That science appears to have little sway over President Donald Trump, though, who this week blocked disaster aid requested by California. The Los Angeles Times reports that it's unclear if the decision was purely political, although Trump has threatened the state with this unusual move before.  AND ANOTHER THING  Solar is heating up. The International Energy Agency published its World Energy Outlook 2020 earlier this week, and it's a must-read for climate and energy nerds everywhere. If reading the 464-page document is too hardcore for you, no worries, Carbon Brief already dug into it for us. Here's some good news. IEA has found that, in many countries, building new solar will provide the cheapest electricity in history. On the fossil fuel side, IEA ‚Äî which is usually relatively bullish on hydrocarbons ‚Äî says that oil isn't done just yet with peak oil having not quite arrived. Coal, though, is in ""structural decline.""  Here are the latest numbers:      "
USA-2020-11.txt,"Vulnerable Kansas bird populations are a canary in a coal mine for climate change    column/5804347002  Wildfires in the west and coastal erosion in east draw much of the attention, but, in its own way, Kansas has a lesson about climate change.  Sarah Spicer | Opinion contributor WICHITA ‚Äî It has been five months since Virginia Soyez died on a Monday in March, but every morning her husband Frank keeps their tradition. He wakes up at 5:30 a.m. ‚Äî a habit that hasn't left him since his days as a tank mechanic ‚Äî and sits in a brown recliner across from its now-empty pair in the sun room. He sips weak coffee from a brown and tan ceramic Fort Scott mug decorated with a sprig of wheat and foregoes breakfast altogether, as there's no longer anyone to share it with.  Dancing along the wallpaper‚Äôs top trimming are cardinals, Virginia's favorite bird. A wall of windows looks out onto a small backyard with enough room for a birdbath, a red and gold birdhouse on a wooden platform and two double-crook black metal stands that hold four bird feeders.  ""My wife always said that if we were going to go to a nursing home, it would have to have a sun room like this so we could sit and watch the birds,"" Soyez, 86, said.  Vulnerable bird populations  Often referred to as the nation's breadbasket, Kansas once captured the national imagination as the ""land of Oz."" Now, due to severe global changes in climate, some of the essential symbols that distinguish it from the rest of the country are being threatened: Wheat and other crops struggle to withstand the rising heat; the Flint Hills, which houses most of the last of the nation's tallgrass prairie (less than 4% of the original prairie remains), is vulnerable. And, more than 52 species of birds, including the western meadowlark, the state bird, are at risk of losing their range within the state.  Report for America: When COVID-19 forced schools to close, child hunger surged in West Virginia  As raging wildfires devastate California and rising tides contribute to coastal flooding, Kansas is not typically at the forefront of the national climate change discussion. While 67% of Kansans agree that climate change is happening, only 52% believe it‚Äôs mostly     caused by human activity, according to a survey by Yale Climate Change Communications. That puts Kansas below the national average on both beliefs, though signs of a shift are emerging.  ""I've noticed a change,"" said Bill Wentz, a professor of aerospace engineering who teaches sustainable energy at Wichita State University. ""College students still want to argue about what‚Äôs really happening with climate change, but most people acknowledge that it is happening.""  Though not professional birders, the Soyezes tracked changes in the bird population from their yard. In her last years, Virginia was increasingly concerned by the dramatic decline they noticed; some of her favorite birds, like the redheaded woodpecker, didn't seem to return as often. Other birds, like the white-winged dove, which was once only seen as far north as Texas, began to visit more regularly as the climate warmed.  The redheaded woodpecker is one of 52 species most vulnerable to Kansas‚Äô spring heat waves, which endanger their young and contribute to the loss of their habitat. A recent study by the National Audubon Society also considered how devastation is exacerbated by urbanization and increased wildfires. In Sedgwick County, where Soyez lives, it is one of four birds at high risk because of climate change, and he rarely sees them. It took a long time to understand why.  According to the American Wind Energy Association, 41% of Kansas‚Äô generated electricity in 2019 was from wind, the second highest percentage in the nation, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 8.2 million metric tons. Renewable energy investment, according to a spokesperson of Gov. Laura Kelly, is both an economic and environmental imperative. The administration has balanced encouraging Kansas‚Äô wind development while still protecting key ecosystems from being developed despite their wind potential, such as the Flint Hills.   The Kelly administration is working with stakeholders and state agencies on a renewable energy vision for Kansas, the spokesperson said.  Change the community can see  But as rising heat, droughts and increased flooding are noticeably impacting local neighborhoods, advocates are worried that Kansas isn‚Äôt doing enough to protect citizens from climate change. Unlike 32 other states, Kansas doesn‚Äôt have a climate action plan. Significantly, the state also doesn‚Äôt have a planning department, meaning that as new construction projects are being developed there are few considerations of how to reduce and mitigate the future impact of climate change, like reducing greenhouse gas emissions and providing shelter for weather disasters.  Report for America: Undocumented in Pennsylvania: An immigration activist stays defiant despite Trump policies  ""In Kansas, we tend to be pretty hands off and certainly at the state level there's not     really strong laws or guidance,"" said Ward Lyles, a licensed urban planner and associate professor of public affairs and administration at the University of Kansas. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs true across the Midwest.‚Äù  While there is no one alive today who could remember what pre-industrial Kansas felt like, or saw the tallgrass prairie flourishing, Soyez is part of a generation that witnessed the signs of climate change during their lifetime. A former gas plant worker who has lived in Kansas his entire life, Soyez didn‚Äôt know how climate change was affecting his home until recently. Though he didn‚Äôt have a term for it, he witnessed its impact over the course of his life, remembering when he used to hunt and drink straight out of local springs. Now, he wouldn‚Äôt dare.  ""I wouldn't drink that water any more than a man on the moon,"" Soyez said. ""I won't eat the fish I catch around here. I'd eat a fish out of the salt water down there, but the fish that I catch here? No.""  Perhaps most regrettably, he didn't know how the birds were being affected by climate change until after Virginia‚Äôs death, when he read a Wichita Eagle story about Kansas birds: ‚ÄúBirds in Kansas are facing major threats to their survival and without fast action, the state will lose significant numbers and even entire species, researchers say.‚Äù  The stark warning still stings. His deep, gravelly voice skips from tale to tale like a stone thrown across a pond, leaving lasting ripples behind as he confronts his grief, and the regret that he couldn‚Äôt provide this last answer to his wife.  But hours of video footage, of birds flitting from feeder to feeder and the faint humming sound of a happy Virginia in the background, remind him that through 66 years of marriage their passion never ceased. And he promised to protect it.  Sarah Spicer covers climate change for The Wichita Eagle.

USA-2020-12.txt,"As Black Lives Matter puts injustice in spotlight, climate emergency risks new 'apartheid'   We stand at a critical juncture: we can continue operating within a fundamentally untenable and unequal system or we can seize the opportunity to radically transform it.  Ban Ki-moon and Patrick Verkooijen | Opinion contributors  Show Caption  The growth of the Black Lives Matter movement should make us reflect more deeply on the consequences of inequality in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. For a while police brutality may have been the immediate trigger for the BLM protests, but inequality endangers communities of color in innumerable ways, from a lack of education and job opportunities to greater exposure to COVID-19.  Less prominent in the headlines, but equally serious, is the impact of climate change in exacerbating inequality. With 2020 predicted to be the hottest year on record and the hurricane season upon us, the communities suffering the highest COVID-19 infection and death rates, and the worst hardships from its economic fallout, will likely confront yet further threats in the shape of floods and heat waves.  Links between climate change, health, and inequality  It is important to understand the links between climate change, health, and inequality. Climate change is intensifying and increasing the number of extreme weather events in the U.S. Heat waves alone could potentially kill thousands of Americans every year. Those most at risk are low-income families who cannot afford air conditioning, and Black Americans are more than twice as likely to live in poverty as white Americans. Even before COVID-19, nearly 30 million, or one in three, U.S. households had trouble paying their energy bills. This year, the pandemic has closed libraries and other public spaces, denying even this refuge from the heat to those who need it the most.  These are the same groups of people who endure disproportionate levels of pollution from power plants and industrial facilities, and are least likely to get adequate medical care when they fall ill with respiratory diseases. Indeed, research published by     the U.S. National Academy of Sciences shows that Black and Hispanic people carry a ‚Äúpollution burden‚Äù that is 56% and 63% greater, respectively, than that of non-Hispanic white Americans.  Desmond Tutu, South Africa‚Äôs archbishop emeritus and Nobel laureate, has called the climate emergency ‚Äúthe apartheid of our times.‚Äù He says it is driving a deeper wedge between rich and poor ‚Äî both between nations and within them. Echoing his warning, the UN concluded in a recent report that global warming is likely to undermine not only basic rights to life, water, food and housing for hundreds of millions of people, but also democracy and the rule of law.  Just as in the U.S., those who find themselves on the front lines of climate change elsewhere in the world are often those who have done least to cause it. Earlier this year, Bangladesh faced the challenge of evacuating millions of people from the path of a cyclone in the midst of the pandemic. In the Mediterranean, climate refugees attempting the perilous sea crossing from Africa to Europe in overcrowded dinghies, face the added danger of falling prey to COVID-19, as do those boarding the ‚Äúdeath train‚Äù from Central America to the US border.   COLUMN: Most states fail education obligations to special needs students: So, what else is new?  We can no longer ignore the fact that when natural disasters strike, it‚Äôs the most vulnerable who are worst affected, time after time. Just as the world disregarded COVID-19 when it seemed a distant problem, so climate apartheid will only become bleaker if we continue to turn a blind eye to the effects of climate change on our vulnerable communities. We owe it to those already suffering, as well as to future generations, to fight for the well being of our planet in the face of this existential threat.  Investing for a fairer future  Where there is resolve, humanity is capable of extraordinary feats. Right now, scientists are racing to create a COVID-19 vaccine in record time. But despite the trillions that are being poured into post-COVID economic recoveries, what‚Äôs missing is the political vision to tackle our interlinked climate, health and economic emergencies as if they were one and the same.  Where there has been planning and funding, we‚Äôve seen positive results. Last May, as Cyclone Amphan bore down on Bangladesh, the government tripled the number of shelters to accommodate evacuees with a measure of social distancing. Thanks to Bangladesh‚Äôs decades of preparing and adapting to climate change, Amphan caused little more than 100 deaths,compared with the hundreds of thousands who perished from cyclones in the 20th century. Of course, every single death is cause for regret, but this demonstrates what is possible when minds and money are set on the task of adapting to the effects of global warming.     A final, crucial consideration: not only are the poorest and most vulnerable in our society most exposed to crises such as climate change, they‚Äôre also the least able to escape them. Data released by The New York Times about the number of New Yorkers who fled the city as COVID-19 struck showed the city‚Äôs wealthiest neighborhoods emptied the most ‚Äî and the fastest.  COLUMN: I grew up near the plutonium source for the Nagasaki bomb. Let's end the nuclear nightmare.  The gulf between those who can flee and those who cannot gives us a small taste of what climate apartheid could look like in the decades to come. We must strengthen our resolve to pursue a better, more equal future.  Right now, we stand at a critical juncture: we can continue operating within the fundamentally untenable and unequal system that has brought our planet to its knees, or we can seize the opportunity to radically transform it, to make our unequal world more inclusive, fair, and just. Now is the time to unite, and work together to improve the health of our planet and the equality of the people living on it.

USA-2020-13.txt,"Climate Point: As vote counts continue, Biden vows Day 1 climate action   Mark Olalde .  Trivia time. As of Wednesday, what's the only internationally recognized country in the world that's not participating in the Paris Agreement, the global plan to combat climate change? The United States of America. Which nation is the No. 1 cumulative emitter of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution? The United States of America.  USA Today has the details.  But as of Friday morning, President Donald Trump's future in the White House is dimming, while former Vice President Joe Biden makes gains in vote counts in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Nevada. A win in any of those states would likely give him and Sen. Kamala Harris the election (USA Today has a helpful tool to track votes). Biden took to Twitter on Wednesday, pledging to rejoin the Paris Agreement on Day 1 of his potential presidency. It's only a start, though, as Republicans who are committed to inaction on climate change are still the favorites to retain the Senate.  Here's some other important reporting ...  MUST-READ STORIES  Coming out on top Down Under. It's been a wild week in the U.S., but let's briefly head abroad. Like America, Australia still loves its fossil fuels, although there are some signs of change. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports that a 25-year-old successfully sued one of the country's largest retirement funds, coming to a settlement where the fund managers agreed they ""have a duty to manage the financial risks of climate change."" It's big because citizens and cities around the world have begun turning to the courts ‚Äî including in the U.S. ‚Äî to sue fossil fuel companies while they're also pressuring public universities and pension funds to divest from coal, oil and gas.  Build back better. Sticking with the international theme for a moment, Reuters reports that the United Nations is urging city leaders to use the COVID-19 pandemic as a ""springboard"" to build more livable urban centers. Although the pandemic is pushing many to look for new homes outside urban centers, the U.N. report noted the relative success of some large metropolises like Seoul, Singapore and Tokyo in managing     outbreaks ‚Äî suggesting that overcrowding, rather than density, enabled the virus to spread. High population density, it said, eased delivery of health care and other services.  Small oil? It's been only several years since Exxon was the world's largest company by market capitalization, but the past appears much brighter than the future for the oil supermajor. The Wall Street Journal reports that the company recently posted its third consecutive quarterly loss for the first time ever and hinted that it could take a $30 billion writedown. Meanwhile, E&E is out with a story that includes perhaps my favorite quote ever from an expert: ""It's like I give you $1 million and you convert it to $1 bills, and you light it on fire to make energy."" That's in reference to Exxon's much-advertised plan to go green by developing algae as biofuel. It doesn't appear to be money well- spent.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  American eats. Civil Eats, which covers the country's food system, is out with a highly educational deep-dive dissecting Trump's impact on food, and I recommend taking a read. ""President Trump‚Äôs agenda, focused primarily around deregulation and increasing aid to commodity farmers while cutting food aid to needy families, will have long- lasting implications,"" they write.  Courtroom drama. Remember when the GOP leader of Ohio's House was arrested in a massive corruption case eons ago? And by eons, I mean July. Well, the Akron Beacon Journal reports that the utility company involved in the alleged scheme, FirstEnergy, saw its debt downgraded after several executives were fired. Concurrently, Eye on Ohio and Energy News Network report that consumer advocates are crying foul as FirstEnergy slow walks the release of information pertinent to related litigation. The company did not comment on the story. To cap off the scandal's wild few weeks, Republicans stuck with their candidate, Larry Householder ‚Äî even though he was indicted and stripped of the speaker's job ‚Äî and he won his re-election bid easily, the Newark Advocate reports.  Turnover on downs. In Alabama, Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones, the attorney who prosecuted the 16th Street Baptist Church bombers, lost his reelection bid to Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former college football coach. Our USA Today Network friends at the Montgomery Advertiser report that Jones accepts the scientific consensus on climate change. Tuberville, meanwhile, wouldn't answer the paper's questions on the topic but in the past has said the Christian god controls changes in the climate.  THERE'S USUALLY A CLIMATE ANGLE  Fish amidst the flames. In a new piece, The Arizona Republic reports on a daring rescue of fish ‚Äî you read that correctly ‚Äî as a wildfire and its debris engulfed sensitive Southwestern ecosystems. Ian James writes that this was one of many incidents that     convinced scientists studying the aquatic world to come out publicly in support of sweeping action on climate change.  Who pays the tab? The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that an insurance company has demanded that Peabody Energy, one of the country's few remaining major coal companies, provide collateral for every single dollar of cleanup costs the provider insures. Why is this important? For several years, I investigated the system that's meant to guarantee money will be available to clean up the coal industry's mess when it disappears. I raised the alarm that this exact scenario ‚Äî mining companies and insurance firms passing the buck on reclamation they can't afford ‚Äî was on its way.  A coal-less future. If you're a loyal Climate Point reader, you're well-aware of the Just Transition and the important role labor plays in ensuring good jobs remain as fossil fuel industries disappear. Bringing some hopeful news, the Colorado Sun reports that in the small Colorado town of Craig, the shutdown of its coal-fired power plant was supposed to spell this economic doom, but that never really materialized.  AND ANOTHER THING  Silly Shell. I'm no social media maven, but I know one thing ‚Äî don't get ratioed on Twitter. Shell didn't get the message. The other day, the oil company tried an innocuous-seeming poll, and, wow, did it go sideways. But why am I wasting space discussing an internet fail? The debate highlighted a very important point in the climate change conversation. (Take a look here, and read the replies.) Simply put, fossil fuel companies want the narrative to be that the demand side ‚Äî individuals ‚Äî are responsible for saving the planet by driving less and using energy-efficient lightbulbs. That's what Shell did with their failed poll. The problem, though, is that it's far too late for billions of people to automatically go green at the same time. The market, regulators and the supply side run the show, not individuals with limited choice in how they light their homes and power their cars. The Guardian has more on Shell's ""greenwashing.""

USA-2020-14.txt,"'I was slipping into despair': Jane Fonda finds hope, purpose in climate change activism    do/5709624002  Barbara VanDenburgh | USA TODAY  Show Caption  Jane Fonda‚Äôs 82nd birthday party was a doozy.  The Oscar-winning actress spent the special day in December with some of her celebrity friends: Rosanna Arquette, Gloria Steinem and Casey Wilson were all there. Hundreds of other new friends showed up, too, waving signs and chanting, ‚ÄúWe love you!‚Äù Fonda smiled and waved, wearing a fetching fire-engine-red coat.  Then, the best part: She got arrested.  In her new book, ‚ÄúWhat Can I Do? My Path from Climate Despair to Action,‚Äù out Tuesday, Fonda calls her day in police detention the ‚Äúbest birthday party ever.‚Äù  It was all part of the plan for that very special Fire Drill Friday. Fonda had launched the initiative in October with Greenpeace and other environmental activism allies to protest every Friday in the streets of the nation's capital. Those protests would culminate in acts of nonviolent civil disobedience. Many people, including celebrities, were arrested, to draw attention to the climate crisis.   Her birthday Fire Drill Friday arrest was Fonda‚Äôs fifth. On another occasion, she used her detainment to get in a quick workout.  ‚ÄúI did wall squats for a while, meditated, and eventually was able to sleep using a sweater as a pillow and my red coat both to soften the metal under me and as a cover,‚Äù Fonda writes.  Fonda is using the full force of her considerable celebrity to help execute a relentless public pressure campaign to raise awareness ‚Äì and ultimately, she hopes, pressure Congress into passing the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate change proposal that seeks to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels and limit greenhouse gas emissions.  ‚ÄúI was slipping into despair before I went to D.C. I spent a year depressed about climate change and feeling I wasn‚Äôt doing enough,‚Äù Fonda tells USA TODAY. ‚ÄúOnce I went to D.C. and began that action, my despondency disappeared.‚Äù     She‚Äôs hoping her book can help pull others out of their climate despair and start putting in the work to save the planet. ‚ÄúWhat Can I Do?‚Äù isn‚Äôt a rhetorical question ‚Äì Fonda details her journey as a climate change activist and charts a course for readers out of climate despair.   Here's what else Fonda has to say about the climate crisis, the importance of organized activism, the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.  Giving up is not an option  A committed activist for most of her adult life, Fonda has long stood up to forces bigger than herself and held her ground (including, but not limited to, the United States government). She‚Äôs opposed the Vietnam War and the Iraq War, supported the civil rights and feminist movements and fought for Native American land rights.  Still, the generally unflappable Fonda despaired when confronted with the gravity of the climate crisis.  ‚ÄúI would wonder if perhaps humankind deserved the fate it had created,‚Äù Fonda writes. ‚ÄúJust get rid of us Homo sapiens ASAP and things will restore themselves.‚Äù  A mother and grandmother, Fonda knew that wasn‚Äôt an option.  ‚ÄúI knew this fatalist thinking was a cop-out, and I didn‚Äôt like myself for it,‚Äù she writes. What helped convince Fonda to fight for change was actually listening to what climate scientists were saying.  ‚ÄúThe scientists are very clear: We have to cut our fossil fuel emissions in half by 2030,‚Äù Fonda says. ‚ÄúThey say we have the technology to do it, we have the money to do it, we have everything we need to do it except enough people to force the government to actually do it.‚Äù  'It affects us all': Erin Brockovich's 'Superman's Not Coming' explores water issues, urges action  Hence Fire Drill Fridays. Fonda doesn‚Äôt have the power to single-handedly lower global temperatures, but she does have the power of celebrity. With it, she can draw attention to the cause and help to build a nonviolent army that may someday be big enough and loud enough to compel the government to take action.  She‚Äôs drawing other celebrities to the cause, too, including some rather unlikely ones. Sam Waterston, her co-star on the popular Netflix series ‚ÄúGrace and Frankie‚Äù and a self-described moderate, is nearly 80 and wasn't exactly a rabble-rouser ‚Äì at least not until he joined Fonda at a Fire Drill Friday protest. Two weeks later, he was sending Fonda pictures of himself in handcuffs again ‚Äì this time on the playing field at a Harvard-Yale game in support of students demanding their universities divest from fossil fuels.     Fonda says, ‚ÄúHe was holding up his handcuffed hands saying, ‚ÄòLook what you started!‚Äô‚Äù  COVID-19 is an omen  As with so many other things ‚Äì school, work, major political conventions ‚Äì the coronavirus pandemic has forced Fire Drill Fridays to go virtual. Each week, Fonda hosts Fireside Friday Drills, conducting video chats with prominent political, social and activist figures. There are also teach-ins with scientists, professors and other experts, and virtual rallies to help keep up the energy of the virtual volunteer army. Fonda says a recent Friday saw 600,000 people following across all platforms.  But while the pandemic didn‚Äôt kill the movement, Fonda sees it as a harbinger ‚Äì and argues that climate change is partially responsible.  Fact check: The coronavirus pandemic isn‚Äôt slowing climate change  ‚ÄúPandemics are becoming more and more frequent, and that itself is connected to the climate crisis,‚Äù Fonda says. As climate change warms weather and shortens winters, Fonda says, disease-carrying animals and insects begin to move into new areas. Cutting down forests releases bats and other animals into populated areas, possibly carrying diseases that humans aren't immune to. Melting permafrost in the Arctic could release pathogens.  ‚ÄúWhat we learned from (COVID-19) is the importance of having a robust federal government, that it be prepared, and that it listen to the experts, the scientists,‚Äù Fonda says. ‚ÄúI think people really realize with COVID how non-resilient the United States is in the face of increasingly extreme weather events. We are not ready.‚Äù  Report warns: Climate change could be a 'catastrophic' national security threat  The 2020 election is a moment of truth  Fonda is critical of President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration and its record on climate change. When asked whether she sees the coming election as a do-or-die moment for climate reform, Fonda doesn‚Äôt hesitate. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she says emphatically.  ‚ÄúMaybe a whole lot of people, especially young people, were big supporters of Bernie Sanders, and they‚Äôre disappointed that he and his policies didn‚Äôt win,‚Äù Fonda says. ‚ÄúMy message is: I‚Äôd rather push a moderate than fight a fascist.‚Äù  That ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù is Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, whose climate policies are less progressive than Sanders‚Äô. Fonda understands the disappointment young progressives in particular might feel, but still, she says they need to get out the vote for Biden this November.     ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking them to send him a valentine, we're not asking them to fall in love with him or date him,‚Äù Fonda says. ‚ÄúCome on, get over yourself, and get ready to fight the fight of your life.‚Äù  To get involved with Fire Drill Fridays, text JANE to 877-877, or visit firedrillfridays.com.

USA-2020-15.txt,"Climate Point: Big Oil battered by lawsuits. America battered by extreme weather.      Mark Olalde .  Hard to believe it's been 19 years. Nearly two decades since those planes flew into the Twin Towers, into the Pentagon and into a field in Pennsylvania, we still must pause to reflect on those innocent lives snuffed out on . I was a youngster in elementary school that fateful day, but I still remember it clearly.  I have no grand, environmental lesson to draw from this yearly, dark milestone. But I do have a question: When tragedy strikes, be it terrorism or slow-moving catastrophes, how do we respond? We're watching unseasonal snow fall in one part of the country while another part burns. Rising seas chew up the coast, while droughts and floods condemn interior agriculture. How do we respond?  Staring down threats from climate change, a groundswell of citizens, cities and states are taking Big Oil to court. Many of these lawsuits aim to force fossil fuel companies to pay costs associated with mitigating extreme weather, but they're also an attempt to break the industry's grip on global politics. It's been a big week climate litigation.  The Post and Courier reports that Charleston, the largest city in South Carolina, became the first in the conservative South to sue the oil industry for lying about its products' ties to climate change. The News Journal writes that Delaware's attorney general has also launched a lawsuit against 31 fossil fuel companies, ranging from Chevron to BP. And internationally, DeSmogBlog writes that other climate lawsuits are picking up steam, including a recently filed attempt from young adults in Mexico to hold their government accountable.  Now, here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  There will be fraud. Bloomberg's also out with a new, damning piece that digs into unfilled promises made by oil executives. According to the story, top-level employees at oil and gas company Anadarko have been accused of lying about their potential reserves ‚Äî and therefore profitability ‚Äî while taking home handsome golden parachutes. It's not an isolated case study in the modern oil business.     Grief through the flames. We can rip up, pave over and build on as much nature as we want. Humans will still have a deeply held connection to the natural world. I was on the scene while the Dome Fire was still burning in the Mojave National Preserve, ultimately torching more than 43,000 acres of some of the densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world. Join me as I, for The Desert Sun, explore what this tells us about how climate change fuels catastrophic wildfires and how this doesn't bode well for iconic species like the Joshua tree.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  Water wars bubble up again. Ian James of The Arizona Republic tracks water in the West as closely as anyone, and he's out with a new report on a proposed 140-mile- long pipeline in Utah that would draw on Colorado River water. The other six states that touch the river basin are pushing back.  Coal in the Cowboy State. Investigative newsroom WyoFile this week published a new report digging into carbon capture and storage. It's the process of pulling carbon dioxide out of the air to reduce the greenhouse effect, but it's pushed less by environmentalists and more by the fossil fuel industry as a way to justify the burning of hydrocarbons. In Wyoming, which produces 40% of America's coal, a fight is brewing over whether the technology actually has a viable future.  A stark warning. Politico got their hands on a report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an independent U.S. government agency, that acknowledged the dire implications of climate change on the economy. ‚ÄúClimate change poses a major risk to the stability of the U.S. financial system and to its ability to sustain the American economy,"" the study concluded.  ENERGY POLICY, IT IS A CHANGIN‚Äô  Oil facing a major setback. The fight to mandate buffer zones ‚Äî otherwise known as setbacks ‚Äî between oil wells and homes, schools and other important infrastructure has been won time and again by the fossil fuel industry. In the last election, massive spending from oil and gas companies led to one such easy victory. But, the Colorado Sun reports, times might be changing in the Centennial State, as ""four of the five commissioners (who oversee oil and gas) voiced support for an extended setback to protect public health and safety.""  In the black no more. Even the coal industry itself no longer argues whether King Coal has been dethroned. In the latest example of this fall, Taylor Kuykendall from S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that a bankrupt mining company called Rhino Resource Partners LP asked a bankruptcy court to let it sell its assets for pennies on the dollar. A mine went for $213,366. One preparation plant went for $25,000 with only one bidder.      Back in blackout. Do you question how a state like California ‚Äî which by itself would be one of the world's largest economies ‚Äî could be hit by blackouts from not enough electricity in 2020? You're not alone. Sammy Roth of the Los Angeles Times recently published a Q&A with Stephen Berberich, president of the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the Golden State's grid. It's an interesting read for anyone wondering what or who is to blame.  AND ANOTHER THING  A hot new destination. This summer has absolutely obliterated many heat records here in the Southern California desert. In Palm Springs, we already hit 55 days of 110 degree weather or hotter by Sept. 1. Maybe I'll move back to Chicago. Together, Desert Sun business reporter Melissa Daniels and I examined new research that predicts, by the end of the century, rising temperatures will doom a large swathe of local tourism economies if we don't act soon. It's an important case study that has implications from California to Florida.   Here are the latest numbers:  And one last thing before I sign off.

USA-2020-16.txt,"Scientists are seeing an 'acceleration of pandemics': They are looking at climate change    pandemics/5749582002  Doyle Rice | USA TODAY  ""We have entered a pandemic era,"" a recent study in the journal Cell said. Almost certainly, the impacts of pandemics like COVID-19 are exacerbated by climate change. ""It is hard to imagine that climate change will be anything good for human health.""  COVID-19 may only be the beginning of global pandemics ‚Äì a future scenario in which climate change may also play a role.  ""We have entered a pandemic era,"" said a recent study in the journal Cell. Written by Dr. Anthony Fauci and medical historian Dr. David Morens, both of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the study paints a picture of a future where pandemics become more numerous.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a crystal ball, but what we are seeing looks very much like an acceleration of pandemics,‚Äú Morens told BuzzFeed News. Causes he cited include deforestation, urban crowding and wet markets for wild game.  But climate change's possible role is complicated: We know that the virus survives longer in cold temperatures than hot, so that could mean that a warmer planet would slow the spread of the disease, said meteorologist Jeff Masters, who writes for Yale Climate Connections. On the other hand, he said heat waves cause people to spend more time indoors in air-conditioned spaces, where the spread of the disease increases.   Unsuitable for 'human life to flourish': Up to 3B will live in extreme heat by 2070, study warns  ""Thus, Florida had a difficult time with COVID-19 this summer, despite the fact that some parts of Florida recorded their hottest summer on record,"" Masters told USA TODAY. ""These complexities make it difficult to judge how climate change may be affecting COVID-19.""  Warming creates 'opportunity' for pathogens   Some scientists do believe warming will play a bigger role in future pandemics.     ""We do know that climate change alters how we relate to other species on Earth and that matters to our health and our risk for infections,"" said Dr. Aaron Bernstein, director of Harvard University's T.H. Chan C-CHANGE program.  ""As the planet heats up, animals big and small, on land and in the sea, are headed to the poles to get out of the heat,"" he said. ""That means animals are coming into contact with other animals they normally wouldn‚Äôt, and that creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.""  In addition, Masters said the diseases of most concern globally that are worsened by climate change are the ones spread by mosquitoes, since mosquitoes like it hot and wet ‚Äì conditions that are becoming increasingly common because of global warming. Malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever and the West Nile virus are all expected to spread into areas where they currently are not endemic, he said. Tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease will also spread.  Bernstein said climate change has already made conditions more favorable to the spread of some infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, waterborne diseases such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus (which causes vomiting and diarrhea) and mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.   ""Future risks are not easy to foretell, but climate change hits hard on several fronts that matter to when and where pathogens appear, including temperature and rainfall patterns,"" Bernstein said. ""To help limit the risk of infectious diseases, we should do all we can to vastly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.""  Fact check: The coronavirus pandemic isn‚Äôt slowing climate change  As for whether climate change could exacerbate future pandemics, Morens told USA TODAY it is too early to draw definitive conclusions.   ""One might imagine that if climate change causes further environmental degradation and change (beyond what humans are already doing), then we are likely to see more of these diseases,"" he said. ""But one could equally argue that we will see less. These are big questions to which we may not have good answers for decades, or even centuries to come.  ""But at the end of the day, for many reasons, it is hard to imagine that climate change will be anything good for human health.""  Climate change is a 'threat multiplier'  One expert said that almost certainly, the impacts of pandemics such as COVID are exacerbated by climate change.     Meteorologist Michael Mann of Penn State University called climate change a ""threat multiplier,"" meaning ""it amplifies existing challenges and threats by increasing our vulnerability and reducing our adaptive capacity.""   He said to consider, for example, the situation in Puerto Rico, where many people have died of COVID-19 for the simple reason that they have not yet recovered, in terms of their public health infrastructure, from the devastating impacts of Hurricane Maria three years ago.   ""There is no doubt in my mind that the storm was made more destructive by unusually warm tropical Atlantic sea-surface temperatures, which provide more energy and moisture for the storm,"" Mann said. ""This anomalous warmth can only be explained taking into account human-caused climate change.""   UN report: Planet is 'way off track' in dealing with climate change, UN report says  He said a case can also be made for at least an indirect connection between COVID-19 and climate change. Environmental degradation, including deforestation, the destruction of rain forests and natural habitats for development may be displacing exotic disease-carrying creatures in a way that does favor increased human contact.   ""These same activities ‚Äì deforestation in particular ‚Äì are also leading to increased carbon emissions, which are behind human-caused climate change,"" Mann said.      "
USA-2020-17.txt,"Trump's EPA rewrote the rules on air, water energy. Now voters face a choice on climate change issues    regulate/6071916002  Beth Burger | Cape Cod Times Cherise Harris noticed a change in her eldest daughter soon after the family moved a block away from a 132-year-old coal-fired power plant in Painesville, Ohio.  The teen‚Äôs asthma attacks occurred more frequently, Harris said, and she started carrying an inhaler with her at all times.  The family didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but Painesville‚Äôs municipal-owned plant emits nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide ‚Äì two pollutants that the American Lung Association says inflames air passages, causing shortness of breath, chest tightness, pain and wheezing.   ‚ÄúIt makes me wonder,‚Äù said Harris, who lives with her four children and fianc√©. ‚ÄúIs that what triggered my daughter‚Äôs asthma?‚Äù   Under President Donald Trump's rule, the Painesville plant ‚Äì and nearly 200 other coal-powered electric utilities like it ‚Äì can emit more such pollutants, according to the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs own projections.   The rule is one of nearly 100 environmental rollbacks the Trump administration has pursued over the past four years to loosen regulations on everything from air and water quality to wildlife.  A majority of them already are in effect; others face court challenges. All threaten environmental protections that have been in place for decades.   As Americans cast their ballots on Election Day, voters have a choice: continued deregulation that could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions, worsening symptoms of climate change and mass species die-offs, or a reversal of those policies and a slate of new governmental restrictions.  Democratic nominee Joe Biden, who is Trump‚Äôs main challenger in the election, has promised a plan to fast-track the country to zero carbon dioxide emissions in the electricity sector by 2035. It‚Äôs similar to a new energy emissions model released Thursday by a team of researchers at the Clean Energy Futures project who say it's possible to get to zero emissions in the electricity sector within two decades.  The team‚Äôs model shows solar and wind replacing coal and natural gas as the leading sources of electricity generation.     ""When you set an ambitious target, like 100% clean energy, you see substantial improvements in air quality and major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Kathy Fallon Lambert, senior adviser at the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment (C-CHANGE) at Harvard University‚Äôs T.H. Chan School of Public Health and part of the research team.  ""That's not so surprising,‚Äù Lambert said. ‚ÄúBut what was a bit surprising to us is that it's achievable with existing technology and the costs are moderate.""  USA TODAY Network climate reporters, including the Times' Doug Fraser, fanned out across Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Michigan and Ohio to examine the effects of rollbacks of two key protections: One that diminishes air quality through Trump‚Äôs Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule; the other threatening water quality through recent changes to the Waters of the United States rule, or WOTUS.  The void of federal regulations has left some states, which are already in the midst of declining revenues due to the coronavirus pandemic, trying to maintain pre-Trump standards.  ‚ÄúThe obvious thing (the rules) do is weaken pollution standards, or weaken environmental protections,"" said Joseph Goffman, a former assistant administrator at the EPA and now the executive director of the Environmental & Energy Law Program at Harvard University. ""As they go into effect, the public is exposed to more pollution, more environmental damage, more emissions of greenhouse gases, than they otherwise would be exposed to thanks to these rules.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBut these rules do something else,"" Goffman said ‚Äì what the administration really wants is to undo the law.  Trump EPA officials argue the opposite, despite what scientists and activists say. Officials believe rules changes have removed burdensome regulations without a cost to the environment.  The Trump Administration, Environmental rollbacks, climate change, and pollution  Harvard research director talks about the effects of the Trump administration's environmental roll backs to Air pollution and climate change.  Courtney Hergesheimer, The Columbus Dispatch  ‚ÄúWe have a really good environmental record,"" EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview with the USA TODAY Network. Wheeler, before taking over the agency, had been an EPA employee and also a lobbyist for energy, oil and uranium processing companies.     ""I would say that the Obama administration only focused on climate change and not on the nuts and bolts of what the EPA is supposed to be doing,"" Wheeler said. ""And we've been doing all of it at the same time.‚Äù  Earth is on course by 2050 to be about 3 degrees Celsius warmer compared to pre- industrial times. The increase will wipe out some species, place more homes in floodplains and mean longer, more intense heat waves. There‚Äôs a race to stop carbon dioxide emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and fuel conditions for climate change.  Even with steadily dropping emissions levels in the U.S. over decades, carbon dioxide remains in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere for up to 1,000 years, according to NASA.  At the same time, EPA's authority has become restricted and limited for the first time in decades since landmark environmental laws were enacted, according to more than a dozen experts and former EPA staff members interviewed for this story.  With the rule changes, the ‚Äúinterruption of progress represents a loss of time that will never be recovered,"" Goffman said. ""Time is of the essence, in terms of dealing with climate change.‚Äù  A rule to keep coal-fired plants running  For more than 100 years, coal-fired power plants have emitted carbon dioxide that contributed to climate change. Rather than reducing those emissions,the EPA under Trump implemented the Affordable Clean Energy Rule ‚Äì or ACE ‚Äì requiring plants to operate more efficiently.  Critics say that's the wrong move.   If the plants run more efficiently, the operators make upgrades and keep them operating longer, experts said. The EPA‚Äôs own data modeling shows that this leads to emissions increases, Harvard's Fallon Lambert said.   ‚ÄúOur primary takeaway is that it does little to nothing to address carbon pollution,"" she said. ""And in many states, you could see an emissions rebound.""  Charles Driscoll, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Syracuse University, who is also part of the Clean Energy Futures project, agreed.  ‚ÄúACE incentivizes the continuation of coal. So it doesn't do much in terms of carbon dioxide. It doesn't do much for sulfur dioxide,‚Äù he said.  The rule went into effect in June 2019 and took the place of the Obama administration‚Äôs Clean Power Plan, which sought to reduce emissions by about 32% from 2005 levels by 2030 but never took effect due to court challenges. It would have provided utilities with     incentives to use renewables and low-emitting fuels more and use high-emitting fuels, like coal, less.   Even without strict reduction standards, carbon dioxide emissions continue to drop, the EPA‚Äôs Wheeler said.   ‚ÄúThe prior administration, they focused almost solely on climate change at the expense of the other responsibilities of the EPA,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat they tried to do is virtue signal to foreign capitals, such as Paris, instead of focusing on something that is legally sustainable here in the United States.‚Äù  A Flourish map The Trump administration withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, which is working to reduce greenhouse gases, saying it placed an unfair economic burden on America.  The EPA's Wheeler said he believes the courts will uphold the ACE rule and that it ultimately will reduce carbon emissions. ""The trajectory of CO2 emissions in this country is going down. And it's going down each year, and it will continue to go down.‚Äù  But it would drop little compared to the researchers‚Äô clean energy model. Nationally under that plan, carbon dioxide emissions from energy generation would plummet 36% by 2030. They would drop 70% by 2035 before hitting 100% ‚Äì zero emissions ‚Äì in 2040.  In Painesville, under the Trump administration's ACE rule, EPA records show the city's coal plant would be allowed to produce more than twice as much carbon dioxide as it has emitted in any year since 2011. When the plant runs, it mostly affects a Black and Latino neighborhood nearby. Children play at a park there in sight of the plant's stack.  Activists: It's profits over people  About 30 miles northeast of Cleveland, in Ohio, Painesville's power plant burns coal only when energy use peaks and the market price soars, keeping usage to a minimum, a city spokeswoman told the USA TODAY Network.  Its annual CO2 emissions fluctuated over the decade, reaching as high as about 122,000 tons in 2011 and dipping as low as to about 6,300 tons in 2018, EPA records show.  Those outputs seem small in comparison to the limits allowed by the Trump rule ‚Äì more than 265,000 tons annually by 2025, according to EPA models.  A community of mostly Latino and Black residents living adjacent to the plant may be paying the price with their health. Since 1990, an average of 135 Ohio residents die annually from asthma, according to Ohio Department of Health.     There‚Äôs a recreation center, outdoor basketball court and playground next to the coal- fired facility, which originally opened in 1888. The playground attracts children who play near the plant and breathe in emissions.  ""We always played there. We never really paid attention to it. We lived in this area most of our life,"" said Juan Jacquin, 18, whose family moved a couple of blocks closer to the plant in recent months. The odor is noticeably stronger when it runs, he said.  Across Lake Erie from Painesville, in Michigan, portions of a heavily industrialized area in and around Detroit have failed for years to meet EPA air quality standards for sulfur dioxide.  Under Trump-administration policies, EPA‚Äôs own projections show sulfur dioxide emissions will increase in Michigan by more than 35% over the next five years.   That disproportionally affects lower-income residents and people of color, many of whom live in neighborhoods in close proximity to a large oil refinery, steel and auto plants, or other factories.  In Wayne County, which includes Detroit, childhood asthma hospitalization rates are more than 62% higher than the statewide average. In 2017, the mortality rate from asthma among white Michigan residents was 7 deaths per 1 million; for Black residents, it was three times higher ‚Äì 26 per 1 million.   ‚ÄúIt is obvious profits over people is the top agenda item,‚Äù said Delores Leonard, a retired educator turned environmental activist in one of Detroit‚Äôs most industrialized, most polluted areas.   The EPA predicts CO2 emissions will increase in Michigan by almost 15% over the next decade, at a time when the Great Lakes region is warming faster than the rest of the contiguous U.S., according to scientists.  A clean energy model, similar to what Biden is touting, shows Michigan emitting 13.9 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide and 10,000 fewer tons of sulfur dioxide in 2035 compared to the ACE rule.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so upsetting,‚Äù said Alyson Melnik, 25, a resident of the factory-lined Detroit suburb of Dearborn. ‚ÄúThe EPA no longer stands for anything that protects the environment.‚Äù   It‚Äôs not unusual for communities of color to be located near polluting facilities in what environmentalists call ""sacrifice zones.""  Dr. Aaron Bernstein, interim director of climate health and the global environment at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a pediatric hospitalist at Boston Children's Hospital, said air pollution in the United States disproportionately affects minorities.   Black and Latino communities are exposed to, ‚Äúin some studies, 20%, maybe 60% more     air pollution,"" he said at a recent conference. Yet ""they produce less. They‚Äôre responsible for less. Their behaviors in our society actually consume less goods and services and energy. They‚Äôre producing the least and are exposed to the most.‚Äù  Nationally, 1 in 5 children who have asthma may have developed it from breathing polluted air, Bernstein said.   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen more children not be able to breathe in my lifetime than I would like to see in anyone else‚Äôs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe mother does not care about climate change. She couldn‚Äôt give a hoot about what‚Äôs going to happen to the planet in 50 years. She wants to know if her child is going to suffocate in front of me.‚Äù  Wheeler said the EPA wants to improve environmental quality, ""so that we can try to bring down the asthma rates in children. I was a child asthmatic. I think it‚Äôs very important to be working on the max attainment.‚Äù  When asked if more stringent standards would be needed to improve air quality, he said, ‚ÄúThe answer isn‚Äôt always just to go to more stringent standards until you get everybody to comply with the existing standards that we have.‚Äù  Wheeler said air pollution is down during Trump‚Äôs term in office, but according to an Associated Press analysis last year, federal data showed the nation had more polluted air days than just a few years earlier.  Under a clean energy model, estimates similar to what the Biden campaign is promoting, Ohio would emit 62.4 million tons less of carbon dioxide by 2035 compared to the ACE rule and nearly 71,000 fewer tons of sulfur dioxide would also no longer enter the air, according to the model.  Market-based solutions  Many coal-fired plants will likely continue shuttering and dropping off the EPA‚Äôs regulatory list. There has been a decline in coal-powered sources because of market forces ‚Äì in particular, lower-priced natural gas.   American Electric Power closed a coal-fired power plant in Conesville, Ohio, in May, two years ahead of schedule.  In October, Texas-based Vistra Corp., the company that owns the William H. Zimmer Power Station in Moscow, Ohio,just outside Cincinnati, announced plans to close the plant in 2027 along with other plants across the Midwest.  Michigan‚Äôs two largest energy utilities, Consumers Energy and DTE, in recent months announced plans to accelerate the closure of several coal-fired power plants.     Consumers Energy wants to end coal-fired power generation and reduce carbon emissions by more than 90% by 2040. DTE said it will close 11 of its 17 plants in Michigan ‚Äì including three in the Detroit area ‚Äì by 2023, and achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century.  Coupled with market forces and more consumer support for renewable energy, the private sector is decarbonizing on its own. But that is ""not a substitute for government action,‚Äù said Michael Vandenbergh, a Vanderbilt University professor who is director of the Climate Change Research Network.  ‚ÄúI think after (the election) if we get a Biden administration,"" Vandenbergh said, ""then what we will find is that these corporate commitments will have paved the way for government action, and will provide a gap-filling or complementary role if we get major legislation or a new regulatory program.‚Äù  Legal implications of rollbacks  Trump‚Äôs policies on the environment and climate have elicited stiff resistance from conservation groups and Democrats. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than California, where Attorney General Xavier Becerra led the opposition's legal onslaught.   By mid-October, California was part of coalitions that had launched 106 lawsuits against the Trump administration, 56 of which specifically took on environmental issues.  This deluge of litigation is aimed to stop rollbacks or halt the promulgation of new, weaker regulations under the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Power Plan, the Endangered Species Act and others.   ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs three worst enemies are the facts, the law and the science,‚Äù Becerra said.   If Biden is elected, many of those 56 lawsuits could become moot. Becerra said he could not think of any environmental policy stance the Trump administration had taken that a hypothetical Biden administration would likely defend.   ‚ÄúA new administration could obviously change their position in litigation, and it‚Äôs not uncommon that that happens,‚Äù said Mike Landis, an attorney representing advocacy groups including the Public Interest Network and Environment America.  But the process of getting environmental laws to where they were in 2016 is more complicated and hinges on factors ranging from when the Trump administration unveiled a new policy to what the regulation does.      For example, a Biden administration could stop defending the ACE rule, which California is challenging in court. But it would be a separate matter to reinstitute the Clean Power Plan after it was repealed in June 2019.   ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt be as simple as rolling back the rollback,‚Äù Landis said.  First, the Biden administration would have to build back the EPA's gutted staff and fix its budget, said Betsy Southerland, former director of Science and Technology at the EPA Office of Water.  ""They're not going to just put things back the way they were in 2016,"" she said. ""They want to initiate aggressive new action on climate change and environmental justice. So no question, this new administration is going to be faced with a massive workload.""  Erasing protections for waterways  Perhaps the rules with the largest implications across states are the revisions to the Clean Water Act.  In 2015, the Obama administration expanded the federal government‚Äôs authority to regulate wetlands and washes when it adopted the regulation called the Waters of the United States rule, or WOTUS.  By scrapping that rule and adopting its new Navigable Waters Protection Rule, the Trump administration dramatically narrowed the definition of streams and wetlands that fall under federal regulation. Omitted were ephemeral streams that flow seasonally, select intermittent streams that flow after heavy rainfall and wetlands that are not adjacent to bodies of water.   ‚ÄúAlmost every single state has their own protections on waterways,"" the EPA's Wheeler said. ""So even if it's not a federal waterway, it doesn't mean it's not protected by the states.""  The administration's changes to the waters rule leaves 18% of streams and 51% of wetlands unprotected, according to an EPA staff analysis that used data from the U.S. Geological Survey's national hydrography database.  The data was not publicized when changes to the rule were proposed. The staff analysis became public after an open records request, Southerland said.  In other parts of the country, like the arid West, the rates of unprotected waterways are closer to 80% or 90%, Southerland said.  When asked about the percentages of waterways across the country left unprotected, Wheeler questioned the figures.  ‚ÄúWe've never completely mapped all the waterways,‚Äù Wheeler said. ‚ÄúIt's just something that can't be quantified at this point in time. ‚Ä¶ We are mapping waters across the     country, but it had never been done before for regulatory purposes. So the numbers are just estimates.‚Äù  California has already sued the EPA over the change and states are reporting a loss of protections, in some cases, of most of their waterways.  ‚ÄúThe Clean Water Act is a strong law. It's withstood the test of time, and it's been protecting our waters for 40 years, and now it's not,‚Äù said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club‚Äôs Arizona chapter.  In Arizona, the Obama-era rule would have made ‚Äúevery wash in the state of Arizona jurisdictional because under that rule, you were categorically jurisdictional if you had a bed, bank and a high watermark,‚Äù said Cynthia Campbell, Water Resources Management Advisor for the city of Phoenix.  ‚ÄúBut the problem is that if you've ever been to Arizona, if you've ever seen our landscape, our landscape is covered with washes and alluvial flows off of our mountain ranges, that can be very small or very large,"" she said.   Trying to sort out whether washes are ephemeral or intermittent will be difficult, Campbell said, ""because we're in a 20-year drought.‚Äù  The new rule could eliminate federal protections for 85% to 90% of Arizona's waterways, Campbell said.  If the state doesn‚Äôt fill in the space left by the federal pullback, developers and mining companies wouldn‚Äôt need to apply for certain permits in the future, in one instance potentially easing the way for developers who plan to build huge housing developments near the imperiled San Pedro River.  After the change, the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality began holding a series of meetings on how to fill the gaps with new state regulations.  Water woes in New England  The effects of the new water rule will also be felt in the Northeast, said Heather Govern, vice president and director of the clean air and water program of Conservation Law Foundation. She sees the rule as another battle in the war between environmentalists and those defending industrial interests.   In Massachusetts, an aerial survey in 2000 found 30,000 potential vernal pools, ephemeral wetlands that are dry most of the year and only appear with spring rains. Those pools burst with life, much of it tied exclusively to these small shallow pools and are a vital part of the forest food web.  In Massachusetts and New England, the Trump move was welcomed by developers, Govern said.     ‚ÄúAnyone building on land abutting wetlands or streams or wanting to build on wetlands and streams (benefitted),‚Äù Govern said.  Hundreds of scientists conducted over 1,000 research projects to form the scientific basis of the 2015 Clean Water Rule, said Curtis Spalding, a Brown University professor and a former EPA regional administrator. Previously, the burden was on the developer to show that a wetland had no connection to or impact on navigable waters.  ‚ÄúLarger projects tend to have some political support,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúState legislators, under the mistaken idea that somehow it is good for the economy to lose wetlands and compromise water quality will support them for short term gain, but a long term loss.‚Äù  Massachusetts Audubon and Conservation Law Foundation joined six other plaintiffs in suing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April over the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which the suit called an unreasonably narrow interpretation of the Clean Water Act.  It‚Äôs hard enough to keep development from occurring in a wetland that is invisible for all but a few months of the year, but removing Clean Water Act protections made the job much harder, Govern said. Over the past couple of decades the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has suffered cutbacks to staffing.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of resources,‚Äù said Govern. Even though Massachusetts has strong clean water laws of its own, there are streams and water bodies that have traditionally fallen under federal protection. Without that protection, ""it falls back onto the state.""  The case for water: a life force  A mile of stream winds through part of Donna Schwab‚Äôs 55-acre property in North Lewisburg, Ohio, located nearly 40 miles northwest of Columbus.  Farmers channeled parts of the stream into a straight ditch decades ago. It's slowly recovering, beginning to wind through portions of the property.  ‚ÄúIt was a question of whether it would be covered by the ephemeral streams of the WOTUS rule,‚Äù said Anthony Sasson, a research associate at Midwest Biodiversity Institute, which monitors aquatic resources across Ohio and the Midwest.  Biologists found the stream has value. Trees line the banks, providing shade again. Fish swim in pools along sections of the stream while the creek bed dries out in other portions. But the water, and life with it, exist just below the surface.  The stream, and how it‚Äôs defined, has now become a political and environmental issue under the revised WOTUS rule.   In Ohio, there are an estimated 36,000 miles of ephemeral streams like Schwab's unnamed one that are not protected under the Trump administration‚Äôs rule.     Ohio EPA has since moved to cover ephemeral streams and Sasson said the state's rule was an improvement over the federal rule.  Ohio land restorationist stays positive despite environmental protection roll backs  In Ohio, there are an estimated 36,000 miles of ephemeral streams which are not protected under the Trump administration‚Äôs interpretation of the law.  Courtney Hergesheimer, The Columbus Dispatch  Critics of the regulations, including developers and coal mine operators, argue that some of the streams are so small that a person can jump from bank to bank or don‚Äôt have water in them all year. They contend the streams aren‚Äôt worth protecting and only impede farm operations and other economic development.  ‚Äú(It has) very little effect on water quality and we don‚Äôt feel we should have to deal with it,‚Äù said Mike Cope, president of the Ohio Coal Association.  For decades, Ohio EPA sent teams of biologists out to water basins throughout the state to take a census of the wildlife. Certain fish and bugs cannot exist when pollution is present. The wildlife assessment allows biologists to take the pulse of the stream and measure its health.  The tributaries, although small, feed into larger bodies of water.  ‚ÄúIf you take a heart in a human body, it's an important organ, right? But it can't function alone without all the tributaries, the veins and blood vessels that bring the blood to and from it,‚Äù said Schwab who retired from work as a wildlife biologist from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources.  Schwab's stream has never been assessed by state biologists, but when an independent group from Midwest Biodiversity Institute came to sample water quality they found the conservation work paid off. There were 17 species of fish and 43 species of insects.  Conservation experts say everything is connected. Wetlands and streams provide food and habitat for fish and wildlife and act to curb floods and erosion said Ma≈æeika Sullivan, director of the Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at Ohio State University.  ""But they also provide natural products for human use,"" he said, ""drinking water is the most important among them.""   There are already examples that can illustrate the potential damage.  ""One of the most well-known examples of connectivity, and across broad spatial scales is the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. This is largely attributed to nitrogen and phosphorus coming from fertilizer runoff from Midwestern fields, enters smaller     streams,"" Sullivan said.  ""They make their way to larger streams, they make their way to the Mississippi River, and then eventually down into the Gulf of Mexico, hundreds of miles away, right? This has led to harmful algal blooms, biological deserts. And this is a great example of how these cumulative changes across broad spatial scales can affect downstream water quality.""  Schwab remains hopeful.  ""Maybe more people become aware. And then they do their civic duty and vote and talk to their leaders. Then maybe things get changed better down the road,"" she said. ""It still comes down to water quality and the water we drink. We all live downstream, right?""

The Duke of Cambridge gave his first Ted Talk on Saturday as a guest speaker during Ted's virtual Countdown Global Launch, an initiative to ""champion and accelerate solutions to the climate crisis.""  Akin to the theme of the event, he spoke about how fast our Earth was changing due to climate change and urged leaders to take action . The Duke of Cambridge appeared during the fourth hour of the six-hour event where he appeared wearing a blue shirt paired with jeans and was seated by a large oak tree. Prince William opened his talk by sharing the long history of his royal family.  ""I'm simply the latest in a line that can be traced back generations. This oak tree is close to Windsor Castle, which has been home to my family for over 900 years. Thirty- nine monarchs have lived here and enjoyed these beautiful surroundings,"" Prince William said before expressing his awe at how some of the trees sprouted during William the Conqueror's reign in 1066.  The Duke marveled at how much the world has been able to accomplish through innovation, like air travel and vaccines, but also noted that humankind's impact on the globe is speeding up climate change.  ""Over my grandmother's lifetime, the last 90 years or so, our impact has accelerated so fast that our climate, oceans, air, nature and all that depends on them are in peril. This oak has stood here for centuries, but never has it faced a decade like this,"" Prince William said.  More: Prince William, David Attenborough launch environmental award, the Earthshot prize  He said given the scientific evidence, it is imperative that we make change during this decade because if we don't, ""the damage that we have done will be irreversible"" and its effects won't only harm future generations, but it will have an affect on us now.     ""This damage will not be felt equally by everyone. It is the most vulnerable, those with the fewest resources and those who have done the least to cause climate change who will be impacted the most,"" he said.   Prince William noted that if we act now, our lives will all be better and healthier by 2030.  The Duke of Cambridge also pointed to how world leaders have have quickly come together and mobilized to handle the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to illustrate that we can do the same when it comes to climate change.  ""We built hospitals overnight, repurposed factories, poured billions into the search for a vaccine and better treatments,"" he said.   Prince William's talk comes on the heels of his Earthshot Prize launch Thursday, which is a ¬£50 million (about $65 million) prize awarded to individuals, teams, collaborators, scientists, activists and governments to name a few that come up with evidence-based solutions for five ""Earthshots.""

USA-2020-19.txt,"Recent global warming has wiped out 6,500 years of cooling, study says    says/5356154002  Doyle Rice | USA TODAY  Watch Video: How adult Americans think about climate change.  Over the past 150 years, human-caused global warming has erased the natural global cooling that occurred over the previous 6,500 years, according to a study published Tuesday.  Scientists reconstructed the global average temperature over the past 12,000 years to reach their conclusion. They studied ""paleoclimatic"" sources from around the world ‚Äì such as lake deposits, marine sediments, peat and glacier ice ‚Äì to infer past temperature changes.  ""Before global warming, there was global cooling,"" study lead author Darrell Kaufman, a paleoclimatologist at Northern Arizona University, said in a statement.   ""Previous work has shown convincingly that the world naturally and slowly cooled for at least 1,000 years prior to the middle of the 19th century, when the global average temperature reversed course along with the build-up of greenhouse gases.""  ""This study, based on a major new compilation of previously published paleoclimate data, combined with new statistical analyses, shows more confidently than ever that the millennial-scale global cooling began approximately 6,500 years ago,"" he said.  The rate of cooling that followed the peak warmth was subtle, only around 0.1 degree Celsius per 1,000 years, according to assistant research professor and study co-author Michael Erb, also of Northern Arizona University, who analyzed the temperature reconstructions.  The cooling seems to be driven by slow cycles in the Earth's orbit around the sun, which reduced the amount of summer sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere, culminating in the ""Little Ice Age"" of recent centuries, Erb said.   Since the mid-19th century, global warming has climbed about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), suggesting that the global average temperature of the last decade (2010-2019) was warmer than any time during the past 12,000 years.  ""It's possible,"" Kaufman said, ""that the last time the sustained average global temperature was 1 degree Celsius above the 19th century was prior to the last Ice Age, back around 125,000 years ago when sea level was around 20 feet higher than today.""     The study is important because by tracking global temperatures over the past 12,000 years, researchers can better forecast future climate changes, scientists say.  ""Our future climate will largely depend on the influence of human factors, especially the build-up of greenhouse gases,"" said study co-author Cody Routson, also an assistant research professor at Northern Arizona University.  ""However, future climate will also be influenced by natural factors, and it will be complicated by the natural variability within the climate system. Future projections of climate change will be improved by better accounting for both anthropogenic (human- caused) and natural factors.""  The study was published in Nature Research's Scientific Data, a peer-reviewed journal.   2020-07-01T17:56:01Z      "

""Greenhouse gas concentrations ‚Äì which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years ‚Äì have continued to rise."" Record heat, ice loss, wildfires, floods and droughts continue to worsen.  Climate change has not stopped because of COVID-19, a United Nations report says.  ""Greenhouse gas concentrations ‚Äì which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years ‚Äì have continued to rise,"" said World Meteorological Organization Secretary- General Petteri Taalas, in a statement.   Emissions are heading in the direction of pre-pandemic levels following a temporary decline caused by the lockdown and economic slowdown, the report released Wednesday said. The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal produce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are responsible for global warming.   ‚ÄúThis has been an unprecedented year for people and the planet. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives worldwide. At the same time, the heating of our planet and climate disruption have continued apace,‚Äù said United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres in a foreword to the report.  In more grim news, the report also said the world is getting closer to passing a temperature limit set by global leaders five years ago and may exceed it in the next decade or so.   In the next five years, the world has nearly a 1-in-4 chance of experiencing a year that‚Äôs hot enough to put the global temperature at 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial times, the report said.  That 1.5 degrees Celsius is the more stringent of two limits set in 2015 by world leaders in the Paris climate change agreement.     The warming that has already occurred has ‚Äúincreased the odds of extreme events that are unprecedented in our historical experience,‚Äù Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh said.   More pandemics? Scientists are seeing an 'acceleration of pandemics.' They are looking at climate change.  Taalas said ""large swaths of Siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heat wave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change. And now 2016‚Äì2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record.   ""This report shows that while many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,‚Äù Taalas said.

""Some communities have their drinking water poisoned by toxic substances. Others wrestle with ash and debris washed into reservoirs and lakes.""  POLITICAL CLIMATE  A stealth campaign for coal. When I spent several years reporting on coal, I got to know a lot of mines. My favorite named coal mine, by far, was Air Quality, an Indiana operation. I found it darkly ironic for obvious reasons, but now the tables have turned and the U.S. coal industry itself is suffocating amid tough market forces. Just how bad is it out there for coal? WyoFile and Wyoming Public Radio teamed up to dig into the Cowboy State's decision to funnel taxpayer money into a dark money nonprofit group that travels the country in a desperate attempt to lobby for coal. State officials argue they're saving the state's tax base by advocating for its major industry, but others question the ethics of the move.  Roll back for what. Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a long-standing policy mandating sources of hazardous air emissions to have efficient pollution control technology for the length of their operations. Reuters reports that environmental groups claim the changes will allow more pollution, while the EPA is arguing it reduces costly regulations for industries that are meeting their environmental goals. Under the new standard, many large polluters will likely be reclassified, meaning they won't have to remove as many toxins from their emissions.  More battles in Oklahoma. Only days after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling this summer found that much of eastern Oklahoma was still Indian Country, the Sooner State's governor petitioned the EPA to let the state control environmental oversight in Indian Country. The EPA granted his request. The governor said the decision brought regulatory certainty to Native Americans, but tribes were quick to lambast the decision, Indian Country Today writes.  THE FUTURE OF FOSSIL FUELS  California frac(k)as. California has a reputation as a progressive bastion where environmental regulations are so stringent that developers are pushed right on out of the state. Well, there are several industrial habits even California can't kick, one of them being oil. Los Angeles is in many ways an oil town, and the state is still one of the country's largest producers. But, liberal Democrats are now pushing for a full ban on several types of fracking that cause spills and other environmental woes, Janet Wilson reports for The Desert Sun.  Exxon knew, part 2. In the same week where it was knocked off its perch as America's largest oil company by market cap, Exxon Mobil was the target of a damning new report from Bloomberg. According to internal documents, the company ""had plans to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the     entire nation of Greece."" Exxon argued that its figures were only preliminary and had changed substantially since the pandemic, but it's a telling view into a company that has done even less than its competitors to address its greenhouse gas emissions.  The War(saw) on coal. The transition away from coal, which has been a globally dominant fuel source for more than a century, has been painful in many regions where a post-mining economy is yet to materialize. This fact has pitted organized labor against the environmental movement, especially in coal strongholds such as Eastern Europe. In a big ‚Äî if not slow and somewhat symbolic ‚Äî move, coal-loving Poland recently struck a deal with its unions to phase out coal mining by 2049, Climate Home News reports.

USA-2020-23.txt,"Climate change: Democratic alarmism leads to failing policies    column/5434178002  Climate change needs to be addressed but the Democrats' plan is alarmist and not going to save the planet. We need to weigh costs and benefits of climate action.  Bjorn Lomborg | Opinion contributor Over the past few decades, climate change has been cast in ever more apocalyptic terms. A new global survey shows that almost half the world‚Äôs population and about 4 of 10 Americans believe global warming will likely lead to the extinction of the human race.   Incessantly claiming the end of the world is near is simply unbridled alarmism and untethered to the actual research presented by the UN Climate Panel. However, such scare scenarios are ideal for politicians; they can promise to save the world, and they can leave the substantial bill to future election cycles.  Democrats' action plan for climate change   In this context, House Democrats have joined a long list of prominent global politicians across the last decades who promise to fix global warming, outlined in a 538 page Congressional Action Plan. Among many other proposals, it promises no new gasoline cars by 2035,ending fossil fuels in the power sector by 2040, and reducing the net emissions from the U.S. to zero by 2050. Appropriately, speaker Nancy Pelosi capped her presentation by promising the plan would be ‚Äúsaving the planet.‚Äù  It might seem odd to be discussing climate change in the midst of a global pandemic. However, the Democrats point out that climate, not corona or the recession, is the ‚Äúessential crisis of our time‚Äù as it threatens devastating health and economic consequences.  Yes, climate change is a real challenge that we need to tackle smartly. But suggesting it is an ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù to human existence, as Joe Biden frequently claims, causes us to panic and make poor decisions. Instead, we need to weigh costs and benefits of climate action.  When the Democrats claim that climate change is worsening the impacts of extreme storms, droughts, and flooding, they are mostly wrong. Peer-reviewed research clearly shows that neither landfalling hurricanes nor strong landfalling hurricanes in the U.S. have become more frequent since 1900. The 2017 National Climate Assessment even     states that ‚Äúdrought has decreased over much of the continental United States.‚Äù It also concludes that flooding, which has increased in some places and decreased elsewhere, cannot be connected to climate change.  While costs from disasters are increasing, this is overwhelmingly because more people with more valuables live closer to harm‚Äôs way. For instance, the coastal population in Florida has increased 67-fold since 1900, with each family living in more expensive houses. A hurricane hitting Florida today will, therefore, create much more financial damage than a similar hurricane 120 years ago. Thus, helping future generations avoid costly hurricane damage is about better building codes, restricting siting in vulnerable areas, and providing residents with more information.  COLUMN: Black health matters. COVID has shown that improving care must be a national priority.  This doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt real benefits to cutting emissions, but they are dramatically lower than what the Democrats suggest. The UN Climate Panel shows that the total negative impact of climate change in half a century will be equivalent to a reduction in annual incomes of between 0.2 and 2%. As it expects the average person in 50 years to be 363% richer than today, that means with global warming the average person will grow 356% richer. That is a problem, but not the end of the world.  The costs of cutting emissions  Unfortunately and glaringly, the Democratic plan contains no cost estimates, despite its intention to fundamentally restructure the growth engine of the U.S. Only one nation ‚Äî New Zealand ‚Äî has been bold enough to request an independent cost estimate of cutting emissions to zero by 2050. The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research found that the optimistic cost would reduce GDP by a whopping 16% each year by 2050.Translated to the projected U.S. GDP in 2050, this would imply a cost of at least $5 trillion in today‚Äôs money. Not just once, but every year. That is more than the entire pre-Covid-19 annual federal spending of $4.5 trillion.   Needless to say, spending 16% or more to avoid part of a 2% problem is a bad deal. But Democrats are not alone. Many countries have made spectacular promises to cut emissions and failed. The UN, in a surprisingly honest review, says that despite all the good intentions from the Obama administration and other countries, actual global emissions look similar to a hypothetical world which had made no climate policies since 2005.  And cutting emissions is hard. The corona epidemic has created a dramatic recession, yet it will likely reduce U.S. 2020 emissions by just 7 to 11%. To get to zero would require ten or more lock-downs every year. This will be phenomenally expensive and politically impossible.     That is why Democrats ‚Äî and all of us ‚Äî should focus more on solutions that will actually be effective and realistic. Currently, cutting emissions is costly and involves subsidizing inefficient solar, wind, and electric cars. Rich countries can afford a little, though none can afford to dramatically switch.  Coronavirus in Florida: Florida's COVID-19 data is unreliable, confusing and hazardous to our health  But if we invest much more into green research and development, we can innovate the price of future green energy below fossil fuels. Then everyone will switch.  Claiming climate change is our biggest challenge is a false alarm. Proposing unrealistic and extremely expensive policies is unhelpful. The Democrats are correct to emphasize we need climate policies, but the policies must be smart.  False Alarm ‚Äî How Climate Change Panic Costs Us Trillions, Hurts the Poor, and Fails to Fix the Planet.""      "
USA-2020-24.txt,"Homes made of sandbags, barbed wire could offer cheaper, safer shelter as climate crisis worsens   worsens/5924773002  Coral Murphy | USA TODAY Thousands of people in Puerto Rico are still living under blue tarps three years after Hurricane Maria struck the island, and more than 30,000 families have asked the government for assistance after the storm destroyed or damaged their homes, with not everyone eligible to receive help.   This is why Paula Paoli and Owen Ingley are in Las Mar√≠as, Puerto Rico, and hope to introduce a new construction technique that helps homeowners avoid the destruction of houses in the future.  The couple want to expand the use of biodegradable domes to help people who have lost their homes replace them with structures that have the resiliency to withstand weather events that devastate Puerto Rico with increasing frequency.  These ""SuperAdobe"" structures proposed by Paoli and Ingley use sandbags, barbed wire and on-site earth as its essential components, and the bags are piled on top of another, plastered and painted.   This type of construction has evolved from military bunker structures and allows for rapid building, with some homes taking just over 24 hours to assemble. According to Ingley, the rapid turnaround, as well as the inexpensive materials, make SuperAdobe housing a cost-effective solution to provide temporary or permanent housing to people who lose their homes after a natural disaster.   Open enrollment 2021: You may be able to carryover unused FSA funds of up to $550  A dark Black Friday:Big shopping day slumps, but earlier deals, Cyber Monday come to the rescue  ‚ÄúAn emergency relief structure could be built for as cheap as $1,500 to $2,000 in materials,‚Äù Ingley says. ""A tiny, more permanent home could be built between the range of $8,000 to $15,000.""   Typical shipping container homes and tiny houses can cost from $10,000 to $180,000 to build, according to HomeAdvisor.      The couple founded Plenitud, a nonprofit educational farm and community in the western part of the island. They building these homes as emergency relief and promote SuperAdobe as a alternative to other kinds of new homes in case other category 5 hurricanes strike. To accomplish this, Ingley‚Äôs school, CalEarth, is requesting official recognition of SuperAdobe as a safe and sustainable building material by the International Code Council.  Climate change tests SuperAdobe  It is up to some nonprofits to further the construction of this type of housing on the island, since it is not an officially approved repair or reconstruction method for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.   After several years of putting the constructions through various stress tests ‚Äì rain, wind, fire, sleet, snow ‚Äì the SuperAdobe construction method is finally coming up to a final assessment by the International Code Council, a body of construction experts and engineers that certifies acceptable methods for construction.  Across Plenitud's farm, visitors can spot the SuperAdobe domes, which vary in size and color.   At first glance, a SuperAdobe house resembles an igloo. According to Ingley, earthbag buildings are resistant to the heavy winds and flooding of a hurricane, as well as the movements of an earthquake. The materials also make this type of building environmentally friendly.  SuberAdobe was founded on the idea that builders can use dirt and other materials found onsite, making this type of building environmentally sustainable.   Hurricane Maria challenge  ""When Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, we built three pilot demonstration homes and they all sustained no damage during the hurricane,"" says Ingley, co-founder of Plenitud. Those SuperAdobe houses were in Las Mar√≠as, Arecibo and Maunabo, where dozens of conventionally constructed homes were destroyed.   SuperAdobe home materials offer flexibility and strength, allowing the building to shift without cracking or breaking. Ingley also builds each roof with an arch shape, since it  resists heavy wind better than flat ones.   In Puerto Rico, 28,706 families asked the government for assistance to repair their homes after Maria‚Äôs destruction, but only 6,146 homes were eligible under Puerto Rico‚Äôs Repair, Reconstruction, or Relocation program as of last June. Ineligible individuals either didn't meet the program's low income threshold or did not have the official deed to their property.      FEMA was granting up to $60,000 for home repairs or $150,000 to rebuild or relocate after Maria hit Puerto Rico. With a full grant and a conservative budget, an individual could build more than 18 permanent SuperAdobe homes.   Ingley studied bioconstruction at the California Institute of Earth and Architecture, a nonprofit organization focused on the development and research of earth architecture. The institute, also known as CalEarth, is at the forefront of popularizing SuperAdobe construction across the country.  SuperAdobe is closer than we think   SuperAdobe construction is permissible only through specialization permits granted by a county building department, usually approved for emergency or research purposes. For earthbag-building to be allowed without a special permit, it must be approved by the International Code Council. This is because building departments need a way to inspect, and having ICC standardization allows inspectors to obtain building plans to know what works and what doesn't when it comes to earthbag building.   Before the ICC approves a specific building material, it must go through fire, rain, sleet, snow and wind-resistance tests, among others.  For the past four years, CalEarth has been working with the ICC to have earthbag building standardized among ICC codes. According to CalEarth‚Äôs president, Dastan Khalili, SuperAdobe could be included in ICC codes in the next six to 12 months.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the last phases of testing with the ICC right now,‚Äù Khalili said. ‚ÄúWith many people homeless and living in inadequate housing, the solution is right under their feet.‚Äù   Once adopted into the International Residential Code, each code must be specifically adopted by a jurisdiction to become a part of its building regulations, with room for modifications.   This year, Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Sally caused devastation in Puerto Rico and states in the Gulf Coast, with some of them still recovering from past storms. In Puerto Rico, former Housing Secretary Fernando Gil said in September 2019 that an overall estimated 20,000 to 25,000 ‚Äùblue roofs‚Ä≥ remained across the island , referring to the tarps stretched over damaged buildings.   As climate change worsens, Plenitud‚Äôs Ingley believes that SuperAdobe housing can provide a solution for halting the damage created by natural disasters.   ‚ÄúIt's a building technique that's attractive for considering the problem of how we can have affordable housing that's resistant to global climate change,‚Äù Ingley said.

USA-2020-25.txt,"Dual disasters: How is climate change worsening wildfires and hurricanes?    extreme/5817070002  Doyle Rice | USA TODAY  Show Caption  We're barely over halfway through the nation's hurricane and wildfire seasons, and both have already been devastating and record-breaking.  This extraordinarily busy Atlantic hurricane season ‚Äì like the catastrophic wildfire season on the West Coast ‚Äì has focused attention on the role of climate change.  Yet a question arises: How could climate change worsen both the wildfire and hurricane seasons? Aren't they ""opposite"" weather phenomena?  No, said J. Marshall Shepherd, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Georgia.   ""We've always known that climate change would make extremes more extreme on all sides of the ledger. It's counterintuitive to some people that global warming can amplify drought and heavy rain, but it's simply physics,"" he said.  Hurricane Sally: Far from finished, storm leaves 600,000 without power across Deep South as flooding, rains roll north  Penn State University meteorologist Michael Mann, speaking about whether wildfires and hurricanes are opposites, said ""actually, in a sense, they‚Äôre not.   Mann said that as we continue to warm the planet ‚Äì heating and drying out the western U.S. and warming the tropical Atlantic Ocean ‚Äì we are amplifying both of these phenomena as well.  ""So when we happen to get a La Ni√±a event, as this year, natural variability reinforces the impact that climate change is playing and we get dual disasters playing out in the U.S., as we are seeing right now,"" Mann told USA TODAY.  The La Ni√±a climate pattern is a natural cycle marked by cooler-than-average ocean water in the central Pacific Ocean. It's one of the main drivers of weather in the U.S. and around the world, especially during the late fall, winter and early spring.   Mann explained how the natural La Ni√±a climate cycle is also having an impact:     ""La Ni√±a years tend to be associated with a Northern Hemisphere jet-stream pattern that favors both dry, warm conditions out West, and reduced vertical wind shear in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean. The former favors wildfires out West, the latter favors hurricanes back East.""  Federal government forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced La Ni√±a's formation last week. It's expected to exacerbate both the hurricane and wildfire seasons.  Hurricane Sally: Storm makes landfall causing 'catastrophic flooding'  Hurricane Sally's winds are battering Pensacola, Florida, and its slow pace means the rains will bring ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding.""  In the West, climate scientists say rising heat and worsening droughts in California consistent with climate change have expanded what had been California's autumn wildfire season to year-round, sparking bigger, deadlier and more frequent fires like the ones we've seen this year.  The role that climate change played in wildfires in California seeped into the political realm earlier this week. Though government officials and scientists identified climate change as the primary culprit behind the intense wildfires, President Donald Trump insisted during a briefing in Northern California on Monday that ""forest management"" is more to blame.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told him forest management is an issue, but ""climate change is real, and that is exacerbating this.""  Trump, Calif. officials clash over climate change  At a wildfires briefing in California Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials urged President Donald Trump to accept that ""climate change is real."" Trump replied: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll start getting cooler. You just watch.‚Äù (Sept. 14)  More: Wildfires burned millions of acres across the West. See what that looks like.  And as for hurricanes, scientists also say global warming is making the strongest of them, those with wind speeds of 110 mph or more, even stronger. Also, warmer air holds more moisture, making storms rainier, and rising seas from global warming make storm surges higher and more damaging.  During Hurricane Sally, a peak storm tide of 5.6 feet occurred Wednesday morning in Pensacola, Florida ‚Äì the city's third-highest level on record.     In addition, scientists have been seeing tropical storms and hurricanes slow down once they hit the United States by about 17% since 1900, and that gives them the opportunity to unload more rain over one place, as 2017‚Äôs Hurricane Harvey did in Houston ‚Äì and what's happening now with Hurricane Sally in the Southeast U.S.  Contributing: David Jackson, USA TODAY; The Associated Press      "
USA-2020-26.txt,"Global warming good news? Some Antarctic penguins enjoy diminishing sea ice    ice/3253321001  Doyle Rice | USA TODAY  The species ""could be a rare global warming winner."" Ad√©lie penguins may experience a population boom in the years to come. Researchers strapped GPS trackers and video cameras to 175 penguins to track the penguins' behavior.  The lack of sea ice around parts of Antarctica because of global warming may be good news for one species of penguin, a new study suggests.  Surprisingly, Adelie penguins appear to prefer reduced sea-ice conditions, meaning that the species ""could be a rare global warming winner,"" according to a statement.   ""It turns out that these penguins are happier with less sea ice,"" said lead researcher Yuuki Watanabe from Japan's National Institute of Polar Research. ""This may seem counterintuitive, but the underlying mechanism is actually quite simple.""  He explained that in ice-free conditions, penguins are able to travel more by swimming than by walking.  ""For penguins, swimming is a whopping four times faster than walking,"" he said. ""They may be sleek in the water but are pretty slow waddlers over land.""  Researchers from Japan's National Institute of Polar Research strapped GPS trackers and video cameras to 175 penguins to track the penguins' behavior over several years.   In seasons with heavy sea ice, penguins tired out as they waddled to find food. But when there was less sea ice, the penguins were able dive anywhere they want, often just entering the water right by their nests, Watanabe said.   Extreme heat: Unsuitable for 'human life to flourish': Up to 3B will live in extreme heat by 2070, study warns  This is more energy- and time-efficient and it expands their foraging range, the study suggests. In fact, the researchers found that the penguins may have expended an average of 15% to 33% less energy per trip compared with ice-covered seasons, putting that saved energy into growth and reproduction.      Since climate models predict that the Antarctic will rapidly lose sea ice as the 21st century progresses, the results suggest that Ad√©lie penguins may experience a population boom in the years to come.  UN climate report: Planet is 'way off track' in dealing with climate change, UN report says  But the new research noted that, according to previous studies, other Ad√©lie penguin populations that reside in warmer, sea-bordering regions (about 30% of the species) do not fare as well when sea ice diminishes.   The new study was published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.       "
USA-2020-27.txt,"Climate Point: Not to be alarmist, but is your house in a flood zone?    Mark Olalde .  Let's start with a new investigative project from USA Today, in partnership with nonprofit First Street Foundation, that digs into the question of all-important flood maps and the insurance that relies on them. It turns out, many maps haven't been updated in years, leaving 6 million homes and commercial properties potentially unprepared for the floods that are only worsening as weather becomes increasingly severe.  Take a look to see how your community compares. And now, let's get to some other important reporting...  MUST-READ STORIES  The Democrats have a plan. Say what you will about how Democrats' talk on climate change compares to their action, but they finally published their long-awaited plan to address the issue and to phase out new emissions by 2050, The Guardian reports. Dave Roberts of Vox took a deep dive into what the plan means, comparing it to Republicans' refusal to seriously address the issue.  The dominoes are falling. As the coronavirus-fueled economic slowdown exposed the over-leveraged nature of shale gas, it became inevitable that bankruptcies would follow. Now a major player, Chesapeake Energy, has fallen, which could be a harbinger for what faces the rest of the industry. Its downfall could've been tied in part to greed ‚Äî CNBC uncovers its hidden wine cave, beekeepers and botox treatments ‚Äî but its industry is also just downright unprofitable. Forbes has those details.  We appear to be close to enforcing laws. The EPA announced in late March that it would halt large swathes of its enforcement during the coronavirus pandemic. This sparked an immediate outcry but proved to be just a preview of the federal deregulatory agenda the Trump administration laid out during the public health crisis. Bloomberg reports that the EPA recently announced it will return to doing its job at the beginning of September in response to the country reopening.  The resource curse strikes again. In a horrifying new story, Bloomberg takes us into the Niger Delta, specifically 27,000 acres that have been turned into a toxic muck by decades of oil spills caused by Shell, Chevron and others. Nigeria is dependent on the industry but faces cleanup that would take many billions of dollars that aren't there.     POLITICAL CLIMATE  Missed potential. The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ‚Äî Trump's NAFTA ‚Äî went into effect on Wednesday, and it's not a win for the environment, Martha Pskowski writes in DeSmogBlog. The new deal guarantees the ""free flow of energy"" across borders, strengthens markets for natural gas, lifts tariffs on tar sands and ""misses an opportunity to push both the U.S. and Mexico to act on the climate crisis.""  The Emerald Isle goes green. Ireland recently came to an agreement for a new, three-party coalition that comes with an ""extremely ambitious"" climate plan to push it to the forefront of the European Union. The coalition's negotiations landed on two key environmental priorities: pass a law within 100 days to set a net-zero emissions target by 2050 and go green via the economic recovery post-coronavirus. Climate Home News has the story.  Tree politics. Here in the Southwestern desert, political haggling is underway over the response to climate change. California is considering listing the gangly-but-beloved Joshua tree ‚Äî as I describe it in this scoop for The Desert Sun ‚Äî as endangered, which could make it the first species protected under state law with climate change as the main threat.

RENEWABLES ARE HAVING A WEEK  Fiduciary doesn't mean fossil fuel. S&P Global Market Intelligence reports on a new study out this week that analyzed more than 2,500 coal-fired power plants and found renewable energy is simply cheaper. For nearly 40% of global coal capacity that's currently operational, it's cheaper not just to operate solar or wind power but to actually build brand new panels and turbines from the ground up.  Under African skies. One in two people who will be born over the next decade will be born in Africa. Bringing widespread electricity access to the continent will have wide- ranging effects, the executive director of the International Energy Agency and the minister of petroleum and energy for Senegal write in The Africa Report. Studies have shown that the continent has vast, largely untapped renewable energy potential, which could be used to lift African nations out of poverty while protecting health and the environment.  George Washington is done with hydrocarbons. At the center of the Western world, in downtown Washington, D.C., George Washington University announced this week that it will divest its endowment from fossil fuels. The politically important institution is now the latest university to do so, WTOP reports, following the likes of the University of California system.

Dozens of little-known California oil spills have earned companies millions of dollars, an investigation by Janet Wilson of The Desert Sun and Lylla Younes of ProPublica has found. In 2019, California banned inland oil spills known as ""surface expressions,"" but there are no explicit deadlines for stopping them and restoring the sites. When the spills break out, nothing stops producers from turning them into moneymakers ‚Äî companies can corral the spills with dirt berms, netting, pipes or drains, vacuum out the crude, refine it and sell it. One Chevron spill has been running since 2003, and is bigger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker disaster. In the last three years alone, the crude collected from it has generated an estimated $11.6 million, according to an analysis of data provided by the state.  Peak oil. It's a wonky phrase, but it signals a paradigm shift humanity: peak oil. Boiled down, it means the point at which the world is extracting and consuming the most oil that it ever will. After that, it's a downward slope into a new, hopefully greener, energy portfolio. BP, one of the world's oil supermajors, became the first such company to predict peak oil is upon us. Bloomberg reports that growth in demand for black gold either has already hit its zenith or nearly there.     What's at stake. InsideClimate News is in the midst of a series that analyzes how key Senate races around the country will impact the environment. Recently, reporter James Bruggers dug into the track record of the GOP's longest-serving Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. While his opponent is a centrist Democrat who hasn't endorsed the Green New Deal, McConnell has been a powerful force in halting momentum on climate action and opposes steps like sticking with the Paris Agreement.  Why is California on fire? There aren't many scientific fields more contentious than fire research, and that's the case as California obliterates its record for most acres burned in a single year in recorded history. In the Sierra Nevada, there are easily more than 100 million trees killed by bark beetle infestations and drought, adding 2,000 tons of fuel per acre in some places. But is the cause of fires ranging through these mountains as simple as too many dead trees? Joshua Yeager of the Visalia Times-Delta and I dug into this question to sort fact from fiction and learn what's making California's fires so catastrophic. If a scientific discussion's too detailed, President Donald Trump also took on California wildfires this week, chiding state officials who tried to teach him about climate change. ""Well, I don't think science knows, actually,"" Trump said.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  The rollbacks roll on. My hometown paper, the Chicago Tribune, is out with a new deep dive into how the Trump administration's war on environmental regulations has allowed a coal-fired power plant that dumps by far the most arsenic, lead and mercury into Lake Michigan to continue operating. ""Buried in the fine print of the Republican administration‚Äôs new regulations is a stunning admission: Benefits for energy companies would come at the expense of more than 20 million Americans who drink water and eat fish from lakes and rivers polluted by coal plant discharges,"" the story says.  Putting climate deniers in charge. In another stunning, anti-science move, a longtime climate denier has been hired to an important post at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NPR reports.  Fighting in the Last Frontier. Up in Alaska, the Anchorage Daily News is out with an analysis of Ballot Measure 1, which will appear on the November ballot. It's an initiative targeting the highly subsidized oil industry and could significantly raise taxes on several supermajors operating in the state as well as force them to crack open their books, at least in part. The oil industry has unsurprisingly come out in opposition, claiming the measure would hurt the economy.  CLIMATE CHANGE MARCHES ON  Death from the skies. Climate change has myriad, sometimes surprising, impacts on the natural environment. The Las Cruces Sun-News reports that birds across New Mexico are mysteriously dying, and scientists have yet to figure out why. Perhaps they     had to migrate too early due to wildfires. Perhaps they're losing food as insects die off. There are more questions than answers right now.  More bad news at the poles. Doyle Rice at USA Today wrote this week that a new study has found that ""two of Antarctica's most important glaciers are breaking free from their restraints."" Eventually, these glaciers could contribute to 10 feet ‚Äî a staggering number ‚Äî of sea level rise.  Exxon knew, Exxon sued. Faced with such devastating climate change and sea level rise, cities and states continue to launch a barrage of lawsuits at oil companies.

USA-2020-29.txt,"How can Trump ignore climate crisis with twin hurricane-season storms barreling toward us?   column/3424879001  Climate change is wreaking havoc on people's lives right now. This month alone, not a section of the country has been spared a devastating event.  Monica Medina | Opinion contributor  The Louisiana coast is staring down the double barrel of a hurricane-season shotgun. It could be about to experience something that has never happened before ‚Äî two Atlantic hurricanes or tropical storms making landfall within hours and miles of one another.   For weeks, the nation‚Äôs weather forecasters, public and private, have been warning that this hurricane season was about to get ugly. Earlier this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a worse than average hurricane season. But two weeks ago NOAA‚Äôs National Hurricane Center revised its prediction upwards to as many as 25 named storms, of which up to six could be major hurricanes.  The forecast took on particular urgency due to the COVID-19 pandemic stretching health care and first-responder resources to the breaking point. Unfortunately, we are not ready for what is about to hit us.  Marco, the 13th named storm of the season , became a hurricane briefly on Sunday and was expected to make landfall in Louisiana late Monday. Laura, the 12th named storm, will likely blast ashore in the state Wednesday.   Worse and unexpected damage  Why is this happening? Because the Gulf of Mexico is unusually warm this year ‚Äî and so is the entire nation. And the weather pattern we are stuck in is supercharging every storm and extreme event.   Just look at the damage caused by Isaias, a relatively mild hurricane that came ashore Aug. 3 along the strom battered storm-battered North Carolina coast. But the damage was much worse, and unexpectedly so, up the coast all the way from the Eastern Shore of Maryland into New England.      And if it were just the hurricanes that would be bad enough, but this summer has been especially horrific. In August alone we have seen record heat throughout the Mountain West and desert Southwest, a ‚Äúderecho‚Äù or inland hurricane-like storm that blasted across the plains and into the Great Lakes region and left a path of destruction unlike anything in recent memory. Then there is freakish weather ‚Äî dry lightning ‚Äústorms‚Äù causing wildfires to burn out of control, creating one of the worst fire seasons in California‚Äôs history.  When I was the deputy administrator of NOAA under President Barack Obama, we believed that climate change was making our weather more severe, but we were cautious about directly connecting those dots. We looked at the data and realized that our storms were increasingly impactful and costly. We started publicizing the number of ‚Äúbillion dollar storms‚Äù and tweeting about severe weather to better warn the public in real time when their city or region was about to get walloped. But still the agency was cautious not to attribute any one storm or event to climate change.  What a difference 12 years makes.   Now the public can and does see for itself that climate change is altering our weather patterns and wreaking havoc on people‚Äôs lives today. Not a section of the country has been spared a climate change-related devastating event in just the month of August alone.   Wildfires, blackouts, anger: California shows us the future of climate change  And yet President Donald Trump is doing almost nothing to help his fellow Americans. Power outages stretch on for days and weeks during the hottest summer in memory ‚Äî either because of storm-damaged power lines, wildfires or brownouts due to surges in demand in the hottest parts of the country. State and local governments are cash strapped and can‚Äôt keep up, yet the president refuses to provide emergency funding relief to them.  Trump apathy on weather disasters  There are so many wildfires burning out of control that California does not have enough firefighters to keep people and property safe. When asked whether he would help, Trump blamed the state for not ‚Äúcleaning its floors.‚Äù He visited his New Jersey golf coursethis month just after Isaias hit the northeast but did not have time to survey the nearby damage. Vice President Mike Pence visited Iowa, but did he make time to actually see the cornfields flattened by the derecho? Nope.  Trump‚Äôs major ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù to severe weather response is to try to divert money from disaster relief to pay for legally dubious executive orders he made by fiat for COVID-19- response. No prior administration, Democratic or Republican, would have been so apathetic or nonresponsive when faced with this parade of weather disasters. The White House Situation Room would be abuzz of activity. The deputies of all the relevant     government agencies would meet there daily to discuss how to respond in real time to the crises of the day ‚Äî where to send reinforcements and where to send funds. The president and vice president would receive briefings numerous times a day and would visit the worst areas to see them for themselves.  Climate change: As Black Lives Matter puts injustice in spotlight, climate emergency risks new 'apartheid'  This was the way we dealt with it when the Gulf was hard hit by a disaster 10 years ago. I visited the region with Vice President Joe Biden during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill . I saw his compassion on display as he talked to its victims ‚Äî fishers and coastal small business owners who had been devastated. He gave speeches, but more important, he met face to face with the people who came to see him and spoke to them in rope lines and on the docks.   That‚Äôs the kind of president we need now. One who recognizes the crisis and feels the pain of those dealing with it.  The current president might think that with his Sharpie that he can ‚Äúscript‚Äù where severe storms go. But I doubt he can Sharpie his way out of this one-two hurricane punch.   It is what it is.

USA-2020-3.txt,"For Gen Z, climate change is a clear and present danger to our planet    The solutions to climate change that we learn about as young people have been inadequate or nonexistent.  Kiera O‚ÄôBrien and Naina Agrawal-Hardin | Opinion contributors  Show Caption  In America, climate change is often portrayed as a ticking time bomb of far-off devastation through videos of dying polar bears, melting ice caps and rising flood waters. Rarely do we confront the cost that climate change is already having on lives across the globe, especially in marginalized communities.  Yet, after events in our families‚Äô own backyards in the waterways of Ketchikan, Alaska, and the mountains of Tennessee, we each realized at a young age what our schools didn‚Äôt tell us: Climate change is an immediate threat.   Despite growing up more than 3,000 miles from each other, we have witnessed some of the same consequences of climate change, and we know that its urgency is not up for debate.  In Ketchikan, record-breaking temperatures and rainfall threaten the ecosystem Alaskans rely on for subsistence. In Tennessee, the risk of floods and even uncontrollable wildfires worsens every year.  In the world around us, climate change has altered the color of oceans, decimated homes and, recently in the west, set hundreds of thousands of acres on fire. The devastation of the climate crisis is clear. Yet the solutions to climate change that we learn about as young people have been inadequate or nonexistent.   Much of what we know about climate change we have learned by seeking out the information ourselves. We‚Äôve relied on the media, external organizations and conversations with our peers to find hope in the face of the existential threat we face.  We could tell you that the average global sea level has already risen 4 to 8 inches or that fires this year have burned more than 600,000 acres in 14 states in the West . But you don‚Äôt need us to reiterate the severity of the climate crisis. It's here, and it‚Äôs intensifying.     Instead, we‚Äôd like to share what we‚Äôre doing about it and how you can help.   As members of Gen Z, we value connecting with our peers to help identify and implement solutions. We cannot do this alone. We seek to learn from the gains that other social movements have made in the past. Engaging in intergenerational collaboration will enable us to find solutions to meet the scale of the crisis.   That‚Äôs why we are working with the Aspen Institute to launch K12 Climate Action: a collaboration among key education and environment leaders to equip young people with the tools they need to combat climate change. By leveraging the education sector, we can ensure that the next generation of activists is empowered to face the climate challenge head on.   As commissioners of K12 Climate Action, we plan to spend the next year learning from experts; hearing from students, parents, educators and school leaders; and bringing our experience to the table.  We will demand climate action in our schools to mitigate their environmental impact and build their resilience. We will also advocate for curricular and teaching innovation to give young people a comprehensive understanding of the changing climate and how they can contribute to solutions. Unlocking the power of our educational systems as a force for climate action is a vitally important part of the sweeping societal mobilization needed to build a sustainable future.   While we may have roots on opposite ends of the country, we‚Äôve seen first-hand how our communities have struggled to cope with the climate crisis. Our actions as a generation are rooted in our shared experiences with climate devastation. It does not matter if you live in Alaska or Tennessee, in the bayou of Louisiana or the forests of California: Young people know that our planet has reached a critical tipping point.  We are calling on our fellow young people to work with us on institutionalizing climate justice throughout our education sector.   We are in a learning and listening mode over the next year, and we want your input. As students, what do you wish you learned about climate change in school? What is your school doing that works well? Do you wish your district would use electric buses? Do you want solar powered lights in your classrooms? Sustainably sourced food in your cafeterias? Curriculum on the social impacts of climate change, in addition to the science behind it? We welcome your ideas on the most important solutions to explore.   Gen Z has grown up experiencing the impact climate change is having on our planet, but the two of us didn't learn about possible solutions; we had to discover them on our own. We are here to help other young people grow up with the sense of hope that we have worked so hard to find.  Working with people from all walks of life, we have the ability to turn the education sector into a force for both practical and visionary climate action.     Join us in creating a more sustainable, resilient and equitable world for everyone.      "
USA-2020-30.txt,"Climate Point: California moves to ban gas-powered cars. And, vote for fat bears    cars/3496820001  Mark Olalde .  How bad have President Donald Trump and the GOP been for the environment? MIT Technology Review reports that a new study found recent environmental rollbacks ""could pump the equivalent of 1.8 billion additional metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2035."" That's more than Russia's total fossil fuel emissions in a given year. And, these rollbacks won't just lead to an uptick in greenhouse gases, they'll also strip protections from endangered species, national monuments and ephemeral waterways.  I'm about to take you through some more heavy environment news, but before I do that, there's something even heavier I need to note ‚Äî bears...big bears...oh so very fat, chonky bears.  Every year, the staff of Katmai National Park and Preserve in Alaska host #FatBearWeek, a super important competition to vote on which bears have gotten the most majestically large. The voting begins on Sept. 30, and we're all waiting with bated breath to see if any bear can outdo last year's winner: 435 Holly.  Here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Red goes green, allegedly. Is China set to become more environmentally friendly than the U.S.? The AP reports that President Xi Jinping told the U.N. General Assembly that the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide (the most common greenhouse gas), will go carbon-neutral by 2060. China has a poor environmental record, but it's an important commitment that will mean a ton if it sticks.  California refuses to idle. Even if the federal government is standing by as climate change marches on, California's administration isn't ‚Äî although environmentalists would like it to move a whole lot faster. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that he is asking state agencies to write up rules to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine passenger vehicles in the state by 2035, an audacious goal. I've got the story for the USA Today Network. What does that mean for your car ownership if you live in California, and is this even legal? I've also got that story. Where greens are furious, though, is that     Newsom took a swing at one issue but largely ignored the state's oil industry. For The Desert Sun and ProPublica, Janet Wilson reports that the governor said he'll get rid of fracking in the state by 2024 and clean up spills, but his order doesn't have much teeth.  More pork from the feds. Joe Wertz of the Center for Public Integrity is out with a new investigation digging into the massive animal farms ‚Äî called concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs ‚Äî that feed our modern populations. With so many animals living and excreting in close quarters, they're a nasty source of air pollution and smells. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory efforts have been haphazard at best or purposefully lax at worst, depending on whom you ask.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  The notorious. The American judicial system lost one of its most iconic liberal voices this week when U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died at 87. E&E writes that her death leaves ""a chasm on the bench where once sat an environmental champion."" While it had been getting harder and harder for people affected by environmental harm to sue, she welcomed cases. ""There's no environmental voice on the right court now,"" said Jonathan Adler, director of the environmental law center at Case Western Reserve University.  Politics beat rock. The U.S. Geological Survey is supposed to be an apolitical slice of the government, a place where scientists go to be ""policy neutral but policy relevant."" But, under an administration that has gone to great lengths to politicize science, will its integrity survive? Wired is out with a new deep dive into the culture of the agency, its hard-to-read Trump appointee and a trend of climate change ""model-bashing.""  Remember when Facebook was cool? Facebook recently unveiled a new effort to counter false information about climate change shared on its platform. The results were less than impressive to many observers. Gizmodo ripped into the late and lackluster plan, which was centered on a page with climate change facts called the ""Climate Science Information Center."" ""What Facebook is doing is akin to the National Rifle Association‚Äôs argument that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" the publication says. Facebook recently suspended accounts of several environmental groups, ostensibly mistaking them in crackdowns on misinformation and intellectual property rights violations, The Guardian reports.  CALIFORNIA, CLIMATE AND COVID  Treeing to set a precedent. Joshua trees are as iconic as they are, well, weird- looking. They're a symbol of the Mojave Desert, but they're also threatened by a changing climate. Rising temperatures are shrinking their range and pushing it farther north and into higher elevations. In a potentially precedent-setting decision, a California commission advanced them through an important step in the endangered species listing process, the first time that's ever been done with climate change as the species' central threat. I've got the scoop for The Desert Sun.     Only read if you want your heart ripped out. It can be difficult to understand the existential impacts of climate change and to connect the dots from carbon emissions to impacts on you and me. Here's one example. Chico Enterprise-Record photographer Carin Dorghalli was covering the Bear Fire, which has torched more than 8,000 acres. It's one of dozens of fires around the Golden State that have been made worse by climate change bringing drought, heat and a potential increase in lightning strikes. But she became part of the story when she discovered that a business that was the heartbeat of a local community and owned by her father, a Syrian immigrant, burned to the ground in the fire. Take a read of her first-person story to see what extreme weather means at a personal level.  Remember COVID? A new report found that farmworkers in Monterey County, Calif., are three times as likely to be infected by the virus as others, The Californian reports. In an industry that's inextricably tied to the environment ‚Äî and whose workers suffer from environmental health and justice issues like pesticide drift ‚Äî there's still not enough being done to protect health and safety.  AND ANOTHER THING  Tick tock, tick tock. Part art installation, part giant clock, New York City's Metronome has kept time for 21 years. As a show of urgency this week ‚Äî which has been Climate Week around the world ‚Äî the time has been counting down, not up, Gothamist reports. The Metronome reads fewer than eight years until zero, which represents the amount of time the world has to reach carbon neutrality. Scientists predict that missing that deadline will result in greater than 1.5 degrees Celsius of global temperature increase compared to pre-industrial levels. Missing that mark will bring the hurt.  Scientists also agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We‚Äôre above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2020-31.txt,"As my beautiful bayou home is ravaged by hurricanes, people of color become climate migrants   column/3478995001  Hurricanes Laura and Sally have ravaged an already-vulnerable Gulf Coast. And it is people of color who most often suffer as climate change migrants.  Jasmine Sanders | Opinion contributor  There is nothing quite like the smell of the bayou. I remember when I was a teenager how I would head to my ‚Äúsecret spot‚Äù across the levee to just lay and think. I remember the many barbecues and gatherings. I remember the soothing tranquility that vibrated from the bayou just as vibrant as my first-time having alligator ‚Äî which tastes like chicken, by the way.  But what I also remember, is how many people‚Äôs lives were forever changed in August 2005 when Hurricane Katrina arrived on the shore of New Orleans and families no longer had a place to call home and joined the growing population of ‚Äúclimate migrants.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt think I will ever forget seeing live coverage of coffins floating in the flooded streets. That image just ‚Ä¶ does not go away. Or the image of thousands upon thousands of people piling into the Superdome for shelter because evacuation plans fell apart, people were stuck in their cars in traffic for hours trying to get away, or standing on top of their roofs waving and yelling for help. I remember a couple weeks later, a boy and a girl from New Orleans walking into my high school classroom in Monroe, Louisiana, and looking at them with sorrow, as they had lost everything.  What's the matter with Kansas? Climate change: Vulnerable Kansas bird populations are a canary in a coal mine for climate change  Three months later, and the world seemed to have forgotten it had even happened. But for a lot of Louisiana natives, life was now different. Seeing FEMA trailers spread across southern Louisiana was not uncommon. Folks were now dispersed across the nation, many relocated to Houston, and never looked back.  No home to return to     This was not just simply relocation, but the first time I was witnessing climate migration. There was nothing for them to return to. Houses were destroyed, family relics lost, businesses gone, injuries, death, and a culture scarred. For many of Americans we have only seen this similar devastation after a disaster, such as an earthquake or tsunami. Miles upon miles away from us, the migration of people due to disaster was never something we had to face; we simply gave just the one-time donation.  It is now 15 years later, and Hurricane Laura and, most recently, Hurricane Sally have ravaged the Gulf Coast. Have we learned anything from our mistakes? Were we prepared?  Louisiana is in the midst of washing away and recovering from Laura, evacuations are now simply a regular part of life and happening weekly. At least 12 people in Louisiana were killed because of Laura, and another four in Texas; and residents are still trying to assess the damage and flooding as a result of Sally. It's as if Laura spoke to Sally and said ""You take out one end, and I'll get the other."" Florida and Alabama are being pounded with floodwater and debris and hundreds of thousands are without power, while others are escaping their neighborhoods infested with dangerous, downed power lines.  Borders can't contain climate change: California‚Äôs crisis is a world management issue  The Gulf Coast is just not getting a break and this intensity of unsurvivable storm surges seems to be the next normal.  In the years following Hurricane Katrina, FEMA worked with the Louisiana governor‚Äôs Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness on mitigation projects designed to minimize or eliminate damage. They were put to the test as Tropical Storm Barry approached in 2019, I‚Äôm not sure if we will ever be totally prepared for unsurvivable storm surges.  Unsurvivable, unrelenting  As a Louisiana native, you are prepared for the devastation to the beautiful coastline due to a hurricane, but what you are not ready for is hearing the words ‚Äúunsurvivable storm surge.‚Äù My home parish of Ouachita, situated in northeastern Louisiana, was the second most affected area from Hurricane Laura with more than 60,000 power outages. In addition to the sweltering southern heat and a COVID-19 pandemic, yet another hurricane or tropical storm is not what Louisiana needed.  Climate change is known in some circles as a ‚Äú threat multiplier,‚Äù increasing steadily and resulting in the exacerbation of existing stressors. It is the threat we know about and are constantly learning more about each day, simply because the intensity of it is escalating.      Climate migration will have to be addressed. This is a global human issue that transcends politics. Around the world, we are seeing people having to flee their homes due to climate change. And right now, the world is not a welcoming place for these climate migrants. Communities of color are disproportionately impacted by climate change and the most affected by devastating loss. This is not happening in a foreign country where you cannot fathom it or ignore it. This is happening here. In your very own backyard.

Before we jump into our regularly scheduled programming...  Climate change continues to super-charge weather events ranging from wildfires to hurricanes, and we're in the midst of both this week. Not every storm is the fault of climate change ‚Äî to be clear ‚Äî but a growing body of literature shows the events are made worse by factors like increasing ocean temperatures. More on Hurricane Laura next week (and more on fires later in this newsletter), but for now, there's a developing story out of Louisiana where a chemical fire at a chlorine plant erupted not long after the storm swept through the area. Here's The Times-Picayune with the story.  For our other lead story this week, an AP investigation found the Trump administration wrote something of a blank check for polluters during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For the Goop-adherents, the yoga practitioners and the Instagramers, white sage has become an oft-burned and ""smudged"" plant. But the practice, which came from Native American communities, has led to a boom in an illicit poaching market centered in Southern California. Kimon de Greef investigates for Vice.  Oil, we're going down swinging. In a striking example of fossil fuels' diminishing power, Exxon Mobil was one of several companies dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The oil supermajor was the world's largest company only nine years     ago, but it was booted to make room for tech companies, The Dallas Morning News reports.  Coal is a dinosaur. As I've written before, the American coal industry is on its way out the door. Energy News Network and WyoFile have been exploring what this means for coal-dependent communities around the country in a series called Transition in Coal Country. In the most recent installment, they take us to the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, where the idea of a just transition still remains that far out of reach.   POLITICAL CLIMATE  When you give your son a fish. The multi-billion-dollar Pebble Mine project has been a battleground for years, as environmental groups and indigenous communities say the proposed 8,400-acre open pit mine would imperil the headwaters of the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery. Over the weekend, Zack Colman and Alex Guillen of Politico broke the story of President Donald Trump appearing to change his mind on a project he had supported. Then, they reported on Monday that the Army Corps of Engineers called for a series of conditions that are likely to kill the mine. It appears that Trump's son and donors having a fondness for fishing the area likely tipped the scales.  The burn salve. As wildfires have raged across California in recent weeks, so too has the debate over fire suppression and fuel management. After a century of aggressive firefighting techniques, forests in the West need to return to a more natural burn cycle, while chaparral are likely being over-burned. But questions remain on what's the proper balance. Perhaps answers exist with Native American tribes who have lived for many years in what is now the Golden State, NPR reports.  ENVIRONMENTALISM AROUND THE WORLD  Brain storms. You don't have to, like me, spend all day investigating environmental woes to fall victim to the existential dread wrought by climate change. The Center for Public Integrity, Columbia Journalism Investigations and 12 other outlets teamed up on a unique investigation into the mental health implications of increasingly severe storm events around the U.S. and its territories. ""More Americans are affected by climate- driven disasters every year, with serious emotional consequences,"" they wrote. ""Even with FEMA aid, state and local resources aren‚Äôt enough."" Three-in-five respondents to a survey they sent out reported at least five types of emotional challenges in the year following a disaster.  There be pirates in these waters. Waving the Cambodian flag, the ship full of millions of dollars of apparently illegally caught threatened fish tried to make berth and offload in Namibia.

For months now, we've seen clear links between the environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, whether they be the urban-wildlife interface unleashing new zoonotic diseases or communities lacking clean water necessary for hygiene. The Navajo Nation has been hit hard by the virus, perhaps in part because nearly a third of households don't have running water, an issue that will only become worse as climate change pushes the mercury higher.  Ian James of The Arizona Republic traveled to the nation, which spreads across much of what is now the Four Corners region, to report on its poor water access.

Batteries are the future. Switch, a company that operates electricity-hungry data centers, plans to host the world's largest solar-storage facility that ties directly to its customer. Greentech Media reports that the new project will be constructed in the Nevada desert and represents another big step toward the battery capacity needed to tether renewable energy to the world's power demands.  The bailout continues. There are more clean energy jobs than those in the fossil fuel sector, Sarah Bowman of the Indianapolis Star reports, yet several large coal and gas companies in the Hoosier State received more than twice what renewable energy     companies did in relief dollars. ""For many environmental advocates, the Paycheck Protection Program data calls into question the number and size of relief funds allocated to an industry that was on the decline before the pandemic,"" she writes.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  An upstream battle. If the Pebble Mine ever receives its final permits and breaks ground, its owners stand to make billions of dollars. At the same time, the world's most productive sockeye salmon fishery could be obliterated. Chris D'Angelo of HuffPost reports that, after the Obama administration worked to slow the project, the Trump administration reversed course. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers posted its final environmental impact statement and said the massive mine wouldn't have any major impacts on fish, paving the way for it to receive the final green light.  Politicizing public lands? Earlier in the year, how to manage national parks during the coronavirus pandemic became a political flashpoint. Now, although the virus is anything but contained, they're back open and once again causing controversy. The Fresno Bee reports that Yosemite National Park ‚Äî which hosts 4.5 million visitors per year ‚Äî has a COVID-19-positive resident. Instead of dealing with the issue, park management moved to quash the news, an employee alleged to the newspaper.  Corruption check-in. If you're a fan of this newsletter, then (in addition to being the best) you've been following the corruption case unfolding in the Midwest. Republican Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder was recently charged by the FBI for a scheme involving a nuclear and coal bailout. Now, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports, a customer of the utility company in question, FirstEnergy, has filed a class-action lawsuit to get money back from the rate hikes that funded the bailout.  WATER WORRIES  When clean water's not cheap. Would you pay $74 a month to be able to turn on a tap that's not clean enough to drink? That's the question in this important story from the San Francisco Chronicle that looks at low-income communities around Fresno and their fight to finally get access to potable water. The catch? There are 310 public water systems out of compliance in the state, and just as some programs were getting underway to address these issues, the coronavirus pandemic hit, throwing their finances into disarray.  Come hell or high water. Weeks of unusually heavy rain have dropped on central and southern China, affecting 54 million people and putting unprecedented stress on the Three Gorges Dam, the Los Angeles Times reports. The dam is one of the largest in the world, and if it were to fail, an untold number of people would see their homes, farms and lives washed away.  Fossil fuels are thirsty. Our USA Today Network friends over at the Farmington Daily Times recently wrote about a new report from the Energy Policy Institute that looks at the high water usage at coal-fired power plants. Across the dry West, this thirsty     fuel appears increasingly out-of-step with efforts to use less Colorado River water. The report analyzed data from 30 coal plants in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and Wyoming and found that they guzzle about 208 million gallons of water every day.  AND ANOTHER THING  See you on the other side. Fossil fuels aren't forever. But as the world transitions to cleaner energy sources, we can't forget the communities whose economies are based on mineral extraction. The concept is called the ""just transition"" in the environmental movement, and it searches for solutions to find new jobs in a greener economy for former miners and roughnecks. First, E&E takes us to the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to examine what life looks like under the clouds of booms and, increasingly, busts.

The California governor isn't the only governor saying the fires are a consequence of climate change. He's joined by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee.  ‚ÄúAnd it is maddening right now that, when we have this cosmic challenge to our communities, with the entire West Coast of the United States on fire, to have a president to deny that these are not just wildfires, these are climate fires,‚Äù Inslee said Sunday on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week.‚Äù  President Donald Trump will travel to California on Monday for an update on the wildfires. Trump will visit McClellan Park in Sacramento County, where he will be briefed by local and federal fire and emergency officials, the White House said Saturday.  Wildfires rage across the West: Smoke poses health hazard to millions  McClellan Park has served as the base for firefighter operations in the state. In California and across the West, hundreds of thousands of residents have been driven from their homes or been told to pack a bag and be ready to go. Millions are being tormented by the unrelenting smoke.  The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality's Air Quality Index considers anything between 301 and 500 as hazardous. Portland‚Äôs index was at 426 on Sunday. Two cities, Madras and Roseburg, exceeded the scale.  ‚ÄúI drove 600 miles up and down the state, and I never escaped the smoke,‚Äù Oregon Sen.

USA-2020-35.txt,"In Phoenix, rising temperatures day and night kill more people each year    temperatures/5640563002  Climate Collision  It's not just desert cities that are threatened by hotter summer temperatures. Deadly heat is on the rise across the United States.  Debra Utacia Krol, Arizona Republic  Updated 11:52 p.m. hddc Aug. 27, 2020 Jack Esry died alone in his home on July 25, 2019.  As temperatures soared close to 110 degrees, Esry's son Bill, who lived out of state, had worried that his aging father, who had already been injured in a serious fall, would be affected by the extreme heat.  His dad's air conditioning unit had failed and Jack had delayed getting it fixed. He kept his windows closed, fearful his cats would escape. Finally, a friend called Bill to say his dad had missed a weekly chat.  Bill called authorities and asked for a welfare check.  When Scottsdale police arrived, the house was a scorching 99 degrees inside.   Jack Esry had succumbed to the heat.  Esry, 80, was one of a record 197 people in Maricopa County who died from heat- related causes in 2019. That surpassed the previous record of 182 deaths in 2018, which surpassed the record of 179 deaths in 2017.   So far in 2020, the Maricopa County Health Department has confirmed 30 heat-related deaths. The agency is investigating an additional 243.  The death toll rises in a way that would drive dramatic headlines if tied to a single weather event. Hurricane landfalls typically claim far fewer lives.   Instead, heat deaths happen one at a time, over the growing number of weeks and months each year when the weather turns dangerous. They are tied not to a single event but to an ongoing one, the rising temperatures that affect all seasons.     Over the past 30 years, heat has accounted for more fatalities on average than any other weather-related disaster in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service.  And while heat deaths may be more acute in the desert city of Phoenix, the warming climate that helps drive them is not likely to leave any major American city unscathed.   Hot days, hotter nights   Along with longer days, school holidays and the annual departure of the human  snowbirds from Phoenix, summer comes with heat and, increasingly, the heat doesn't let up at sundown.  Phoenix area residents accustomed to blazing summer days are also being hammered by rising nighttime temperatures. More than once this summer, the thermometer still read 100 degrees at midnight and for more than seven days in July, the temperature never dropped below 90 degrees, setting a new record.  The region also contends with longer summers as days grow hot earlier, sometimes as soon as April, and stay hot well into October.   And summers won't grow more temperate any time soon. Climate change has increased the average temperature in Phoenix by 4.35 degrees since 1970, according to a 2019 report by Climate Central.  The expanding urban heat island hoards heat in asphalt, concrete and tall buildings during the day and releases it at night, which has resulted in nighttime temperatures soaring as much as 10 degrees above historical records.  These factors helped contribute to Phoenix being named as the fourth fastest-warming city in the U.S. With an average of 169 days per year with temperatures of 90 degrees or higher and an average midsummer high temperature of 106.1 degrees, Phoenix was also ranked as the hottest big city in the U.S.  As if to underscore the trend, the average temperature in Phoenix during July was 99 degrees, which made July the hottest month on record.   A man carries an empty jug to be filled at a water station at the corner of Van Buren Street and 33rd Avenue in Phoenix on July 15, 2020. Thomas Hawthorne/The Republic  But it's not just desert cities like Phoenix and Tucson that are threatened by hotter summer temperatures. Deadly heat is on the rise across the United States. Cities including Burlington, Vermont; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Helena, Montana, are right behind Phoenix as members in Climate Central's top 10 fast-warming cities list, experiencing temperature rises of more than 4 degrees.      Chattanooga experienced what one meteorologist called a ""death ridge"" during a May 2019 heat wave. The city and surrounding region experienced record temperatures ‚Äî Chattanooga's high temperature was more than 10 degrees above normal for late May. The Tennessee Valley city's summer temperatures stretched into fall, reaching 100 degrees in October for the first time since weather records have been kept.   Even Minneapolis, known as the coldest large city in the U.S., has seen a 3.72 degree temperature rise.  ‚ÄúWe are seeing more intense and longer heat waves, and while everywhere is used to dealing with seasonal extreme heat events for their given city, many northern areas may not able to adapt fully to extended periods of heat the same way as the south,"" said Jennifer Vanos, professor of sustainability at Arizona State University.  ""When heat combines with humidity over many days, like we see in much of the Great Lakes region,"" Vanos said, ""it can become particularly dangerous.‚Äù  As highs and lows continue their inexorable rise, long-running factors including poverty, homelessness and isolation for the elderly have begun to intersect with new effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may limit incomes and shutter the facilities that help some people escape the heat. The combined effects could lead to a higher death toll this year.   How heat kills  As the air temperature rises, so does the body‚Äôs temperature, said Mona Sarfaty, director of the Program on Climate and Health in the Center for Climate Change Communication. In response, a person begins to sweat.  ‚ÄúThe sweat evaporates from the skin as long as the air isn't too humid,‚Äù Sarfaty said. ‚ÄúSo you would expect that sweat to evaporate and cool things. It‚Äôs the body's way of cooling itself.‚Äù  Without an opportunity to cool the body down, she said, people begin to feel the first symptoms of heat illness.  Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist  People need time to recover from the heat.  ‚ÄúYou get headaches,‚Äù Sarfaty said. ‚ÄúYou may just start to feel kind of dizzy or lightheaded. You may have some cramping, either abdominal cramping or muscle cramping.‚Äù     The longer someone is overheated, the worse the body's response. If a body‚Äôs core temperature soars to 104 degrees or higher, the heart starts to pound and breathing speeds up. Eventually, the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and brain will become damaged.  When that occurs, without immediate medical treatment, lifelong damage or death can occur within 24 hours.  Higher nighttime temperatures also make heat-related illnesses and deaths more likely.  ‚ÄúPeople need time to recover from the heat,‚Äù said Nancy Selover, Arizona's state climatologist. ‚ÄúIf your body has a chance to cool and recover, you're OK to go again the next day. But if you can't get that cooling relief, then it's hard to sleep when it's 85 degrees.‚Äù  It's not just desert cities like Phoenix and Tucson that are threatened by hotter summer temperatures. Deadly heat is on the rise across the United States. The Republic  Selover said there are more days when nighttime temperatures never dip below 90 degrees, once a rare phenomenon.  In July, Phoenix broke the record for the most nights with low temperatures of 90 degrees or above and, by late August, there had been more than 25 days when the temperature remained above 90, day and night.  Rising humidity also factors into more dangerous summer days across the nation. The intersection of temperature and humidity can turn deadly with a thermometer reading as low as 100 degrees if the humidity rises to 35% or higher .  Weather and climate experts measure the effects of heat and humidity with what's called a heat index. Excessive heat warnings are issued when the heat index is expected to reach 105 or higher for at least two days, and nighttime temperatures will be 75 degrees or higher.  Colin Raymond, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said adding humidity into a hot day affects the body's ability to cool itself.  ""It's like being in a steam room,"" Raymond said. Days of higher temperatures coupled with higher concentrations of water vapor in the air can cause people to fall ill in large numbers, although he said more research is underway to more fully understand the effects.   People hike at Pima Canyon Trailhead in Phoenix on July 11, 2020. An excessive heat watch is in effect through Monday. Catherine Rafferty/The Republic     A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists said if warming proceeds without any action to reduce heat-trapping emissions, one-third of the nation‚Äôs 481 urban areas with populations of more than 50,000 people, including Phoenix, will experience an average of 30 or more days per year with a heat index registering more than 105 degrees.  The combination of increased heat and inadequate mitigation can be lethal: The Maricopa County Department of Public Health's statistics indicate that deaths attributed to heat increased 232% from 2006 to 2019.  Jennifer Vanos, professor of sustainability at Arizona State University  We know that we are the hottest county in the U.S. We're also the fastest-growing county  in the U.S., so we should have the smartest policies and programs for reducing public  health impacts that are associated with heat.  Many of those victims were homeless or elderly, both considered particularly vulnerable communities. Because the county has focused on more closely evaluating deaths for heat-related causes, their figures capture more cases than do national sources.  The Arizona Republic examined reports from 164 autopsies performed in Maricopa County between Jan. 5 and Sept. 6, 2019. By Dec. 31, the county would add another 33 deaths to that total.Of the reports examined, 141 revealed that death was either heat- caused or heat-related. Others appeared to suggest that heat may be a factor; three deaths were caused by exposure to cold temperatures.  ‚ÄúWe know that we are the hottest county in the U.S.,‚Äù said Vanos, at ASU. ‚ÄúWe're also the fastest-growing county in the U.S., so we should have the smartest policies and programs for reducing public health impacts that are associated with heat.‚Äù  Vanos said existing programs don't seem to be effective at protecting the area's most vulnerable, like people who don't have air conditioning. Seniors and homeless people are also succumbing at increased rates. And transit riders in the metro area are greatly challenged as they deal with little shade and heat radiating off asphalt.  Low-income families struggle   Summer in Phoenix typically starts with stifling heat with low humidity. Once the monsoon sets in, that sense of being dry-roasted gives way to steamy, oppressive heat that is inescapable even at night.  Most people would rely more on their air conditioners, but many low-income families don‚Äôt have that luxury.  Tucked into a largely Latino neighborhood in south Phoenix, one family has struggled to keep cool yet not run out of money during the torrid summer monsoon.     Blanca Abarca, her husband and 14-year-old daughter, Isabella, lack the means to cool off that many people take for granted: air conditioning. The Abarcas rely on a different technology ‚Äî two evaporative coolers ‚Äî in their modest 1950s-era brick home.  Blanca Abarca stands in her front yard on Feb. 27, 2020, in Phoenix. Sean Logan/The Republic  The coolers reduce air temperature by blowing water-charged air through the house. But a swamp cooler, as it‚Äôs often called, becomes ineffective once the dew point, a combination of temperature and moisture in the air, reaches 55. Abarca‚Äôs husband, a handyman, installed ventilators in the ceiling and floor to circulate more air, but during the monsoon, being indoors can be almost unbearable.  Abarca showed off her outdoor kitchen and dining area in a backyard alive with big shade trees, three dogs, several chickens, a vegetable garden shaded to keep the hot sun off her tender plants. The kitchen is essential when it‚Äôs too hot to cook indoors, she said through an interpreter.  The family maintains big trees to provide shade over their home. The side yard sports a large aviary, where they keep cockatoos. There‚Äôs even a turtle enclosure along one wall.  But along another fence sits an air quality monitor, installed by ASU students who are studying the high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses in the neighborhood. That pole is overshadowed by a charred electric pole that was struck by lightning several years ago. It looks like it could topple on the garden during the next hard windstorm.  ""All the electric company did was put a new (transformer) up,‚Äù said Abarca.   The Abarcas take at least three showers a day to cool off. And, Abarca said, ‚ÄúWe drink about six or seven gallons of water a week just to hydrate.‚Äù  They purchased two tiny room air conditioners for the bedrooms, but Abarca said they carefully ration their usage to just a few hours at night, so they can sleep.  Sean Logan/The Republic Blanca Abarca, resident in south Phoenix  My husband said that if we put an air conditioner on the house, that he‚Äôd have to get another job.  ‚ÄúDuring the summers, we pay $200 a month at most,‚Äù said Abarca, a stay-at-home mom. That‚Äôs still a lot of money to a family with just one breadwinner.   Abarca said she‚Äôs investigated solar panels but found the cost would add the equivalent of another house payment to their budget. And, since the Abarcas make barely more than state guidelines for low-income solar grants, she said, they are deemed ineligible     for not only solar power but other low-income assistance from their electric provider, Salt River Project.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs illogical,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEvery year, we pay our taxes. But, by just $1, you‚Äôre considered rich!‚Äù  The Abarca family isn‚Äôt alone: The U.S. Census Bureau notes that the poverty rate for residents of the Abarcas' ZIP code is 32% higher than for the county as a whole, and per-capita income lags by 13.4%.  Local electricutilities, including SRP and Arizona Public Service, offer some programs to aid low-income customers making at or less than 150% of the federal poverty level. For the Abarcas, that would be just $32,500 annually. Making their home more energy- efficient is out of reach even with a more generous income limit of twice the federal poverty level, since the maximum grant is $6,000.  In the meantime, Abarca said, she sees her neighbors getting AC units, only to be shocked when the first bill arrives.  Blanca Abarca poses for a portrait in her backyard on Feb. 27, 2020, in Phoenix. Sean Logan/The Republic  ‚ÄúSome people pay $400 or $500 a month,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne lady got a $1,500 bill, but even after talking to the company and finding there was a mistake, they still had to pay $600. Oh my gosh, I don‚Äôt have that kind of money!‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy husband said that if we put an air conditioner on the house, that he‚Äôd have to get another job,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI see other families that finally got AC units, but now both parents have to work just to afford the electric bills.‚Äù  She said it‚Äôs grown hotter and more humid over the two decades they have lived in Phoenix.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting so that you can‚Äôt be outside anymore,‚Äù Abarca said. Yet there are still many homes in the neighborhood that have only swamp coolers hanging off walls or mounted on roofs.  A study to assess the cooling needs of homebound people published by the Maricopa County Department of Public Health found that about 19% of homes in the county have swamp coolers. The study also noted that the cost of running air conditioners in homes that have them was listed as the biggest reason for not using them.  ‚ÄúI think that in this 21st century there‚Äôs so much technology,‚Äù said Abarca, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs illogical that a lot of people pay a high price to have it while others don‚Äôt pay as much.‚Äù  A senior succumbs to heat     By most standards, Jack Esry Sr. was set to live out his retirement years in comfort. He graduated top of his class at Stanford in mechanical engineering and parlayed that into a successful career. After retiring from Motorola in 2006, Esry enjoyed a comfortable pension. He owned a spacious home in the suburban area of north Scottsdale, where he lived alone after a divorce.  Esry‚Äôs son Bill, who lives in Oregon, wasn‚Äôt initially concerned about residing two states away, since his grandmother had lived to age 107. Grandma had downsized and moved to a nearby senior living facility, and Bill encouraged his dad to do the same.  ‚ÄúDad made enough money to move to that development,‚Äù said Bill Esry, ‚Äúbut he was stubborn and wanted to stay.‚Äù  This scenario is familiar to health care providers who deal with seniors.  ‚Äúit‚Äôs a lot easier for the older generation to get into trouble,‚Äù said Karlene Rood, wellness coordinator for Sun Health at Home, a West Valley program that provides home care for its members. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like to ask for help.‚Äù  Karlene Rood, wellness coordinator  It‚Äôs a lot easier for the older generation to get into trouble. They don‚Äôt like to ask for help.  Bill checked in with his dad regularly by text, email and by phone each Sunday. The younger Esry had become concerned enough about Jack‚Äôs ability to live on his own that he and his wife had begun making plans to move nearby so they could care for him. In addition to ongoing health issues like high blood pressure, kidney disease and COPD, the elder Esry had also become a recluse and a hoarder. Bill learned later that his dad spent all of his money on electronic gadgets and ‚Äútoys.‚Äù  Bill Esry had cause to worry: During their weekly phone call on Sunday, July 21, ‚ÄúDad said his air conditioning had broken a week ago,‚Äù Bill said.  His father kept saying he would get the AC fixed because he didn‚Äôt want to pay the estimated $4,000 to get a new unit. He said he had a warranty company that covered repairs, and he was waiting for a technician to come out.  Bill said he advised his dad to open some windows at least, but the elder Esry refused, saying he was afraid his two cats would escape.  It‚Äôs possible Jack didn‚Äôt realize he was becoming dangerously overheated. Rood and Sarfaty agree that people over age 65 have a diminished ability to sweat, a function that helps cool the body down and prevent heat exhaustion or potentially life- threatening heat stroke. Seniors also tend to overdress, Rood said. And some prescription and over-the-counter medications for conditions ranging from allergies to high blood pressure and depression increase heat sensitivity.     Two days later, Bill‚Äôs phone rang, but all he could hear was his dad moving around.  ‚ÄúHe ‚Äòbutt-dialed‚Äô me,‚Äù said Bill. On Thursday, July 25, a friend of Jack‚Äôs from Prescott called and said Jack had failed to keep his weekly online chat appointment with her.  Bill called Scottsdale police.  ‚ÄúI told them how to get them in the house,‚Äù said Bill. He later viewed video of the police entering the home and said, ‚ÄúYou could tell they were really uncomfortable.‚Äù The indoor temperature had reached 99 degrees.  Jack Esry was found in his bed, dead.  The cats survived and were adopted by an older couple.  A medical alert device could have saved Jack Esry‚Äôs life. Rood said Sun Health encourages all of their clients to obtain one.  ‚ÄúThey can push it and get help right away,‚Äù she said. Some devices even link to the person‚Äôs mobile phone GPS, so responders can easily locate them.  Rood also recommends that seniors have a buddy system in place and check in with each other regularly.  Homeless people are more vulnerable  Nearly half of the autopsies examined by The Republic confirmed that victims of heat- related or heat-caused illness were homeless, with another 14 who likely lacked a place to call home, but whose housing status wasn‚Äôt clearly stated in the medical examiner‚Äôs reports.  Some of the victims had burns suffered from lying on hot concrete or asphalt, while first responders reported body temperatures of up to 112 degrees in people who were still alive when they arrived at the scene.  Dozens of tents are seen on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix on Jan. 3, 2020. Eli Imadali/The Republic  Rebecca Legate counts herself lucky to not be such a statistic. In 2016, Legate was struggling to survive what, at the time, was the third-hottest year in Phoenix. Daytime temperatures reached as high as 118 degrees, and 19 days hit record high temperatures.  More dangerous were the 16 nights during that hellish summer when temperatures never dipped below 89 degrees. To add to her misery, Legate was pregnant.  After a traumatic experience that caused her to flash back to when she was trafficked as a child, Legate said she regressed from a long-term period of sobriety.     ‚ÄúI ended up living in a condemned house with no electricity, no water, in the middle of the summer, pregnant,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI had three of my older kids with me at the time.‚Äù  Rebecca Legate reads with her 3-year-old daughter, Nati. Legate, once homeless during one of Phoenix's hottest summers, now works for the Phoenix Rescue Mission. Scott Streble/Phoenix Rescue Mission  ‚ÄúThe biggest problem with the heat and homelessness is mental illness, housing and drug addiction,‚Äù said Nathan Smith, director of community engagement at the Phoenix Rescue Mission. ‚ÄúThe reason that they‚Äôre out there on the streets suffering from the heat is because they don‚Äôt consistently have access to the services to keep them off the streets.‚Äù  Smith points to unaffordable housing, mental illnesses that prevent people from staying on track to meet life‚Äôs demands and drug addiction, which drives people to hunt drugs instead of being healthy, as the root causes of homelessness. Medications that treat mental illnesses also make people more vulnerable to becoming overheated as well.  Smith said an alarming factor in homelessness is the explosion of unsheltered people in metro Phoenix. From 2014 to 2018, he said, the percentage of homeless people who live outdoors increased from 18% to 48%, which greatly raises the specter of more heat- related illnesses and deaths. They are also the hardest for agencies like Phoenix Rescue Mission to serve, Smith said.  Summers were always hot, Legate said, but 2016 was especially scorching, with nearly 30 days of high temperatures soaring above 110 degrees.   Scott Streble/Phoenix Rescue Mission Rebecca Legate  We were always having to get ice for the ice chest and hoping it would last.  ‚ÄúIt was rough,‚Äù she said. She and her boyfriend would ride bikes to fill 5-gallon water containers to lug back to the house. They scrounged money to feed the on-demand box to keep electric service flowing. They kept an ice chest for food due to the sporadic power situation.  ‚ÄúWe were always having to get ice for the ice chest and hoping it would last,‚Äù Legate said.  After the older kids fled to a relative‚Äôs home, Legate continued her downward spiral. She hit bottom after being arrested on drug charges and sent to prison, where at least there was air conditioning and regular meals.     With the help of a sympathetic attorney and a social worker, Legate transitioned to the Phoenix Rescue Mission, where she completed a faith-based recovery program. She regained custody of her youngest daughter, now 3, and works at the mission.  Transit riders challenged to stay cool  Rosetta Walker has to prepare carefully for her next bus trip.  ‚ÄúI pack a hat, sunscreen, water, an umbrella and sunglasses,‚Äù said Walker. ‚ÄúThe umbrella is an absolute necessity.‚Äù  That‚Äôs because Walker, 60, faces up to a 20-minute walk to a bus stop, depending on which direction she‚Äôs heading that day. There‚Äôs very little shade along the nine-block route she travels in her south Tempe neighborhood to protect her from blazing hot summer days.  Walker also needs the umbrella while she waits for the bus, as neither of the stops has a shade structure. One stop has some trees on the west-facing side. The other, located on a corner next to an empty lot, has no shade at all.   Walker has been using public transit for the past eight years as she pursues her post- retirement passion of volunteerism. She's unable to drive because diabetes-related glaucoma left her legally blind. She takes the bus and light rail to the federal courthouse every Friday to register newly minted voters after the weekly naturalization ceremony.  Then there are the days she travels downtown to train as a poll worker. A citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, Walker also lends support to many Native events and initiatives, ranging from the Pueblo Grande Indian Market to traveling to the Arizona Legislature, where she advocates for more services to fight the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women.  Rosetta Walker, public transportation commuter  I pack a hat, sunscreen, water, an umbrella and sunglasses. The umbrella is an absolute  necessity.  In just one week, Walker rides the bus to no less than five such appointments, along with lectures and concerts, community events and trips to the nearby Walmart. Walker‚Äôs husband, Jim, a firefighter, and daughter, Cheyenne, help by driving her whenever they can, but more often, Walker simply takes the bus.  And, like the other transit users in the Valley, Walker deals with grueling heat in the summer. In January 2020 alone, Valley Metro reported more than 5.3 million boardings on their system and 64,380,334 boardings in fiscal year 2010. That includes bus, light rail service and neighborhood circulator buses.      Having diabetes makes Walker even more cognizant of the need to be heat-savvy, since diabetics are especially susceptible to dehydration. Their insulin uptake can be disrupted when the thermometer registers high temperatures.  But even with all of the precautions she takes, Walker confesses that some days she feels like she might pass out on the street. That‚Äôs when she ducks into a McDonald‚Äôs or a Circle K to cool off for a bit.  Governments, nonprofits address heat crisis  Over the past several years, public and private agencies have begun to take a more coordinated approach to addressing what has become an invisible, slow-moving public health crisis.  One such approach is the Maricopa Coalition on Climate Change and Public Health. Since 2015, the coalition has labored to break down operational silos, share information, develop effective means to track heat-related and heat-caused illness and deaths, and build a strategic plan to address the ever-growing issue of hotter summers and how to support those who are most vulnerable to deadlier days and nights.  The coalition includes the Heat Relief Regional Network, a county-wide system of emergency cooling centers and water distribution sites managed by the Maricopa Association of Governments. The cooling centers, which include community centers, libraries and churches, operate during extreme heat events. Many are located along bus routes, but some can only be accessed by walking several blocks.  But the cooling centers have their limits. They close when the facility does, usually during the hottest part of the day.  Jonathan Beebe Giudice  I think one of the things that is very important is that people feel that there is not much that they can do when it comes to heat. But the truth of the matter is that there are things  that can be done.  Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director and administrator of the Maricopa County Public Health Department‚Äôs disease control division, said the county is working to get more centers open later in the day. She said the number of centers has tripled. Sunenshine and Vanos both emphasized that data collection has greatly improved.  Mark Hartman, chief sustainability officer for the city of Phoenix, is also looking at how to improve the cooling centers.     ‚ÄúWe want to ensure that our cooling centers are actually in places that people will want to go,‚Äù said Hartman. One tactic is to offer more activities, such as what's available in libraries.   In December 2019, the Institute for Sustainable Communities, an organization that helps build resiliency and economic sustainability, received an environmental community action grant that it will use to help facilitate the coalition's implementation of its strategic plan.  ‚ÄúMaricopa County is more advanced compared to other regions in dealing with extreme heat,‚Äù said Steve Adams, director of urban resilience at the institute. Adams also noted that many programs to address climate change tend to operate at local jurisdictional levels; he likened such programs to how local governments respond to citizen calls to fix potholes in a pragmatic fashion.   One such public-private partnership is beginning to bear fruit, or, rather, mesquite beans. Tucked in the shadow of glittering new development in downtown Phoenix, the Edison-Eastlake neighborhood swelters during the summer.  Arizona State University partnered with the Nature Conservancy, county and city agencies and local residents to develop a plan to make this working-class neighborhood more walkable and less hazardous to health.   ""Phoenix is one of the hottest areas around the world,"" said Diana Bermudez, director of special projects for the Nature Conservancy. ""But this is one of the hottest areas in terms of temperature in Phoenix.""  After holding workshops with local residents, the coalition identified 12 ""hot spots"" that needed to be addressed. One such corner recently was the site of the first installation to relieve the heat: planting mesquite trees and other indigenous plants at the Trans Queer Pueblo on a corner across from the Phoenix Ranch Market.  Jonathan Beebe Giudice with the Pueblo said not only will the trees and cactuses provide needed shade for pedestrians, they also symbolize a return to ancestral foods and to show people in the community how they can continue to self-develop on their own terms.   ""I think one of the things that is very important is that people feel that there is not much that they can do when it comes to heat,"" said Bermudez. ""But the truth of the matter is that there are things that can be done, and that nature can play a very important role in that.""  Bicyclists enjoy a ride through sprinklers at Chaparral Park in Scottsdale on July 13, 2020. The temperature for the day was expected to reach a high of 112 degrees Fahrenheit. Thomas Hawthorne/The Republic     Tribes in the area are also taking steps to keep their citizens safe. In Guadalupe, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe has a home safety program to help elders and other fixed-income tribal members repair and maintain their air conditioners.  Alma Iris Valenzuela works with elders in the 3,000-member community that's part of the larger 11,000-member tribe based in Tucson. Valenzuela said she normally deals with about 600 elders, including 45 who participate in the tribe‚Äôs elder activities, and with other tribal citizens who need assistance. The tribe even offers interest-free loans to replace broken or outdated units, with elders receiving a 50% discount.  ‚ÄúMost elders already know about our program,‚Äù she said.   Cliff Puckett with the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community‚Äôs emergency management department said the tribal government has a plan to aid elders and other people in need of assistance for fixing their cooling systems.  ‚ÄúSeniors can call our maintenance line to get their ACs up and running,‚Äù said Puckett. ‚ÄúWe also have two cooling stations set up for power outages, and we‚Äôll evaluate people who come in if they need additional assistance.‚Äù  In case of extended outages, the tribe will house them free of charge. And the Salt River community can mobilize a mass care center for long-term outages.  Laura Dent, executive director of Chispa AZ  Information on heat and other environmental issues needs to be culturally relevant and in a  variety of languages.  But Laura Dent has a different take. Dent is executive director of Chispa AZ, the Hispanic division of the League of Conservation Voters. She said much needs to be done to ensure that all neighborhoods are equally served with heat relief and mitigation.  ‚ÄúLatinos are more affected by heat,‚Äù she said. For example, families in Hispanic neighborhoods are challenged to make their homes energy efficient. Parks and streets lack the robust tree canopies seen in more upscale neighborhoods. People who are forced into on-demand electric service end up paying far more over the long run. Latinos also tend to work in the construction and agriculture sectors and thus are exposed to extreme heat in great numbers.  Dent‚Äôs solution: Help Hispanic people to become more politically aware and active so they can advocate for environmental justice.  ‚ÄúWe need to hold utilities accountable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd information on heat and other environmental issues needs to be culturally relevant and in a variety of languages.‚Äù     Isabella Abarca, who‚Äôs a promotore, or advocate, with Chispa, said some meetings held by the city of Phoenix didn‚Äôt have translators, and others were held during working hours, when the people most affected by what was being discussed weren‚Äôt present to share their concerns.  Dent also called for a more equitable distribution of tree canopies and enhanced parks. And, she said, Hispanics need to be more welcomed into environmental groups.   Ramon Rojas walks Dutch the dog down Third Avenue in Phoenix on July 15, 2020. Thomas Hawthorne/The Republic  What does Walker believe is needed for transit customers to withstand hotter days and nights?  ‚ÄúMore shade at the stops,‚Äù she said. Driving east on Guadalupe Road, Walker points out an example: This stop has a metal-roofed shade with solar panels that power a night light.  ‚ÄúI like those because the light makes the stop safer at night,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd the shade is welcome when it‚Äôs 110 degrees out.‚Äù  Hartman said the city is looking at creating ‚Äúwalksheds,‚Äù shaded walkways to keep pedestrians out of the sun. Phoenix is also exploring ‚Äúcool‚Äù paving to reduce nighttime radiation from dark paving materials.  ‚ÄúWe're thinking of a light gray material instead of the white that Los Angeles tried,‚Äù he said.  David Hondula, assistant professor at ASU‚Äôs School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, agrees that shade structures can make a difference to pedestrians in the summer. Hondula also notes that quality of life issues could be more closely explored to develop heat mitigation and adaptation.  ‚ÄúIs our ice cream not melting as we're walking home from the grocery store? Can people choose active modes of transportation like public transportation?‚Äù he said.  Utilities are also beefing up programs to aid customers. Both power providers offer payment assistance, special discounted rates for low-income clients and grants for making homes more energy efficient. SRP works closely with social service agencies to serve customers needing services beyond paying their bill; APS representatives said they have retrained their customer service staff to be more responsive to calls for help.   TaiAnna Yee, city spokesperson  Maximizing shade was one of the biggest things people suggested.     Valley Metro, the region's transit agency, has been preparing for hotter temperatures.  ""Our buses and light rail cars are designed for summer heat,"" said Valley Metro spokesperson Susan Tierney.  Special paint helps deflect heat, and light rail cars have greater air conditioning capacity. Also, Tierney said, Valley Metro maintains solar facilities at its light rail operations center in Phoenix, as well as at the bus operations and maintenance facility in Tempe. At the Mesa facility, solar panels were recently installed on new canopies, further sheltering buses from the sweltering heat while being serviced before embarking on their routes.   Landscaping is also important to the system, Tierney said. It provides both psychological and cooling effects, she said.   Cities manage their own bus stops. Tempe plans to add more shelters to its 800 bus stops, said city spokesperson TaiAnna Yee.  ""Maximizing shade was one of the biggest things people suggested,"" she said. Also, she said, the city plans to replace neighborhood circulator vehicles with larger buses that will also have greater cooling capacity.   Heat in the time of COVID-19  Nathan Smith says the Rescue Mission and other agencies across metro Phoenix respond to another scorching season by seeing red ‚Äî Code Red. That‚Äôs the mission‚Äôs heat relief campaign.  ‚ÄúWe ask the community to give us about 1 million water bottles from May through August,‚Äù said Smith. ‚ÄúWe put them on ice and we take it out to the streets, so we can at the very least make ensure people have consistent access to cold water.‚Äù  The rescue mission also shares its bounty with hydration stations and cities so the need for water can be slaked.  Smith is also exploring how the Phoenix Rescue Mission can expand its summer heat response to reach out to homebound people and seniors becoming ill and dying in their homes due to heat.  ‚ÄúThe biggest problem we face in relation to heat is the same we face in general: the difficulty of getting people into permanent, stable living situations,‚Äù he said.  Downtown Phoenix is deserted due to 110 degrees and the new coronavirus. Nick Oza/The Republic     A murkier question looms over all of the cities and agencies: What does the COVID-19 pandemic mean for efforts to deal with extreme heat? Many residents may not have the cooling center lifeline if libraries, schools and churches remain closed.   ""We currently have 42 collection locations across the region that accept donations of water and other resources,"" said Brande Mead, human services director for the Maricopa Association of Governments. ""We also currently have 64 heat relief stations across the region that offer hydration and/or refuge.""   Mead acknowledged that the number of relief facilities is lower, and MAG believes it's due to the pandemic. Mead said that as locations begin to reopen, the network will add them to the list.  ""The CDC has issued guidance for cooling centers and COVID-19 and we have shared that guidance with our partners and have encouraged them to follow the guidance as they are able to,"" Mead said.   Solveig Muus, who manages the heat relief station at Grace Lutheran Church in downtown Phoenix, said the staff was handing out water during the day and food from 9 a.m. to noon, but was only allowing people with doctor's appointments inside the doors to prevent virus spread. She said the church wouldn't open its doors again until COVID-19 cases were on the decline for at least 14 days.  ""That's about the only way we can be certain that our clients will stay safe,"" she said.   In the meantime, Phoenix Rescue Mission has geared up to offer services to unsheltered homeless people who not only suffer from the heat but may show COVID-19 symptoms.  Rich Heitz, street outreach case manager  We're lucky when we get them to go in for help.  ""I notice when the weather changes that our clients are sicker,"" said Rich Heitz, a street outreach case manager. ""We're lucky when we get them to go in for help.""  Both Heitz and his colleague Sarah Snead said homeless people can have trust issues, and building that trust will be essential to persuade any person living without a home to obtain health care if they become ill. And, they said, if the cooling centers remain closed, they will deal with that, too.  ""We'll hand out water and hygiene packs and advise them to get out of the sun,"" said Heitz. ""We'll get them to water so they can get cleaned up.""  Snead said the Rescue Mission is handing out lunches to their clients.     Another factor is that respiratory illnesses tend to be worse in summer, said Kathleen Winston, dean of the College of Nursing, University of Phoenix. Winston, an RN with 40 years of experience and a Ph.D. in nursing science, said she's familiar with summer heat issues and how to avoid heat-related illnesses.  ""The body doesn't have the same metabolic rate; there's greater stress on your body,"" she said.   Winston said researchers are beginning to study the effects of heat on coronaviruses to learn more about their tie to summer illnesses.  Samantha Godoy, left, and Katie Kelly, of Phoenix, keep cool under misters at the Downtown  Farmers Market on July 25, 2020. Cheryl Evans/The Republic  The American Lung Association notes that people with chronic lung diseases like COPD and asthma fare worse in summer because of air pollution and ozone.   Sarfaty said the Center for Climate Change Communication provides a clearinghouse for health care providers that they can use to educate their patients and communities about the dangers of heat, and how to deal with hot summer days and nights. Also, she said, ‚Äúwe need to stop the emission of these carbon dioxide and methane fossil fuel emissions from going into the atmosphere‚Äù to mitigate the heat.  Abarca believes one solution to make that happen is to make solar panels and other forms of sustainable energy available to all residents, not just those who can afford them.  She also extended an invitation to policy makers to stay at her home over a weekend during the monsoon.  Maybe then, she said, ‚Äúthey would understand what it‚Äôs like to live with no air conditioning.""    "
USA-2020-36.txt,"Climate change linked to serious pregnancy risks, 'landmark' study finds    risks/3220782001  Wyatte Grantham-Philips | USA TODAY An environmental health investigation published Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) finds compelling evidence that links global climate change to negative pregnancy outcomes across the country.  The review analyzed 68 U.S. studies dating back to 2007 ‚Äì which included over 32 million births.  84 percent of the births showed a statistically significant association between increased air pollution and heat exposure (related to climate change) and serious risks for pregnancy ‚Äì specifically preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirth.  ‚ÄúWe spend so much time trying to reduce complications in obstetrics and improve outcomes, that to me this is a landmark study,"" said Dr. Jeanne Conry, MD, PhD, past president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) , current CEO/founder of the Environmental Health Leadership Foundation, and president-elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.  ‚Äú[The investigation shows] that there is a clear association of prenatal exposure of air pollutants and health outcomes ‚Äì children‚Äôs health outcomes...Here, we‚Äôre saying, the air we breathe affects deliveries,"" said Conry, who was not an author of this new research.  Preterm birth and low birth weight can also increase a child's risk for future health and developmental problems.  ‚ÄúThe more you dig, you could really say there‚Äôs a whole generation of children being born like ‚Äòpre-polluted,‚Äô"" said Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola, MD, MSHP, the senior author of the study, an obstetrician/gynecologist, and Environmental Health Expert for ACOG.   ""[As OB-GYNs] we have an obligation to look at where our field can have an impact.‚Äù  Pregnancy during COVID-19: Coronavirus is a lurking danger for pregnant women. Congress should act.  Both Conry and DeNicola stress the importance of recognizing that one of the greatest consequences of climate change is its association with human health.     ""Who‚Äôs the image of climate change? For a while it‚Äôs been the polar bear ‚Äì the polar bear on a floating iceberg. More recently, it‚Äôs kind of become the super-storm ‚Äì and maybe the TV journalists blowing in the wind in those super-storms,"" DeNicola said.  ""[But] really the image of climate change and its effects should be human health ‚Äì kids and pregnant women being affected right now.‚Äù  The lead author of the study, Dr. Bruce Bekkar, MD, a retired obstetrician and current full-time climate activist, agrees. He also describes why their research in this particular study focused exclusively on the U.S.:  ""We purposely excluded papers that had any sort of population in them that were other than US domestic, because we want people to understand the impact of this story,"" he said. ""It may well be worse in other places, but you can‚Äôt step away from the findings of our story and say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs happening somewhere else.‚Äô It‚Äôs literally all around us all over the country right now.‚Äù  The subpopulations found in the investigation to have highest risk included minority groups, especially Black mothers, and well as individuals with asthma.  Conry explains how under-served women who do outdoor labor, or live in a ""desert in the cities,"" for example, are strongly impacted.  ‚ÄúBlack and Hispanic women who are working in the farms or in the fields...they‚Äôve got heat and air pollution, so they‚Äôre particularly vulnerable,"" she said.  More: Hospitals know how to protect mothers. They just aren‚Äôt doing it.  As environments and living conditions across the world, and even the country, vary, the importance of education is stressed.  ‚ÄùWe hope [women and families] realize that this is a risk factor for them that they need to engage with,"" said Bekkar. ""And that means asking their [health care providers] ways specifically that they can address it, because these effects vary so widely in terms of time of year, and location geographically.‚Äù  Dig Deeper  You may also be interested in  ACOG finds climate change to be an urgent concern to women's health, as well as a major public health challenge worldwide ‚Äì something the organization reaffirmed in April 2018.  ""Climate change has a disproportionate effect on global women‚Äôs health, as it broadens existing gender-based health disparities,"" ACOG wrote in a position statement.      ""We ask that government and public health agencies take steps to ensure the protection of women‚Äôs health services and human rights.""  And although Conry feels that even more research could be done, she stresses that that doesn't need to halt change.  ""We don‚Äôt have to wait for all the research to take place to be able to take a strong stance on climate change, on air pollution, on the quality of life,"" she said. ""I think that‚Äôs what ACOG stands for ‚Äì we‚Äôre saying, prioritize health and the environment, and we call for reproductive and environmental justice.‚Äù  In terms of policy, Conry urges the U.S. to re-join, and be a leader, of the Paris Climate Agreement. She also suggests that more regulations may be necessary ‚Äì whether that be changing air standards, or improving working conditions.  ‚ÄúGlobal health should be a guiding light,"" said Conry, ""so when we say that we‚Äôve got a crisis, we need to address it as the global emergency it is.""  Bekkar, DeNicola and Conry explain the need for all parties ‚Äì the medical community, policymakers, and families themselves across the country ‚Äì to learn more and act, in order to help combat these serious consequences.  ‚ÄúWe spend, as obstetricians, so much time counseling pregnant women about all these precautions,"" said DeNicola. ""But there‚Äôs only so much [pregnant women] can do, they realistically cannot control the temperature outside or the air pollution that they encounter, and so, beyond the individual actions...the real solutions are system solutions, and primarily those are controlled by policymakers.‚Äù  Both DeNicola and Bekkar also believe that they can already see some change, but it's an ongoing process.  ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a time, right now, in society where we‚Äôre being reminded that we‚Äôre not just independent, we‚Äôre all connected...all of those sort of micro-decisions make a significant impact on the exposures that people face,"" said Bekkar. ""All of these exposures are at the hands of elected officials, so, come November, no one should vote for anybody that doesn‚Äôt stand up against the climate crisis and want to do something about it right now.""  ""As we‚Äôve so vividly been shown around the world in the past couple of months, when you stop burning fossil fuels so much, when traffic drops off and airplanes fly less and things like that ‚Äì nature rebounds...and that has a direct impact on people's health.""

USA-2020-37.txt,"Climate change may push polar bears to the brink of extinction within 100 years, study says    Doyle Rice | USA TODAY  All but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found. The bears' habitat of sea ice is predicted to decline to such an extent that the animals will be food deprived. As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.  All but a few polar bears in the Arctic will likely be gone by the end of the century, a new study suggests, unless measures are taken to reduce the production of greenhouse gases that cause global warming.  The bears' habitat of sea ice is predicted to decline to such an extent that the animals will be deprived of food.   ""Ultimately, the bears need food and in order to have food, they need ice,"" P√©ter Moln√°r, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough and one of the authors of the study, told CNN. ""But in order for them to have ice, we need to control climate change.""  Polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt, and when the ice is absent, they are forced onto land where they cannot find food. As Arctic sea ice declines in response to warming temperatures, polar bears must fast for longer periods.   Prolonged fasting periods have been linked to reduced body condition, reproduction and survival in some polar bear populations, the study found. Continued sea ice loss ultimately threatens polar bear survival Arctic-wide.   ""Previously, we knew that polar bears would ultimately disappear unless we halt greenhouse gas rise. But knowing when they will begin to disappear in different areas is critical for informing management and policy ‚Äì and inspiring action,‚Äù said the University of Wyoming's Steven Amstrup, who conceived the project and is a co-author of the study.   Amstrup is also the chief scientist at Polar Bears International, a conservation organization dedicated to polar bears.      The authors modeled polar bear survival under a high greenhouse-gas emissions scenario, which, if it occurs, would mean that all but a few polar bear populations would collapse by 2100, the study found.  Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are produced from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal.   ""Showing how imminent the threat is for different polar bear populations is another reminder that we must act now to head off the worst of future problems faced by us all,‚Äù said Amstrup.

June 20 hit 100 degrees (38 degrees Celsius) for an Arctic record.  The analysis, published Wednesday, showed that prolonged heat such as Siberia experienced this year would happen less than once in every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change ‚Äì ""making it almost impossible in a climate that had not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions,"" the study said.

""Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.‚Äù  Arctic heat record: One of the coldest places on Earth recorded its hottest temperature ever: 100.4 degrees  To reach their conclusions, scientists used 70 climate models running thousands of complex simulations comparing current conditions with a world without man-made warming from the burning of coal, oil and gas.  ‚ÄúThis study shows again just how much of a game changer climate change is with respect to heat waves,"" said study co-author Friederike Otto, acting director of Oxford University‚Äôs Environmental Change Institute. ""Given that heat waves are by far the deadliest extreme weather events in most parts of the world, they must be taken very seriously.""  Researchers said the heat worsened widespread wildfires, pest outbreaks and the thawing of permafrost, which led to a massive pipeline oil spill. Thawing permafrost has the potential to release huge amounts of greenhouse gases trapped under the frozen     ground, which could worsen the warming, scientists said.  Scientists said that without rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, extreme heat waves could become frequent by the end of the century.  ‚ÄúThe climate of the future is very different, as this paper shows,‚Äù said Pennsylvania State University meteorology professor David Titley, who wasn‚Äôt part of the research. ‚ÄúWe can either adapt or suffer.‚Äù      "

David Callaway | Opinion contributor  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî The lightning struck just as I glanced outside my second-floor window a recent morning, one of dozens of strikes in the Bay Area in the pre-dawn darkness as a violent heat storm bore down on Northern California. This one caught, and within minutes, a massive tree was in flames less than a mile from my house. Sirens blared.  Lightning storms are rare in this part of the world, but wildfires are not. This was the first time I had seen one start, though, and by the time I grabbed my wallet and awakened my wife to help bang on neighbors‚Äô doors, firefighters had doused it. Others have not been so lucky, as you‚Äôve no doubt read.

Oh, and COVID-19.  Rolling uncertainty   To add to the chaos, energy regulators bungled the heat wave, running out of electricity just as temperatures soared above 100 degrees last weekend in the late afternoons.  In scenes many residents remember from the bad old days of Enron Corp. two decades ago, California‚Äôs Independent Systems Operator (ISO) had to institute rolling blackouts for two nights.  Critics were quick to blame the state‚Äôs enthusiasm for renewable energy, citing its use of solar power for the majority of its energy during daytime hours. The solar power wasn‚Äôt the issue, though. It was poor forecasting on how much energy would be needed to     sustain the millions of residential air conditioners fired up in those few hottest hours before darkness.  'Trump digs coal' symbolism, not policy: Don't fuel Donald Trump's culture war on climate change. Beat it instead.  California ISO typically sources energy from neighboring states when it runs low, but because of the heat wave, there was little energy to share.  Bureaucratic bungling is nothing new in California. But the events of the past week give us a glimpse of what the coming climate battles will look like: Natural disasters. Extreme distress, particularly among the low-income, minority neighborhoods. Finger- pointing by politicians and regulators. Lack of preparation.  Across America, we‚Äôre getting a taste of what the next few decades hold in terms of climate change. More hurricanes and rising seas in the East, flooding and more tornadoes in the Midwest. Fires in the West. Water shortages. Angry people.  Climate scientists point to the turmoil this year as proof that the changes aren‚Äôt just coming; they‚Äôre here. The damage we‚Äôve done through greenhouse gas emissions is not something we can turn off. It‚Äôs done. We can only hope to act so that it won‚Äôt get worse than this.  A matter of survival  Seven years ago, I worked with talented USA TODAY reporters across the United States to produce a series on what various parts of the country would look like in two decades. Almost halfway there, it‚Äôs clear it is going to be even more dire than experts told us in 2013.  Joe Biden‚Äôs climate plan, highlighted last week during the Democratic National Convention, is a potpourri of ambitious ideas designed to appease the progressive wing of the party while not completely alienating the moderate Republicans. There is no ban on fossil fuel subsidies, for example, nor on fracking to extract oil and gas from rock by injecting high-pressure mixtures of water, sand or gravel and chemicals. But it is a plan and something to build on, compared with the alternative of more denial, drilling and auto emission rollbacks.  Climate change: Put a price on carbon pollution, then refund the money to consumers  From Wall Street to Silicon Valley, though, there is a rising wave of money making its way toward sustainable investments ‚Äî $1 trillion in sustainable funds, according to the financial service UBS. That money will be aimed at companies trying to cut their carbon footprints and seeking solutions such as electric vehicles and energy efficient buildings. The idea of doing good and making profit at the same time is catching like a, uh, wildfire.     Last week marked the second anniversary of Greta Thunberg‚Äôs Friday school strikes to promote fighting climate change. Most of the world‚Äôs governments remain ‚Äúin a state of denial,‚Äù she co-wrote in a column in The Guardian.  That denial is real. And with it comes apathy, which is probably more dangerous. The climate debate will be an important part of the coming election. Even more so afterward, no matter who wins. The time to solve it has long passed. It‚Äôs a matter of survival now. Our new climate reality is here, and it‚Äôs getting worse.

USA-2020-41.txt,"Climate Point: Trouble in the Galapagos. Drilling in Alaska? And more record heat.    rollbacks/3356618001  Mark Olalde .  We'll get to wildfires, scorching temperatures and Beltway politics shortly, but let's start in our nation's heartland, where The Indianapolis Star reports that the state agency tasked with protecting the environment has been flooded with requests to ease up on rules during the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the asks came from typical polluters, for example, a coal company with a history of violations, leaving the state trying to walk a fine line in granting exceptions.  And while we're talking about our great Indianapolis partners in the USA Today Network, a quick shout out to a new effort by reporters London Gibson and Sarah Bowman to answer your burning questions about the environment in that region. They're calling it the ""Scrub Hub,"" and they've steeled themselves to answer your toughest queries and quandaries.  And now, here's some other important reporting from around the country (and world)...  MUST-READ STORIES  Fishing for trouble. China's abysmal environmental track record is no secret and neither are its international ambitions. The Guardian reports the latest twist, as a fleet of more than 200 Chinese-flagged fishing vessels is threatening the Galapagos islands, world-renowned for their biodiversity. ""It was a slaughterhouse,"" one scientist who has been studying species around the islands told the newspaper of Asian fleets' fishing methods.  You take my breath away. Back in the U.S., Sharon Lerner reports for The Intercept on the realities of environmental racism. She dives into the confluence of COVID-19, the environment and demographics, writing that the pandemic has actually made pollution worse in some unsettling ways. In New Jersey, for example, regulators expanded permits for crematoriums to allow them to continuously operate due to such an increase in deaths. In one Newark neighborhood, this means a  stream of virus-fueled air emissions coming from five different sites.  What is pristine wilderness worth? When it comes to campaign promises, President Donald Trump has done his best to stick to his word. One promise, expanded domestic fossil fuel production, has been stymied by forces like the pandemic, but the     president has a chance to achieve a ""decadeslong Republican dream"" in Alaskan oil and gas. The administration is expected to soon sell the first leases for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, although there's one problem (besides climate change and habitat destruction). It appears that politicos are meddling in the scientific review process that must be completed before such a decision. Adam Federman investigates for Politico.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  Breaking barriers. Win or lose, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., already checked a number of firsts when former Vice President Joe Biden selected her as his running mate. She's been blasted for being everything from not progressive enough to too progressive, so what does she mean for Democrats and their ever-shifting stance on the environment? InsideClimate News provides one interesting take on that question, writing that she's not the greenest candidate in history but that she's leaning further that way over time. Of note, Harris has promised that, if she and Biden win, she would bring her background as a prosecutor to the White House and make polluters pay while also prioritizing issues of environmental justice.  Trumping science. Meanwhile, the current administration continues to roll back environmental regulations at a breathtaking clip. The latest step came via the Environmental Protection Agency, which targeted rules governing methane emitted by oil and gas companies, HuffPost reports. For reference, methane has 86 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide in the short term, and the oil and gas industry is a massive emitter via unchecked leaks in its infrastructure.  A red-hot debate. While we're talking about the world getting hotter...wildfires. For The Desert Sun, I recently wrote about the Apple Fire, which has become the second- largest blaze in this part of Southern California in more than a decade. But wildfire management has been too successful over the past century. The result is a carpet of highly flammable fuel throughout the West's forests and grasslands. More and more, though, scientists are arguing that government land management agencies have over- corrected, now taking a burn-first approach that decimates landscapes while doing little to stop catastrophic infernos.  FOSSIL FUELS VS. RENEWABLES  Black and blue. Oil and water don't mix. Well, they're not supposed to, at least. The BBC reports that a Japanese tanker has been grounded off the shore of Mauritius, an African island nation, for several weeks and recently started leaking oil. While the toxic spill is small compared to more famous catastrophes, it's dumping into the Blue Bay Marine Park reserve, ""a wetland of international importance.""  Baltimore blowup. A huge explosion in Baltimore on Monday ripped apart three rowhouses, The Baltimore Sun writes, leaving one person dead. It's far from the first time a gas leak has led to such a fatal outcome, and some activists are seizing on the     moment to call for homes to be electrified to alleviate concerns of safety, public health and emissions.  Sun in the sky, you know how I feel. Wood Mackenzie, an international consulting firm, predicts solar installations will drop this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Greentech Media reports. But the firm's analysis isn't all gloomy news for the growing renewable energy source. About 70% of the country's commercial buildings are still targets for economically viable solar arrays, which could translate to 145 gigawatts of electricity potential.  AND ANOTHER THING  Mercury rising. If you keep up with this newsletter, you know we cover a lot of ground each week. But, the central question of climate change remains. Sometimes it's tough to see how invisible molecules of carbon dioxide and other gases are rapidly changing our planet. This wasn't one of those weeks.  The Arizona Republic reported that Phoenix just had its hottest summer in recorded history. The Washington Post reported that Baghdad's record-breaking heat is so bad that metal door handles can blister skin. And Dinah Voyles Pulver and I reported that California, too, is throwing out the history book. Palm Springs recently hit 122 degrees. Climate change is here.  Here are the latest numbers:      "
USA-2020-42.txt,"Climate Point: Big oil is headed back to court while Congress considers paying for its cleanup    paying-its-cleanup/3258906001  Mark Olalde .  The oil and gas industry has had a weird year ‚Äî haven't we all? ‚Äî that hs seen its prices temporarily dip negative, the Rockefellers (of all people) divest and make money off the decision, and oil tankers act as floating reserves for the glut of product.  This week, the industry's winding path through 2020 continued as it was hit by two new lawsuits. On Wednesday, the state of Minnesota slapped ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute with a consumer fraud lawsuit, claiming the companies and trade group lied to the public about climate change for 30 years, the Star Tribune reports. A day later, E&E writes, Washington, D.C., also took on the oil supermajors, building a legal argument linking the petroleum industry's advertising practices to those employed by the tobacco industry.  But there's more to talk about than court cases, so here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Cleanup vs. bailout. House Democrats on Monday unveiled a $1.5 trillion ‚Äî yes, trillion with a T ‚Äî package that bundled a coronavirus stimulus, an infrastructure bill and various other ideas that have sat on the shelf for years. In recent weeks, the idea of a New Deal-esque jobs program that would put oilfield workers back on the job plugging orphan oil and gas wells gained significant momentum. It was included in the package to the tune of $2 billion, which could be a huge environmental win if it leads to orphan well cleanup. On the other hand, it could be yet another fossil fuel industry subsidy. Energy News Network has the inside story.  Insult to injury. The Navajo Nation's per-capita coronavirus rate has been the worst in the country for much of the pandemic, and one cause that keeps popping up is a lack of access to clean water. Bloomberg reports that many Navajo citizens are pointing the finger at Peabody Energy, the country's largest coal-mining company, which they say ""pulled so much water from the Navajo Aquifer before closing its last mining operation there last August that many wells and springs have run dry.""     ""Climate change is killing Americans."" Columbia Journalism Investigations, the Center for Public Integrity and The Guardian put it pretty bluntly with that title. Their collaboration is out with an investigation that found heat-related deaths are on the rise, while federal programs meant to protect citizens from this growing threat have been left underfunded and floundering.  King Coal on its deathbed. The coal industry still looms large in America's politics and psyche, but the industry is rapidly losing its place in the country's energy mix, especially as the pandemic stalls demand. An investigation from environmental publication DeSmogBlog reveals that a potential insurance bubble could leave billions of dollars of coal mine cleanup costs unprotected ‚Äî meaning we the taxpayers would be on the hook ‚Äî exactly as the latter-day coal barons walk away.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  The never-ending story. The Salton Sea in Southern California has transformed in recent decades from leisure destination to a source of toxic, lung-damaging dust, as the shoreline recedes and exposes accumulated pollution. For The Desert Sun, I've got the latest on government infighting over the mishandling of habitat restoration projects that have gone unfinished for years.  Cap and trade hits tough times. California's cap and trade program has been an ambitious attempt to limit carbon dioxide emissions while making money for the state to use on environmental projects. But this year, the auction the state holds to sell pollution permits dropped from hundreds of millions of dollars to $25 million. Rachel Becker of CalMatters obtained a letter from the head of the state's environmental agency that revealed a plan to review the entire system.  Blowing up the desert. Benjamin Spillman at the Reno Gazette-Journal writes that Fallon Naval Air Station in Nevada was recently denied two proposals that would've given it an additional 900,000 acres for bombing and other training purposes. The decision was a win for several area tribes as well as conservationists who don't want to see more of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge given to the military, but their victory might only be temporary.  CONSERVATION RUNS INTO A WALL  Walled off. The Trump administration is barreling ahead with the president's border fence, KUNC in Arizona reports, which is now cutting across the San Pedro, the last free-flowing river in the Grand Canyon State. Construction of the border wall has been allowed to discount numerous laws, and local public officials and residents are worried about its impacts on flood control and wildlife there.  Strip mining the ocean. And if we're talking about extreme impacts to ecosystems, how about mining the ocean floor? Mongabay and the Cook Islands News report that the tourism-dependent economy of the remote island chain in the south Pacific Ocean     has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, compelling its leaders to rethink protections for its marine exclusive economic zone. Now, they're considering opening it up to some of the world's first undersea strip mining, which could come with disastrous results to marine environments that would be blanketed with a plume of dumped mine waste.  We're yelling timber. In a narrative that seemingly mirrors the out-of-state landowners controlling the rolling hills of Appalachia, the Oregonian, Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica report that Wall Street investors have bought up much of the Pacific Northwest's logging industry. Instead of smaller operations that try to preserve the industry, these investment firm-backed loggers aggressively clear cut forests, reduce biodiversity, remove the carbon-capturing benefits of old-growth trees and rely on tax breaks that leave Oregon with little to no benefit.  AND ANOTHER THING  Maybe we've still got a chance. Environmental news anymore is often politicians ignoring science, the mercury ever rising, and sea levels, well, also rising. But perhaps we have some good news that suggests we can still address our human-caused environmental catastrophes. Circle of Blue reports that California, Nevada and Arizona's use of the Colorado River in 2019 fell to a 33-year low, as cities saw significant gains in conservation and efficiency.

USA-2020-43.txt,"Climate Point: Russia spills oil in the Arctic; fossil fuels are labeled 'white supremacy'    white-supremacy/5324974002  Mark Olalde | USA TODAY Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I‚Äôm Mark Olalde.  In what could be a harbinger of things to come, melting permafrost inside the Arctic Circle in Russia caused a fuel tank to topple, spilling 21,000 tons of diesel over 135 square miles and into the Ambarnaya and Daldykan rivers. USA Today has the details of a catastrophe that speaks to both the causes and the effects of climate change globally.  Like we discussed last week, however, the quickly shifting climate won't impact everyone equally ...  LET'S KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING  If protesters can continue filling the streets, we can continue talking about the issues. In case you missed my conversation with Mustafa Santiago Ali of the National Wildlife Federation, you can catch up on his thoughts here. Ali talked about environmental racism in its many forms, but how does it manifest locally? To dive deeper, I called Gustavo Aguirre Jr. ‚Äî the only person I've heard compare environmental justice to tres leches due to its layers ‚Äî who is the Kern County director with the Central California Environmental Justice Network.  Kern is home to three-quarters of California's oil and gas industry and massive agribusiness, so the pollution there is harsh. I grew up with debilitating allergies and asthma ‚Äî it's important to note that my family could afford to keep a parent home and keep me in filtered air conditioning when I got sick as a child ‚Äî so of course I first encountered Kern during the almond harvest. I was only reporting there for a few days, yet breathing was nearly impossible. Needless to say, I was miserable, and in reflecting on environmental racism, my mind immediately returned to Kern where Aguirre explained that environmentalism and racial justice go hand-in-hand.  Here's our conversation, edited for length and clarity.  CP: You've got environmental justice right there in the name. What's the intersection of those issues, and why has CCEJN chosen to focus on both?     Aguirre: Really the vision of CCEJN was to make sure that the solutions that were being heard ‚Äî the solutions that were being prescribed to people in power ‚Äî were solutions that were coming from community groups. You have your ""big greens"" that really come to this from a top-down approach. ... Oftentimes that excludes and unfortunately hurts local, small-scale organizing around where a lot of the fountains of emissions and discrimination and injustice come from. ... Oftentimes the experts who are dealing with this day in and day out are the folks who live there. It was really creating a network of folks who are in the frontlines day-in and day-out, understanding what are the best solutions, taking into consideration the people who live there.  CP: So what does environmental justice look like at the ground level that's specific to the area you service?  Aguirre: The term itself ‚Äî environmental justice ‚Äî is a historical reaction to environmental racism, and if you just take ""environmental"" out of there, it's a reaction to racism. Where really this comes from, in the early '80s and early '90s when these major sources of emissions were being built ‚Äî for example the landfill in Kettleman City ‚Äî if you start looking at the context of who are the people behind these decisions and who are the people giving the authority and insight to these corporations to land in these communities, you start to look at documents and studies and references like the Cerrell report. It's a report that comes from a consultant in Los Angeles. ... They study communities throughout California to see where's the best place to put ‚Äî for example, a toxic incinerator ‚Äî and have no one fight back. ... And it's looking at locations that have low density of higher education. It's looking at communities that are mostly working in labor and an extractive industry. It's communities that are dependent and highly participant in religion. And it's looking at communities that are mostly comprised of people of color. ... The intersection of having these industrial, toxic polluters built near or next to communities of color really tells the story of this long inheritance.  CP: Are there specific aspects of this issue that are unique to California because of its large Latino population?  Aguirre: The origins of my ancestors, the Aztecs, were in California. The birthplace was here, and then they migrated south. ... Then you have the country of Mexico, a lot of it was north of the border of the current United States. ... Historically, my people have always been on the land. ... You would think that ""let's make sure the folks who were previously here were honored in a more grateful way,"" right? But then you look at communities like Coachella, Mecca, Indio, Blythe, Arvin, Lost Hills, Matheny Tract, Stockton. ... The people that work and pick and harvest and transport the richest that come from these fields are all people of color. The people that are suffering at the very front lines exposure to pesticides, exposure to 1,3-D are people of color. The people who are constantly sprayed through pesticide drifts in the fields are people of color. Something else we do at CCEJN is look at county budgets. Where is money     allocated, and where is money not allocated? ... Then on top of that, when we look at where has money been invested in these communities, that's another huge driver of growing inequality.  CP: In this state, there's a strong history of organizing, but what needs to happen to address environmental justice issues? What's the next step in California?  Aguirre: There's definitely not enough organizing here in the San Joaquin Valley in California. There's definitely an opportunity and a space to ensure grassroots community organizing is uplifted. And how do you accomplish that and what are some of the goals? Historically, we've had extremely low and weak political power here. We've put people of color in power, but not much has changed to be frankly honest. So, it's time to really look at those progressive, forward-thinking minds with justice at the forefront.  ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IN ACTION  Wrong side of the water pipe. In a must-read, the Fresno Bee and the Investigative Reporting Workshop tell us a story that's all-too-common here in California: a low- income, minority community doesn't have access to safe drinking water while it's situated adjacent to first world infrastructure. In this case, the community is called Tooleville, and its residents are fighting to get hooked up to a reliable water system. ""When small communities of color like Tooleville ask for a basic service like access to safe drinking water, they get labeled as aggressive,‚Äù said Michael Claiborne, an attorney who's assisting the community.  Black gold matters. As protests against police brutality and systemic racism rage on, myriad companies have chosen to or been forced to respond. Among them was oil supermajor BP, whose CEO condemned racism. But, Kate Aronoff of The New Republic wasn't impressed and delivered a thought- and debate-provoking rebuttal. ""Fossil fuels' rise and reign is a story of white supremacy: of Western powers and corporations claiming resources from the global south and maintaining access to them through imperial might,"" she wrote.  Total rejection. In a win for one frontline community, the city council in Arlington, Texas, recently voted down a proposal from French oil supermajor Total. The company had hoped to drill three gas wells within several hundred feet of a daycare center in a predominantly Latino and black neighborhood, the Houston Chronicle writes, and advocates had written the project off as almost laughably dangerous.  IMPORTANT STORIES OF THE DAY  The coming flood. As a changing climate intensifies extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes, American taxpayers might just be handed a bill for billions of dollars, Politico has found. The reason? Mortgage guarantees and flood insurance, the biggest government-supported housing subsidies, will take a beating as more homes find themselves in the path of these destructive storms, fires and floods. Meanwhile,     fewer people are taking out flood insurance policies, even though they're supposed to if they have a government-backed mortgage.  It's just a hill, and it's on fire. Picture the side of a hill. Then imagine that it's starting to crack, there's a smell of burning and smoke trickles up from the ground. It might sound like the rapture, but it's actually the somewhat common phenomenon of disused coal mines burning underground. The Centennial State has 38 such fires that have been listed as high priority and that can burn for years on end, Colorado Public Radio reports. Check out this interesting explainer.  Good news if you're feeling blue. The Arizona Republic reports that there might be some positive news for the water-strapped West. While climate change is hitting the already over-allocated Colorado River, new research suggests that two smaller, but still key, rivers in the basin appear to be more resilient to rising global temperatures. Phoenix isn't going to stop being unbearably hot, but its reservoirs do appear to have some protection.  COVID-19 HASN'T GONE AWAY  Between the worldwide protests against racism and states quickly reopening as if the coronavirus pandemic were finished, it's easy to feel like we beat the virus. In fact, it's spreading faster than ever in a number of states, so let's check in on its environmental implications.  Going green to stay in the black. BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, made waves in the financial world when it decided to make climate change an important factor in its investment decisions. But now, the company is assisting the U.S. government with a $750 billion bailout of American businesses that are hurting from the coronavirus-fueled economic slowdown. It has to play by the fossil fuel-loving administration's rules, not its own, and it might have to walk back some of its environmentally friendly promises in divvying up the cash, Bloomberg reports.  Charlotte's interweb. Meatpacking plants have been hit by coronavirus outbreaks, keeping workers off the line and creating a bottleneck in America's meat industry. Civil Eats reports that pork production is down 10 percent year-over-year, and pig farmers are being forced to euthanize animals. To avoid this waste, many farmers are turning to informal, direct-to-customer sales online, although that's leading to health concerns as the sales circumvent typical regulatory processes.  Under the cover of coronavirus. Some tribal nations have been hit extraordinarily hard by COVID-19, and as their attention is taken up by the emergency, the federal government decided to move closer to permitting a controversial project, Arlyssa Becenti of the Navajo Times writes. As many as 3,101 new oil and gas wells could be drilled if the government approves a proposal that has been panned for its potential impacts to the area surrounding Chaco Canyon ‚Äî a national historical park and a UNESCO world heritage site ‚Äî in New Mexico.     AND ANOTHER THING  Very powerful light. Energy policy is always wonky, but now a petition filed by a secretive nonprofit ‚Äî Does it represent ratepayers? Is it an industry front group? ‚Äî could rip up one of the foundational rules that helped build rooftop solar.

USA-2020-44.txt,"As Donald Trump trashes science on coronavirus and climate change, nature responds in kind    responds-editorials-debates/5640070002  Our View: COVID-19 failure fits a Trump administration so into denying what's behind Hurricane Laura. But natural disasters won't be politicized.  The Editorial Board | USA TODAY  It is perhaps fitting that, as President Donald Trump prepared to address the Republican National Convention on Thursday night, a Category 4 hurricane crashed into the Gulf Coast, wildfires were burning in California and the U.S. death toll from COVID-19 topped 180,000.  Science can be ignored, denied, spun and politicized. But in the end it will make itself heard. It is being heard loud and clear in these catastrophic, or potentially catastrophic, occurrences.  It's almost as though nature is punishing America for two of its worst instances of escapism, denialism and repeated policy failure.  Hurricane Laura's rapid intensification  One is inaction on climate change, which is helping to spawn hellish Western wildfires, drought and decreasing snowcaps in the Rockies, frequent sunny-day flooding in coastal zones, and anomalous weather events like twin tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Laura's rapid intensification was fueled by unusually warm Gulf waters.  The second instance is an ungainly, profit-driven health care system that was ill prepared for a pandemic to begin with. The response has been made worse because the president has been misstating facts, pitching miracle cures and desperately trying to spin some kind of political gain out of morbid and macabre events.  The pandemic doesn‚Äôt care about the presidential election, and it won‚Äôt be used as a stage prop. If public officials don‚Äôt use science to full effect as a countermeasure, it will continue to take human lives with indifference. Likewise, the climate will only get     warmer if action is not taken, unimpeded by the the glib deniers on cable television and in government.  The climate change and the horrific scope of the pandemic in the USA are both consequences of the belittling of science. It should not come as surprise that an administration so into denying climate science would also botch the response to the pandemic.  Before Election Day  The administration failed to listen to doctors on the severity of the crisis early on, and it was late to promote the wearing of masks and to prioritize testing. Now the White House has its sights set on making a big announcement on vaccines or treatments before Election Day.  To that end, Trump and his team of senior health officials misstated facts, misrepresented data and made unsupported statements last weekend on the efficacy of an experimental COVID-19 treatment that received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.  The treatment, which involves extracting antibody-rich blood plasma from recovered patients and injecting it into the bloodstream of sick ones, holds considerable promise. But administration officials pulled out a small subsample from a Mayo Clinic study on plasma treatment to claim that it reduced deaths by 35%, a claim that both bewildered and troubled the study‚Äôs authors.  Everyone wants to see effective treatments. But to politicize scientific announcements is to raise suspicion that corners are being cut. It could also prompt Americans to distrust government just when trust is needed to promote vaccinations.   In any event, science and nature will have the last word.

Construction of the arena, which will be 100% powered by on-site solar panels and offsite solar farms, has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but is expected to be completed in plenty of time for the start of the 2021-22 NHL season.

USA-2020-48.txt,"Borders can't contain climate change: California‚Äôs crisis is a world management issue    column/5818005002  This week California. Next week the Gulf Coast. Next month Australia. Around the world, we all see the impact of climate change.  David Callaway | Opinion contributor  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî The United States election season‚Äôs climate detour hit the West Coast this week, with surreal terms like ‚Äúclimate arsonist‚Äù and ‚Äúmore explosive"" trees competing for headlines as the smoke stank and the candidates bickered.  Climate change is a convenient club for former Vice President Joe Biden to pound President Donald Trump with. And for Trump in turn to beat California Democrats with. But it‚Äôs not an election issue priority for either.  That‚Äôs because most Americans can now witness the effects of climate change with their own eyes, either through West Coast fires, East Coast hurricanes or Midwest flooding. There is still disagreement on cause, but little on the fact that it is here. Three dozen Republicans running for U.S. House and Senate offices this election season have climate strategies or prioritize the environment, according to endorsements from the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative climate group.  The apocalyptic orange skies that encased San Francisco‚Äôs Bay Area last week are gone, giving way to a blanket of thick smoke for the millions of residents, which unlike COVID-19, presents a visible threat outside our home windows. Even as the state ‚Äî and Oregon and Washington north of it ‚Äî begins a slow recovery from a summer of COVID spikes, the prospect of two more months of fire season has caused a general depression that psychologists call ‚Äúclimate change grief.‚Äù  You will hear more about this in coming months. Because contrary to President Trump‚Äôs assertion that California‚Äôs problems are a ""forest management"" issue, and that other countries don‚Äôt have these problems, even though they have ‚Äúmore explosive"" trees, California‚Äôs problem is the world‚Äôs problem.  Wildfire season on the move     Wildfire season will soon begin in Australia and New Zealand. China and India have wildfires. Israel has had wildfires. South America has them, and this summer the Arctic has burned like never before. The world is not on fire, as some headlines suggest. But it is burning more, a result of higher temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions.  Wildfires, blackouts, anger: California shows us the future of climate change  The goal of the Paris Agreement, endorsed by 197 countries in 2015 to set a limit on further global average temperature increases from greenhouse gas emissions to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, has not been breached yet. Some scientists believe it will be in the next four years.  If what we are experiencing now is a result of temperatures that are only about 1 degrees Celsius higher or a little more, what can we expect at 1.5 degrees Celsius? Or even 2 degrees Celsius?  Next week is ‚Äúclimate week‚Äù in New York City, hosted by Climate Week NYC, in association with the United Nations and the City of New York. In past years, world leaders have flocked to the UN for their annual gathering, and climate has become more and more of an important topic. This year, while most events will be virtual because of COVID, we should still expect to hear pledges of new commitments and new money directed toward climate solutions.  Not acting fast enough  While welcome, the biggest disconnect between the climate disasters now and the corporate and political pledges of support, is that the pledges all target a year in the distant future, such as 2030 or 2050. Large institutions on Wall Street and in Europe are increasingly directing money now into investments in solutions, but even those come with a promised outcome still years away.  Toxic outside, contagious inside: Fire and COVID rage all around me. Can't we do better?  The COVID-inspired decline in greenhouse gas emissions earlier this year has now largely been squandered, as China and India regear their factories, and as the fires wipe out any gains we might have made against pollution. Biden may be reaching to call Trump a ‚Äúclimate arsonist,‚Äù as are debunked social media rumors that antifa arsonists are setting the fires out West. But the idea that we are increasingly burning our environment is no stretch. Here in California, we can taste it.  In the end, Trump is not completely off base. Climate change is a management issue. The president‚Äôs management issue. The world‚Äôs management issue. This week California. Next week the Gulf Coast. Next month Australia.  The settings change, but the results will not. Despite the smoke, we can see where this is going.      David Callaway is a former editor-in-chief of USA TODAY and the founder of Callaway Climate Insights.      "

Plus: Inmate firefighters get some help.  I'm Cheri Carlson, a reporter at the Ventura County Star, with the news to know headed into the weekend.  But first, here‚Äôs a story about a tiny kitten that survived the Bear Fire. The mewing ""fire cat"" found some safety inside a firefighter‚Äôs jacket pocket, escaping the still-smoldering ash.  In California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.  'A climate damn emergency'  The hottest August in state history. Record-breaking temperatures. Drought. Millions of dead trees and 14,000 dry lightning strikes in three days.   Gov. Gavin Newsom said Friday: ‚ÄúThe debate is over around climate change. Just come to the state of California, observe it with your own eyes.""  The Associated Press said he pledged to redouble efforts to ‚Äúdecarbonize"" the economy as he toured Butte County where the North Complex Fire ripped through the town of Berry Creek this week.  Newsom also warned the nation that the record wildfire season may be a glimpse into its future, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Political leaders need to start taking the climate crisis seriously, he said.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a little bit exhausted that we have to continue to debate this issue,"" Newsom said. ""This is a climate damn emergency. This is real and it‚Äôs happening.""  It is only a matter a time before climate change also takes a major toll on the tourism industry, including in the Palm Springs area and elsewhere. As the number of hot days piles up, ""snowbird season"" could be cut by more than a third, The Desert Sun reports.  Death toll climbs; firefighting inmates get some help     Crews reported some progress on California's fires Friday. The death toll, however, climbed to 20. Half of those victims died in the North Complex Fire burning near Oroville, according to the Los Angeles Times.   One was a 16-year-old boy from Berry Creek. He was remembered by family members as outdoorsy and adventurous.  Each year, the state's firefighting force includes hundreds of inmates trained in California's prison system. Now, a new law will help give them a shot at becoming professional firefighters once they complete their sentences.  The Associated Press reported the governor has signed legislation to allow state and county inmates who train as firefighters to seek to erase their criminal records. Those records often are a bar to employment.  ‚ÄúThese individuals have received valuable training and placed themselves in danger to defend the life and property of Californians,‚Äù said Assemblywoman Eloise Reyes, a Democrat from San Bernardino who authored the bill.  A grim anniversary; planning for mass vaccinations  Communities around the country Friday honored the lives lost 19 years ago in the  terrorist attacks. In Ventura County, people gathered outside a fire station early Friday morning.  Mass vaccination clinics at stadiums or other large venues? It's possible, Ventura County's Public Health Officer told the Ventura County Star. When a vaccine becomes available, medical volunteers could be asked to perform COVID-19 vaccinations in mass clinics and local hospitals could also be tapped to deliver shots.  Planning to head outdoors this weekend? First, here's a reminder that smoky skies continue to blanket the state and the San Jose Mercury News reports it may stay that way for a while. Air quality alerts have been issued both near and far from where the fires are burning.

USA-2020-5.txt,"Climate Point: Trump can't recall his environmental stance in debate    Mark Olalde .  Did you watch the presidential debate on Tuesday night? I'm so sorry. But surprisingly, moderator Chris Wallace did ask about climate change. Biden walked a center-left line, nodding to the wildfires sweeping the West and pledging to rejoin the Paris Agreement but distancing himself from the Green New Deal, instead committing to his own plan. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äî a progressive leader and champion of the Green New Deal ‚Äî wasn't upset, defending Biden for a plan that environmental experts have said is actually pretty decent.  Perhaps Biden's most important point came when he said no new coal- or oil-fired power plants would be built in the U.S. The future is renewable, he acknowledged. Trump, meanwhile, only vaguely said that humans contribute to climate change (scientists agree we're the main cause). As a crowning environmental achievement, he pointed to the plan to plant a billion trees to soak up carbon. A few things. That's not the plan ‚Äî it's a trillion tree initiative ‚Äî and, while a fantastic idea, it's a smokescreen that Republicans have begun jumping on while they avoid more important solutions like transitioning away from fossil fuels and plastics.  Sticking with the federal government for our first story, chaos continues in the country's largest land holder: the Bureau of Land Management. The never-confirmed director of the agency ‚Äî an unabashed opponent of public lands called a ""sagebrush rebel"" ‚Äî has served illegally for more than a year, a federal judge ruled. Every decision he made during that time could also be vacated, HuffPost reports.  Here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Gold, terrorism and black markets. If you haven't yet read the FinCEN Files investigation from BuzzFeed, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 108 other newsrooms that exposed banks shrugging as they were used to finance the world's dastardly deeds, you need to do so. But I'll just point out one part. Gold companies had a hand in a quarter of global suspect transactions the publications uncovered, in many cases raising suspicions of the connection between the legal and illegal mining industries, the latter of which leads to environmental destruction and gang activity in many parts of the Global South.      Perpetual pollutants. Sharon Lerner of The Intercept this week continued her stellar reporting on PFAS, a group of synthetic and likely carcinogenic chemicals that persist indefinitely in the environment. She found that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration has stalled its own effort to list several of these substances as hazardous. (Meanwhile, in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law this week that takes on PFAS, one of several environmental bills that advanced. I've got the round-up for The Desert Sun.)  Palm oil's dirty industry. The AP is out with a new investigation that found clear evidence of slavery being used in the palm oil industry, which also has a history of deforestation and other environmental woes.  POLITICAL CLIMATE  Come on, Arizona. Erin Stone from The Arizona Republic is out with an astounding deep dive into the Copper State's failed response to the climate crisis. If, like me, you've lived in Phoenix's heat, you know just how rough it can be to survive in that state. So what is the Republican stronghold doing about climate change? A mere 15 years ago, Arizona was a leader in fighting to clean up its environment. ""In recent years, the governor and the Legislature have taken no cohesive action, enacting laws that prohibit mitigation efforts at a local level. One state law even prevents state agencies from monitoring greenhouse gases,"" she writes.  The elephant in the environment. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin this week acknowledged that his party can hold up Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court for ""perhaps a matter of hours, maybe days at the most,"" but there's no stopping the GOP from barreling ahead. So, what does this mean for the environment? InsideClimate News has the details, but in short, it's tough news for the natural world. Her father was a long-time lawyer for oil supermajor Shell, she's extremely conservative and she would give a generation-lasting majority to the party that denies basic scientific facts.  Chamber made. With its headquarters overlooking the White House, the Chamber of Commerce has a huge influence on American politics. DeSmogBlog is out with a story about an environmental group's report digging into the chamber's power and how it has advocated for fossil fuels.  CHECKING IN AROUND THE COUNTRY  Every day is a wild one for the environment, but the news seems to be coming out of a fire hose these days. In the name of keeping my finger on the pulse of national environmental shenanigans, let's quickly bounce around some states' recent, top news.  Texas. The Lone Star State may be known as an oil stronghold, but its future is renewable. Forbes reports that, this year, the grid serving nearly all the state ""is scheduled to add almost as much wind as it has in the past five years combined and     almost triple its solar capacity.""  Nevada. Our USA Today Network friends at the Reno Gazette-Journal report that the Center for Biological Diversity is suing two federal agencies to protect Tiehm's buckwheat, a rare wildflower. The plant only grows on 10 acres in Nevada, and 40% of the entire species was removed or wiped out earlier this month.  Arizona. Staying in the Southwest, the Cronkite News Service writes in The Arizona Republic that the federal government has blocked the Tohono O'odham tribe from accessing one of its sacred sites near the border. This comes as the Trump administration steamrolls the tribe and numerous federal laws to continue border wall construction.  California. Ventura County, just north of Los Angeles, is now home to some of the most progressive oil regulations in the country, the Ventura County Star reports. County supervisors narrowly approved a new general plan that creates a buffer zone between oil and gas extraction and communities that is nearly half-a-mile in some places.  New Mexico. Searchlight New Mexico, a small investigative newsroom, is out with an expos√© of a foreign-run, water- and land-guzzling marijuana operation that is both likely illegal and using child labor near the Navajo Nation.  Wyoming. The Powder River Basin produces about 40% of America's coal, and the country's two largest coal mining companies had hoped to merge to dominate that region. A judge recently upheld a Federal Trade Commission decision blocking the move, S&P Global Market Intelligence reports, delivering another painful blow to the struggling industry.  AND ANOTHER THING  Forget politicians, let's look at animals. Two years ago, an orca caught the world's attention when it carried its dead calf for 17 days, sparking cries to focus on species conservation. The pod that spends time in the Puget Sound, the Seattle Times reports, appears to be doing well this year, with another baby orca born the other day, the second this month. While it's futile to measure the global scale of the extinction crisis by individual animals, hope for the future of biodiversity must be found somewhere.  And while we're on the topic of adorable animals, don't forget that it's #FatBearWeek hosted by Katmai National Park and Preserve. It's an annual celebration of huge and healthy wildlife in Alaska, and these big bears definitely deserve your votes.  Here are the latest numbers:     That‚Äôs all for now.

USA-2020-50.txt,"Climate Point: Bringing labor into green movement    Mark Olalde | USA TODAY Welcome to a special Labor Day edition of Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I‚Äôm Mark Olalde.  August is officially in the books ‚Äî the record books, that is ‚Äî and much of the West just had its hottest August since we began tracking such things. That includes large swathes of Southern California, where The Desert Sun's Colin Atagi reports the Coachella Valley, as of Tuesday, already experienced 55 days of 110 degrees or hotter this year, blasting past the previous record. To the east, Phoenix recently hit number 50 such days, The Arizona Republic reports.  At this point, consequences of climate change are already present and understood, but the push to take aggressive action to mitigate emissions still faces vehement opposition, especially from conservative. Could a green-labor partnership be the key to getting everyone on the same team?  In honor of Labor Day, let's dig in....  LABOR RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS  Addressing climate change requires the buy-in of a seemingly unrelated segment: labor. It's a convenient argument for those opposed to environmental action to say conservation kills jobs. That puts the onus on the green movement to expose that talking point as a straw man, something they've historically failed to do.  But there are two words that are now at the heart of environmentalism: Just Transition. It's an idea that advocates say holds the potential to radically expand the movement's coalition by pairing workers' rights with the right to a clean environment.  To learn more, I spoke with coalfield organizers familiar with the economic and environmental devastation left by this dying industry. From Wise County in Virginia, I called up Adam Wells, regional director of community and economic development for Appalachian Voices. In northeast Wyoming, I spoke with Shannon Anderson, staff attorney with the Powder River Basin Resource Council. These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.  Climate Point: Can you define this idea of a Just Transition?  Wells: The people and the communities that gave the most in the last economy ‚Äî in the fossil fuel based economy in the 20th century ‚Äî should be among the first to benefit from the new economy that's emerging the 21st century, the low-carbon economy...That     won't happen on its own. If we just leave capitalism to itself, by and large most of those communities and people will be left behind.  CP: We've heard stories of, say, retraining coal miners to become computer programmers, which has only worked in small numbers. What are some of the problems with these ideas?  Wells: If you try to say ‚Äî ""Well, that worked for a handful of people in one community, clearly this is the answer. We're going to train all the miners to become coders and solar installers."" ‚Äî that's just tone deaf entirely because that ignores the culture of coal mining, which is very proud... . A lot of miners are old and sick, and so if I had to say one thing that miners were going to do, it's retire... . Providing for those workers that gave the most matters, but I think the biggest challenge is still about how do we keep our young people in Appalachia and give them meaningful employment that lets them build wealth and sustain a family.  CP: In the Powder River Basin, what does the future look like for coal?  Anderson: Wyoming still produces by far the most coal in the country, even today we produce about 40% of the nation's coal... . There was a downturn prior to the coronavirus, and that has just escalated and really pushed things over an edge... . The layoffs will continue, coal production will continue to decline and it will happen very rapidly, I fear, in the coming years.  CP: Is it possible to build a new economy in Wyoming while there is still a coal industry?  Anderson: It's a question of when, not if, the coal industry will evaporate. There will be a day when the mines stop running... . Now is really the time ‚Äî while we're still producing some coal, while we still have an economy and jobs and revenue based on that industry ‚Äî that we need to start planning for the transition. But the missing piece is really political will.  CP: If we talk labor in Central Appalachia, we talk about a strong union movement that made gains for workers. Does that play into the transition?  Wells: One of the essential things is health benefits for impacted workers. In this case, it's black lung, so that's got to be a part of any transition bill. The nation made a promise to coal miners in the '40s that their expenses would be covered, and that's a promise that needs to be kept forever.  CP: What's the importance of having labor in the fold in terms of the green movement?  Wells: We have to stop climate change. It is the most urgent and important thing that our generation can do... . What having labor in the conversation, having impacted communities in the conversation, gives the movement is the human element to reach a broader section of the country... . Let's say we do succeed at getting to a completely     decarbonized energy system, what's going to be left? Having workers and having impacted communities at the table ‚Äî and often those are very similar perspective ‚Äî it makes sure the work that we're doing is going to be sustainable in a human sense so that we actually want to live in the places that we saved.  CP: Has there always been a hesitancy around change, or how have these ideas of community development evolved in the history of the green movement?  Anderson: One of the greatest challenges right now is fear of the unknown. It's this idea of the community that's been a certain way for a very long time, and then you see some external force in D.C., some unelected bureaucrat at the EPA or some senator from some coastal state telling us we're going to have to do things differently....We have climate targets that we have to meet, otherwise we're going to have a catastrophe....But there needs to be a recognition that if we do that, things are going to have to change in communities, particularly in communities dependent on the coal industry, and that those policies are going to be viewed with fear and trepidation and opposition unless you engage those communities in a very different way.  Now, here's some other important reporting....  MUST-READ STORIES  Would you like some plastic with that? Environmental Health News reports that hundreds of thousands of tons of microplastics ‚Äî tiny pieces of plastic that are shed from a myriad of man-made products and can contaminate the environment with toxic chemicals ‚Äî fall on agricultural land every year. New research is beginning to show just how dangerous this trend is, as it can send carcinogens like cadmium into plants. Such evidence apparently isn't convincing enough for lawmakers to act, though. Rachel Becker of CalMatters writes that the California Legislature, deluged by expensive lobbying efforts from the plastics and packaging industries, rejected what would've been the nation's toughest stance on single-use plastics.   Blue let green fall flat. But that wasn't the only environment bill to die in California this year. Pre-pandemic ‚Äî in the Before Times ‚Äî there were high hopes that the Golden State's legislative body would tackle issues ranging from oil well setbacks to conservation goals. For The Desert Sun, I published a list of winners and losers this legislative session. But here's an intriguing question, could everything passed on the last day of session go up in smoke? It's not just a conspiracy theory. AP has the details.  Safeguarding the Silver State. The Reno Gazette Journal reports that the debate over creating Nevada's fourth national monument is underway. A coalition of Native American tribes and conservation groups are asking that 380,000 acres east of the Mojave Desert be set aside in what they'd call the Avi Kwa Ame National Monument.  POLITICAL CLIMATE     Paradise burned. Mongabay is out with a new story that finds 516 major fires, mostly set illegally, burned 1,450 square miles of the Amazon between late May and late August. ""Government agencies and law enforcement that once operated in the Amazon have been largely defunded under the (Bolsonaro) administration,"" according to the investigation.  Just sue, baby, sue. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced recently that he was filing California's hundredth lawsuit against the Trump administration. The milestone litigation is aimed at taking down a Trump administration rewrite of National Environmental Policy Act rules. I've got the story for The Desert Sun.  The transition. While we search for those all-important post-extraction jobs, cleaning up the mess left behind by heavy industries like mining presents a much-needed landing strip. The Casper Star Tribune reports that Wyoming officials predict the state ""will complete 96 (mine cleanup) projects and generate $201 million for local economies by the end of 2020.""  CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE  Fanning the flames. An interesting new feature from The Arizona Republic takes us behind the scenes with researchers studying wildfires and analyzing the connection between the blazes and climate change. From lightning strikes to decreased moisture levels, nuanced variables are fueling catastrophic burns.  The great smoke screen. As climate change deniers have been forced to backpedal in the face of overwhelming evidence, they've latched onto an idea: instead of quitting fossil fuels, why not just capture the climate-warming carbon dioxide. The already flawed idea ‚Äî If the technology worked, why not quit fossil fuels AND capture historical greenhouse gases? ‚Äî has taken up valuable space in the discussion surrounding solutions. Judith Lewis Mernit appears tired of hearing about it and, for Capital & Main, dug into the sketchy math surrounding carbon capture and sequestration.  Vicious cycle. Reuters reports that as ice melts in the Arctic, more ships can pass through, bringing record levels of pollution. ""As those heavy ships burn fuel, they release climate-warming carbon dioxide as well as black soot. That soot blankets nearby ice and snow, absorbing solar radiation rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere, which exacerbates warming in the region,"" researchers have found.  AND ANOTHER THING  Sweet phone, bro. The men President Donald Trump has tapped to lead the U.S Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of the Interior ‚Äî the country's main environmental regulator and land manager, respectively ‚Äî have been plagued by scandals and allegations of corruption since Day 1. Former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was ridiculed within the Beltway early in the administration     when he ordered a $43,000 secure phone booth be constructed at EPA HQ for his use. E&E finally pried free a photo of the infamous cubicle via a public records request, and it quickly became a symbol of the disarray that has set in at the agency.  Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We‚Äôre above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2020-6.txt,"Biden and a new Congress will act quickly on the climate crisis happening now: Harry Reid    column/6103697002  Trump has catastrophically failed to manage climate change, but we can still prevent its worst impacts if we vote for candidates who respect science.  Harry Reid | Opinion contributor This is the last presidential election before it‚Äôs too late to change course on climate change. Voters have one last chance to elect a president and members of Congress who will face the climate crisis and take steps to address it.  The challenges today are unprecedented. We‚Äôre in the midst of a global pandemic where millions in the United States have been infected and even more have lost their jobs, their businesses, and any semblance of the daily life we all had taken for granted. Climate change is another unprecedented crisis. The western United States has been consumed by horrible fires caused by climate change. A series of fires and droughts has ravaged my home state Nevada.  Science denial has, for decades, motivated Republicans in Congress to block action on climate change. This denial is now on full display in President Donald Trump‚Äôs catastrophic failure to manage climate change and COVID-19. The consequences for our country in Trump ignoring both of these scourges are apparent.  Problems fueled by climate change  Despite these challenges, there is hope. Americans have made it clear that climate change is a concern and priority, and we are casting our votes accordingly in this election.  We recognize that climate change is a common thread running through so many of our problems today. Climate-fueled natural disasters are costing our government billions of dollars each year. As the impact of Mother Nature intensifies, government budgets continue to dramatically increase. Furthermore, scientists say the more humans encroach on wildlife habitats or as these habitats are altered or destroyed due to our changing climate, then the more likely it is that pandemics like COVID-19 will occur.  Today‚Äôs pandemic is exacerbating pre-existing medical issues such as asthma and other respiratory diseases caused by poor air quality. Chemical facilities, many of which are adjacent to communities of color, are causing untoward sickness and death. These     communities have been subject to environmental injustices for decades, and now they are dying of COVID-19 in greater numbers as well.  There is still time to prevent the worst impacts of climate change if we act now. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris have a transformational plan to invest $2 trillion in clean energy infrastructure so we can achieve 100% clean electricity by 2035. In Senate races across the country, voters from Alaska to Colorado to South Carolina are showing strong support for candidates running on climate action, clean energy and conservation.  With a new president and a new Congress, there will be opportunity to pass bold solutions to combat our environmental and economic problems. A comprehensive clean energy infrastructure bill will create jobs and jump start our economy, reduce carbon emissions, and improve air quality. We‚Äôre dealing with a historic opportunity and we must not allow Senate Republicans to thwart the will of the American people.  Embrace and solve this problem  Climate change should not be a partisan issue. Former Sen. John Ensign was a conservative Republican, but he and I worked together to pass legislation to benefit our state of Nevada, including the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act that created wilderness, promoted clean energy, and created new jobs.  In a Biden presidency, a plan to defeat COVID-19 would be quickly implemented. With a President Biden and a newly elected Democratic Congress, the challenges of climate change would be swiftly addressed.  We must all recognize the No. 1 issue facing young men and women in America is their concern about the changing environment. Many have had their lives upended and their futures diminished by our changing climate. Americans have never shied away from challenges. In this election season, we must make our voices heard by voting for climate.  Back in the 1960s, folk singer Pete Seeger sang: ‚Äú I can see a new day, a new day soon to be, when the storm clouds are all passed and the sun shines on a world that is free.‚Äù I say we need to add a new line to his song: ‚ÄúWe will not be free until we put our arms around climate change and stop its ravages.‚Äù  Nevada Democrat Harry Reid served in the U.S. Senate from 1987 to 2017 and was the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015.

To stop the warming, ""enormous amounts of carbon dioxide have to be extracted from the atmosphere."" Some experts are skeptical of the computer model used in the study.  Even if human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to zero, global temperatures may continue to rise for centuries afterward, according to a scientific study published Thursday.  ""The world is already past a point of no return for global warming,"" the study authors report in the British journal Scientific Reports. The only way to stop the warming, they say, is that ""enormous amounts of carbon dioxide have to be extracted from the atmosphere.""  The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal and gas release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, causing global temperatures to increase and sea levels to rise.   The scientists modeled the effect of greenhouse gas emission reductions on changes in the Earth's climate from 1850 to 2500 and created projections of global temperature and sea level rises.  ""According to our models, humanity is beyond the point of no return when it comes to halting the melting of permafrost using greenhouse gas cuts as the single tool,"" lead author Jorgen Randers, a professor emeritus of climate strategy at the BI Norwegian Business School, told AFP.     ""If we want to stop this melting process we must do something in addition ‚Äì for example, suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it underground, and make Earth's surface brighter,"" Randers said.  Scientists are seeing an 'acceleration of pandemics': They are looking at climate change  The study said that by the year 2500, the planet's temperatures will be about 5.4  degrees Fahrenheit warmer than they were in 1850. And sea levels will be roughly 8 feet higher.   The authors suggest that global temperatures could continue to increase after human- caused greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced as the continued melting of Arctic ice and carbon-containing permafrost increase water vapor, methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  The melting of Arctic ice and permafrost also would reduce the area of ice reflecting heat and light from the sun.  According to the study, to prevent the authors' projected temperature and sea-level rises, all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions would have had to be reduced to zero between 1960 and 1970.   To prevent global temperature and sea level rises after greenhouse gas emissions have ceased, and to limit the potentially catastrophic effects on Earth's ecosystems and human society, at least 33 gigatons of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere each year from 2020 onward through carbon capture and storage methods, according to the authors.  That's roughly the total amount of carbon dioxide the global fossil fuel industry emitted in 2018, according to Business Insider.  One expert, Penn State University meteorologist Michael Mann, told USA TODAY that he was skeptical of the computer model used in the study: ""The climate model they have used is a very low complexity model. It doesn‚Äôt realistically represent large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as ocean circulation, etc.  ""While such models can be useful for conceptual inferences, their predictions have to be taken with great skepticism. Far more realistic climate models that do resolve the large-scale dynamics of the ocean, atmosphere and carbon cycle, do NOT produce the dramatic changes these authors argue for based on their very simplified model.  ""It must be taken not just with a grain of salt, but a whole salt-shaker worth of salt,"" Mann said.     Another expert, Mark Maslin, a professor of climatology at University College London, also pointed to shortcomings in the model, telling AFP that the study was a ""thought experiment.""  ""What the study does draw attention to is that reducing global carbon emissions to zero by 2050 is just the start of our actions to deal with climate change,"" Maslin said.  The study authors urge other scientists to follow up on their work: ""We encourage other model builders to explore our discovery in their (bigger) models, and report on their findings.""      "
USA-2020-71.txt,"Climate Point: Congress battles over relief checks while oil companies are bailed out

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
It's the last day of 2020. Take a breath.
If you're slightly numb from unprecedented wildfires, a zoonotic disease hammering the world, raging hurricanes and a major political party contesting a fair election, you're not alone. It's been a tough year, especially in terms of the environment. There's hope, though, that we can build back greener. President Donald Trump signed a stimulus and spending package on Sunday, as USA Today reports. Energy journalist/blogger David Roberts has the details on the longest bill Congress ever passed, which has wide-ranging energy provisions. Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden has released plans to invest in renewables and to build modern, green infrastructure.
And, on the topic of relief spending, here's one more story to kick things off. The Wall Street Journal recently exposed how Republicans in Congress, even while fighting against higher relief checks for everyday Americans, worked to kick back tens of millions of dollars in stimulus cash to oil companies. Key among them was Sen. Ted Cruz, who helped a fracking company that partly financed his failed presidential bid score $35 million from the government.
Here's some other important reporting....
MUST-READ STORIES
Fossil future. Kevin Crowley and Akshat Rathi of Bloomberg are out with a new investigation that finds oil supermajor Exxon has been making internal projections of its projects' future greenhouse gas emissions. But, those numbers often aren't made public, and the company has labeled certain endeavors as clean energy even when the internal figures tell a different story.
Where we spend money. Wyoming Public Radio reports that the Cowboy State's COVID-19 rental relief program, which pulled from CARES Act cash, ended up paying out a mere $1.5 million, 10% of the money it was given. The organization overseeing the payouts claimed that was all the assistance needed across the state. Meanwhile, some of the excess funds went toward a program aiding the state's oil and gas industry. That program ultimately paid out $30 million in fossil fuel subsidies.


Into thin air. One state to the southwest, Utah's Deseret News reports on a fascinating study out of Cornell University and the University of Oregon that looks at the impact of the Clean Air Act over the past four decades. The research found that a decrease in ozone pollution brought about by the law likely ""averted the deaths of 1.5 billion birds, or 20% of bird life in the United States today.""
THINGS I WISH I'D WRITTEN
Even as the pandemic and the presidential election sucked up all the oxygen in the room, environment reporters continued dropping hard-hitting journalism. As we exit this -- I'll let you choose your own adjective -- year, please enjoy a list of articles I really wish I'd been the one to report.
Climate chaos. For months, Abrahm Lustgarten and his team have been rolling out an ambitious series for ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine that delves into the human migration that climate change is beginning to force. The stories wind around the world, from modeling where climate refugees will go to analyzing how Russia stands to be a geopolitical victor as the Earth warms.
Dumping grounds. Rosanna Xia of the Los Angeles Times investigated how thousands of barrels containing the highly toxic pesticide DDT were dumped off the coast of the country's second-largest city.
When the rains won't come. Ian James at The Arizona Republic is an expert on all things water, and he wrote a compelling series on the Hopi Tribe's connection to corn as a crop that has cultural importance. But, a changing climate is hurting the yield.
Origin story. Sticking with The Arizona Republic, Debra Utacia Krol has spent all year proving why we need journalists focused on under-covered communities. In an example of stellar profile writing, she told the story of how Wendsler Nosie Sr., an Apache activist, came to join the fight to protect the environment from copper mining.
We're yelling ""timber."" Oregon Public Broadcasting, The Oregonian and ProPublica partnered to expose how -- contrary to the oft-repeated history that environmentalists single-handedly killed the Beaver State's timber industry -- Wall Street investors facing minimal environmental regulations took advantage of misdirected tax breaks to run roughshod over locally owned logging companies. And, if you're like me and didn't know much about the fascinating history of the Pacific Northwest's logging industry, I'd suggest you take a listen to Oregon Public Broadcasting's Timber Wars, a compelling podcast that premiered this year.
Lucrative land grabs. In one of the most ambitious investigations I've ever seen, High Country News spent two years tracking down data on land stolen via broken treaties and given to land grant universities. They traced 99% of the roughly 11 million acres distributed through the Morrill Act, acreage that helped fund dozens of American colleges.


Profitable pollution. The Desert Sun's own Janet Wilson partnered with ProPublica for this next must-read. In it, she exposed how California drilling companies have a tendency to cause oil spills -- which are illegal -- and instead of quickly cleaning them up, they gathered the crude and sell it for a profit.
Radioactive oil. For Rolling Stone, Justin Nobel took a deep dive into the oil industry's radioactivity and how it could be a potentially deadly, although misunderstood, public health threat.
They knew. We already found out that Exxon knew, as did other oil companies, how their product contributed to climate change. Then, in an excellent piece of sleuthing, E&E exposed General Motors and Ford for also realizing as early as the 1960s that their product played a role but making minimal effort to address the issue.
In the heat of the city. This year will go down as one of the hottest -- if not the hottest, as USA Today reports -- years in recorded human history, but even heat impact is felt differently along economic and racial lines. That's from numerous reports looking into how racist urban planning saddled Black and Latino communities with unhealthy living situations. The Delaware News Journal reported that wealthy neighborhoods in the First State's largest city have much higher numbers of trees that cool their areas. The Arizona Republic wrote about how all of Phoenix is getting hotter, but the elderly, Latinos and the homeless are suffering the most. And Bloomberg CityLab and NexusMedia revealed that heat in Chicago is one of many things targeting Black populations. ""Draw a map of Chicago and shade the areas with more poverty, pollution and coronavirus. It will start to look like being Black is a pre-existing condition,"" they wrote.
Two paths diverged. A nationwide team of reporters from the USA Today Network led by the Columbus Dispatch's Beth Burger went deep on Trump's and Biden's polar opposite stances on the environment, highlighting the election's importance.
And boom goes the fertilizer. The Center for Public Integrity, Grist and The World collaborated on a must-read series about the hidden hazards -- ranging from greenhouse gas emissions and air quality issues to water pollution and explosions -- of America agribusiness' love affair with fertilizer.
And, finally... My hat is off to all these amazing reporters. This list only captures a snapshot of what's out there, so, if you want more, check out this post where I asked the Twitterverse to send me their favorite environment stories from 2020.
I'd also like to share one of my own projects, if you'd oblige me. Amid California's record-breaking wildfire season, I partnered with photographers Jay Calderon and Omar Ornelas to chronicle the aftermath of fire for The Desert Sun. In a small town bordering the Salton Sea, we told the story of a fascinating recluse and his and his wife's quest to rebuild their burnt birding paradise. Then, we went inside the fire line to learn how we recover from a blaze. And, finally, we wandered to the Mojave Desert to observe what the loss of an iconic species amidst the flames tells us about climate change.


AND ANOTHER THING
Lights out for coal. The Longview coal export terminal, proposed to be built in Washington, was for years a last hope for a resurgence of American coal, as it could've further opened Asian markets. It's also been dying a slow death. Now, S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that the bankrupt company that holds the project's lease couldn't find necessary bidders and is instead walking away. One more for the road. Actually, this year was a tough one, and if you've stuck with my ramblings on the environment through it all (and if you've worn your mask), you deserve a feel-good story to cap it off. We're overfishing the oceans, drilling for oil in pristine wildernesses and flattening rainforests, yet there's still amazing biodiversity out there left to protect. Here are some of the species we saw for the first time this year: a new type of whale with a beak, a 150-foot-long sea creature, an adorable lemur with humorously large eyes, a frog the size of an aspirin pill that lives in South American cloud forests, 19 new species of tree-dwelling orchids and an evergreen shrub that looks like a cholla mated with candy dots and represents an entirely new plant family. Mongabay's got the details. Which newly discovered species is your favorite? As for now, scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers: That's all for 2020. Don't forget to follow along on Twitter at @MarkOlalde. You can also reach me at molalde@gannett.com.

USA-2020-72.txt,"'The most significant climate legislation ever': How stimulus bill tackles warming planet

Ledyard King | USA TODAY
WASHINGTON ¬≠ The mammoth spending bill Congress approved Monday to curb the spiraling pandemic and prevent a government shutdown carries another description: a substantial step to confront climate change.
Environmental advocates are touting the $2.3 trillion bill as a potential game-changer thanks to tax breaks for renewable energy sources, initiatives to promote carbon capture storage and a significant phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that are a key culprit to the planet's warming.
In addition, the measure not only eliminates the Trump administration's proposed deep cuts to federal climate science programs but adds millions to those programs for 2021.
""Passage of this bill represents real forward progress on climate change and clean energy."" said Lindsey Griffith, federal policy director at the Clean Air Task Force, who calls the package ""the most significant U.S. federal climate legislation ever.""
While the sweeping bill has grabbed headlines for the billions it provides in direct payments to millions of Americans and its extension of a forgivable loan program for small businesses crippled by the pandemic, policy provisions that attempt to halt carbon emissions that contribute to climate change could prove far more lasting.
Among the most heralded is a bipartisan move to significantly curb the use of HFCs found in refrigeration, air conditioning, building insulation and fire extinguishing systems. The provision requires the Environmental Protection Agency to implement an 85% phasedown of the production and consumption so they reach about 15% of their 20112013 average annual levels by 2036.
More: 'Past a point of no return': Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero still won't stop global warming, study says
The phasedown, part of an international effort to reduce harmful emissions, is projected to prevent the planet from warming half a degree Celsius over the coming decades, though some scientific studies say Earth may be on an irreversible course to warming and the environmental damage that will result.
""It is imperative that we take swift action on climate change if we're going to have any chance of avoiding its worst impacts,"" said Matt Casale, director of U.S. Public Interest Research Group's Environment Campaigns. ""Phasing out HFCs ¬≠ known as `super greenhouse gases' ¬≠ will bring significant climate relief relatively quickly.""


Other provisions include:
Expansion of carbon capture technology and deployment. Under the process, carbon emissions produced by power plants and other heavy industry are contained and injected deep into the ground, where saline rock formations can store the gas for centuries. Reauthorization of an expiring program that provides industry with financial incentives to replace aging diesel engines with less polluting ones. Extension and expansion of tax credits for clean energy, including wind, and a new incentive that encourages newly built power plants to be more efficient and cleaner. Requirements that natural gas facilities deploy the latest technology to prevent, detect and address dangerous methane leaks, a significant contributor to climate change.
Supporters of the legislation say the steps will not only help the planet but also expand a clean energy economy that hasn't always gotten as much support from Washington as they would like.
""We can ensure American workers lead the national transition to a clean economy,"" said Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee who wrote some of the provisions. ""We can embrace the ingenuity and innovation of American industries while protecting vulnerable communities.""
More: Joe Biden can work with conservatives on climate change. Many of them are ready to act.
The measures also had various degrees of support from Republicans representing fossil fuel states, such as Environment and Public Works Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming, who represents the nation's largest coal producing state, and Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, whose state is a leading oil producer.
For GOP lawmakers wary that a drastic transformation to clean energy would imperil their local economies, the legislation is a reasonable, incentive-driven approach.
""Free-market innovation is the key to addressing a changing climate,"" Barrasso said. ""This bipartisan legislation proves we can protect our environment without punishing our economy.""
Climate Point: President-elect Biden sets tone for direction on the environment
Efforts to address climate change at the federal level will get another boost in less than a month when Joe Biden is inaugurated as the nation's 46th president. The former vice president, who has called climate change ""an existential threat to the health of our planet and to our very survival,"" has made it a focal point of his incoming administration.
President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly questioned his own administration's climate science, has signaled he might veto the massive bill after criticizing it for not providing Americans with bigger payments for American families hurt by the pandemic


and because it includes billions in foreign aid. Even so, the measure has enough support to override a presidential veto.

USA-2020-73.txt,"A way forward on climate change: Focus on reducing heavy industry's carbon emissions

Heavy industry like iron, steel and cement production has an outsized impact on trade, job growth and the environment.
Charles Hernick | Opinion contributor
As we head into what is expected to be a divided government in 2021, many industry watchers say that Washington is unlikely to take meaningful action on climate change, and that Congress would be wise to concentrate on low-hanging fruit.
Republicans, focused on a more resilient post-pandemic economy, will prioritize private sector job creation, strengthening industry and trade policies that don't disadvantage American workers.
Many Democrats are likely to call for Green New Deal-like approaches to address climate change and create government-secured jobs.
In such a landscape, low-hanging fruit feels easy, but we should set our sights higher. It is time for Congress to work together -- in a bipartisan fashion that addresses Republicans' key priorities while also significantly cutting greenhouse gas emissions -- on one of the most difficult climate challenges: reducing the carbon footprint for heavy industry.
Little has been done, so the policy playing field is wide open. No idea has been tried and discarded; partisan camps have not been locked down.
Heavy industry like iron, steel and cement production has an outsized impact on trade, job growth and the environment, which make it an alluring opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Globally, industry accounts for about 19% of direct greenhouse gas emissions -- 33% when including indirect emissions, such as those generated by lighting and heating industrial facilities.
Indeed, data-driven climate policy needs to focus on industrial emissions because they have steadily increased and could soon surpass power sector emissions.
Because it is at the heart of the supply chain, the industrial sector has an outsized influence on critical economic indicators. Estimates based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that for every 100 jobs created or lost in the durable goods manufacturing sector, more than 700 jobs hang in the balance elsewhere in the economy.


Differentiating between low-carbon ""Made in the USA"" products from imported highcarbon products should enable a revitalization of domestic manufacturing and domestic job creation, as well as bring stability back to the sector.
The United States is one of the largest importers of embedded carbon -- indirect emissions related to the supply chain and other activities in processing. Policies that address carbon embedded in the trade of energy-intensive goods such as steel and cement represent an immense opportunity to reduce emissions and rebuild the American economy.
China, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, also is the largest exporter of embedded carbon. Other trade partners' carbon output needs to be reduced too.
Shape trade policies around emissions
As a result, countries are beginning to take a closer look at imported products and adjusting their trade policies accordingly. The European Union is pursuing a carbon border adjustment, an attempt to apply monetary value to carbon emissions generated in the creation and transportation of imported goods.
Heavy industry remains a difficult sector to decarbonize; there is no substitute for concrete, iron and steel. In fact, cement production alone is responsible for about 10% of global emissions. But better information on the differences between companies and products will help drive business toward clean, American-sourced materials.
The Building Transparency database includes carbon disclosures by dozens of companies for hundreds of products. Such efforts can go a long way to support market demand for lower carbon-emitting solutions.
And there is a growing list of technologies being developed to help industry mitigate emissions. Carbon Cure, for example, manufactures a technology that introduces recycled carbon dioxide into fresh concrete to reduce its carbon footprint without compromising performance.
Seed market for low-carbon products
Ultimately, a smart plan for both trade and climate should have three main components: Empower companies to reduce their emissions voluntarily. Facilitate growth in the market for goods that have lower emissions profiles, and reduce barriers for people and companies interested in purchasing low-carbon products. Update federal procurement policy to ensure that the U.S. government -- the world's largest buyer of goods and services -- favors American-made low-carbon products.


It will require hard work and attention to detail for Republicans and Democrats to come together on climate policy. A focus on reducing the industrial sector's emissions will boost economic prosperity in the United States and strengthen America's position around the world. That is something all Americans can get behind. Charles Hernick is director of policy and advocacy at Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions Forum.

USA-2020-74.txt,"Climate Point: President-elect Biden sets tone for direction on the environment

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Will the federal government finally buckle down and pass a 13-digit COVID-19 relief bill that's also mixed with an energy-focused federal spending bill? It's tough to tell with President Donald Trump seemingly torpedoing the process at the 11th hour in the midst of fighting over individual relief checks.
That's where we stand as I'm writing this, at least, but if the huge spending measure does pass, it'll have wide-ranging implications for energy and the environment, E&E reports. Among other things, it would extend renewable energy tax credits, carbon capture incentives and building efficiency tax breaks.
On that note, Smart Cities Dive reports that a new study by the Rocky Mountain Institute and Bloomberg Philanthropies outlines how ""green cities"" would be the logical way to build back after the pandemic. If we're going to kickstart things with a massive cash infusion, why not spend it on an accelerated transition to zero emission transportation, retrofitting schools and affordable housing with smarter tech and retiring coal power by investing in additional renewables, they ponder.
Here's some other important reporting....
MUST-READ STORIES
Culture change. Debra Utacia Krol of The Arizona Republic is out with a new, fascinating look at the cultural implications of climate change for the Southwest's Indigenous communities. As environments shift and temperatures rise -- as well as generations lose interest -- it's becoming more difficult to carry on traditions. ""Native artists, cultural practitioners and artisans are experiencing more difficulty locating plants like willow, devil's claw, arrowweed or other materials they need for artistic and cultural continuance,"" she reports.
Saving the swamps. To date, $5 billion has been poured into the restoration of the Everglades since then-President Bill Clinton signed a law calling for its protection in 2000. What have we accomplished so far? Unfortunately, not as much as we'd like, the Fort Myers News-Press reports. Only one of 68 related projects have been completed


there. ""That's not to say the federal-state Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is faltering, but it does illustrate the staggering challenge of such an undertaking,"" Amy Bennett Williams writes.
End of an era. Back in the Copper State, The Arizona Republic reports that three huge emissions stacks at the Navajo Generating Station, an iconic coal-fired power plant, came down the other day, signaling the sunset of an era. While the event itself was in many ways purely symbolic, Ryan Randazzo writes that the ""demolition of the largest coal burner in the West is a milestone for environmentalists who fought, and continue to fight, to shift the country to renewable energy.""
POLITICAL CLIMATE -- SELECTION WEEK!
With John Kerry previously announced as President-elect Joe Biden's international climate envoy, there were still numerous key environmental posts to be filled, which resulted in heavy lobbying from politicos and wild guessing from pundits. Most of those spots have now been filled by a group of individuals that the Natural Resources Defense Council has labeled ""an environmental A-Team destined to make historic progress in fighting climate change and protecting public health."" Here's where we landed on some key environmental posts.
U.S. Department of the Interior. After intense political pushing and shoving in the nation's capital, Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., has been chosen to be the first Native American Secretary of the Interior. From the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, Haaland is a supporter of the Green New Deal, and her selection marks a massive about-face for an agency that once played a role in the genocide of Indigenous people. Indian Country Today has the story.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Over at the EPA, Michael Regan, North Carolina's chief environmental regulator, is Biden's choice. Regan would be only the second Black administrator of the EPA, and he has bona fides from fighting to clean up coal ash. Politico has the story.
Department of Energy and climate czar. Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm will be the nominee to helm the U.S. Department of Energy, while Gina McCarthy, a former head of the EPA and current Natural Resources Defense Council CEO, will act as Biden's climate czar. The Detroit Free Press has the story.
EXTREME EXTRACTIVES
When the black gold's not worth the green. In the first federal drilling auction in California since 2012, the government scored fewer than $50,000 from oil and gas companies. In exchange, they handed over drilling leases covering 4,100 acres, Reuters reports.
Outlawing protest. As climate change looms, should it be illegal to protest against new fossil fuel infrastructure? Several states have said ""yes"" over the past few years, and HuffPost reports that Ohio is ready to be the latest. A bill to ""escalate criminal charges on


fossil fuel protesters and threaten religious organizations or nonprofits that support such demonstrations with crushing fines"" faced large opposition in the past, but recently, the Legislature approved it on the last day of the session. The governor is expected to receive it before the end of the calendar year. Whose land is it? In an intriguing legal battle, Native American tribes in Oklahoma are asserting their right to govern oil and gas extraction on land that's legally theirs, something the state's Corporation Commission and private businesses are unsurprisingly fighting against. The Oklahoman reports that the state's top court will review the commission's decision to deny tribes that regulatory power.
AND ANOTHER THING
Diagnosis a dying lake. Glimmering in the Southern California desert, the Salton Sea is the state's largest lake. It's also a growing -- or shrinking, depending how you look at it -- environmental and public health catastrophe, as the shoreline recedes, exposing pesticide-laden dust that winds blow across the region. This week, I partnered with photographer Mette Lampcov for a story co-published by The Desert Sun and High Country News. We dug into the question of why we've known about this issue for decades, yet so little has been done, even though roughly $70 million has gone to fix it. Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2020-75.txt,"Climate crisis: I used to mull when to have children. Now I ask if I should I have them.

Reliable COVID vaccines spark optimism about 2021 and beyond. There is no vaccine for the climate crisis, but we must create a similar promising future.
Dr. Neelu Tummala | Opinion contributor
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns about whether public health agencies should advise women to postpone pregnancy because of potential virus-related risks. Not surprisingly, there are multiple ethical considerations to such recommendations, with reproduction ultimately being a very personal and private decision. One important factor is the control many women (although admittedly not all) are able to exercise in choosing their risk exposure to the coronavirus. That is a stark contrast to the risks associated with the climate crisis, where the very air women breathe and the heat waves they are exposed to increase pregnancy-related complications.
A recent study reveals that roughly 25% of childless adults consider climate change in their decision not to have children. Over the past 20 years of my own life, my thoughts toward starting a family have always revolved around timing. When is the right time for me? It wasn't the carefree years of college, the studious years of medical school or the overworked years of residency. Now, as I continue to look forward, the question of when is accompanied by a previously unthinkable thought: Should I?
Environmental inaction affects choices
People across the world are considering the climate crisis in their decision not to have children. For some, the decision is based on the uncertainty of the future. For others, the concern centers around the increased carbon footprint of another child. And still for others it is a moral issue. This is a complex and emotional question that I have no answer to, nor do I offer judgment on others' choices. What is clear, however, is that environmental inaction influences this decision of personal reproduction.
The health and economic challenges of 2020 are unparalleled in recent history, but continuing vaccine rollouts allow for an optimistic outlook for 2021 and beyond. There is no vaccine for the climate crisis, however, which is why aggressive action is needed to create a similar promising future.
Without aggressive climate action, predictions of the future include hunger, disease, war and death. The Department of Defense has declared climate change a threat to national security. As sea levels rise and weather becomes more extreme, there will be food


and water scarcity. People around the world will be forced to migrate, leading to land shortages and civil unrest. It is a world that looks nothing like the one into which we or our parents were born. And it is a world into which 1 in 4 adults are concerned about bringing life.
Beyond Trumpism: Joe Biden can work with conservatives on climate change. Many of them are ready to act.
The uncertainty of the future is best exemplified through its impacts on our health. Or maybe, as a physician, this is the variable that scares me the most. In children, global warming already contributes to an increased risk of mental health disease, greater risk of heat stress and increased risk of malnutrition. Continued warming affects children's health in ways that medicine has only started to discover and, in the absence of climate action, will multiply in unimaginably devastating ways.
The incentives aren't just economic
The concerns of the climate crisis are growing exponentially. As compared with Generation X individuals (those born between 1965 and 1980), there is a 55% increase in the percentage of millennials who consider climate change in their reproductive decisions, and a 68% increase for Generation Z individuals. In just one generation, this is a nearly 25% increase.
The overwhelming question is, how do we stop this?
President-elect Joe Biden ran on an ambitious climate agenda that aims for net zero emissions from the electricity sector by 2035 and from the entire U.S. economy by 2050. That would be the most progressive climate strategy the United States has attempted. He plans to spend nearly $2 trillion on clean energy initiatives that will create jobs, such as making buildings more energy efficient, investing in public transportation and supporting vehicle electrification.
When he introduced his seasoned and diverse climate team Saturday, Biden said his administration would focus on jobs, environmental justice and getting ""back in the business of leading the world on climate change.""
Climate change: Many of the states most at risk are also the least prepared
For his climate plan to succeed, it needs support from the House, the Senate and, by extension, all of us. Now is the time to demand all of our newly elected leaders to prioritize the future so that each generation can freely embrace the decision to bring a child into a safe and healthy world.
A question politicians commonly ask about responding to the climate crisis is: How much will it cost? There is an economic incentive for climate action, and a priceless one: making pregnancy as safe as possible, and allowing prospective parents to make a decision about starting a family as a personal decision, not one influenced by environmental concerns.

In just a few weeks, California has experienced six of the state's 20 largest wildfires in modern history.   Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared the usual wildfire season ""the reality of the ravages of climate change.""  But some are hesitant to believe him ‚Äî and have taken to Facebook to express their doubts.  A since-deleted screenshot of a tweet from actor James Woods displays a map of the wildfires throughout the Western U.S., with no fires marked in nearby Mexico or Canada.   ""Hey Governor Newsom, why does 'climate change' stop abruptly at the Canadian border?"" the tweet reads. The tweet was posted to Facebook by Amiri King.  Others used the maps to bolster the claims that fires in Washington and Oregon were set by anti-fascist activists, which USA TODAY has already debunked.  ""Let's just say I'm skeptical that 50 fires started in 3 states but stopped at the Canadian and Mexico border was due to climate change,"" another post on Facebook reads.  The users behind the posts did not respond to requests from USA TODAY for comment.     There are fires on both sides of the border, though some maps only show the U.S.   In reality, there are fires on both sides of the border. Throughout the summer, Mexico and Canada have experienced fires in their western regions, too ‚Äî they just aren't marked on some maps that are only intended to show fires in the U.S.  Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and the director of the Texas Tech Climate Center, addressed the issue on Twitter.  ""The latest disinformation circling the twittersphere asks why the impacts of climate change appear to stop at the Canadian border,"" she wrote. ""The answer is simple: because US maps only show US data.""  A global map from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System reveals fires burning up and down the coast, in Canada, the U.S., and Mexico.  Hayhoe also pointed to Canada's National Wildland Fire Situation Report as proof that the crisis extends beyond the United States.  As of Sept. 9, it listed five uncontrolled fires burning in Canada, on top of 11 fires being held and 47 controlled fires. And two highest-priority fires on the website are both in British Columbia, the Western-most province.  Tweets from Mexico's Comisi√≥n Nacional Forestal also indicate multiple fires in recent weeks in its Baja California state and show the blaze on a map.  Scientists confirm that climate change has exacerbated fires  Scientists have backed up the claim that this season's fires have been worsened by climate change.  Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at the Breakthrough Institute, told the Los Angeles Times that summers in California are 2.5 degrees warmer than they were in the 1970s.  ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve been seeing in California are some of the clearest events where we can say this is climate change ‚Äî that climate change has clearly made this worse,‚Äù he said.  More: Fact check: Oregon, Washington fires were not set by anti-fascist activists  Though fire is not unusual in California, the hot summers have ""turbocharged"" the conditions that cause fires to grow.   ‚ÄúWe see fires growing from essentially nothing to a quarter of a million acres in one day,"" he explained. ""And that‚Äôs because the conditions are ripe, and temperature plays a large role.‚Äù     ‚ÄúIn a world without climate change, it still would have been a hot August; we still would have had some fires. But it‚Äôs clear that climate change has made things notably worse,‚Äù he added.  More: Creek Fire ignites fire management debate on 102 million trees killed by beetles, drought  Lori Daniels, a forestry professor at the University of British Columbia, told the Associated Press that climate change has intensified fires on both sides of the border.  Warm and dry conditions make it easier for small fires started by lightening or human activity to grow and travel through forests. As a result, British Columbia endured its own record-breaking fires in 2017 and 2018.  ‚ÄúThis is everywhere,‚Äù Daniels said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all experiencing extreme temperatures, extreme droughts, extreme fires driven by those droughts, and they are the hallmarks of climate change.‚Äù  Our rating: False  Based on our research, the claim that wildfires on the West Coast stop at the borders of Canada and Mexico is FALSE.

USA-2021-32.txt,"Once climate change deniers, the agriculture industry positions itself as part of the solution

Ignacio Calderon | Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting
Note: This story has been updated with a comment from the National Pork Producers Council.
For decades, the U.S. agriculture industry had staunchly opposed measures to limit climate change.
Lobbying groups, such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, expressed skepticism that humans caused it. And companies, such as Tyson Foods and Smithfield Foods, have been fined millions for environmental violations.
But the industry in recent years has altered its stance on the issue. Riding a wave of shifting public opinion about the reality of climate change, it is staking out a new position as part of the climate solution.
One of the most visible signs of this about-face happened late last year when the Farm Bureau partnered with dozens of other groups, from agriculture organizations to environmental advocates, to announce a new initiative: the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance. The group has proposed 40 new policies, including voluntary incentives and other tools for farmers to address a warming planet.
At the same time, Syngenta, a major seed company, promised in its most recent sustainability assessment to invest in sustainable agriculture. Its CEO said in a January CNBC op-ed that climate change is ""matter of survival.""
It was a dramatic shift from just four years ago when the company said in its business filings that ""climate change may have both positive and negative impacts"" on the company.
Asked about the change in tune, spokesman Saswato Das did not directly answer. Instead, he said there are ""changing views of society regarding sustainable agriculture.""
""Climate change is an existential threat,"" he added, ""and we need to accelerate action before it is too late.""
Like Syngenta, the other groups and companies contacted for this story did not provide straightforward explanations for why they changed how they discussed climate change. Most said that farmers have always been at the forefront of environmental conservation.


""America's farmers and ranchers are proactively identifying issues and being part of the solution,"" said Andrew Walmsley, the farm bureau federation's director of congressional relations.
But to critics of corporate agriculture, the new language sounds like ""greenwashing"" ¬≠ a marketing tactic used by companies to improve their public images as opposed to truly changing unsustainable practices.
One proposal from Smithfield Foods that advocacy groups say fits this bill is incentivizing the use of digesters. The technology converts hog waste into biogas, which can be used for heat and electricity. The climate alliance also supports digesters.
Tyler Lobdell, a staff attorney at Food and Water Watch, said digesters aren't all they're cracked up to be because industrialized farms, where animals are confined in large numbers, produce too much manure to be sustainable.
""At best, digesters reduce a small amount of methane emissions,"" he said. ""It really is quintessential greenwashing.""
About 40-45% of Smithfield's carbon footprint comes from manure management on farms, according to the company, which is the world's largest pork producer. In 2017, Smithfield launched a renewables division to cut carbon and advance renewable energy.
Kraig Westerbeek, the head of Smithfield Renewables, said digesters make hog farming ""even more sustainable.""
He pointed to the recommendations from the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture about using digesters. According to the government, benefits of digesters include a diversified farm income, conservation of agricultural land and sustainable food production.
""To try to paint these efforts as not progressive and unbeneficial to water quality, air emissions and greenhouse gas reduction is to turn your back on years of research and data that proves otherwise,"" Westerbeek said.
To be sure, the industry, particularly lobbying groups, still resists specific policies.
For example, in 2019, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association lobbied against the work of a Maryland committee focused on sustainable food, and the committee was disbanded, according to Inside Climate News. Tyson, Cargill and National Beef are members of the cattlemen's association.
And the National Pork Producers Council has consistently opposed forcing industrialized farms from reporting their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2019, the council listed among its legislative accomplishments: ""Marshaled the effort to secure permanent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules exempting farms from emissions reporting.""
Rachel Gantz, the council's spokeswoman, said the emissions reported wouldn't be accurate because the EPA hasn't finalized methodologies to quantify them.


""Producers who fail to make the reports --or make inaccurate reports --will be subject to lawsuits by activist groups, federal enforcement actions and subjected to tens of thousands of dollars in fines and penalties,"" she said.
Both the beef association and the pork council are part of the new climate alliance.
Climate change could have dire consequences for agriculture. According to the EPA, as temperatures rise, both the productivity and nutritional value of crops may decrease. Other government studies show that there may be less milk available to consumers, because dairy cows are sensitive to heat stress.
EPA data shows that agriculture made up around 10% of America's greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, the latest year available. Even though government data shows the country's overall emissions have been decreasing since 2007, emissions from the agriculture sector increased 3.7% since 1990.
It remains to be seen how the industry's shift will affect that trend.
""It's been gratifying to see the increasing attention given by a number of major food and agriculture companies to issues of soil carbon and regenerative agriculture,"" said Robert Myers, the director of the Center for Regenerative Agriculture at the University of Missouri. ""So now, are they doing it just for marketing or not?""
History of countering climate change action
The Farm Bureau Federation, a founding member of the new climate alliance, has a history of opposing major changes to farming practices to address climate change.
""Climate change policy is controversial,"" said then-president of the farm bureau, Dean Kleckner, in a prepared statement at a 1998 congressional hearing. ""Drastic action proposed by the administration is not justified at this time.""
Over the years, the federation has said it would support alternative energy that reduces pollution. But, as recently as 2018, it said it would oppose legislation that would have set limits on emissions or required the reporting of emissions, according to its own background sheet on its lobbying on climate.
The climate alliance's proposals largely consist of incentives for farmers to develop climate-friendly habits. Examples include tax credits for capturing the carbon produced in fields and a one-time payment for early adopters of sustainable practices.
Such proposals are not without flaws, said Silvia Secchi, associate professor in the Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences at the University of Iowa.
For one thing, Secchi said, it's hard to monitor if a farmer actually implements sustainable practices like planting cover crops or adopting no-till farming.
Also, the farmer has to do these every year in order to get the carbon sequestration benefits, she said. Otherwise, the carbon can get released back into the atmosphere.


""The things the farm bureau and other Ag lobbyists would like farmers to do are not really very effective things,"" she said. ""By doing it themselves versus being regulated by the federal government, they can do less, they can do what is easy for them and they can sell that effort.""
Walmsley, with the farm bureau federation, disagreed.
""That point of view ignores the incredible advances already made by agriculture voluntarily,"" he said.
Over the last two generations, the U.S. has seen an exponential increase in crop production ""while our inputs have remained relatively flat,"" he said.
Other groups involved in the alliance have a similar history.
In 2010, according to ProPublica, the Cattlemen's Beef Association spent much of its lobbying effort on ""working to prevent consideration of any climate change legislation in the Senate.""
The association recently announced that it will work with the Biden Administration to ""demonstrate cattle production is a solution to climate concerns.""
The National Pork Producers Council, which has fought transparency of emissions, said its members have produced more meat while using less land, water and energy.
""Our industry is committed to further reducing this contribution,"" Rachel Gantz, the council's spokeswoman, said.
Past violations, now fewer emissions
Some of the companies whose lobbying organizations are involved in the climate alliance have been fined millions for environmental violations.
But they have also made public commitments about reducing their environmental footprints.
For example, Tyson Foods ¬≠ which belongs to the cattlemen's beef association and the North American Meat Institute, both members of the alliance ¬≠ has been fined about $57 million for environmental violations since 2000, according to data from Good Jobs First.
In 2017, the company pleaded guilty to a wastewater leak from a facility in Missouri that resulted in the death of more than 100,000 fish. It paid a $2 million fine.
More recently, however, Tyson said it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.
""We acknowledge our previous violations and we aim to continuously improve on our outcomes for environmental compliance,"" a Tyson spokeswoman said in an email. ""We have nearly 500 full-time team members who are solely dedicated to excellent


environmental performance and compliance.""

USA-2021-33.txt,"I tried to buy a climate-friendly refrigerator from GE. What I got was a carbon bomb.

Phil McKenna | Inside Climate News
Nearly all refrigerators in use in the United States today use chemical refrigerants that are some of the most potent greenhouse gases on the planet.
Yet, a growing number of manufacturers now offer new models with an alternative refrigerant that has little to no climate impact.
But none of the major appliance makers, including GE Appliances, were advertising which fridges are climate-friendly, and which are carbon bombs. In some cases, it seems they themselves don't know which is which.
I found this out the hard way when I recently tried to replace my aging refrigerator. I went first to Future Proof, a website offering product reviews of consumer goods with a focus on sustainability.
I quickly found a page on the site touting ""The Most Climate-Friendly Refrigerators for 2020"" and read descriptions of several different fridges, all of which were said to use isobutane, a benign refrigerant with a climate impact similar to that of carbon dioxide.
Elon Musk trolls GM, Chrysler on Twitter: Ford CEO responds with 1 word.
Could these long-gone vehicles make a comeback?: Chevrolet, Cadillac, Dodge classic cars offer opportunity
The refrigerators were no more expensive than other models, and with a few clicks I was able to order the one I wanted through Home Depot.
A few days before my new GE Appliances refrigerator arrived, I got nervous. What if the reviews were wrong? What if my fridge used the more common hydrofluorocarbons -- chemical refrigerants that are thousands of times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide?
I reached out to customer service at GE. A representative assured me they stopped using hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in ""100% of all newly manufactured U.S. refrigerators"" more than a year ago.
Soon after, our new fridge arrived on the back of a large delivery truck early on a Friday morning. I popped the front door of our home in the Boston suburbs off its hinges and gazed at the new climate-friendly behemoth. I opened the refrigerator's ""French doors"" and marveled at its bright, shiny interior.


My eyes quickly went to the serial number sticker on its sidewall -- the only way to tell for certain what refrigerant your device actually uses. I was aghast.
The refrigerator I'd purchased, which the delivery men had just spent the past half-hour wedging into my home, listed ""r134a"" as the refrigerant. R-134a, or HFC-134a, is a chemical 3,710 times more potent than carbon dioxide at warming the planet over the near term.
The refrigerator only used 127 grams -- roughly one-quarter of a pound -- of HFC-134a, and the coolant was tightly sealed in a network of pipes somewhere deep inside. But, at some point, maybe not until my new fridge is crushed for scrap metal at the end of its useful life, that 127 grams of refrigerant will likely be released into the atmosphere.
When it is, the chemical will produce the greenhouse gas equivalent of burning 519 pounds of coal, or setting an entire barrel of oil on fire.
It was as if the shippers didn't just drop off a refrigerator but left a steel drum full of west Texas sweet crude behind and lit a slow-burning fuse.
They sold me one thing and delivered another
Within minutes I was on the phone with GE customer service. The unfortunate person on the other end said she was surprised to hear the fridge I purchased used HFCs.
I told her that I would like GE to pay to have the fridge returned to the big box store that it came from. She said she couldn't do that but could have a service technician come and ""look"" at the appliance.
I told her I didn't need a technician; the issue was plain as day. GE had sold me one thing and delivered another. What I needed, I told the representative, was some corporate responsibility.
I let my consumer rage cool over the weekend before putting my reporter hat back on. The following week I spoke with Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for GE Appliances.
Wood apologized profusely and explained how it came to be that the company's customer service department provided the wrong information.
Wood said more than half of all models sold in the U.S. by GE now use a climate-friendly refrigerant. GE Appliances published a list of all HFC-free refrigerator models it produces, refrigerators that use isobutane, or ""R-600a,"" as the refrigerant, on Friday, March 12, after a version of this article first appeared in Inside Climate News.
Wood said the company is in the process of converting the rest over in the next year or two.
""We have moved ahead to many of the low-GWP (Global Warming Potential) refrigerants before we were required to,"" Wood told me. ""We are actually ahead of a lot of other companies.""


I also spoke with Kevin Messner, the senior vice president of policy and government relations with the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, an industry group.
Messner confirmed GE and all other refrigerator manufacturers are in the process of switching from HFCs to isobutane or other climate-friendly alternatives.
The companies are driven by requirements recently adopted by California and are now being taken up by a number of other states.
The regulations required small refrigerators and freezers to be HFC-free by Jan. 1, 2021, and will require full-size refrigerators and freezers to make the switch by the beginning of 2022. Larger, built-in units have until 2023 to be HFC-free.
Messner couldn't, or wouldn't, say which company was in the lead. But, when I did some further digging I was surprised to find it was GE who spearheaded the ongoing changeover to climate-friendly refrigerators more than a decade ago.
In 2008, GE applied to the Environmental Protection Agency to use small amounts of isobutane in refrigerators at a time when the chemical wasn't yet allowed.
Messner also said a far bigger greenhouse gas emissions problem with refrigerators had already been resolved. HFCs were historically used not only for the refrigerant but also for the foam insulation sprayed into the units to trap in the cold.
Dig Deeper
You may also be interested in
A typical refrigerator used one to three pounds of HFCs in the foam insulation, far more than the quarter pound of HFC refrigerant GE delivered to my door. State regulations banned the use of HFC-based foam in refrigerators and freezers as of Jan. 1, 2020.
Chemical refrigerants are ""usually"" removed from refrigerators and properly destroyed at the end of the refrigerator's useful life, Messner said.
However, the EPA notes that such proper disposal occurs in less than 600,000 of the roughly 9 million refrigerators and freezers discarded in the U.S. each year.
How to tell if your fridge is climate-friendly? Fuhgeddaboudit
What mystifies me is why GE and other manufacturers haven't used their conversion to climate-friendly alternatives as a selling point in their marketing.
As a climate journalist, one of the most common questions I get from friends and family is, ""What can I do to address climate change?""
It's a question I've grown to hate as the readily-available options -- using LED-lightbulbs and reusable grocery bags, driving less and walking more -- are simply window-dressing for a much larger, systemic problem.


But if there was a choice when buying a common household appliance between one that was climate-friendly and one that would release emissions equal to burning a barrel of oil, I'm pretty sure it's one that environmentally conscious consumers would want to know about.
They may even pay a premium for such products.
Yet, manufacturers not only have not advertised their conversion to climate-friendly alternatives, they have made it nearly impossible to figure out whether a model is clean or dirty until it arrives at your home.
As I found out.
And it's not just me who has struggled to find a climate-friendly fridge.
In 2018, employees at the Environmental Investigation Agency, a nonprofit environmental advocacy organization based in Washington, went on a quest to buy an HFC-free refrigerator when their office fridge stopped working.
The group had just helped change U.S. safety standards to raise the limit on the amount of climate-friendly refrigerants allowed in refrigerators. Buying an HFC-free model should have been easy.
""When we told our office manager, `Just make sure that the fridge you get does not contain HFCs,' we did not think that we were signing up for months and months and months of our office manager's time as well as our time,"" said Avipsa Mahapatra, who leads EIA's climate campaign.
The group finally got through to a Bosch representative who found a reference to isobutane, a climate-friendly alternative to HFCs, buried within a technical repair manual and sent a scanned copy of the page to Jill, the office manager.
""I still remember Jill saying, `The Holy Grail of refrigeration is here!'"" Mahapatra said.
The group has since published an HFC-free refrigerator buyers guide listing the growing number of climate-friendly refrigerator models they have identified by the only means they know of -- poking their heads inside refrigerators at big box stores and recording refrigerant information listed on the serial plate stickers.
Unfounded fears, stoked by the chemical industry, led to decades-long delay
It didn't have to be this way. In 1993, a German appliance manufacturer started selling an HFC-free refrigerator whose very name -- ""Greenfreeze"" -- touted its use of a climate-friendly refrigerant
More than 1 billion HFC-free refrigerators have now been sold worldwide, including units sold overseas by U.S. manufacturers, at a time when climate-friendly refrigerators are just becoming available in the U.S.


A recent Inside Climate News investigation found the decades-long delay in the use of climate-friendly refrigerants in America has been driven largely by the U.S. chemical industry, which manufactures HFCs.
HFCs are multibillion-dollar products that would likely be replaced by less expensive and more efficient climate-friendly alternatives if standards put forth by Underwriters Laboratories didn't until recently limit their use, likely at the behest of chemical companies.
Underwriters Laboratories, now known as ""UL,"" is a private company that provides independent safety certifications for thousands of consumer products.
When GE first submitted its application to EPA in 2008 to use only small amounts of isobutane as a refrigerator coolant, Honeywell International, one of the leading HFC manufacturers, opposed the rule change.
The company claimed that isobutane is ""highly flammable and explosive even in small amounts,"" a claim that has not been substantiated by the more than 1 billion isobutane refrigerators in safe operation worldwide. The agency finally granted the request in 2011.
When I asked Julie Wood at GE Appliances why the company wasn't now advertising the environmental benefit of its climate-friendly refrigerator models, she said she didn't think there would be much interest.
""At the end of the day, there is just low consumer awareness,"" Wood said.
That may be the case. It's also possible that appliance manufacturers prefer to quietly make the switch to climate-friendly alternatives without raising the ire of chemical manufacturers.
In my own case, Wood offered to assist me in returning my HFC refrigerator to Home Depot, where I bought it, and to help me find a climate-friendly model. By the time we spoke, however, I'd already ordered an HFC-free fridge from another manufacturer and spoken to a Home Depot representative about returning the one from GE that ran on HFCs.
When I described the problem with the first fridge to the Home Depot representative, I was fairly certain her eyes glazed over the moment I began to speak. Then she put me on hold while she rang GE asking if they would cover the cost of the return.
When she resumed our call, much to my surprise, she said it was no problem, GE would pay for the return. I asked her if she had told them everything, how I was sold an HFCfree fridge and instead got one with HFCs.
""No,"" she said. ""I (simply) told them it was not cooling properly; it was not cooling the way that it should.""
To me, that was the best, most truthful explanation anyone could give.

USA-2021-34.txt,"Climate Point: The Wright brothers make it to Mars and dire drought forecasts in California

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Before Los Angeles became the center of the cinematic universe, the City of Angels was an oil town. Hydrocarbons quite literally bubbled all the way to the surface near what is now downtown, and the first oil well in the area was drilled in 1892. I'd argue that by now -- 129 years later -- regulators in liberal, environmentally minded California should be adept at watching over the industry. Not so, says my colleague Janet Wilson in her latest investigation for The Desert Sun and ProPublica. ""Enforcement is still lax,"" she writes, ""and in many cases, the state doesn't know if companies are complying."" She found a trail of oil spills, unpaid fines and enforcement orders that went ignored in the face of a tepid regulatory response.
Meanwhile, I wrote about a new report that came out Tuesday and shows California oil regulators aren't alone. The country's system for ensuring environmental compliance is fragmented and largely handed off to the states, leading to wildly disparate levels of oversight. There are some surprises -- is Texas really doing a good job managing its polluting industries? -- but the overall message is that more uniformity could go a long way.
Here's some other important reporting...
MUST-READ STORIES
From Kitty Hawk to Jezero Crater. Loyal Climate Point readers know I'm all about Mars news, so this AP story immediately caught my eye. A swatch of fabric from Orville and Wilbur Wright's first airplane has made it to the red planet aboard Ingenuity, the small helicopter set to be deployed from the Perseverance rover. It's not the first time the Wright brothers' plane has made it into space, but now it's flown all the way to another planet.
Regulatory minefield. The Star Tribune out of the Twin Cities reports that a proposed copper mine that has been at the center of environmental controversy lost approval for a permit ""to fill or dredge more than 900 acres of wetland."" With the change in federal administration, there are now five major permits that are back under review, casting the future of the $1 billion project in doubt. Of note, this latest permit review was initiated specifically to check if an indigenous band's water would be impacted.


Drinking toxins. In a hard-hitting piece of investigative reporting, Max Blau of Georgia Health News and ProPublica dug into 90 million tons of toxic coal ash that had accumulated in waste dumps after being generated at coal-fired power plants run by the second-largest energy provider in the country. In the end, Georgia Power ""spent millions of dollars on lobbying tactics to dodge billions in environmental costs."" The power company declined to answer many questions, but said it did its part to clean up its coal ash ponds. This story has it all: ratepayers footing the bill for cleanup, contaminated wells, and utilities and lawmakers turning a blind eye to a public health catastrophe.
The air is thick. Just down the Gulf Coast, the Tampa Bay Times this week published an equally disturbing investigation into public health concerns, writing that Florida's lone lead smelter ""exposed workers for years to levels of lead in the air that were hundreds of times higher than the federal limit."" Company-issued respirators weren't designed to handle that much contamination, a company doctor didn't tell workers the truth about lead in their blood, employees were punished for being poisoned -- leading some to donate contaminated blood -- and federal regulators went years without conducting inspections. The company said it has spent many millions of dollars making the smelter safer.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
Concern on the Colorado. In an ever-warming world that must feed an ever-growing population, all eyes remain on the Colorado River and the 40 million people it sustains. The current guidelines managing water usage along the river expire in 2026, so the states that use the river are launching into negotiations. The team over at KUNC public radio in Colorado prepared this helpful explainer that digs into what some of the major players want and where the battle lines lie. Meanwhile, AP reports that a Nevada town is fighting to stop the renovation of a 115-year-old earthen irrigation canal in an example of how complex water laws and systems have evolved over the years.
States vs. California. The Indianapolis Star reports that Indiana is trying to take on environmentally friendly stances coming from California cities. Earlier in March, the Hoosier State's attorney general joined a coalition of 18 states filing a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court, requesting that it intervene in a climate change case brought by two Golden State cities. Those states are taking the side of Big Oil by echoing the industry's argument that these climate change cases should be heard not in state courts -- which are perceived to be less sympathetic to oil -- but rather in federal courts that were packed with conservative judges in recent years.
Fossil fuels stay hungry for subsidies. Sticking with the theme of conservative states going out of their way to defend fossil fuels, Wyoming continues its legislative push to prop up its shrinking coal industry. Camille Erickson of the Casper Star Tribune reports that one proposed bill would ""require utilities to take additional steps before they can receive approval from state regulators to retire aging coal or natural gas plants."" A second bill would give $500,000 of taxpayers' money to the governor and attorney general ""to potentially sue other states restricting the import or use of Wyoming coal.""


EVER-PRESENT CLIMATE CHANGE
Weary of the weather. For The Arizona Republic, Erin Stone reports that nearly half of 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed feel stress in their daily lives that relates back to uncertainty, fear and other concerns about climate change. In this important piece, she gauges what's on her readers' minds and what this stress could mean in the long run. Take a read. Hot with a chance of dry. Is California in for more drought? According to the Sacramento Bee, that seems likely. ""State and federal officials issued remarkably bleak warnings Tuesday about California's summer water supplies, telling farmers and others to gear up for potential shortages,"" they wrote. A bloom and bust industry. ""This is a disastrous year for wildflowers,"" desert ecologist James Cornett told The Desert Sun's Janet Wilson this week. Only a few years removed from a ""super bloom"" that brought hordes of people out to the desert to see wildflowers, minimal precipitation means no such spectacle is on the way. And, as the climate changes, more frequent and severe droughts can be expected, further drying up the forecast for long periods at a time.
AND ANOTHER THING
Wolfing down some news. And finally this week, let's head over to the Southwest where The Arizona Republic's Anton Delgado reports that the population of the Mexican gray wolf, a protected species, continues making a recovery. A recent survey found at least 186 of these wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona, the fifth straight year their population has increased. Several decades ago, that number was believed to have fallen all the way down to seven wolves, so this update signals a welcome win, although concerns of genetic diversity and poaching persist. Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

USA-2021-35.txt,"Republicans tell Buttigieg that Biden's infrastructure bill should focus on roads, rail, ports - not climate or social justice

Ledyard King | USA TODAY
WASHINGTON ¬≠ Congressional Republicans are pushing back against the Biden administration's ambitious infrastructure proposal, warning that any plan that strays from core transportation priorities to one that tackles climate change and social justice won't get GOP support. ""I don't think the bill can grow into a multi-trillion-dollar catch-all,"" Missouri Rep. Sam Graves, the top Republican on the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee said Thursday. ""A transportation bill needs to be a transportation bill, not a Green New Deal. It needs to be about roads and bridges."" Graves spoke during a hearing where Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg laid out broad priorities for ¬≠ but few details of ¬≠ President Joe Biden's wide-ranging $3 trillion infrastructure bill designed not only to repair bridges and modernize railways but also to drive the transition to a clean energy economy. ""In the United States, transportation is the leading contributor to climate change, contributing to a pattern of extreme weather events, which takes a severe toll on our infrastructure,"" Buttigieg told the committee. ""Every dollar we spend rebuilding from a climate-driven disaster is a dollar we could have spent building a more competitive, modern, and resilient transportation system that produces significantly lower emissions."" Biden is expected to unveil the initial pieces of his economic agenda next week in Pittsburgh where White House press secretary Jen Psaki said he will deliver a speech ""laying out more details of his plan to build the economy back better."" Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda ¬≠ a slogan Biden coined on the campaign trail ¬≠ includes several components, according to Psaki: Upgrades to aging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, rail and cyber equipment; a tax code overhaul that benefits


workers; a boost for caregivers; increased access to health care; and clean energy investments.
More: More than 45,000 bridges rated in poor condition, but President Joe Biden's infrastructure plan may hit snag
The prospect of a bill to rebuild highways, repair crumbling bridges and modernize the nation's rail systems is viewed by both parties as an opportunity for a bipartisan moment in a Congress wracked by political acrimony. But even that may be difficult.
Republicans still fume about the way they feel Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill, known as the American Rescue Plan, was jammed through the Democratic-controlled Congress without a single GOP vote.
Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., told Buttigieg infrastructure must not be handled in the same manner.
""I just came back from a motorcycle ride ¬≠ my first of the season ¬≠ and I can reaffirm for you the obvious that our roads and bridges in this country suck. They need a lot of work,"" Katko said. ""And we can't do it in a partisan manner because its too big an issue for us.""
More: Biden putting final touches on potential $3 trillion economic, infrastructure package as Buttigieg heads to the Hill
Republicans have little appetite for a bill that could add to a national debt already above $28 trillion. And any tax or fee increases Biden or Democrats might propose to help pay for the costs are likely dead on arrival in a Senate that will need at least 10 Republicans to overcome a legislative hurdle known as the filibuster.
Asked during Thursday's hearing about how the bill would be financed, Buttigieg said it could rely on a combination of sources including user fees (such as gas taxes), revenues from other taxes that comes through the general budget, or borrowing.
""The bulk of any proposal will amount to whatever Congress is prepared to authorize (on) any combination of those sources,"" he said.
It's not just House Republicans who are resistant to Biden's proposal.
GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, said he's wary of another mammoth bill that could be a vehicle to promote a liberal agenda, including free community college, universal pre-kindergarten and paid family leave.
""We're hearing the next few months might bring a so-called 'infrastructure' proposal that may actually be a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies,"" he said on the Senate floor Monday.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday she wants ""a strong bipartisan bill"" but won't take out provisions addressing social justice or climate aspects for the sake of placating Republicans.


""We cannot settle just for what we can agree on without recognizing that this has to be a bill for the future, that we have to recognize the climate crisis and what we can do,"" she told reporters on a press call. The country's total infrastructure needs over the decade are approaching $6 trillion or about $2.6 trillion more than what the public and private sectors are projected to spend, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. If not addressed, ASCE projects the ""overdue infrastructure bill"" will cost each American household approximately $3,300 per year in lost productivity and higher prices for goods and services. More: Coronavirus cuts transportation funding, puts major road and bridge projects on hold In addition, the Texas Transportation Institute, which studies commute times, says the extra 54 hours spent idling in traffic costs each commuter $1,080 on average in wasted time and fuel. One idea gaining traction is changing the way motorists are charged to use roads, bridges and tunnels. The current system relies primarily on the gas tax where drivers pay for the fuel they use. But with the increase of fuel-efficient electric vehicles and Biden's push to wean the country off fossil fuels, Democrats and Republicans are warming to the idea of charging based on a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) system that charges based on how far people go. Buttigieg said that's an idea under consideration but said concerns about privacy and technology have yet to be resolved. ""We've got a little work to do,"" he told the committee.

USA-2021-36.txt,"The Biden administration, citing climate change, halted oil and gas lease sales in January. Now, what?

BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden shut down oil and gas lease sales from the nation's vast public lands and waters in his first days in office, citing worries about climate change.
Now his administration has to figure out what do with the multibillion-dollar program without crushing a significant sector of the U.S. economy -- and while fending off sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and the oil industry.
The leasing ban is only temporary, although officials have declined to say how long it will last. And it's unclear how much legal authority the government has to stop drilling on about 23 million acres previously leased to energy companies.
Thirteen Republican-leaning states sued the Biden administration Wednesday to end a suspension of new oil and gas leases on federal land and water and to reschedule canceled sales of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska waters and Western states.
Here are some questions hanging over Biden's Interior Department as it launches a months-long review of the government's petroleum sales with a virtual forum Thursday.
Why target oil and gas lease sales?
Burning of oil, gas and coal from government-owned lands and waters is a top source of U.S. emissions, accounting for 24% of the nation's greenhouse gases. Oil and gas account for the biggest chunk of human-caused fossil fuel emissions from federal lands following a drilling surge under former President Donald Trump.
Emission reductions from a permanent leasing ban would be relatively small ¬≠ about 100 million tons (91 million metric tons) annually, or less than 1% of global fossil fuel emissions, according to a study by a nonprofit research group.
But environmentalists and others who want more aggressive action against climate change say a ban would nudge the economy in a new direction. Biden wants to substitute fossil fuel production and consumption with policies that promote renewable energy on public lands, such as wind and solar power.
""The federal government is a huge player here. The government has market power,"" said attorney Max Sarinsky with New York University Law School's Institute for Policy Integrity. ""If you restrict the supply (of oil and gas), you alter the market and you create a better environment for more sustainable fuels.""


Lease sales and royalties companies pay on extracted oil and gas brought in more than $83 billion in revenue over the past decade.
Half the money from onshore drilling goes to the state where it occurred. Money from offshore drilling gets shared with states at a lesser rate and pays for a conservation fund used to preserve land nationwide.
What's happened so far?
The administration postponed lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and Utah. Biden earlier had suspended leasing in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Interior officials say the fossil fuel program has failed to consider climate impacts and that irresponsible leasing practices carve up wildlife habitat, threaten Native American cultural and sacred sites and lock up public lands that could be used for recreation or conservation.

After what they call a ""fire sale"" of public energy reserves under Trump, Biden's team argues that companies still have plenty of undeveloped leases -- almost 14 million acres in Western states and more than 9 million acres offshore. Companies also have about 7,700 unused drilling permits -- enough for years.
Despite the moratorium, the Biden administration has continued to issue new permits for existing leases, including more than 200 in March, records show.
Environmentalists want that to stop, but an outright drilling ban would raise thorny legal issues. Companies could claim they have the right to extract oil and gas after spending years and millions of dollars to secure leases.
What are Biden's options?
A ban on new leases means drilling would fade out as existing ones expire. It would be a heavy blow for western and Gulf Coast states that heavily depend on oil and gas revenue to pay for schools, roads and other services.
Another option is to increase royalty fees to reflect the ""social cost"" of climate change ¬≠ damage from rising seas, drought, wildfires and other global warming impacts. That would keep revenue flowing and make it more expensive to drill on federal land, forcing companies to concentrate on the most profitable reserves and reducing emissions, though by less than a ban.


""If it's not possible to have a carbon tax on all oil and gas extraction, at least we could do something akin to that on public lands,"" said James Stock, a Harvard University economist and former member of the White House Council on Economic Advisers under Obama.
How many jobs could be lost?
Economists say claims by industry groups and allies in Congress that a leasing ban would trigger massive job losses are greatly exaggerated.
An industry-promoted University of Wyoming study projected almost 300,000 jobs lost by 2025. But historical data on energy jobs suggest a much smaller impact of about 60,000 jobs, said Jeremy Weber, former chief energy economist for Trump's White House Council of Economic Advisers and now a University of Pittsburgh associate professor.
Opinion: Biden's climate change orders take a sledgehammer to Western state economies
That's still a significant number as the U.S. economy recovers from job losses in the pandemic. And even limited job losses could profoundly affect local economies in Wyoming, New Mexico and other oil-dependent states.
There's also no guarantee such impacts would be offset by Biden's promise to deliver millions of new green energy jobs, such as installing solar panels or helping with environmental cleanups of abandoned oil wells and coal mines.
Despite promises by renewable energy advocates, such jobs ""don't fill the bucket like oil and gas does,"" said Jim Willox, a commissioner in Converse County, Wyoming, the state's top crude producer and home to several new wind farms.
Aware of such concerns, Biden climate adviser Gina McCarthy met with executives from Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other companies Monday to discuss ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A White House statement said the administration ""is not fighting the oil and gas sector"" and wants to create jobs while addressing emissions.
American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said independent forecasts show natural gas and oil will provide about half of the global energy mix for decades to come.
What's next?
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, sworn in last week as the first Native American to oversee the nation's public lands and waters, will kick off Thursday's forum, which will include representatives of industry, labor, conservationist groups, Indigenous people and others.


Haaland, a former two-term New Mexico congresswoman, said she wants to ""strike the right balance"" as Interior manages energy development while seeking to conserve public lands and address climate change. An interim report to be completed this summer will outline recommendations for Interior and Congress to overhaul the fossil fuels program. A similar review of government coal sales during the Obama administration was to last three years, but was canceled by Trump.

USA-2021-37.txt,"Communities worry about health as states ignore climate pledges, build oil infrastructure

Ingrid Lobet | Capital & Main
Magali Sanchez-Hall, usually in motion, pauses for a moment on the sidewalk to gaze through a chain-link fence at the massive construction project: tanks shaped like giant tuna fish cans that will store crude oil.
The Los Angeles refinery has been her troublesome neighbor for a quarter of a century, but she finds this latest turn particularly perplexing.
""Right now, we are supposed to be moving to clean energy,"" she said.
Sanchez-Hall, 50, raised her children here before getting a master's degree in public policy. When Tesoro, now Marathon Petroleum, first proposed the tanks in 2016, she opposed them, citing sickening fumes from the ones already there.
""It's a poor neighborhood, we don't have air conditioners, so we leave the windows open,"" she said. ""To put new tanks in, just to store more oil, it's not rational.""
As climate change strikes the USA in devastating ways ¬≠ flooding in Miami, blackened forests in California and weeks of choking air across the West ¬≠ the shift toward a lower-carbon economy is well underway. The new Big Energy companies own renewable, not oil, assets, governments set dates to phase out gasoline-powered cars, and investors wholeheartedly back green technology.
Governors in California, New Jersey, Louisiana and Colorado have laid out ambitious timetables for ramping down climate emissions, each demanding a plan to reduce them by at least 80% by 2050.
Yet in these same states, the nonprofit news organization Capital & Main found that oil companies are granted approval for projects that will tie their financial success to fossil fuel production for decades to come.
More: Read the story at Capital & Main
Companies say they need the buildouts to make their operations more efficient, to lease out for income or to seize export opportunities.
These eleventh-hour investments add toxic emissions to the air in low-income communities already carrying heavy environmental burdens.

More: Why Memphis families fighting Byhalia pipeline have had enough
In the Los Angeles area, 11 tank projects are underway, mainly in communities of color. At the largest, the one near Sanchez-Hall, the refinery says it needs the additional space to store more crude oil.
New Jersey authorities approved 14 storage tanks, at Tremley Point near the Bayway refinery that serves New York and beyond. In Louisiana, Ergon Moda St. James got a permit to put up 20 giant tanks to store gasoline. Weld County, Colorado, commissioners agreed to let Phillips 66 build two large crude oil tanks and other equipment along the planned Liberty pipeline that would travel from the Bakken oilfield to Oklahoma.
Communities tend to pay close attention to these tanks. That's not just because tanks are a link in the fossil fuel chain ¬≠ they make hydrocarbons available on demand ¬≠ but because they leak, and the vapors they emit can be unhealthy.
The Marathon Los Angeles Refinery near Sanchez-Hall's home bridges the Los Angeles harbor neighborhood of Wilmington and the city of Carson. Marathon Petroleum is building six tanks, each 69 feet high and 240 feet across. The company is among the largest refiners in the country: 13 states, 16 refineries, 3 million barrels a day.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), responsible for protecting air quality in the Los Angeles basin, counted the myriad pollution sources in the area and found that petroleum refining is the largest single contributor of volatile air contaminants. That is striking, considering that the area includes major ports and freeways with heavy truck traffic. It's so heavily polluted that it was one of only 13 communities chosen out of 307 nominated for inclusion in California's community-led air pollution reduction program.
The new tanks will take their place near dozens of tanks that operate all day, every day, their roofs rising as they fill, and sinking as they empty into refinery distillers. Homes sit as close as 1,300 feet away. Within a few blocks of the refinery perimeter are about 15,000 households with about four people per home, over half of them Latino, who earn one-fifth less than the state's median household income.
Sanchez-Hall, a community scholar at the UCLA North American Integration and Development Center, said she can often smell the refinery.
""We would have to close the windows every morning around 7 a.m.,"" she said. ""It's a really bad smell that gets into your head and makes it impossible to breathe.""
She's concerned the new tanks will mean more fumes. Data backs up her concerns.


If you've ever spilled gasoline at the pump, you've witnessed its tendency to go airborne. Tank hydrocarbons can be like that. The roofs that float on top of the liquid are intended to prevent evaporation and those vapors from catching fire, exploding or leaking. The roofs can leak around their perimeters, and fumes can escape the tanks through valves, flanges and other places where there is a meeting or connection.
Tanks are an outsize source of fumes at a refinery, researchers have found. ""In our experience, tank emissions contribute approximately two-thirds of the total refinery emissions,"" said a team of scientists, who later took measurements at more than 100 industrial facilities.
In a review of 16 studies published last summer in Environmental Health, researchers found residents who live near refineries, in so-called fence-line communities, had a 30% increased risk of developing leukemia.
Why this buildout, why now?
To arrive at the Los Angeles refinery, crude oil is transported in supertanker ships that dock at special berths at Southern California ports. The ancient liquid comes from Ecuador, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. It empties into a pipeline connection at the dock, and from there, it is routed north 3¬Ω miles to Marathon's Carson Crude Terminal and refinery.
In official documents, the company said the increased storage of crude will not translate into any significant increase in fuel production. Community groups argued the tanks were part of an expansion. After six years of dispute, the company's argument won out in the environmental impact report, in an analysis by an independent petroleum engineer and, after community groups sued, in state appeals court.
The company said the reason for the tank expansion is that the biggest supertanker ships hold so much crude ¬≠ about 1.8 million barrels each ¬≠ that it strains the loading capacity of even this facility, the largest refinery on the West Coast. Before tankers can finish unloading, they must detach from the berth and anchor nearby, polluting the air with engine emissions while they wait.
Douglas Miller, former vice president for California Value Chain Strategy for Tesoro Companies ¬≠ since purchased by Marathon ¬≠ said in a declaration filed with the environmental impact report that companies must pay shippers for this waiting time. The new tanks will save 20 to 25 cents on every barrel of oil, Miller said ¬≠ potentially $400,000 per cargo load.
Marathon did not respond to questions sent in email or subsequent queries, but the environmental impact report, like the petroleum engineering report, says the tanks will reduce pollution levels for portside residents because the supertankers will spend less time in the harbor.
Julia May, senior scientist with Communities for a Better Environment, maintains the tanks are clearly an expansion.


""What they left out,"" she said, ""was if you can bring ships in and out more quickly, that allows more ships to come in.""
Circumstances surrounding these projects vary. In Colorado, the planned tanks and pipeline would bring in ""over $1 million in annual property taxes to Weld County and a one-time sales tax of more than $1 million for the materials and equipment to build the facility,"" according to the Liberty joint venture website.
Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards has been a strong supporter of petrochemical development near the St. James storage tanks, an oil hub on the Mississippi River. The tanks to store gasoline at Tremley Point in New Jersey will be filled with refined product from the Phillips 66 refinery next door, meaning increased business at a marine terminal.
The skyrocketing availability of oil brought on by the shale boom beginning in 2008 spurred a buildout of pipelines and storage, especially along routes to the Gulf Coast.
Another powerful factor in this buildout, globally, is private capital seeking higher returns. Some years ago, this capital zeroed in on storage tanks as a fresh opportunity, said Frank Schreurs, managing director of InEnergy, a boutique energy advisory firm in the Netherlands.
""It's like real estate,"" he said. ""You build your infrastructure, and then you get a rental person in and they pay you a fixed fee for using the infrastructure.""
Many of the tank farms would probably not have been built if not for these funds, Schreurs said: ""There is so much money it is almost scary.""
In a sign of the heavy question mark hanging over oil, none of those three facilities has been built.
A spokesman for Phillips 66 said the company deferred the Liberty pipeline project with its tanks, ""due to the challenging business environment."" The same is true for the tanks in New Jersey. Ergon and Moda Midstream declined to comment about their unbuilt project in Louisiana.
The oil industry has been having difficulty borrowing for its capital-intensive projects as climate change realigns lending rules, which has added to other hurdles, such as flat demand and lengthy court battles.
A long-understood undercount
In Los Angeles, if the new Marathon tanks don't represent an expansion of the refinery as a whole, they do represent an expansion of storage ¬≠ that is their purpose. According to government documents, storage capacity at the refinery will increase by nearly a third, from 11 million to more than 14 million barrels.


The tanks also will leak and give off vapors, a fact that stands out starkly in the state's engineering report. They will have 608 flanges estimated to leak 7 pounds of volatile organic compounds per year. They will have 668 connectors estimated to leak nearly 3 pounds per year. Combined with what are referred to as tank breathing emissions, each of the six tanks are expected to release 20 pounds of volatile gases daily.
This is the reality with tanks. Documents for the petroleum tank projects in New Jersey and Louisiana accept that there will be leaks, too. The new tanks in St. James Parish are permitted to emit about 270 pounds per day.
The environmental report for the Los Angeles tank project notes that its estimates represent a worst-case scenario, based on a hypothetical mix of crude oil that leans toward tar sands, a sludgy petroleum deposit consisting of mostly sand, water, clay, and bitumen.
Some emissions may be even higher than these official estimates, though. When regulators evaluate whether a community will suffer too much exposure to a potent chemical such as benzene from a new project, they do not actually measure. They estimate using something called emissions factors ¬≠ a sort of lookup table where they plug in the size of the project and the chemical to be put in the tank, along with other parameters.
When officials tested that method a few years ago in Los Angeles, they found it deficient. They hired a Swedish university spinoff company called FluxSense to measure actual refinery emissions over two months at all six major refineries in Los Angeles.
Its report revealed that the method routinely used by authorities doesn't come close to accurately predicting benzene emissions. On average, Los Angeles refineries release 34 times more benzene than they report. The FluxSense report found that Marathon was even worse, emanating 43 times more benzene than the company reported. As a result, the company fixed several problems pinpointed by researchers.
Benzene has been known to be harmful for so long that when California gained the authority decades ago to make its air quality regulations tougher than those of the federal government, benzene was among its highest priorities.
People exposed repeatedly to benzene can develop leukemia. It depresses blood cell counts and can lead to anemia. It can damage the immune system, is toxic for unborn babies and affects male fertility.
""Any benzene exposure is a concern, regardless of exposure length,"" California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment said in a refinery study four years ago.
The study's findings have not been integrated into the way Los Angeles air officials grant permits. State air officials acknowledge that dangerous emissions remain undercounted.
""I think it is pretty well-known that there is underreporting of fugitive emissions from storage tanks,"" Sarah Rees, assistant deputy executive officer at the South Coast AQMD said during a meeting of the Wilmington/Carson/West Long Beach Community Steering


Committee.
The air district said it hasn't integrated the much-higher benzene measurements into its permitting because the method is not certified in the USA. The agency convened a working group to update its methods.
Officials pointed to fence-line air testers mounted on the perimeter of most California refineries. Communities had asked for those monitors for years, and their calls gained traction after a fire at a Chevron refinery in Richmond in 2012 sent more than 10,000 people to the hospital.
In Louisiana, the faith-based environmental group RISE St. James, with the Louisiana Environmental Action Network and Louisiana Bucket Brigade, opposed the tank farm in their highly polluted African American neighborhood. Parish councilman Clyde Cooper got a commitment for fence-line air testers.
At refineries at least, federal authorities and some states seem to be taking air issues more seriously.
In 2013, the governor of California created an Interagency Refinery Task Force, which aims to ""work collaboratively to achieve the highest possible level of safety for refinery workers and local communities."" In 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted rules intended to clean the air around refineries across the nation, requiring for the first time that levels of benzene be measured around perimeters. In 2017, the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association and Air Resources Board called for more monitoring and community awareness around refineries, a call it repeated two years later.
More: EPA adopts rules to limit oil refineries' emissions into neighborhoods
Oil infrastructure reaches far beyond refineries, which are only one endpoint. Petroleum products get switched from pipeline to ship or river barge or loaded into trucks to supply gas stations.
Tanks serve a crucial function. They bridge inevitable pauses in the relay chain, said Cathy Landry, spokeswoman for the International Liquid Terminals Association. Oil or gasoline doesn't get shipped out the second it arrives, she said, ""It is batched, so diesel might go out next week, and this week it's gasoline.""
Are the days of new infrastructure numbered?
The delay in building permitted projects may signify a tipping point. Even some oil companies have announced plans to zero out their carbon emissions.
Nearly two decades after passing the world's first tailpipe climate law, after a year when oil companies wrote down billions of dollars in assets, when ExxonMobil was removed from the Dow Jones industrial index, when California's governor announced that no new


internal combustion cars would be sold beginning in 2035, the South Coast AQMD still does not consider climate change in permitting decisions for oil companies. ""We review permit applications,"" the agency said. ""There is no requirement currently to limit any buildout of fossil fuel infrastructure."" Americans buy hundreds of millions of gallons of gasoline a day, but sales have been pretty flat for the past 18 years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said fossil fuel use must ramp down sharply each year to have a better than even chance of climate change shy of catastrophic. Amol Phadke, a senior scientist at the University of California, Berkeley who specializes in energy technology policy, noted huge advances made in recent years in clean technology. ""I think we should not be building new fossil infrastructure,"" he said. ""We should be phasing it out.""

USA-2021-38.txt,"12 Republican state attorneys general sue President Biden over climate change order

WASHINGTON ¬≠ Twelve states with Republican attorneys general Monday sued President Joe Biden over his first executive order aimed at climate change, alleging he lacked the constitutional authority to implement new rules about greenhouse gases.
The federal lawsuit, led by Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt of Missouri, argues Biden violated the separation of powers clause in the Constitution because Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate.
On his first day in the White House, Biden signed Executive Order 13990, directing federal agencies to calculate the ""social cost"" of greenhouse gas pollution by estimating ""monetized damages"" to inform future federal regulations. This includes changes in net agricultural productivity, human health, property damage from increased flood risk and the value of ecosystem services.
More: Biden prioritizes climate change as national security concern, pauses oil drilling on public lands
But the 12 states that are plaintiffs say assigning such values is a ""quintessentially legislative action that falls within Congress' exclusive authority."" They also say the economic ramifications of the order will be disastrous.
""If the Executive Order stands, it will inflict hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars of damage to the U.S. economy for decades to come,"" the suit reads. ""It will destroy jobs, stifle energy production, strangle America's energy independence, suppress agriculture, deter innovation, and impoverish working families. It undermines the sovereignty of the States and tears at the fabric of liberty.""
Republican state attorneys general from Arkansas, Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah joined the suit.
The White House and Department of Justice declined to comment on the suit.
The complaint asks the court to issue an order that prohibits federal agencies from using the ""social cost"" estimates and to declare they are ""arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and contrary to law,"" among other relief.


Executive Order 13990 also revoked the Keystone XL Pipeline permit and instructed the Interior Department to review the Trump's administration's decision to shrink the boundaries of national monuments. It was one of several early executive actions that Biden took to combat climate change during his first month in office. Orders that Biden signed Jan. 27 elevated climate change as a national security concern, committed to the goal of conserving at least 30% (an increase from 12%) of all federal land and water by 2030 and built on his economic policy agenda to direct federal agencies to ""procure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy industries. More: 6 takeaways from the Senate's approval of Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill Biden campaigned on being the most aggressive president on climate change, which he called ""an existential threat."" His goal is to decarbonize the U.S. power sector by 2035 on the way to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. States on both sides of the issue have sued the federal government on climate change. Mostly red states sued to stop the Obama administration from implementing its Clean Power Plan aimed at slashing carbon emissions from coal-fired power plans. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the challenge in 2015 and the program never took effect. In 2019, a coalition of mostly blue states sued the Trump administration to stop its efforts to weaken the Obama effort to put national limits on carbon emissions from power plants.

USA-2021-39.txt,"Climate Point: America's offshore wind industry finally gains momentum

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Let's begin in the nation's capital, where the political script we read for the past four years is being flipped on its head. USA Today reports that a coalition of 12 Republican attorneys general launched a lawsuit against President Joe Biden's efforts to address climate change. The executive order at the center of the litigation directed the federal government to calculate the cost of greenhouse gas pollution in order to guide regulations, but the Republican states argued this move would be bad for business.
Here's some other important reporting....
MUST-READ STORIES
Offshore going mainstream. The Biden administration on Monday approved ""the country's first full-scale offshore wind farm,"" greenlighting the Vineyard Wind project that will sit 12 nautical miles off the coast of Massachusetts. E&E reports that the development still requires a few final permits, but this approval is a big step toward kickstarting a U.S. offshore wind industry. Not to mention, the wind farm is expected to generate enough electricity to power 400,000 homes.
Water woes. The Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University partnered with WWNO in New Orleans and WRKF in Baton Rouge for a series diving into water issues in Louisiana. In the first installment, the team reports that unregulated pumping of groundwater has led to the state's aquifers draining more rapidly than nearly anywhere else in the country. Also on the water front, some Western states aren't seeing eye-to-eye on the dwindling Colorado River. As negotiations continue over the future of allotments that are bigger than what the river can provide, AP reports that Utah is positioning itself to fight for its full share, even if other states are giving ground.
When green isn't green. Going international for a moment, Bloomberg reports that a Mexican program meant to incentivize tree-planting isn't all it's cracked up to be. The goal is to create timber and fruit industries and combat climate change, but it's offering the wrong incentive. Instead of working as planned, the program has led to farmers clearing jungle in order to get credit for planting new trees. Take a look.
POLITICAL CLIMATE


Political positioning. Rep. Deb Haaland's contested path toward the top of the Department of the Interior finally appears to be cleared, as the Senate plans to vote on her nomination Monday. She should have the votes. Meanwhile, the Detroit Free Press writes that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm has been approved to lead the Department of Energy. And, USA Today reports, Michael Regan was confirmed as the first Black man to take the post of Environmental Protection Agency administrator.
California oil rush. While liberals won the day in Washington, D.C., it was conservative county supervisors in the Central Valley who grabbed headlines in California. The Desert Sun's Janet Wilson reports that Kern County this week ""gave upfront, blanket environmental approval for 40,500 new oil and gas wells."" About three-quarters of the Golden State's oil industry is in Kern, making it a battleground between environmental justice advocates and fossil fuel companies. The former argued that public health impacts and climate change were being ignored, while the latter pointed toward the economic impact of winding down oil production. Farmers threatened to sue to stop drilling on or near their land, but green groups beat them to the punch, filing litigation on Thursday.
Oil field of dreams. And speaking of oil, Colorado state legislators are tasked with retooling the system meant to guarantee there's money left to clean up old oil and gas wells. Nick Bowlin of High Country News reports on new data from think tank Carbon Tracker that found the true price to plug and remediate these wells could be many millions of dollars costlier than the current system has set aside. ""With the industry's murky financial future, experts predict more and more sales of risky wells to less-wealthy operators, until the state could end stuck with the final cost,"" he writes.
OUR WILD WORLD
""Bloodless cockfighting."" That's how this new feature from the magazine Guernica describes the often illegal, underground world of finch singing competitions in New York City. The birds are typically smuggled from Guyana and can be worth thousands of dollars apiece, but there's a push to legalize the trade. Take a few minutes to get a window into this fascinating slice of the world.
Monster fish. The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports that ""a fearsome new invasive predator has emerged in the state."" Called the arapaima, it's a fish that can grow up to 10 feet long and is a native of the Amazon River. While there's still no evidence that the fish has reproduced in the Sunshine State, concerns abound that its presence spells trouble for native species due to its ""voracious appetite.""
Digging for history in Phoenix. Turning now to more urban environments, The Arizona Republic is out with an interesting new look at the history and development of Phoenix and the surrounding valley where millions of people now live. A massive canal system constructed by Native American groups once spread more than 700 miles across the region, evidence of ""one of the ancient world's great engineering feats."" Recent work in Tempe is digging further into this rich history.
AND ANOTHER THING


News flash. All eyes were on Texas when a huge winter storm exposed inadequacies in the state's deregulated energy grid. In response, the crisis brought attention to the country's power system and the need to make some big changes. Across the USA Today Network, journalists checked in on how their region is doing. For The Oklahoman, Jack Money wrote that it could've been a lot worse for the Sooner State, as its participation in the multi-state Southwest Power Pool likely protected the grid's reliability. Still, shifting weather patterns will strain the system. For the Indianapolis Star, London Gibson and Sarah Bowman reported on the 34 counties across the state -- out of 92 -- that have ""ordinances that restrict wind and solar projects, or prohibit their construction altogether."" That anti-renewable effort will go a long way in hurting the state's ability to provide affordable power, experts say. And for The Arizona Republic, Ryan Randazzo answered his readers' burning question: Can this happen there too? In this piece, he explained what went wrong in Texas -- and what's different about the Southwest. Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2021-40.txt,"Fracking gas is too risky for our climate future

Fracking gas generates high emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
Katie Rock | Opinion contributor
Last month's polar vortex and other extreme weather events from the past year in Iowa and nationally have shown us the risks of continuing to rely on fossil fuels. As fuel lines froze, large volumes of gas and coal power plants were not able to operate during extreme cold putting millions at risk. Massive power outages caused millions of people, from here in Iowa down to Texas, to survive against the raw elements.
Some suffered and died due to hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, or fires caused by burning their own belongings for warmth. While some renewables were also forced offline, clean energy was largely more reliable than fossil fuels during this crisis.
Extreme weather and natural disasters show us time and again the need for a comprehensive shift to a clean, reliable energy system that keeps us healthy and does not worsen our climate crisis. We should reject claims that renewable energy is less reliable than our dependence on fossil fuels. Our energy grid needs critical infrastructure updates to continue to expand clean energy as the effects of climate change accelerate.
It is time to take a hard look at how to build a more resilient electricity system in Iowa. These moments of extremes are happening more often and reveal how vulnerability leads to injustice. Increasing investment in local distributed energy could have helped prevent the blackouts that affected over 5 million people across the U.S. We can start by adding on-site solar and storage to our most critical community spaces -- hospitals, schools, and essential businesses -- to offer support and shelter for times of crisis.
It should be clear now that generating more power from out-of-state gas in Iowa is a risky deal. Building more of the same will not fix this problem. It will only make it worse. Fracking gas generates high rates of emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide. When methane emissions from leaky, unregulated fracking wells are included, gas power is as bad as coal for our planet. Plus, as methane degrades in our atmosphere, it just becomes carbon dioxide. And that does not even include the contamination and depletion of our water supply from fracking.


Pollen season is expanding: If your allergies are more severe, more expensive and last longer, blame climate change Gas also poses risks financially. We know that more than 80% of large gas plants built today will become uneconomical due to the falling costs of energy by 2035, much like coal plants are today. In Iowa we have seen old coal plants shift to gas only to be demolished ahead of schedule. Roughly 80% of Iowa's remaining coal fleet is over 40 years old. Iowa can continue to lead on clean energy by retiring coal power, replacing it with clean energy, and saying no to new gas plants. As more coal plants come offline this decade, they must be replaced with clean sources including wind, solar, storage, energy efficiency and demand response tools. Sen. Capito: Bipartisan transportation bill can propel American economy forward Wind, solar and batteries are the lowest cost options for energy, and costs continue to decline. We don't need gas as a ""bridge fuel."" We are already on our way with wind and solar in Iowa, but we need more investments in clean energy and a clean grid to complete the transition. The Iowa Legislature should reject new state incentives for new gas infrastructure currently under consideration. A course correction to avoid the worst effects of climate change should include cutting fossil fuel use not only from electric power supply, but in buildings, transportation. and manufacturing supply chains. The extreme cold in 2019 was followed by a ""Bomb Cyclone"" that melted all our existing snow in days resulting in multibillion-dollar flood damage throughout the state, from which we are still recovering. We need to recognize that these new terms for unprecedented weather conditions are becoming our new normal. Climate change is the greatest challenge of our lifetimes. We owe the legacy of a clean, carbon-free energy transition to future generations. Katie Rock is campaign representative with Iowa Beyond Coal.

USA-2021-41.txt,"If your allergies are more severe, more expensive and last longer, blame climate change

My patients feel the burden of global warming and longer growing seasons. Without better climate policies, how far from reality is year-round pollen?
Dr. Neelu Tummala | Opinion contributor
""Why are my allergies lasting longer than they used to?"" The first time a patient asked this, I researched potential reasons. The second time, I was prepared with the answer. And now, knowing what is coming, I preempt the question. The growing season, the period when trees, grass and weeds grow and produce pollen, has lengthened by about 17 days in Washington, D.C., as compared to 1970. In Detroit and Portland, Oregon, the season has lengthened by almost a month.
A recent study published in PNAS, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reinforces what my patients are experiencing. Looking back approximately three decades, pollen seasons now last on average 20 extra days in North America, and pollen concentrations have increased about 21% over the years. The data shows that these changes in pollen allergy season are in part driven by anthropogenic global warming.
Quality of life is suffering
This study and others before it cement what health care providers who treat allergic rhinitis, or allergic inflammation of the nasal cavity, are seeing in their clinics. Climate change affects health. In this case, the roughly 20% of Americans who suffer from environmental allergies feel the burden of global warming through exacerbated pollen allergy symptoms, including increased nasal congestion, sneezing and post-nasal drainage.
Allergy symptoms have a tremendous impact on quality of life. It is not surprising that nasal congestion, a common symptom of allergic rhinitis, affects sleep quality. This translates into daytime fatigue and disruption of emotional health, including feeling irate or depressed. Also, children who suffer from allergies risk poorer school performance, an unwelcome consequence for students whose learning is already challenged in the COVID19 era.
Often, patients use a prior year's patterns to predict when to start their allergy medications. Some of the therapies directed at addressing nasal allergy symptoms are started before the onset of symptoms. Intranasal steroids, for example, are highly effective at controlling nasal inflammation, but the maximal efficacy of the spray may take days to


occur. Unfortunately, climate change-induced variations in pollen seasons may make the determination of timing more challenging. When patients are caught off guard by an early pollen season, they end up suffering through poorly controlled allergy symptoms by not starting their allergy medications.
A necessary shift: Climate chaos is the real job killer. Biden's clean energy plan will boost the economy.
Dr. Anjeni Keswani, the Director of the Allergy and Sinus Center at The George Washington Medical Faculty Associates, describes how her practice management has changed in recognizing the shift in ragweed pollen symptoms in her patients, with symptoms both starting earlier in the year and lasting longer. Because of these seasonal variations, she has found it necessary to adjust recommendations regarding starting and stopping allergy medications.
More medication, higher costs
Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased from 325 to 414 parts per million over the past 50 years. As pollen levels rise in response to global warming and increased carbon dioxide in the air, so too does the symptom burden. This increased burden of disease often requires more medication, which means more money out of your pocket. The economic cost of managing allergic rhinitis is approximately $3.4 billion, almost half of it for prescription medications. With both pollen seasons lasting longer and more pollen in the air to combat, this number will continue to rise.
Texas winter storms: Repeated climate disasters do not have to be our destiny
So where do we go from here?
Knowledge of how environmental changes impact health is important. It can help optimize the management of medications to maximize symptom control. Equally important, it is a constant and unwelcome reminder that the climate crisis affects our health. Climate action through effective government policy and corporate responsibility, as well as transition to a more sustainable lifestyle, are musts to address this growing risk factor. Without it, how far from reality is year-round pollen?

USA-2021-42.txt,"Climate Point: We made it back to Mars, but your earthly home might be in flood zone

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country (and the galaxy). In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
America is back on Mars! If you're anything like me, that means you spent the past week obsessively consuming news about NASA's Perseverance rover that landed on the red planet. If not, then I've got you covered. First, check out this AP video of the moment that touchdown was confirmed because cheering scientists either mean you're watching the end of a '90s movie or we just did something wild. Then, check out this USA Today piece on how the mission team has taken steps toward diversity. Next, Florida Today has more information on some quirks of the Mars mission. And, finally, head over to Perseverance's Twitter feed for a plethora of cool stuff, ranging from sounds recorded on Mars to insights from NASA.
Back on Earth, here's some other important reporting....
MUST-READ STORIES
Politics as usual. Currently, all eyes in Washington, D.C., are on U.S. Department of the Interior confirmation hearings, where Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., could become the first Native American to hold a cabinet position. But, conservatives aren't making life easy for her, as they argue she would be bad for fossil fuels -- Haaland previously came out in favor of the progressive Green New Deal. HuffPost has an interesting look at the irony of politicians who voted against action on climate change lecturing her to ""respect the science."" Still, as CNN reports, fossil fuel-friendly Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced he will support her, likely meaning she'll be confirmed. Meanwhile, the Detroit Free Press reports that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, who has pushed for both electric vehicles as well as renewables, has been confirmed by the Senate to helm the Department of Energy.
High water mark. Next up, here's one that you might not have heard about but could make your wallet a lot slimmer or a lot fatter, depending on where you live. USA Today reports on new data that speaks to an overhaul of the federal flood insurance program. The data from research group First Street Foundation estimates that average insurance rates need to quadruple in places to keep the program solvent. ""For some 265,000 properties, annual premiums would need to climb $10,000 or more to match the actual risk,"" the team writes. This story is complete with helpful maps and tools, so if you live anywhere near water, take a look at how you might be impacted.


Lights out. After a cold snap brought much of Texas' grid to its knees, it's supposed to be 72 degrees in Dallas tomorrow. Welcome to the modern, wildly variable climate. The thaw is also bringing time to reflect on what exactly went wrong after rolling blackouts caused by a variety of factors -- not least of which was natural gas infrastructure that wasn't weatherized -- left people without power for days. ProPublica and The Texas Tribune are out with a deep dive on the event, chronicling how ""lawmakers and regulators, including the (Texas Public Utility Commission) and the industry-friendly Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry, have repeatedly ignored, dismissed or watered down efforts to address weaknesses in the state's sprawling electric grid."" Meanwhile, the Austin American-Statesman, which previously reported that members of the board overseeing the majority of Texas' grid did not live in the state, writes that five members are resigning.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
California courtroom. I grew up watching legal dramas with my mom, so, now that I cover the Golden State, I've realized a courtroom TV show about California environmental litigation is long overdue. For The Desert Sun, I've got the details about two important cases currently underway in the state. First, a judge refused to strip temporary protections from Joshua trees in a case that has implications on whether climate change is a justifiable reason to protect species. Then, an environmental group is targeting state oil regulators, filing a suit to compel them to more closely follow environmental laws when handing out drilling permits.
Don't cross the Delaware. Speaking of hydrocarbons, there's some big news out East, where the Pocono Record reports that fracking has been banned on 13,539 square miles of land surrounding the Delaware River. This comes from a vote by representatives of the governors of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey and New York.
Legislating lumens. Back in the West, Sam Metz of AP reports that Nevada's Senate unanimously upvoted a bill to recognize ""dark sky places."" The legislation will ""create a state program aligned with the International Dark Sky Association"" to protect areas around the state that have some of the best stargazing in the world.
Battery battles. And finally on the U.S. politics front this week, High Country News published a feature that looks at the debate over America's nascent lithium mining industry. On one hand, lithium plays a key role in the batteries that will store the energy fueling the clean energy transition. On the other hand, tribes, environmentalists and ranchers argue that rushed mining proposals are threatening land in states like Nevada. Take a look at how this conflict is playing out near the Fort McDermitt Paiute Shoshone Reservation.
GOING GLOBAL
Disaster on the horizon. This week, I want to briefly take you around the world, where some important environmental stories are quickly unfolding. Let's start in Yemen, where the ongoing war could have a surprising victim -- the country's coastal and marine


ecosystems. For Newlines Magazine, Lylla Younes reports that an oil tanker has been sitting moored 4 miles offshore for five years after it was abandoned. The ship holds more than 1 million barrels of crude, and neglect and saltwater are eating away at it. If the tanker isn't pulled to shore and emptied soon, then it could cause a spill four times as massive as the infamous Exxon Valdez. Extreme extraction. Humans aren't so great at the three R's -- reduce, reuse, recycle -- leading us to ever more extreme ways of digging up new resources. The latest international battle is centered on seabed mining, which is the fledgling practice of stripping the bottom of the ocean for minerals and dumping the refuse back into the water. If practiced on a large scale, it's expected to be hugely destructive. Under increasing pressure, though, a territory in Australia has outright banned the mining technique, The Guardian reports. Breaking the ice. In a dizzying sign of the times, Bloomberg writes that a tanker made the first-ever February trip through Arctic sea ice after another hot year. Russia's deputy prime minister's response was that he's ""confident that the Northern Sea Route is competitive."" Without a shred of irony, the expedition was a return trip after dropping off a load of liquified natural gas in China.
AND ANOTHER THING
Much ado about nothing. And to kick this week's edition, let's keep things international, where Politico digs into the latest intergovernmental attempt to address a changing climate. ""When it comes to climate change, bombs don't work, so the United Nations Security Council prefers words to action,"" reporter Karl Mathiesen writes. But Russia, which as a permanent member of the council has veto power, warned against any move to recognize warming as a threat to global security. Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2021-43.txt,"Facebook says it cracked down on climate change lies. Then came false power outage claim during Texas winter storm

Jessica Guynn | USA TODAY
Show Caption
Misleading claims shared by prominent conservatives that wind turbines caused massive winter storm power outages in Texas whipped through Facebook without factchecking labels, racking up millions of views, according to a new report shared exclusively with USA TODAY.
Human rights group Avaaz says the 10 top-performing posts about wind turbine failures from public figures such as Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee received more than 15.8 million views on Facebook.
As of Tuesday, none of the posts had a fact-checking label, including those reviewed by Facebook's fact-checking partners.
USA TODAY's fact check found the claim that frozen wind turbines were to blame for blackouts in Texas was missing context. Some wind turbines froze because they were not built to withstand the unusually cold temperatures, but the most substantial energy losses were from the shutdowns of thermal power plants.
According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state's power grid, natural gas, coal and nuclear energy plants were responsible for almost twice as many power outages as frozen wind turbines and solar panels.

""When a page, group, or post violates our policies we either remove it or label it depending on the violation and we've followed the same approach with the examples identified in the Avaaz report,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""We remain the only


company to partner with more than 80 fact-checking organizations and use AI to scale those fact-checks against millions of duplicate posts across our platform. There is no playbook for a program like ours and we work to improve it all the time.""
The false claims began with the image of a helicopter de-icing wind turbines that was passed off as a photo from the deadly Texas storm that left millions without food, water or heat, but was, in fact, taken in Sweden in 2014, according to research this week from the German Marshall Fund.
Gaining steam, the claims spread quickly on YouTube, where they had 1.8 million views, and generated 1 million likes, comments, and shares on Facebook, the think tank found. On Twitter, a tweet with the embedded image was retweeted 30,000 times.
The Avaaz report found that Facebook in most cases slapped a fact-checking label on the helicopter image.
""Facebook let irresponsible myths reach millions without intervention going against its very own policies,"" Fadi Quran, campaign director at Avaaz, said. ""The company should know by now that during any crisis, disinformation spreads like wildfire ¬≠ and its negligence and algorithms are the fuel.""
The flood of misleading narratives about the Texas power outages is part of a growing trend of disinformation campaigns popping up when extreme weather patterns sweep the country.
Social media companies are under growing pressure from environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers to stop the spread of climate-change hoaxes and conspiracy theories. They warn that the Biden administration efforts to increase investment in renewable energy while cutting oil, gas and coal emissions could be undermined by falsehoods on social media.
""Disinformation content targeting these efforts is only likely to increase in the coming months and years, particularly given a concerted effort to shift public opinion against these efforts,"" the Avaaz report said.
In September, Facebook said it would counter climate-change misinformation with a Climate Science Information Center that supplies users with science-based facts.
""We are very aggressively removing content that could lead folks into harm's way, and we are surfacing more content that can get them the help and support that they need,"" Facebook chief product officer Chris Cox told USA TODAY at the time. ""During any weather-related or disaster-like event, we have teams pay a lot closer attention to what's going on in those areas to understand what's happening to the information ecosystem. And that's just part of the work we do to make sure the platform is providing the right information in times of crisis.""
Facebook's announcement came just days after emergency responders in the Pacific Northwest had to fight misinformation on Facebook along with catastrophic wildfires.


Trump takes on wind turbines, but is it all bluster? Trump tells the National Republican Congressional Committee wind power causes everything from cancer to depressed property values. Matthew Sobocinski, USA TODAY Climate scientists said the ""half measures"" did too little to rein in false, misleading or disputed information such as the discredited theory that the government is using ""chemtrails"" to manipulate the weather. ""The consequences are that the public is far less informed about climate change than they need to be,"" Michael E. Mann, director of Penn State University's Earth System Science Center, told USA TODAY at the time. ""It is very convenient for polluting interests who don't want to see climate policies move forward."" Last week, Facebook said it has added a new feature to its climate-change information center that offers facts that debunk common climate myths. The Avaaz report says Facebook must do more to correct the record. ""When independent fact checkers determine that a piece of content is false or misleading, Facebook should show a retroactive correction to each and every user who viewed, interacted with, or shared it. This can cut belief in false and misleading information by nearly half,"" the group said. Facebook should also reduce the reach of pages or groups that repeatedly share climate change misinformation, Avaaz said.

USA-2021-45.txt,"Texas winter storms: Repeated climate disasters do not have to be our destiny

How is it that Americans keep finding ourselves in the grip of a never ending series of extreme weather emergencies caused in part by climate crisis?
Monica Medina | Opinion contributor
I was deeply saddened to see our family, friends and fellow citizens suffering in Texas and its neighboring states. They shivered for days, burned furniture and slept in their cars to stay warm, and desperately scrounged for food and drinking water. Yet another moment when we had to ask ourselves, ""Is this America?""
There was plenty of blame to go around -- Texas' independent energy grid, the lack of surplus natural gas on hand, the failure to weather-proof the entire system (renewable and carbon based) for the blast of frigid air from the Arctic known as a polar vortex. The cascading emergencies caused by the hard freeze in the deep south were each predictable, but only if one knew the extent of the cold air and bad weather that was about to ""mess"" with Texas.
Some decried this as a ""black swan"" event -- historic, rare -- once in a lifetime, and random. But the truth is, it was not.
We knew it was coming
As far back as Jan. 5, climate forecasters started sounding the alarm about the coming cold wave. The Washington Post reported that ""a dramatic spike in temperatures is occurring at high altitudes above the North Pole,"" and that the ""unusually strong event may have profound influences on the weather in the United States and Europe, possibly increasing the potential for paralyzing snowstorms and punishing blasts of Arctic air.""
Seasonal weather forecasters noted that this kind of sudden Arctic warming event happens about six times in a decade and that this one was unusually intense. But they predicted that no one would care until the snow hit their backyards. So true.
The full list: Green New Deal's 55 promises that have little to do with climate change
Another round of warnings were sounded in late January and early February, when news outlets from Minnesota to New Jersey told their audiences to get ready because the polar vortex is coming. These polar vortex events have happened more often in recent years, it seems. People across the northern and eastern parts of the country still remember the polar vortex event in the winter of 2013-14, which caused $4 billion in losses, in the


winter of 2017-18, when the temperature dropped into the single digits and stayed that way for more than two weeks. Then-President Donald Trump famously tweeted about wanting some ""good old fashioned global warming"" during another polar vortex event that gripped the midsection of the country in January of 2019.
Texas had experienced one before too -- back in the winter of 2010-11.
When will we have had enough?
How is it that Americans keep finding ourselves in the grip of a never ending series of extreme weather emergencies caused in part by climate crisis? We had the repeated and devastating fires of last fall and the fall of 2018. There were a record number of hurricanes last summer. At the same time, Phoenix's high temperatures last year also broke records -- more than 140 days of 100 degrees or higher. And there has even been a wind storm on the plains that literally blew the corn out of the ground for hundreds of miles, and ferocious floods in the Midwest have swept livestock away.
Texas winter storms: I went 55 hours without power in freezing Austin. At least I'm alive.
Climate change is clearly happening and it could happen to you -- and there is no vaccine for the climate crisis. We need to do a better job of dealing with it, to state the obvious.
Last year there were a record 22 extreme weather disasters exceeding $1 billion in losses. Our response is no surprise -- we assume that the best we can do is to have boxed meals, blankets, generators and first responders ready for when climate disasters, like bolts of lightning out of the blue, strike again. Government support and resources to respond to these crises once they hit are imperative.
Get out ahead of the problem
But there is also much more we can do to get ""left"" of the ""boom"" of each climate-related weather disaster. Crisis managers describe the cataclysmic events that stop our world in its tracks as a ""boom."" Response missions are right of boom -- they deal with events after they happen. But the bigger payoff comes from left of boom missions -- those that attempt to get ahead of the boom and prevent it from being an emergency in the first place.
What does this mean in practical terms? In the short run we need to do climate stress tests -- look at critical infrastructure -- dams, the electric grid and power systems, water systems, and supply chains -- to make sure they can withstand the worst climate events we can envision. Then we need to act on that information. Federal investigators did test and investigate the Texas grid, but the state did not heed the results. Why? Perhaps because they thought the extreme weather events were too random and rare. Without knowing how much they were at risk for the next polar vortex, why prepare?


So in addition, we need to improve the science involved in predicting these extreme events well ahead of time so that we have a much better understanding of where the risks are the highest in the first place. It turns out that some government scientists believe they could, if we put their minds to it, begin to better predict the type, magnitude, frequency and location of extreme weather events weeks to even months ahead. We could forecast them, just like we forecast daily weather. And with forecasts we can be much smarter about preparing for disasters instead of just waiting for them to happen. The irony of this week is that while Houston had a problem -- a really bad one -- NASA landed a spacecraft on Mars to explore that planet. A chief NASA engineer said on Thursday, that ""When we put our arms together and our hands together and our brains together, we can succeed."" Right on. But let's put all that brainpower to work better understanding our own planet so that we can seriously improve our lives on Earth.

USA-2021-46.txt,"'Climate change is real': Biden administration says Texas power crisis shows U.S. unprepared for extreme weather

Joey Garrison | USA TODAY
WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden's administration said Thursday the ""full support of the federal government"" remains extended to Texas, still paralyzed by a winter storm that left millions without power in dangerous conditions.
The White House also blamed climate change for the Arctic-like temperatures and heavy snow in Texas and other parts of the U.S., arguing it shows why infrastructure in the U.S. is in need of sweeping upgrades.
Liz Sherwood-Randall, Homeland Security advisor in the White House, said more than 1 million people in the U.S. still lack power but that numbers are ""declining significantly."" That includes around 600,000 Texans experiencing power outages, down from nearly 4.5 million earlier in the week.
""It's important to set expectations, however, that due to the nature of this storm citizens will continue to experience rolling power outages in some communities,"" she said in a White House phone briefing with reporters.
Biden has approved federal emergency declarations for Texas, Oklahoma and is processing a request from Louisiana.
More: 'Massive failure': Why are millions of people in Texas still without power?
Infrastructure inadequate for climate change, White House says
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has provided 60 generators and fuel to support water treatment plants, hospitals, and nursing homes in Texas as well as 729,000 liters of water, 10,000 wool blankets, 50,000 cotton blankets, 225,000 meals, and other supplies as requested by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.
Beyond the immediate needs, Sherwood-Randall said the ""extreme weather"" events demonstrate the urgency to address the country's infrastructure, which she characterized as ill-equipped to handle the effects of climate change long-term.


""Climate change is real and it's happening now, and we're not adequately prepared for it,"" Sherwood-Randall said. ""And in particular, power grids across our country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are placed on them under these circumstances. And the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme conditions.""
Why some scientists blame climate change for the extreme cold
She said the Biden administration will be ""leading an effort to strengthen and harden our critical infrastructure"" to prepare for the ""full spectrum of challenges that we're likely to face in the future.""
""We know that we can't just react to extreme weather events,"" Sherwood-Randall said, ""we actually need to plan for them and prepare for them.""
Biden has said he wants to include significant infrastructure spending in an upcoming ""Build Back Better"" jobs proposal but hasn't laid out a timeline for its introduction.
More: Record cold, intense storms and tornadoes amid global warming: Could there be a connection?
Some scientists, but not all, say there could be a connection between global warming and the wandering polar vortex that explains the unseasonably low temperatures in the South this week.
The polar vortex is a gigantic circular upper-air weather pattern in the Arctic that tends to keep the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole. But at times, some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing extremely cold weather down into the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
The theory: weird warmth invades the Arctic, some of the cold that's supposed to stay up there ¬≠ including the vortex ¬≠ sloshes southward.
""There is evidence that climate change can weaken the polar vortex, which allows more chances for frigid Arctic air to ooze into the Lower 48,"" University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd told USA TODAY.
No plans yet for Biden to visit Texas
Sherwood-Randall said the White House spoke to leaders of FEMA, the Department of Energy and energy companies on Thursday morning ""to explore whether there is anything more we can do to provide support for our citizens.""
However, she said it is not ""physically feasible at this time"" for the federal government to connect the national electric grid to the grid controlled by Texas, which operates its own separately.
The country is divided into three grids: one covers the eastern U.S., another the western states and there is the Texas grid, which covers nearly the entire state.


More: Another winter storm slams Northeast, Mid-Atlantic; 1M without power, including over 400,000 in Texas Psaki said there are currently no plans for Biden to visit Texas or other states affected by the winter storm. Biden spoke to Abbott Thursday night. She said Biden is receiving regular updates on the situation in Texas but pointed to the expansive ""footprint"" and resources required of a presidential trip. ""He is focused on has directed his team to make rapid decisions and to be responsive to the specific needs of the states as they come up during this difficult time,"" Psaki said. Psaki said the weather has slowed down the government's efforts to ship COVID-19 vaccines to some states and that the administration has worked to reschedule deliveries. ""Our goal is to ensure vaccine distribution across all jurisdictions is as stable and equitable as possible,"" she said.

USA-2021-47.txt,"US rejoins Paris climate accord 107 days after leaving it: 'We've lost too much time'

Seth Borenstein | Associated Press
The United States is back in the Paris climate accord, just 107 days after it left.
While Friday's return is heavily symbolic, world leaders say they expect America to prove its seriousness after four years of being pretty much absent. They are especially anticipating an announcement from the U.S. in coming months on its goal for cutting emissions of heat-trapping gases by 2030.
The U.S. return to the Paris agreement became official Friday, almost a month after President Joe Biden told the United Nations that America wants back in. ""A cry for survival comes from the planet itself,"" Biden said in his inaugural address. ""A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now.""
Biden signed an executive order on his first day in office reversing the pullout ordered by his predecessor, President Donald Trump. The Trump administration had announced its withdrawal from the Paris accord in 2019 but it didn't become effective until Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the election, because of provisions in the agreement.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Thursday that the official American re-entry ""is itself very important,"" as is Biden's announcement that the U.S. will return to providing climate aid to poorer nations, as promised in 2009.
Feb. 17: Record cold, intense storms and tornadoes amid global warming: Could there be a connection?
Why is it called the Paris Agreement?: The name has nothing to do with 'people of Paris' as GOP politicians suggest
""It's the political message that's being sent,"" said Christiana Figueres, the former United Nations climate chief. She was one of the leading forces in hammering out the 2015 mostly voluntary agreement where nations set their own goals to reduce greenhouse gases.
One fear was that other nations would follow America in abandoning the climate fight, but none did, Figueres said. She said the real issue was four years of climate inaction by the Trump administration. American cities, states and businesses still worked to reduce heat-trapping carbon dioxide, but without the federal government.


""From a political symbolism perspective, whether it's 100 days or four years, it's basically the same thing,"" Figueres said. ""It's not about how many days. It's the political symbolism that the largest economy refuses to see the opportunity of addressing climate change."" ""We've lost too much time,"" Figueres said. United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen said America has to prove its leadership to the rest of the world, but she said she has no doubt it will when it submits its required emissions cutting targets. The Biden administration promises to announce them before an Earth Day summit in April. ""We hope they will translate into a very meaningful reduction of emissions and they will be an example for other countries to follow,"" Guterres said. Already more than 120 nations, including No. 1 emitter China, have promised to have net zero carbon emissions around midcentury. Dig Deeper You may also be interested in University of Maryland environment professor Nate Hultman, who worked on the Obama administration's official Paris goal, said he expects a 2030 target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions between 40% and 50% from the 2005 baseline levels. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate energy panel, has criticized Biden for rejoining Paris, tweeting: ""Returning to the Paris climate agreement will raise Americans' energy costs and won't solve climate change. The Biden administration will set unworkable targets for the United States while China and Russia can continue with business as usual."" A longtime international goal, included in the Paris accord with an even more stringent target, is to keep warming below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit since that time. The U.S. rejoining the Paris accord and coming up with an ambitious target for emissions cuts would make limiting warming ""to well below 2 degrees -- not just to 2 degrees but below 2 degrees -- a lot more likely,"" said climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, energy and climate director for the Breakthrough Institute.

USA-2021-49.txt,"Climate Point: Republicans try to shift blame for Texas energy woes to renewables

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Is it possible for anything to be apolitical these days? It wouldn't seem like that's possible. First, my thoughts go out to everyone suffering in Texas where power has been out for days in some areas, while temperatures have plummeted. Second, this means we need to discuss energy policy.
Prominent Republicans -- from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw -- have latched onto their own state's deadly power outages to take aim at renewable energy, igniting a seething debate over energy policy. Instead of repeating their false statements, however, I'm going to use this space to share analyses about what really happening to the Lone Star State's grid.
Let's start with the Houston Chronicle, which reports that Texas was warned a full decade ago that a perfect storm had hit before and would hit again because electricity infrastructure wasn't weatherized. Now, climate change is only making extreme weather more extreme. Meanwhile, Madlin Mekelburg of the Austin American-Statesman found that at least a third of the board that controls Texas' grid doesn't even live in state. And, Bloomberg writes that, while some wind turbines went offline due to the cold, ""frozen instruments at natural gas, coal and even nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas,"" were much bigger problems. In fact, Abbott went as far as temporarily banning the sale of Texas natural gas outside the state. So much for a free market.
Finally, got questions on the science behind the polar vortex that brought this extreme freeze? USA Today has you covered with this helpful visualization.
Here's some other important reporting. ...
MUST-READ STORIES
Unprecedented. A highly contaminated, 1,400-acre site in Philadelphia might have a second life as real estate, but first it'll have to go through a decade of cleanup that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Reuters reports. The defunct oil refinery's costly transition provides ""a glimpse of what lies ahead if the United States hopes to wean itself off fossil fuels and clean up the toxic legacy of oil, gas and coal,"" they write. There are


about 135 such refineries scattered across the country, with at least six others announcing in recent months that they were scheduled to shut their doors for good. Whatever comes next can redefine the cities they once polluted.
Rolling back the rollback. The Biden administration has begun in earnest the process of doing away with the Trump administration's attempts to roll back environmental laws. The latest move comes in the California desert, where the U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that it will cancel an 11th-hour action by the previous administration to rewrite the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. The agreement spans more than 10 million acres and tries to balance solar, wind, mining, cultural resources and desert habitat. I've got the story for The Desert Sun.
Indiana's time bomb. Over in the Hoosier State, Sarah Bowman of the Indianapolis Star writes that ""ash from Indiana's coal-burning power plants is contaminating groundwater across the state, rendering it unsafe to drink."" But, while some states are forcing utilities to transfer the carcinogenic waste to lined pits, Indiana's got the most coal ash-filled pits of any state in the nation and is letting them sit there. Water near 14 power stations is already contaminated as a result.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
Waging water wars. The Sacramento Bee and the Guardian partnered on a recent piece digging into court documents that detailed the Trump administration's efforts on California water policy. They uncovered numerous exchanges between government regulators who said science was being sidelined as a 2019 water deal appeared to favor farmers over environmental concerns. Agricultural interests have said the state had been wasting water, but a California Democratic member of Congress called some of the findings ""blatantly illegal.""
Fracking fracas. The Desert Sun's very own Janet Wilson reports that California progressives are turning up the heat on fracking and other controversial drilling methods. Two state senators introduced a bill this week to ""halt all new fracking, steaming and other risky oil and gas production techniques next year, and end them completely by 2027."" The ambitious, proposed legislation also seeks to institute a nearly half-mile buffer zone between oil and gas development and residential areas.
This story's charged. HuffPost is out with the details on a piece of international controversy brewing in Georgia. The U.S. International Trade Commission has blocked ""one of the world's biggest electric vehicle battery manufacturers from selling its cells in the United States"" over a charge that it stole trade secrets. Ford and Volkswagen had already designed electric vehicles around the specific battery the company was to produce, throwing a significant wrench in the rollout of cleaner cars in the U.S. Biden has 60 days to either veto the decision or let it stand.
GRAB BAG


Either the environment news has come hard and fast this week or I've just been unable to focus my attention on one topic. Either way, there's too much interesting stuff to share, so let's take a wide-ranging look, rapid-fire style.
Wildfires. The AP reports that a U.S. Energy Department inspector general audit found wildfire risk was increasing around Los Alamos, a nuclear laboratory in New Mexico, but the operation isn't taking enough precautions.
Abandoned mines. KUTV, a CBS affiliate in Salt Lake City, reports that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded $220 million in contracts for long-awaited reclamation at abandoned uranium mines scattered across the Navajo Nation.
Ecosystems. CNN reports that scientists accidentally discovered ""strange life forms on a boulder beneath the ice shelves of the Antarctic,"" including sponges and some other species that might be yet-uncategorized.
Wave energy. KTVZ in Oregon reports that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which typically deals with offshore oil and gas production, awarded a lease to Oregon State University for the first wave energy research project. It will look at technology to harness waves as renewable energy.
EVs. USA Today reports that luxury car brand Jaguar will, in 2025, start shifting to selling only electric vehicles, with the majority of Land Rover sales also expected to be electric by 2030.
Biodiversity. Audubon, a wildlife-focused magazine, reports that the Mojave Desert has gotten about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit hotter and lost 20% of its rainfall in some areas over the past 100 years, meaning that bird species there are pushed to the brink due to climate change.
AND ANOTHER THING
Red rover. And finally, I promised you more space news, so here we are. Emre Kelly at Florida Today has the latest on the Perseverance Mars rover landing, which is taking place today. After traveling nearly 300 million miles, three spacecraft from three different countries are all arriving at the red planet this month. Perseverance now needs to slow itself down from 12,100 mph to 1.7 mph during its ""fiery, seven-minute atmospheric entry and touchdown."" My fingers are crossed for this $2.4 billion mission, although I'm far from the only one. Krispy Kreme tweeted at the rover, asking for suggestions of good locations for a doughnut shop. I don't yet know what to make of that...
Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

USA-2021-50.txt,"Record cold, intense storms and tornadoes amid global warming: Could there be a connection?

Doyle Rice | USA TODAY
The polar vortex is a normal, natural pattern that is stronger in the winter and tends to keep the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole. The six years from 2015 to 2020 were Earth's warmest six years in recorded history. ""It's been unusual for a few weeks now ¬≠ very, very crazy ... Totally topsy-turvy.""
The U.S. has endured a wild stretch of harsh winter weather lately thanks to an invasion of the infamous polar vortex. It may be counterintuitive, but could global warming have caused this?
First, an explainer: The polar vortex is a gigantic circular upper-air weather pattern in the Arctic that envelops the North Pole. It's a normal, natural pattern that is stronger in the winter and tends to keep the coldest weather bottled up near the North Pole. The jet stream usually pens the polar vortex in and keeps it there, but at times, some of the vortex can break off or move south, bringing extremely cold weather down into the U.S., Europe, and Asia.
Some scientists ¬≠ but not all ¬≠ say there could be a connection between global warming and the wandering polar vortex: The theory is that when weird warmth invades the Arctic, some of the cold that's supposed to stay up there ¬≠ including the vortex ¬≠ sloshes down south into North America and Europe.
More on the way: Another winter storm will bring snow and ice to 100 million people from the South to the East Coast
""There is evidence that climate change can weaken the polar vortex, which allows more chances for frigid Arctic air to ooze into the Lower 48,"" University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd said.
While the vortex is a natural phenomenon, and polar vortex breakdowns happen naturally, there is likely an element of climate change at work.
Woodwell Climate Research Center climate scientist Jennifer Francis, who has published a study on the phenomenon, said in 2019 that ""warm temperatures in the Arctic cause the jet stream to take these wild swings, and when it swings farther south, that causes cold air to reach farther south.""


Millions without power after storm slams Texas
Millions of people have been without power and heat for more than 12 hours in Texas after a winter storm stressed demand and damaged equipment.

'Major breakdown' in the vortex in recent weeks
The jet stream is the river of air up in the atmosphere that steers weather around. A study in 2015 in the journal Science reported that the rapid warming of the Arctic makes for a more wavy jet stream, with waves that move more slowly across the globe. When that happens, cold, Arctic air sometimes pours down over the U.S.
A study in 2018 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, co-written by Atmospheric Environmental Research meteorologist Judah Cohen, found that ""over recent decades, the stratospheric polar vortex has shifted toward more frequent weak states,"" allowing it to stray from its home above the North Pole.
Warming in the Arctic, with shrinking sea ice, is goosing the atmospheric wave in two places, giving it more energy when it strikes the polar vortex, making it more likely to disrupt the vortex, Cohen said.
Polar vortex's icy grip: Snow, ice, bitter cold: Winter to hit hard this week as polar vortex descends across the nation
Human-caused global warming happens when fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas are burned, releasing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere and oceans. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, the National Climate Assessment said.
What's happened to the vortex in the past few weeks has been remarkable: Francis said ""it's been a major breakdown. It really is the cause of all of these crazy weather events in the Northern Hemisphere.""
""It's been unusual for a few weeks now ¬≠ very, very crazy,"" Francis said. ""Totally topsyturvy.""
Are February tornadoes unusual?
And as for the deadly tornadoes in the South this week, scientists say there is no clear connection between that type of severe weather and human-caused climate change. While climate change does have a documented effect on many extreme weather events, it has no clear connection to severe thunderstorms nor the tornadoes they produce.


In fact, a 2016 report from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that of all weather phenomena, severe storms (and tornadoes) are the most difficult to attribute directly to climate change. On average, there are 29 tornadoes in February of each year across the nation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said. Deadly tornadoes: 'Truly, truly a disaster': 3 dead, at least 50 homes damaged as tornado rips through North Carolina And overall, global warming remains real, despite this week's chill: The six years from 2015 to 2020 were Earth's warmest six years in recorded history, according to NOAA. Global temperatures have also been above average for 433 consecutive months. Indeed, though temperatures in the central U.S. neared all-time record lows this week, the U.S. as a whole covers only about 2% of the Earth's surface.

USA-2021-51.txt,"USA TODAY exclusive: Bill Gates discusses confronting climate change, says Joe Biden's energy and emissions goals are within reach

Ledyard King | USA TODAY
WASHINGTON ¬≠ Bill Gates is an optimist when it comes to climate change.
The Microsoft co-founder and global health philanthropist said the past four years have been a wasted opportunity to combat the threat of a warming planet and U.S. leadership on the issue waned under Donald Trump.
But he said achieving President Joe Biden's ambitious goals of decarbonizing the energy sector by 2035 and attaining net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is within reach. That is, if clean energy storage and transmission challenges are met, next-generation nuclear power remains part of the portfolio, and the federal government ramps up investment in research and development of carbon-neutral building materials to make them far less expensive.
""My goal is to say we need a plan,"" Gates told USA TODAY during a recent interview. ""People who think a plan is easy are wrong. People who think a plan is impossible are wrong. It's super hard and very broad, but it's doable.""
Gates wrote a new book, ""How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need"" (Knopf) detailing his ideas for addressing a crisis that experts say is causing temperatures to increase, sea levels to rise and natural disasters to grow more frequent and intense. The book goes on sale Tuesday.
In a wide-ranging interview, the billionaire investor talked about how the ""easy stuff,"" such as electric cars and the first part of clean energy generation, has largely been achieved. He said the focus must be on finding ways to reduce the carbon footprint of the agricultural and industrial sectors, such as developing a ""green"" process of manufacturing cement and steel that's affordable.
5 books not to miss: 'The Rise and Fall of Stan Lee,' Bill Gates on avoiding climate disaster
The co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which spends billions on global health initiatives, spoke with USA TODAY about climate change. The following is a lightly edited transcript of what he had to say:


Question: Will your work on the climate rival your foundation's investment in global health in terms of scope, magnitude and resources?
Answer:No, the dollars on global health are substantially higher. I've spent a couple billion on climate things. I'll spend at least a couple billion more, but it won't be on the scale of our global health work.
Q: President Biden issued several executive orders on climate change last month to rejoin the Paris treaty, prioritize science-based policy across federal agencies and pause oil drilling on public lands to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Is this enough?
A:He's doing the right things, but we still do not have a plan. When you look at the R&D spending for things like steel or cement inside the U.S. government, it's tiny because the Energy Department never thought of themselves as the ""How do you make steel?"" ""How do you make cement?"" ""How do you avoid cow methane?"" Department. And we're dramatically short on R&D.
More: Biden prioritizes climate change as national security concern, pauses oil drilling on public lands
Q: Is it just about investing?
A: There's a lot of policies to help bootstrap things like green steel and green cement. The key thing that the U.S. needs to think about is that our responsibility to the world on climate is not just to reduce the U.S. emissions to zero. Because the U.S. has over half of the innovation capability of the globe, it's up to us to innovate so that what I call the green premium comes down.
Q: You never mention President Donald Trump in your book. How much did his climate denial and efforts to ignore the crisis set back the country's ability to meet the ambitious milestones you believe the planet needs to achieve?
A: When you're going around trying to raise money for vaccines for poor countries, everyone's like ""Where's the U.S.?"" And it's the same on climate. The last four years, there has been some progress but, without the U.S., completely inadequate. And I don't think our biggest problems are denialists. The two factions I worry the most about are people who say, ""Hey, that's there, but it's too expensive. It just hurts too much."" And then the people who think it's easy like we can solve this in 10 years. That's no more scientific than denying that climate change doesn't exist.
Q: So you don't think Trump set back the cause irreparably?
A:We're not worse than we were four years ago. He didn't shut down the national labs. He didn't reduce the R&D budget. There are things that it's going to be tricky to get back in shape. But it's still possible. Between now and 2050, that's 30 years. We didn't use four years of those 34 years as well as we should have, but it's still possible to solve this problem.


Q: In your book, you talk about the need for the federal government to play a key role in climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions and helping the clean energy sector grow. But haven't the past four years shown us how unreliable government can be as a partner and that the private sector is better off solving this problem directly?
'The most significant climate legislation ever': How federal spending bill tackles warming planet
A:Well, without government, we won't succeed. If you take a product like green steel, there is no green steel, because the green premium is so very very high. And you know you need all the power of the universities and the national labs to come together on doing a piece of work like that. You know one of the approaches involves clean hydrogen, but those projects are very expensive, and they're just not economic today, so I'm not sure if there's a way that private sector solves a problem like that.
Q: What promising new technologies do you think can best address climate change?
A: Sadly, no single technology is going to be enough. But I really am seeing some fantastic examples from breakthrough energy of things that seem kind of amazing. ... There's a company called Quidnet. They pressurize water and push it underground. And that's a way of storing energy that can be done almost anywhere in the country.
Q: You mentioned the importance of energy storage.
A:One of the dilemmas in climate is that these intermittent sources like wind and solar can be shut down for long periods of time. Like when there's a typhoon over Japan or a cold front over the Midwest of the United States, you get even up to a couple weeks where wind and solar wouldn't be generating hardly anything. And, you know, the batteries we have today, they're getting good enough for cars, but they have to be about 20 times better than that to work in this bad weather, seasonal intermittency where people still expect to get electricity.
Q: Many Americans still view nuclear power as unsafe or not environmental because of the waste it produces. Can we reach the net-zero targets we're talking about without nuclear power.
A:Well, there's basically three ways to deal with the reliability of the electric system. One is to have a miracle in energy storage. If we don't get the miracle, the only two sources of high scale, 24-hour electricity would be nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion is early enough along that it's very unlikely it can be a big part of the 2050 solution. And so, at least maintaining investments in nuclear fission, which generates about 20% of U.S. electricity. I think that's wise.
Q: Opponents to the dramatic changes in energy supply needed to achieve net-zero emission by 2050 argue it will ravage communities whose economies rely heavily on the fossil fuel industry.


A: It's a legitimate concern. ... Thirty years in terms of jobs policies, we should be able to help fund some transitions. We should be able to make sure people going into the workforce are trained for the new jobs that will be there. Q: In your book, you suggest one of the steps individuals can take to tackle the climate problem is to run for office. Why don't you? A:I think the impact of my current work is the best use of my talent where I'm picking companies and scientists and looking across the system here. I wouldn't be good running for office.

USA-2021-52.txt,"Climate chaos is the real job killer. Biden's clean energy plan will boost the economy.

The shift to clean energy won't kill jobs so much as change jobs. The alternative is a society wracked by climate degradation and dim economic prospects.

You could have bet your retirement fund on it. Status quo defenders are whipping out that old pet phrase -- ""job killing"" -- and its usual variants to malign President Joe Biden's plan to jump-start the country's overdue shift to a clean energy future.
The job-killing claim is as specious as it is predictable and shortsighted. If it's jobs we care about -- jobs now and jobs a decade and more down the line -- a clean-energy future is our best friend. And our worst enemy is runaway climate change.
The Biden administration has wisely emphasized job creation as an essential part of its Build Back Better recovery plan. The goal, Biden says, ""is building a modern, resilient climate infrastructure and clean energy future that will create millions of good-paying union jobs (with) prevailing wages and benefits.""
Jobs now and jobs in the immediate future -- as important as they are, Biden says, there's something greater at stake: the urgent need to confront the ""existential threat"" of climate change.
Climate crisis creates economic havoc
An exaggerated scare tactic? Not according to the vast, vast majority of scientists, whose voluminous research shows the continued buildup of carbon in the atmosphere fueling ever more destructive storms, rendering parts of the planet too hot for habitation, and throwing off ocean currents and sea levels, among other devastating effects.
If you want to know what that might look like when your kids are your age, think of the ferocious storms and wildfires of recent years. Think of the record-breaking heat waves we have had. And multiply.


The greater the environmental damage, the greater the economic wreckage, according to analyses by credible organizations, including the Brookings Institution and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction. The latter reports that unless emissions are reduced, weather disasters are expected to become more severe and frequent, causing trillions of dollars worth of economic damage.
Climate-related job loss is more than mere conjecture about some distant future. Along the Long Island Sound, for example, ocean warming has all but wiped out a once thriving lobster-fishing industry and the jobs it created. California's infamous Camp Fire, whose smoke caused business disruptions as far away as San Francisco, destroyed the town of Paradise and virtually all its economic (and employment) activity.
A blindness to anything past the immediate short term, and anything other than the way things have always been, characterizes critics' response to the administration's plan. A New York Post editorial calls the ""far left"" Biden plan a ""war on American jobs."" Biden's moratorium on new drilling leases will ""kill"" more than 58,000 jobs, warns the Western Energy Alliance.
Employment opportunities matter. But what critics fail to mention is that the transition to clean energy doesn't just take jobs. It makes them.
""It is expected that reduced employment in fossil fuels through the transition can be more than offset by a rise in employment in renewables and construction,"" according to a study by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. It projects that a green energy transition could create $26 trillion in benefits across the global economy by 2030.
Memo to politicians and pundits: Texas is not all about oil and gas anymore
In a determined switchover to clean, green and resilient, all those solar and wind installations are not going to construct themselves. All those sea walls and other infrastructure are not going to be shored up by elves. Robots alone are not going to manufacture all the electric cars that General Motors is committed to rolling out as part of its plan to go all electric by 2035.
The economic and employment benefits apply not only to the tree-hugging blue states but also to the Western states we most associate with oil. Consider Texas: This oilman's mecca has become a clean energy superpower, as Greentech Media puts it. Texas is now second only to California in its number of clean energy jobs.
Dismal jobs picture if we do nothing
""Anybody who thinks transitioning the economy to clean energy will kill -- not create -- jobs is simply out of touch with reality,"" says Bob Keefe, executive director of the nonpartisan advocacy group Environmental Entrepreneurs. ""We're creating way more jobs through clean energy than fossil fuels. This is the energy industry today.""


The truth is that the clean energy economic transformation won't kill jobs so much as change jobs. How the quantity and quality of the new jobs stack up against the old depends, of course. It depends on the particulars of the policies and practices that emerge from federal, state and local governments and the on-the-ground behavior of innumerable companies, civic institutions and citizens. Warming trend: Joe Biden can work with conservatives on climate change. Many of them are ready to act What we do know is that a society racked by climate degradation is a society with dim economic prospects and a dismal jobs picture. You want to know what really ""kills jobs""? A world thrown into chaos and calamity by the kind of climate disruption of which we have started to get more of a glimpse in recent years: more destructive storms and fires, populations forced to vacate regions that are no longer habitable, rising seas turning touristy beach towns into ghost towns. No stable climate means no stable society, which means no stable economy, which means no stable jobs market. So yes to jobs and the new energy economy that will create and sustain them -- jobs next year, jobs next decade, jobs for the next generation. To paraphrase ""When Harry Met Sally,"" once you realize your energy and economic future, you want that future to start as soon as possible.

USA-2021-53.txt,"Climate Point: COVID-fighting-crabs, energy scams and a race to the red planet

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
In this desert paradise where I live, spring is already in the air. Warming temperatures are melting away the winter cold (or, as cold as it ever gets in Palm Springs), and early blooming plants are bringing a renewed splash of color. That might be pleasant for you. For me -- and for millions of other people -- spring brings on the annual respiratory dance with the devil known as allergies. So, of course, climate change is about to make our allergies a whole lot worse. Doyle Rice from USA Today reports on a new study out of the University of Utah, which found that ""pollen seasons start 20 days earlier, are 10 days longer and feature 21% more pollen than they did in 1990."" That certainly seems like a good enough reason to act on climate change.
Speaking of climate change and respiratory issues, I've got the details on a new study that came from Harvard University and a few colleges in the United Kingdom. In it, researchers found that pollution such as small particulate matter coming from the use of fossil fuels -- namely coal, but also oil and gas products -- has been causing more than 8 million premature deaths per year. In a twist of irony that shows just how tied we still are to fossil fuels, California approved new fracking permits -- to a company with lobbying services from the governor's friend, no less -- the same day the report dropped.
But with industries fighting tooth and nail against the most direct and obvious way to tackle climate change -- phasing out fossil fuels -- are there other baby steps we can take? President Joe Biden is asking the Senate to approve the Kigali Amendment, which would phase down the use of certain ""super greenhouse gases"" often used in refrigeration and air conditioning. Even the air conditioning industry is in support, and two industry leaders wrote an opinion stating as much in The New York Times the other day.
Here's some other important reporting. ...
MUST-READ STORIES
The Lion, the Polygamist, and the Biofuel Scam. That's the title of this cover story from Wired, and I figured I couldn't give it a more interesting introduction than that. This piece by Vince Beiser lives up to the moniker of a ""must-read,"" as it follows an Armenian and a splinter sect Mormon as they bilk the government out of hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies for biofuels they never produced.


Jersey shore. I learned something new this week. The Star-Ledger reports that horseshoe crabs are an integral part of the pharmaceutical industry because their blood is used to test the purity of medications, including those fighting COVID-19. Fascinating. Now, with a bird called the red knot threatened because it largely feeds on horseshoe crabs' eggs, a battle is underway to determine the correct balance between using and protecting this species.
The red planet. If you're a Climate Point fan, you know I'm all about a good space story. So, here we go. The AP reports that three spacecraft -- from the U.S., China and the United Arab Emirates -- are all scheduled to reach Mars within days of one another this month. The spacecraft -- in English called Quest for Heavenly Truth, Hope and Perseverance -- are arriving in such quick succession due to a short window of opportunity to launch back in July. Hopefully, I'll have additional exciting updates about landings soon.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
Hedge your bet. In Utah, The Salt Lake Tribune is out with an important story looking at the potential for money-movers, not policymakers, to take on the question of the drought-riddled Colorado River. ""Hedge funds and other Wall Street interests want to rewrite the 'Law of the River' in the Colorado River Basin and use the free market to solve the problem of scarcity -- while potentially raking in immense profits,"" they write. How skeptical should we be? Take a look as they parse through fact and fiction on the river.
Filling the swamp. The Indianapolis Star reports that a proposed piece of legislation has what appears to be massive conflicts of interest. The bill would eliminate protections for wetlands around the state, while saving developers a boatload of cash. ""All three authors of the legislation run companies that are members of the Indiana Builders Association, the group leading the lobbying effort for the bill on behalf of homebuilders and developers,"" they write.
Alternate reality. Wyoming and its energy-dependent economy are having quite the past few weeks, especially as state politicians continue ignoring the need to push for diversification while the coal industry that sustains them quickly slips away. Camille Erickson reports for the Casper Star-Tribune on the announced closure or winding down of more coal mines in the state's Powder River Basin, including the Coal Creek and Black Thunder, two of the country's biggest. Still, she reports, the state senate is moving on a bill that takes aim at net metering. The proposed legislation's supporters say it could wipe out unfair subsidies to renewables, while its opponents argue it would decimate rooftop solar. As I explained in last week's Climate Point, fossil fuels, not renewables, are benefiting from massive subsidies.
OUR MODERN INFRASTRUCTURE
Nuclear option. Would you want nuclear waste in your backyard? For almost everyone, the answer is a quick ""no,"" and therein lies the problem. Attempts to find a place to warehouse this radioactive detritus have gone in circles for years without finding one safe


and centralized location. Now, Searchlight New Mexico and the Institute of American Indian Arts' journalism program are out with a new deep dive into the latest attempt to put a nuclear waste storage facility in southeastern New Mexico.
Pipe dream. A few states west, The San Diego Union-Tribune is out with a story on what it's calling ""arguably the most ambitious public works project in San Diego history."" It's a $5 billion, more than 130-mile-long, proposed pipeline, and it would tunnel under a mountain range to bring Colorado River water to the coastal city. There's also a catch -- San Diego already gets this water via canals and pipes managed by a Los Angeles-based water district, so this is a new delivery mechanism but brings no new water. Proponents say it would be cheaper. The opposition labels it many negative things, including environmentally destructive.
Buckeye blowout. Next up, the Allegheny Front, a public radio program, reports on the troubles associated with disused oil and gas wells. One such well near the amazingly named town of Crooked Tree, Ohio, recently blew what was suspected to be brine from below ground into the forest for several days, killing fish in a nearby waterway. Back in New Mexico, the Carlsbad Current Argus writes that a ""bill that would restrict the use of freshwater by oil and gas operations in most cases and assess penalties for spills"" is advancing through the Legislature.
AND ANOTHER THING
Climate refugees. It's a scary thought that people could become refugees due to a changing climate, although it's a reality that's becoming increasingly present as weather intensifies, temperatures rise and droughts lengthen. Climate Home News reports that President Biden ""has ordered his National Security Advisor to look into how to resettle migrants displaced by climate change."" Biden set a deadline in six months for a report on the country's options on that front.
Wait, wait, one more. You've been such a great audience that you deserve a nice one for the road. Eight-year-old Leo from Minneapolis is an NPR listener, although an unhappy one. They don't talk enough about dinosaurs, and he wants to become a paleontologist one day. ""Maybe you should call your show Newsy things Considered, since I don't get to hear about all the things,"" he said in a devastating turn of phrase. So, they linked him up with a museum researcher and curated a playlist on dinosaurs and other assorted cool things. More here.
Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

USA-2021-54.txt,"Wind energy had a 'banner year' in 2020. Here's what that means for Joe Biden's climate plan.

Elinor Aspegren | USA TODAY
Watch Video: Texas wind energy beats out the nation and parts of the world
The wind energy sector in the U.S. blew away records in 2020.
A study from the American Clean Power Association released this month reports that 2020 was a record year for the industry, with developers adding enough megawatts of capacity to provide power for millions of homes and inching the U.S. closer to the Biden administration's goal of carbon neutrality by 2035.
In all, 16,913 megawatts of new wind power capacity was installed in the U.S. last year ¬≠ an 85% increase over 2019. That's the equivalent of the power generated from 11 large coal plants, and enough to serve nearly 6 million homes, Jonathan Naughton, a professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Wind Energy Research Center at the University of Wyoming, told USA TODAY.
Texas hosted the most activity with 13% of energy output, followed by Wyoming (10%), Oklahoma (7%), Kansas (5%) and New Mexico (4%).
""2020 was a banner year for the wind industry,"" Heather Zichal, president/CEO of American Clean Power, formerly the American Wind Energy Association, said in a statement. ""Despite all the challenges COVID-19 placed on our businesses, we still shattered nearly every record for capacity and growth.""
Here's how states stack up, and how the industry's current capacity figures into the country's goal for carbon neutrality.
Texas: Wind power 'driving significant economic growth'
Wind power produced up to two thirds of Texas's energy output in 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration. In total, the Lone Star State generated about 29,407 MWs of wind power, installing 2,197 MWs in 2020 ¬≠ meaning that if Texas were a country, it would rank fifth in the world for wind power capacity, some estimates say.
""Texas is the number one energy consumer in the country. Our economy and continued growth are dependent on reliable power, and how we meet this massive demand has tremendous implications,"" Powering Texas writes on its website. ""Renewable energy is helping Texas meet this growing demand for energy, while also providing jobs, bolstering rural economies and supporting communities all across the state.""


Why is Texas such a windy state? It sits right in the wind belt, a swath of land blessed with an excellent wind resource. The wind resource continues straight up the middle of the country to Canada and includes Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and the Dakotas. There's also significant wind in portions of Minnesota, Iowa, Wyoming and Montana.
It also has less restrictive zoning, taxation systems that encourage building and robust transmission lines that together have allowed it to jump ahead of the rest.
Wyoming: An improving political climate for wind energy?
Wyoming is an interesting place for wind energy ¬≠ it's the No. 1 producer for coal in the country, said Naughton.
""Wind energy is always looked at as a threat to the coal industry,"" he said.
But in 2020, the state nearly doubled its wind capacity for power, adding nearly 900 MWs over the past year. That signals to Naughton that the political climate for wind power is improving in the Cowboy State.
Biden's climate crusade: How his plan to cut carbon emissions, create jobs could impact U.S.
""People are understanding that wind is likely to develop here and it produces some jobs and some tax money, and it does some good things,"" he said.
Part of that is due to a tax on wind power, which brings in about $4.2 million a year, reported the Casper Star-Tribune.
But Naughton and other energy experts cautioned that people shouldn't take the burst in Wyoming's wind development as a trend from year to year. The Industrial Siting Council, the regulatory board charged with reviewing big wind project applications in the state, hasn't received a new proposal for a wind project since 2019, the Star-Tribune reported.
How close is US to carbon neutrality?
Despite the wind energy industry's gains in 2020, the U.S. remains far from carbon neutrality by 2035, a main goal in the Biden administration's climate plan.
""We're in the single digits still. But we're in the high single digits,"" Naughton said. Compared to 2000, when the U.S. was stuck in the sub-single digits, he added, ""We've come an amazing way.""
Still, Naughton said the U.S. would need to accelerate its pace of installation to achieve President Joe Biden's goal, which he described as doable with a recommitment to offshore wind energy farms and to those areas impacted by the loss of old energy outputs.
""We have a policy push to do it. And we also have an economic push to do it. So the pieces are in place,"" he said. ""We've just got to make sure it actually happens.""

USA-2021-55.txt,"Michael Mann: Why Biden's actions are good news from front lines of the climate change war

By labeling climate change a 'maximum threat,' the president is signaling to the world that we're in the midst of, for lack of a better term, a war.
Michael E. Mann | Opinion contributor
President Joe Biden, in his first weeks in office, already has advanced a sweeping agenda to tackle the climate crisis by addressing the health, economic, inequity and foreign policy aspects of the problem.
An executive order he issued last week establishes climate as an essential consideration in U.S. foreign policy and national security, recognizing the importance of restoring our role as a leader in the international effort to avert catastrophic climate change.
By labeling climate change a ""maximum threat,"" the president is signaling to the world that we're in the midst of, for lack of a better term, a war.
Whether we like it or not, and surely not of our own choosing, we are indeed in a war -- with powerful fossil fuel industry groups and those doing their bidding who have, for decades, orchestrated the most elaborate, well-funded disinformation campaign in the history of human civilization, the campaign to deny the reality of human-caused climate change.
Now, Biden is gathering his council to assess the current and future dangers in this fight, including all 17 intelligence agencies; a general on the international front, John Kerry, who will also have a seat on the National Security Council and will direct our diplomatic efforts abroad; and another general on the domestic front, former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy, who will coordinate climate action in the homeland.
The troops are the vast array of experts, including scientists like myself, with whom the administration will continue to consult to assess what's happening on the front lines.
Climate denial is in retreat


The good news is that early battles of the climate war, targeting the basic scientific evidence, have been won. Given the devastating climate impacts we are now seeing play out in real time, it's no longer credible to vast swaths of the population for fossil fuel interests and their promoters to deny that climate change is real.
Polluting interests haven't given up, however. They're now fighting what I call ""The New Climate War"" -- an assault on climate action using tactics that seek to delay, deflect, divide and sow doom, which lead us down the same path of inaction.
But there's more good news: The enemy's troops are starting to defect. A majority of younger Republicans favor action on climate. And a mounting number of moderate congressional Republicans would like to see their party engage meaningfully on the defining challenge of our time, advocating for climate solutions that are consistent with their ideological beliefs. An armistice appears in sight.
While no war analogy is ever perfect, the Marshall Plan isn't a bad one for characterizing what a postwar battlefield might look like. Also known as the European Recovery Program, it was a U.S. program providing aid to Western Europe following the devastation of World War II. It provided more than $15 billion in assistance to help finance recovery efforts.
Just as the United States provided economic assistance to help Western European countries heal, we must help individuals, companies and industries transition off fossil fuels toward a clean energy future.
Plan calls for restoring land, water
President Biden's newly announced climate plan seeks to do precisely that, providing government funds for a Civilian Climate Corps that will put Americans to work restoring public lands and waters that have been degraded by fossil fuel extraction and supporting agricultural, forestry and land management actions to increase the natural sequestration of carbon.
The plan also will establish an Interagency Working Group to assist coal, oil and natural gas and power plant communities, and to revitalize these communities by turning degraded lands such as brownfields into new hubs of economic activity.
As they say, you go to war with the army and the weapons you have. For the time being, this means that climate progressives who might have wished for a Gen. Bernie Sanders will have to get behind Gens. Kerry and McCarthy instead.
And while an expansive ""Green New Deal"" probably won't pass a  Senate, legislation supporting carbon pricing and market incentives for renewables very well could, bringing at least a handful of moderate Republicans across the aisle to join with Democrats.
We can hope for ever bolder climate legislation down the road. But we must bring carbon emissions down substantially within the next few years, and the perfect cannot be allowed to be the enemy of the good.


Bipartisan climate legislation that can accelerate the green energy transition will complement the bold actions being taken by the new administration, putting us on the path to averting catastrophic planetary warming.

USA-2021-56.txt,"Biden's climate change orders take a sledgehammer to Western state economies: Barrasso

We need unity, but handing out pink slips won't unite red states and blue states. And Biden's orders won't have measurable impact on climate change.
John Barrasso | Opinion contributor
On Inauguration Day, I attended President Joe Biden's swearing-in ceremony and listened to his speech. It was my 16th presidential inauguration. As a boy, my father took me to see President John F. Kennedy take the oath of office. I have attended every public inauguration since. I brought my daughter with me this year. It was the seventh time we shared the peaceful transfer of power.
The president's call for unity is greatly needed. America is truly at its best when we work together toward common goals. Whether facing wars, economic downturns or pandemics, our nation's greatest achievements have come when we put partisan politics aside.
Last Congress, Senate Democrats and Republicans proved we can work together on several issues -- including protecting our environment. As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I partnered with Delaware's Democratic Sen. Tom Carper to advance the first highway infrastructure bill ever to directly address climate.
Biden's unhelpful executive orders
We worked together to pass a historic, bipartisan environmental innovation law. It supports the development of groundbreaking technologies like carbon capture and carbon use, while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions from school buses, trucks, refrigerators and air conditioners. We succeeded in making sure these measures would not raise costs or cost Americans their jobs.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the law ""one of the biggest victories to fight global warming in a very long time.'' I agree. Free market innovation -- not costly regulation -- is the best way to address a changing climate.
We were successful in these efforts because we found common ground. Now, as the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I'm ready to work with President Biden to solve our energy challenges.


So far, the Biden administration's actions are nowhere near his unifying words on Inauguration Day. On Day One, the president signed executive orders to stop the Keystone XL pipeline and rejoin the Paris climate accord. The next week he halted new oil, gas and coal leases on federal lands.
These orders will take a sledgehammer to the economies of Western states without putting a dent in climate change.
A federal leasing ban would kill an estimated 62,000 jobs in New Mexico, nearly 120,000 in Texas and more than 33,000 in my home state of Wyoming next year alone, according to the American Petroleum Institute. It will also eliminate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue that these states depend on for public schools, roads, water projects and other essential services.
COVID and climate change: On COVID-19 and climate change, denialism is deadly
In response to the Keystone cancellation, TC Energy has announced 1,000 layoffs, and the potential union jobs lost could be 10 times higher.
Jennifer Granholm, Biden's nominee to be Energy secretary, even admitted at her confirmation hearing that some energy jobs ""might be sacrificed."" Handing out pink slips will not unite red states and blue states.
Rely on free market and ingenuity
These orders will have no measurable impact on climate change. Energy companies won't stop producing fossil fuels because they are banned from federal lands. They will simply take their investment and the jobs that go with it elsewhere -- likely overseas, where there are fewer environmental safeguards.
Oil from Canada will continue to be imported, but more will come in by rail. President Barack Obama's State Department said moving that oil by rail would result in up to 42% more carbon emissions.
Damaging America's economy won't stop climate change. Between 2015 and 2019, carbon dioxide emissions jumped in Russia, China and India.
At the same time, U.S. emissions continued to drop, as they have since 2007.
No new restrictions: On climate change, government-centric approach will hurt USA with unintended consequences
The future of global energy is American ingenuity, investment and innovation. Instead of making traditional energy more expensive, let's make alternative energy cheaper and more reliable. Carbon capture technologies and advanced nuclear reactors are in development right now. Let's bring them online at home and then promote their use worldwide.


America and the world will continue to use fuels like oil, natural gas and coal for the foreseeable future. Banning U.S. production of these fuels weakens our energy security and undermines our economic strength. It will saddle Americans with higher energy bills, an additional burden as the nation struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic. Republicans are not willing to sacrifice American jobs. We are willing to partner with President Biden to make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can -- without raising costs on the American people. Sen.

USA-2021-57.txt,"OnPolitics: Biden tackles climate change

Mabinty Quarshie | USA TODAY
It's hump day and there haven't been any major catastrophes today in politics. I'm calling that a win!
So what's going on? Continuing on his spree of unwinding former President Donald Trump's policies, President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed another raft of executive actions tied to combating climate change, prioritizing science and evidence-based policy across federal agencies, and pausing oil drilling on public lands.
Also: Biden is still grappling with how to unify a nation -- and Congress -- that has at times been bitterly divided.
It's Mabinty, with the political news you need to know.
Want this news roundup in your inbox every night? Sign up for OnPolitics newsletter here.
Climate change is now a national security concern
The executive actions Biden signed Wednesday afternoon:
Elevate climate change as a national security concern Commit to the goal of conserving at least 30% of all federal land and water by 2030, which stands at 12% today Build on his economic policy agenda to direct federal agencies to ""procure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy industries.""
Biden had pledged to be the most aggressive president on climate change, which he has called ""an existential threat."" His goal is to decarbonize the U.S. power sector by 2035 on the way to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
""We've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis,"" Biden said from the White House State Dining Room. ""We can't wait any longer. ... We know it in our bones. And it's time to act.""
Who's happy about it? Environmentalists. The League of Conservation Voters applauded the plan, describing it as a ""whole of government approach that puts bold climate action, clean energy, and environmental justice at the heart of their domestic and foreign policy agenda.


Who's not so hot about this? Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who is set to become the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, called Biden's orders ""divisive and illegal.""
OK, how realistic is all of this?
Biden's prospects of pushing through his ambitious priorities on COVID relief, racial justice and climate change certainly improved when Democrats won both Georgia Senate seats ¬≠ and full control of Congress ¬≠ earlier this month. But Biden's team acknowledged that congressional action will be required to achieve much of Biden's early agenda. Topping that list is the passage of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, dubbed the American Rescue Plan.
But the retention of the Senate filibuster ¬≠ a congressional tactic that essentially requires 60 Senate votes to get bills passed ¬≠ means the new president might have to rein in some of his most progressive ideas because the moderates in both parties he'll need to pass legislation won't go for them.
If you forgot what a filibuster is, let me remind you: The filibuster is a longstanding tool used by senators in the minority to block a vote on a bill by basically endlessly debating the measure. The only way to stop debate and force a vote is if 60 members agree to do so.
Democrats only have 50 votes ¬≠ not enough to stop debate and force a vote if Republicans decide to filibuster.
The good news for Biden is that most Americans say they want to see bipartisanship in Washington, according to a recent Monmouth University poll. Notably, a new poll shows 71% of Americans would prefer Republicans in Congress find ways to work with Biden, compared to the 25% of Americans who would rather they serve as a check on the president's agenda.

USA-2021-58.txt,"Climate Point: Biden takes aim at fossil fuels, while Alberta, Canada, takes aim at journalists

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
President Joe Biden has been in the White House for a little more than a week, and the hits keep on coming for the environment. Some of his earliest actions on his first day related to climate change (more on that later), and Wednesday was dubbed ""Climate Day."" Among other things, Biden used the day to commit to setting aside 30% of federal land and water for conservation by 2030, to pause new oil and gas leases on federal land and to begin eliminating fossil fuel subsidies. HuffPost has a helpful breakdown here.
""President Biden set ambitious goals that will ensure America and the world can meet the urgent demands of the climate crisis, while empowering American workers and businesses to lead a clean energy revolution that achieves a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and puts the United States on an irreversible path to a net-zero economy by 2050,"" according to a White House statement on his overarching plans.
Some of the plans, though, such as the pause on new oil and gas leases, do little to actually slow fossil fuel extraction. In that case, oil and gas companies had stockpiled permits in advance of the inauguration to circumvent such an order. USA Today has more on that. Still, environmentalists and climate scientists hope these actions are a sign of even more to come.
Here's some other important reporting...
MUST-READ STORIES
Chilling effect. As a journalist, I'm used to receiving reader input and complaints. What I'm still not used to even after four years of the last administration, is a full-throated attack on the free press by the government. Geoff Dembicki is out with an unsettling story for Vice in which he revealed the party controlling Alberta's provincial government in Canada paid thousands of dollars to slander environment journalists as part of a multimillion dollar investigation going after environmentalists. Among those targeted in the conservative party's report were a professional group to which I belong and a reputable publication for which I previously reported. In an additional odd twist, the report was written by a ""home-school teacher in England."" Needless to say, she failed to reach out to journalists for comment.


Rigging the reports. E&E's Benjamin Storrow is out with another compelling investigation, this time into utilities' proclivity to use tricky data and carbon accounting to make big claims about how much they're cutting in greenhouse gas emissions. ""The guidelines governing public emissions reporting are vague and voluntary, enabling companies to embellish their reductions, while making it difficult to compare one utility with another,"" he writes.
The temperature is too damn high. Over in the Southwest, Erin Stone of The Arizona Republic digs into disparities in resources between urban and rural communities as temperatures soar. In many outlying areas, she found rising heat was bringing deadly health implications with few options for refuges like cooling centers.
Endangered. If you want a feel-good story, please skip this one. Jimmy Tobias has a new project out with The Intercept in which he uses a fight over development in Florida as a case study for how a key conservation agency is succumbing to outside pressure. As he sees it, we're left with a ""politicized (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) that is struggling to uphold the Endangered Species Act amid a growing global extinction crisis.""
BIDEN GETS GOING
""Climate Day"" was only part of Biden's early steps on climate change and the environment. Here's a run-down of some of his other early big decisions:
Little known, big impact. You've probably never heard of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, so don't feel bad if you missed this story. It's housed within the Office of Management and Budget and gives proposed agency regulations a once-over to vet them. But, a Biden-approved memo titled ""Modernizing Regulatory Review"" looks to revamp how the office functions, shifting it from mainly producing an economic costbenefit analysis to studying a broader range of impacts. ""The memo could unleash a wave of stronger regulations to reduce income inequality, fight climate change and protect public health,"" HuffPost writes. ""Among left-leaning experts on regulation, it's a signal that Biden could break with 40 years of conservative policy.""
Climate cash. Meanwhile, over at the Federal Reserve (Aren't you glad you're getting a tour of our bureaucracy this week?), a new committee was announced to ""deepen the central bank's understanding of the risks that climate change poses to the financial system."" E&E reports on what this means for the banking sector.
Environmental justice gets a nod. Another executive order Biden signed directs the Department of Justice to ""consider establishing an environmental justice office,"" Bloomberg reports. If created, the office would partner with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and others to coordinate work on the topic, which relates to disproportionate impacts of environmental woes on disadvantaged communities.
Go day. And finally, let's not forget Day 1. Presidents often like to take their seat in the Oval Office in front of news cameras only hours after the inauguration, a stack of executive orders filled with campaign promises already there and awaiting their signature. Biden was no different. On the climate front, his Day 1 moves will have the U.S. rejoin the


Paris Agreement and cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, among other things. USA Today's Doyle Rice has the story. But conservatives aren't letting him move forward that easily. While Democratic California Attorney General Xavier Becerra acted as the main antagonist throwing darts at former President Donald Trump's attacks on environmental policy, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas has publicly announced that he's looking to fight Biden on the environment. The Austin American-Statesman has all the details.
AND ANOTHER THING
The transition has begun. Just think. You unplug your car, push the button to quietly turn it on, touch the right pedal (perhaps we'll call it an ""electrons pedal"") and off you go with the instant torque that comes with electric vehicles. While still in the future, this reality is looking closer every day. The Detroit Free Press reports that General Motors, one of the Big Three automakers, announced Thursday that it ""aspires"" by 2035 to only be producing cars, pickups and SUVs that are zero emission. Then, in another five years, it wants its ""global products and plants to be carbon neutral."" Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

USA-2021-59.txt,"Biden prioritizes climate change as national security concern, pauses oil drilling on public lands

WASHINGTON ¬≠ President Joe Biden signed another raft of executive actions Wednesday to combat climate change, prioritizing science and evidence-based policy across federal agencies and pausing oil drilling on public lands in the latest move to unwind the Trump administration's environmental policies.
Biden pledged to be the most aggressive president on climate change, which he called ""an existential threat."" His goal is to decarbonize the U.S. power sector by 2035 on the way to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
The USA emits the second-largest amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), producing about 5.41 billion metric tons in 2018. China emits nearly twice that amount.
""We've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis,"" Biden said from the White House State Dining Room. ""We can't wait any longer. ... We know it in our bones. And it's time to act.""
Just like a national response was needed to combat the coronavirus pandemic, a unified response is required to fight the climate crisis, Biden said.
""We know what to do,"" he said. ""We've just got to do it.""
The actions Biden signed Wednesday afternoon elevate climate change as a national security concern, commit to the goal of conserving at least 30% (an increase from 12%) of all federal land and water by 2030 and build on his economic policy agenda to direct federal agencies to ""procure carbon pollution-free electricity and clean, zero-emission vehicles to create good-paying, union jobs and stimulate clean energy industries.""
Part of that order will be ensuring the federal purchases are in line with Biden's ""Buy American"" initiative aimed at boosting the federal government's purchases of U.S.manufactured goods.
""The stakes on climate change just simply couldn't be any higher than they are right now,"" John Kerry, a former secretary of state and Biden's special climate envoy, said at a White House briefing before Biden signed the orders.
The president faced criticism from Republicans who said his climate policies are costprohibitive, will hurt American businesses and eliminate oil and gas jobs.


The move to impose a moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases follows Biden's decisions last week to suspend for 60 days new drilling permits on federal lands and waters and halt construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline.
The latest orders won't stop energy firms from acting on existing oil and gas leases in the western USA and the Gulf of Mexico, some of which were issued in the final weeks of the Trump administration and could be active for years to come.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican from oil-rich Alaska, called Biden's initial 60-day moratorium to limit oil drilling ""an unprecedented assault on resource development and energy jobs.""
""It is an assault on good energy jobs, good resource development jobs that have been the bedrock of millions of middle-class Americans for decades,"" he said on the Senate floor Friday.
President Biden signs executive orders aimed at undoing Trump's controversial policies
Climate change, LGBTQ rights and the border wall are just a few items President Joe Biden addressed in signing his first executive orders.
USA TODAY
Biden's orders made clear he wants to restore science-based decision-making that activists said was relegated to the sideline by former energy industry lobbyists who ran environmental agencies under a president who challenged the basis of climate change.
""Science is telling us that we don't have a moment to lose,"" said Gina McCarthy, Biden's national climate adviser.
Biden's action will create a National Climate Task Force, which will feature leaders from 21 federal agencies and departments and formally announce a climate summit of world leaders on Earth Day, April 22.
Biden has already issued an executive order rejoining the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change, and his administration is likely to undo a host of rules enacted under President Donald Trump covering emissions, such as methane, that contribute to global warming.
The League of Conservation Voters applauded Biden's plan, describing it as a ""whole of government approach that puts bold climate action, clean energy, and environmental justice at the heart of their domestic and foreign policy agenda.""
""Congress must complement these executive actions with bold legislation that puts our economy on a path to recovery by making transformative investments in healthy, equitable, safe communities powered by clean energy,"" the organization said in a statement.


Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who is set to become the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, called Biden's orders ""divisive and illegal."" ""Despite all the hot air from climate alarmists, banning new oil, gas and coal leases on federal land and waters will do nothing to address climate change,"" Barrasso said. ""Energy producers will simply go elsewhere ¬≠ likely out of state or overseas."" Barrasso said Biden's orders ""will deprive thousands of people in Wyoming of their jobs and a principal source of revenue for public education and other essential services.""

USA-2021-60.txt,"Politics live updates: Sanders mittens, merchandise raise $1.8M for charity; DC police details Capitol riot officer injuries

Here's what's happening in politics Jan. 27, 2021. Check back often for updates.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT., went viral during President Joe Biden's inauguration for his casual look, a buttoned-up Burton coat and knit gloves made by a Vermont second-grade teacher Jen Ellis.
The photo spurred memes across the internet, and has helped raise $1.8 million in the last five days for charitable organizations in Sanders' home state, he announced Wednesday.
The sum comes from the sale of merchandise with the image of him sitting with his arms and legs crossed.
The ""Chairman Sanders"" merchandise, which included T-shirts, sweatshirts and stickers, sold out in less than 30 minutes Thursday, Sanders said. More merchandise added over the weekend also sold out by Monday morning.
""Jane and I were amazed by all the creativity shown by so many people over the last week, and we're glad we can use my internet fame to help Vermonters in need,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""But even this amount of money is no substitute for action by Congress, and I will be doing everything I can in Washington to make sure working people in Vermont and across the country get the relief they need in the middle of the worst crisis we've faced since the Great Depression.""
More: New merchandise cashes in on Bernie meme for Vermont charities
All of the proceeds raised from selling the merchandise support various Vermont charities, including Feeding Chittenden, Chill Foundation and Vermont Community Action centers.

DC police chief details officer injuries from Capitol riot, discloses another officer died in aftermath


Acting Washington, D.C., Police Chief Robert Contee detailed the severity of the injuries police suffered responding to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and disclosed another officer died in the aftermath, according to a copy of his prepared remarks to a House panel Tuesday.
The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) said the officer, Jeffrey Smith, was a 12-year veteran of the police department. The agency declined further comment.
Contee told lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee 65 D.C. police officers sustained injuries that day, and many others sustained injuries like scratches, bruises, eyes burning from bear mace, that were not captured in official injury reports. Still others were suffering from the trauma of responding to the riot, he said.
""Law enforcement training neither anticipates nor prepares for hours of hand-to-hand combat,"" he told lawmakers by video conference.
Top law enforcement officials at the Capitol acknowledged failings in their agencies during the same briefing, apologizing to lawmakers for not taking enough precautions or acting on intelligence about the riot.
In response, the Capitol Police Union slammed their leadership's admission they were unprepared for the riot, saying it ""angered and shocked"" the rank-and-file officers.
Union Chairman Gus Papathanasiou said in a statement that the Capitol Police and MPD combined suffered 140 injuries that day
""I have officers who were not issued helmets prior to the attack who have sustained head injuries,"" he said. ""One officer has two cracked ribs and two smashed spinal discs and another was stabbed with a metal fence stake to name some of the injuries.""
One officer, Brian Sicknick, died during the riot, and another, Howard Liebengood, died in the days after.

Sec. Blinken: America's allies are ready for the US to be 'back at the table'
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday that, based on his initial conversations with foreign ministers around the world, America's allies seem eager to have the U.S. back in the diplomatic arena.
""What I've picked up from those conversations already is a very, very strong desire for the United States to be back in the room, back at the table, working with them on the many, many common challenges we face,"" Blinken told reporters in his first news conference as the 17st secretary of State. ""That was almost palpable in the conversations I've had today.""


Asked how he could assure allies that the Biden administration's policies would not be overturned in four years, Blinken said he planned to work closely with members of Congress to get buy-in from the get-go.
""It is hard to have a sustainable foreign policy absent the informed consent of the American people,"" he said. ""One of the things you're going to see from our administration is working as closely as we possibly can with Congress on these issues from the takeoff, not just on the landing.""
Blinken also used his first news conference to take a dig at Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""It remains striking to me how concerned and maybe even scared the Russian gov't seems to be of one man, Mr. Navalany,"" Blinken said, referring to Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Navalny was arrested on Jan. 17 upon returning to Russia from Germany, where doctors helped him recover from a poisoning attack. He says the attempted assassination was carried out by the Kremlin, which Putin's allies deny.
Blinken did not say what the Biden administration would do if Navalny is harmed again. But he said the US is very concerned about his safety and added that Navanly's voice should ""be heard, not muzzled.""

Democrats introduce bill to Senate to make DC 51st state
Democrats in the Senate introduced legislation to make the District of Columbia a state. This follows a long campaign, spanning years, to grant statehood to the capital.
However, though Democrats narrowly control the Senate on top of the House of Representatives and White House, the legislation has a slim chance of passing unless Democrats eliminate the legislative filibuster in the Senate.
Most Senate Republicans oppose statehood for D.C., as it would likely lead to a partisan shift in the Senate by adding two senators who would likely be Democrats.
More: The filibuster may make it difficult for Joe Biden to pass his agenda, even in a Democratic Congress
The legislation introduced in the Senate has 38 cosponsors, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who introduced the bill, said in a statement: ""This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue; it's an American issue because the lack of fair representation for D.C. residents is clearly inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded.""


In the previous Congress, the House passed a bill in June that would make D.C. the 51st state. That bill, aptly named ""H.R. 51,"" passed on a mostly party-line vote of 232-180. It died in the Senate.
Because it is a new Congress, legislation would have to pass the House again. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents D.C., already reintroduced the statehood bill at the opening of the 117th Congress.
Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., who introduced the legislation, said in a statement: ""This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue; it's an American issue because the lack of fair representation for D.C. residents is clearly inconsistent with the values on which this country was founded.""
The bill would provide the city's nearly 700,000 residents, a population larger than states such as Vermont and Wyoming, with representation of two senators and one House member. The new state's territory would include all of the district's current territory, except for monuments and federal buildings such as the White House and Capitol building.
President Joe Biden said during the presidential campaign that he supports D.C. statehood, as does Vice President Kamala Harris, who casts the tie-breaking vote in the 50-50 Senate.

Trump plans to meet Thursday with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy
Former President Donald Trump is expected to meet privately Thursday with a prominent congressional lawmaker: House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy.
McCarthy criticized Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol ¬≠ ""the president bears responsibility,"" he said a week after the insurrection ¬≠ but he also voted against impeachment. He also taken a softer tone toward Trump in more recent days.
""I don't believe he provoked it, if you listen to what he said at the rally"" right before the Jan. 6 attack, McCarthy told reporters on Thursday.
An aide to Trump, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss his schedule, said the former president does plan to meet with McCarthy on Thursday in South Florida.
The meeting takes place as Trump and attorneys prepare his defense at a Senate impeachment trial next month; opening arguments are scheduled for Feb. 9.
McCarthy's office did not comment on the conference with Trump.

Don't bother asking the White House about Rep. Greene
The White House doesn't intend to give any public attention to Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who made headlines for incendiary remarks and conspiracy theories as a candidate and has continued to be controversial since entering Congress this month.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked Wednesday about CNN's report that Greene's past social media posts indicated support for executing Democratic politicians.
Does the White House have an opinion on whether Greene should face discipline?
""We don't,"" Psaki said. ""And I'm not going to speak further about her in this briefing room.""
A former White House occupant, however, did weigh in.
""This woman should be on a watch list. Not in Congress,"" tweeted Hillary Clinton, who was one of the Democrats targeted in Greene's Facebook comments.
In a tweet, Greene dismissed CNN's report as ""yet another hit piece on me.""

DHS warns that violent extremist threat to persist for weeks
The Department of Homeland Security Wednesday warned of a continuing threat posed by domestic extremists, cautioning that a ""heightened threat environment"" across the country would likely persist through the spring.
The bulletin, issued by acting DHS Secretary David Pekoske, said there was no current evidence of a specific plot, yet authorities ""remain concerned that individuals frustrated with the exercise of governmental authority and the presidential transition ... could continue to mobilize a broad range of ideologically-motivated actors to incite or commit violence.""
Three weeks after the Capitol attack, Pekoske's national advisory stated that extremists harboring a volatile mix of grievances ""may be emboldened"" by the Jan. 6 attack to target elected officials and government property.
The bulletin recalled the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, in which the attacker told police that he had targeted Mexicans as emblematic of ""racial and ethnic tension, including opposition to immigration,"" that has driven violent attacks by domestic extremists.
""Threats of violence against critical infrastructure, including the electric, telecommunications and healthcare sectors, increased in 2020 with violent extremists citing misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 for their actions,"" the bulletin stated.

Leahy, set to preside over Trump trial, returns to Senate after hospital stay
Sen. Patrick Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is set to preside over former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, returned to the Senate Wednesday after a brief hospital visit.
Leahy presided as the Senate reconvened Wednesday morning. He was taken to the hospital Tuesday evening ""out of an abundance of caution"" after ""not feeling well,"" his spokesperson David Carle said.
He was discharged later Tuesday evening after getting test results back and receiving a ""thorough examination,"" Carle said.
Leahy, the most senior Democrat in the Senate who serves as the president pro tempore, is set to preside over Trump's trial when it begins the week of Feb. 8. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts typically presides over impeachment trials for any president, but the Constitution calls for the chief justice to preside only over trials of sitting presidents. Roberts presided over Trump's first impeachment trial over dealings with Ukraine.
Leahy told reporters at the Capitol he went to the hospital for muscle spasms, but he didn't specify where they were spasming. ""They didn't stop,"" Leahy said. His doctor said rather than take a chance with ""so much going on,"" they examined him and then sent him home with his wife, a registered nurse.
""They sent me home with a nurse,"" Leahy said.
He told reporters he was healthy enough to preside over the impeachment trial of the former president. He hasn't yet decided whether to seek reelection in 2022, a decision he expects to make by December.

White House COVID Response Team to host first news conference


The White House announced the first of what will be regular coronavirus response briefings starting Wednesday at 11 a.m.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, Andy Slavitt, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and Jeff Zients will participate. Missing will be recently retired Dr. Deborah Birx, former coordinator for the White House coronavirus task force, who became nationally known for her role in press conferences in the Trump administration.
During a recent interview on CBS ""Face the Nation"" Birx said she ""always considered"" resigning from the White House coronavirus task force, and that someone had been delivering a ""parallel set of data"" to Trump.
The coronavirus task force press briefings had been a daily occurrence at the beginning of the pandemic, but then became increasingly sparse as Trump dismissed them just a few weeks in.
Biden announced Tuesday the U.S. has reached an agreement to purchase an additional 200 million coronavirus vaccine doses, a boost that means the U.S. will have enough supply to fully vaccinate 300 million Americans by the end of summer or beginning of fall.

USA-2021-61.txt,"On COVID-19 and climate change, denialism is deadly

Our View: Like coronavirus, climate crisis won't magically disappear. Biden's expected moratorium on new oil and gas leasing would be a good start in a fact-based, science-based approach.
The Editorial Board | USA TODAY
You're reading Our View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate.
For the Opposing View, read ""America doesn't need a government-centric approach.""
What is R-0 and why is it so important in the fight against coronavirus?
R-0 may be the most important scientific term you've never heard of when it comes to stopping the coronavirus pandemic.
Just the FAQs, USA TODAY
If there were any lingering doubts about the undermining of science as the COVID-19 crisis erupted last year, Dr. Anthony Fauci has horror stories to prove otherwise. In a series of recent interviews, most notably with The New York Times, the nation's leading infectious disease expert revealed how his informed advice for grappling with a growing pandemic was all but dismissed by a White House flirting with denialism.
""We would say things like, 'This is an outbreak. Infectious diseases run their own course unless one does something to intervene,' "" Fauci recalled. ""(President Donald Trump) would get up and start talking about, 'It's going to go away, it's magical, it's going to disappear.' ""
A year and more than 424,000 dead Americans later, grim lessons have been learned about the costs of downplaying research-based measures such as mask wearing, social distancing and testing. (Science is also riding to the rescue in the form of safe and effective vaccines.)
Hottest years in hottest decade
The same kind of fact-based, science-based approach is also needed to tackle climate change, the other crisis threatening humanity.


Levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, produced in large part by the burnings of fossil fuels, are higher than the Earth has seen in at least 800,000 years. Last year tied 2016 as the hottest years on record within the hottest decade ever recorded.
Mega-blazes across America last year incinerated towns and forests made tinder dry by prolonged drought. Warming ocean waters helped transform storms like Hurricane Sally into slow-moving, water-deluging behemoths.
New research this month reveals that freshwater frozen on Antarctica is melting into the oceans at a rate six times faster than 40 years ago, a clear sign of a warming planet and a harbinger of a precipitous sea rise in the decades to come.
Although climate change is already a here-and-now problem, scientists say it's still possible to slow the rise in global temperatures and mitigate the most catastrophic effects. This will require reducing greenhouse gas emissions and even extracting gases from the skies, if science can find a way to do it at scale.
New oil, gas leasing moratorium
President Joe Biden was elected on a platform that included prioritizing the fight against climate change. Among his first actions were rejoining the Paris climate accord and rolling back Trump-era deregulation. On Wednesday, he's expected to announce a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing on federal land.
In the weeks ahead, Biden will seek hundreds of billions of dollars in clean-energy investments, including projects such as installing vast numbers of electric vehicle charging stations.
We continue to believe that a crucial step should be a refundable national carbon tax (about which Biden is silent) to make renewable sources and carbon-capture schemes more competitive with fossil fuels. And, in our view, Biden's quick canceling of the Keystone XL pipeline is a largely symbolic move unlikely to keep oil from being extracted from Canadian oil sands.
Nonetheless, with Biden's election, the nation and Congress can begin the crucial and necessary debate over how best to attack this crisis.
Denying that the crisis even exists -- as Trump did with the coronavirus, and many still do with human-caused climate change -- kills debate and ensures nothing is accomplished until it's too late to avert calamity.

USA-2021-62.txt,"On climate change, government-centric approach will hurt USA with unintended consequences

Opposing View: President's expected moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits isn't the way. We don't need more restrictions.
Nicolas Loris | Opinion contributor
You're reading the Opposing View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate.
For Our View, read ""On COVID-19 and climate, denialism is deadly.""
Climate change is real, and man-made emissions are indeed having an impact. However, many of the subsidies and regulations being proposed are costly and ineffective, benefiting the well-connected rather than the planet.
Take President Joe Biden's expected moratorium on new oil and natural gas leases and drilling permits on federal lands. Western and Gulf Coast states, which rely on energy development for their economic life, would suffer. The decision would result in less supply, fewer jobs and less revenue coming into these states -- money used to fund everything from public schools to conservation efforts.
Worse, all the economic costs of the moratorium would buy a change in the Earth's temperature that's practically unnoticeable. A climate model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research shows that eliminating all fossil fuel production on federal lands would avert 0.08 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100.
Further, policies that restrict or prohibit natural resource extraction in the United States will not stop or substantially change the global consumption of these resources. Instead, production will shift to places where the standards are not as rigorous, increasing emissions in the process.
This administration's recent energy actions represent a broader concern with a government-centric approach. They will result in higher prices and are fraught with unintended consequences.
In fact, even if the United States were to achieve a net-zero emissions target at the sacrifice of higher energy bills and a weaker economy, the climate benefit would be minimal, as America constitutes a relatively small percentage of global emissions.
The Paris Agreement does little to change this, as major emitting developing countries have free reign to emit well into the future without meaningfully changing their behavior.

USA-2021-63.txt,"Climate Point: Biden takes office with ambitious climate plans but minimal details

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Joe Biden is now the president, and the Democrats control Congress, although by the slimmest of margins. Later in this edition, I'm going to take you through a recently published series from the USA Today Network that dives into the strengths and weaknesses of Biden's environmental plans and what these mean for specific communities around the country. But first, he'll have to contend with the legacy of four years of environmental rollbacks from the Trump administration.
Exactly one week before the inauguration, the Bureau of Land Management published a sweeping rewrite of a 10.8-million-acre land management plan covering the Southern California desert. The plan was meant to balance renewable energy development, conservation and the preservation of cultural resources, but Donald Trump took aim in the 11th hour. I've got the details in The Desert Sun.
Meanwhile, The Arizona Republic reports that the U.S. Forest Service also initiated a land swap last week that ""would clear the way for a huge copper mine beneath Oak Flat, a site that's sacred to many Apaches and culturally significant to other tribes."" The clock's now ticking on both attempts to prioritize development on public land, and conservationists as well as Democrats are hoping Biden steps in.
I'll have an analysis of Biden's first week of office in my next edition, but for now, here's a bunch of other important reporting ...
MUST-READ STORIES
Exxon exposed? The Wall Street Journal reports that a whistleblower within Exxon alleged that ""the energy giant overvalued one of its most important oil and gas properties,"" leading to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. At question are asset valuations in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico -- one of the most important oil basins in the world -- which the employee said were bloated.
Supreme conflict of interest. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and Shell go way back, with her father having worked there as one of the oil supermajor's top attorneys for nearly three decades. HuffPost reports that Justice Samuel Alito, who owns


stock in various fossil fuel companies, recused himself from a climate change case against oil companies that was before the court Tuesday. Barrett recused herself from similar cases when she sat on a lower appellate court. But this time? Not so much.
Burns in the Bay. ""It's hard to believe this is January,"" a Cal Fire spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times this week. There used to be clearer lines between fire season and the rest of the year in the West, but those are rapidly blurring as fires are now able to burn throughout the year, a trend worsened by drought and other climate change-induced factors.
CLIMATE COLLISION
From public lands in Arizona to tribal resources in California and from wind farms in the ocean to solar farms in the desert, what will this new administration mean for America's environment? USA Today Network newspapers around the country teamed up to find answers. ""As he steps into office this week, President-elect Joe Biden brings an ambitious plan to address climate change, and with Democrats in control of Congress for the first time in a decade, he may have the opportunity to accomplish some of his loftiest goals,"" Dinah Voyles Pulver writes for USA Today, kicking off the project.
Farming carbon in Indiana. Sarah Bowman and London Gibson report for the Indianapolis Star on the potential to tap into regenerative farming to sequester carbon and otherwise lower greenhouse gas output via agriculture. ""When people think of climate change, they probably envision smokestacks belching pollution into the air. But agriculture is responsible for 10% to 12% of the world's emissions,"" they write. In one example, they describe how the federal government could step in to create a ""carbon bank"" to kickstart a carbon market and incentivize these practices.
Offshore wind in Massachusetts. Doug Fraser reports for the Cape Cod Times on Biden's goal of constructing thousands of offshore wind turbines in the coming years. Under the previous administration, clean power buildout was largely left to the states, complicating the energy transition. Topography and population density in the Northeast make onshore wind difficult, so could this new direction in federal policy mean the region's in store for an offshore boom?
Clean transport in California. James Ward and I, from the Visalia Times-Delta and The Desert Sun, respectively, take on the question of greening the transportation system, which is the largest driver of climate-warming emissions. Biden's goals align with what California is already attempting -- building high-speed rail and shifting to electric vehicles. But, it's a long road. California's high-speed rail project is stuck in a quagmire, and the country would need to grow its infrastructure from fewer than 30,000 electric vehicle charging stations to half-a-million to meet Biden's goals.
Protecting public lands in Arizona. Anton Delgado of The Arizona Republic digs into the fight over public lands in the Southwest. In one case, a company called Energy Fuels Resources wants to mine uranium only miles from the Grand Canyon. (For perspective,


the U.S. uranium industry has almost entirely dried up, and there are many years of the stuff already available from other sources.) The project is yet to produce uranium, and activists hope Biden will kill it for good.
Fighting fire on the West Coast. Zach Urness of the Salem Statesman Journal and Damon Arthur of the Redding Record Searchlight examine record-shattering wildfires up and down the West Coast. They go deep on the ways climate change is fueling blazes, how wildfire behavior is changing as a result and why we need more controlled fire on the landscape.
Black gold in Texas. Madlin Mekelburg of the Austin American-Statesman helps us peer into the future of oil in Texas. Biden's plans on climate are a ""complete reversal,"" from Trump, she writes, and will hit small oil and gas producers especially hard well before the big guys like Shell and BP.
Dirty energy in Ohio. Beth Burger of The Columbus Dispatch reports from communities living around Ohio's coal-fired power plants to see what they're thinking about a coal-free existence. ""As power companies continue to shift to renewables, communities like Cheshire (in southeastern Ohio) likely will no longer have a major source of pollution, opening up a future for them to create,"" she writes.
Weighing cultural issues in the Southwest. Debra Utacia Krol of The Arizona Republic examines the balance that Native American tribes around the Southwest are calling for, as they ask Biden to respect culturally important sites when greenlighting renewable energy projects. ""Tribes and environmentalists wonder what, if anything, the new administration will do to balance those goals, building renewable power generation while still protecting culturally important areas, particularly in the West,"" she writes. In Southern California's Riverside County, for example, a giant solar farm ""tore through trails and funerary sites,"" which came as a steep price for those cleaner megawatts.
Fossil fuels in the Sooner State. Jack Money of The Oklahoman digs into impending shifts in that state's energy future, as Biden takes the reins. His thoughtful piece questions whether more conservative fossil fuel proponents, Trump included, really did that much to bolster the industry or if the market was typically superior. If the latter is true, how worried should the state be about its economy under more liberal federal leadership?
Sea level rise in the Atlantic Ocean. And Pulver and Fraser bring us one last piece from the project, checking in with coastal experts to hear how they want Biden to address rising seas. The government's own data show that high-tide floods are coming twice as often as they did a mere two decades ago.
AND ANOTHER THING
Feeling hot hot hot. Well, that's it for forward-looking projections, leaving just enough time for a quick check back on 2020. As I talked about last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- part of the U.S. Department of Commerce -- announced that 2020 was nearly the hottest year on record. Carbon Brief is out with its


""state of the climate"" that has most of the factoids, charts and stats a climate nerd could desire. Of particular concern, last year was the seventh consecutive year in which global temperatures were a full 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously. Here are the latest numbers:

USA-2021-64.txt,"Biden is taking bold action on climate change and the environment: Here's what we know about the Paris Agreement and the Keystone XL

Doyle Rice | USA TODAY
When it comes to the environment, President Joe Biden hit the ground running, literally minutes into his term. ""A cry for survival comes from the planet itself,"" Biden said in his inaugural address. ""A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now."" The new president on Wednesday, in his first hours in the White House, officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change, a treaty the United States formally exited in November after President Donald Trump withdrew in 2017. Also on his first day in office, Biden canceled the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline to move oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, rescinding Trump's approval of a project long criticized by environmentalists. He also ordered a temporary moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in what had been virgin Arctic wilderness and directed federal agencies to start looking at tougher mileage standards and other emission limits again. Here's a closer look at Biden's actions:
Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement
Environmentalists applauded Biden's move on the Paris climate pact. ""President Biden's swift action to rejoin the Paris Agreement will be the first step to bring the United States back into the fold of the global community after four years of being isolated and on the sidelines,"" Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a statement. ""With communities in the U.S. and around the world reeling from a terrible spate of climate disasters in 2020, it's a relief that the incoming administration has pledged to have science guide their decision-making in addressing the climate crisis,"" she said.


Scientists and world leaders say the Paris Agreement's plans for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide will prevent a major increase in global temperatures. That increase is projected to raise sea levels, spark major droughts and lead to more dangerous storms.
Another expert, Mitchell Bernard, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Wednesday that ""this is swift and decisive action. It makes the United States once more part of the global climate solution ¬≠ not the problem.""
However, Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said ""the Paris climate agreement is based on the backward idea that the United States is a culprit here when in reality, the United States is the leading driver of climate solutions.""
Why is it called the Paris Agreement?: The name has nothing to do with 'citizens of Paris' as Ted Cruz tweeted
Scrapping the Keystone XL pipeline
The 1,700-mile Keystone pipeline was planned to carry roughly 800,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to the Texas Gulf Coast, passing through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma.
The Natural Resources Defense Council said, ""the scrapping of this disastrous project will support both Canadian and U.S. climate objectives by stalling the expansion of the tar sands climate catastrophe and reducing North America's reliance on dirty fuels.""
But North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer urged Biden to reconsider the pipeline decision, calling it an ""early mistake by the president and a nod to far-left environmental extremists.""
Revoking oil and gas development at national wildlife monuments
New climate adviser Gina McCarthy explained to CBS News that the Biden administration will discard or redo more than 100 ""harmful"" presidential proclamations, memoranda, or permits signed by Trump that the new administration views as detrimental to the environment.
Also referring to the Paris Agreement, Penn State University meteorologist Michael Mann told USA TODAY that ""these actions are extremely important, being both symbolic and substantive. They are symbolic in that they signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is back. We're ready once again to assert leadership on the climate crisis.
""But they are substantive, too, in that they use two of the most important lever-arms we have when it comes to climate action, which include international diplomacy and domestic policy,"" Mann said.
Considering revising vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards


Biden also aims to reduce harmful emissions from cars, trucks and SUVs. Specifically, the new administration intends to undo one of Trump's biggest changes: His gutting of Obama-era fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for automobiles through 2025. But the regulatory slog could take a couple of years unless Trump's rollbacks are thrown out by the courts. Biden will also likely reverse Trump's decision to revoke California's ability to set its own pollution standards.

USA-2021-65.txt,"Biden's climate crusade: How his plan to cut carbon emissions, create jobs could impact U.S.

USA TODAY asked experts across the U.S. for their best guesses on the potential impacts of Biden's climate plan, which has big ideas but few details.
Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY
Published 12:00 PM UTC+1 Jan. 18, 2021 Updated 12:17 PM UTC+1 Jan. 18, 2021
As he steps into office this week, President-elect Joe Biden brings an ambitious plan to address climate change, and with Democrats in control of Congress for the first time in a decade, he may have the opportunity to accomplish some of his loftiest goals.
""It's enormous,"" said Susan Glickman, Florida director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, one of many climate advocates, scientists and concerned citizens looking forward with optimism.
Biden's goals include carbon-free electricity by 2035, more wind and solar to get the nation to net-zero emissions and 100% clean energy by 2050. He also wants to upgrade millions of buildings and homes to be more energy efficient, plug abandoned oil and gas wells, reclaim mines and make environmental justice a key consideration.
The climate and energy plans don't delve into specifics on how those goals might be achieved, and his transition team declined multiple requests to answer questions about the plans. Without those key details, people can only speculate on what could happen in the months to come.

USA TODAY Network reporters asked experts across the country for their insight on the potential impacts of Biden's plans, from the anticipated boost to wind power in the Northeast to incentives for farmers in the Midwest and the aggressive clean energy measures already underway in California.
Several key things are lined up in Biden's favor, the experts said.
For example, two major changes have occurred in the 10 years since President Barack Obama had a similar majority in Congress, said David Konisky, a professor at Indiana University's O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.


First, the climate problem has ""taken on incredibly more urgency"" as warming temperatures and rising seas create havoc and give scientists a better look at what's to come, Konisky said. Second, the public is increasingly aware of climate change because of the excessive heat nationwide, wildfires in the West and more intense hurricanes along the Atlantic coast.

""That means there's more pressure for President-elect Biden to do something,"" he said.
Biden's goals to curb greenhouse emissions may be helped by existing plans to phase out aging utility plants and reduce coal use, experts said.
While he aims to cut emissions with clean energy projects, his plans also support regenerative agriculture practices that could help farmers and sequester some of the burden from carbon dioxide emissions.
Other environmental advocates hope the administration will include ample protections for public and tribal lands as it works to expand wind and solar power projects.
Biden's plan is expected to work in harmony with California, where the state's governor already is trying to phase out fuel-driven cars and move forward on high speed rail. The new administration's plan includes increasing the nation's network of electric vehicle charging stations more than ten-fold and expanding light and high-speed rail.
While Biden emphasizes stimulating the economy and jobs by beefing up solar and wind capacity and shoring up roads, utilities and military bases, Republicans are likely to raise concerns about the costs of his ambitious plans.
It could help his agenda that some of the more conservative states, such as Texas and North Carolina, are leading the way in wind and solar, noted a recent story in Inside Climate News. That may help create more bipartisan support for things like renewable energy incentives in the COVID-19 relief package.

However, even with a super-majority for a time, Obama was never able to get a climate bill through Congress, and Biden's margin will be even thinner, Konisky said. ""That could make it even more difficult.""
Even though the public understands climate change better than it did a decade ago, the nation is no less polarized, he said, and does not yet have broad consensus about how the government should address it.


Konisky expects to see Biden pursue his goals in other ways across the spectrum, by embedding climate policies throughout much of what the administration attempts to do, including budgets and ""a robust regulatory effort."" SUBSCRIBE: Help support quality journalism like this. Others expect to see the administration get creative in broadly implementing its policies. If they are serious about climate mobilization, ""it's not just one agency, it's the whole of government,"" said Robert Kopp, a Rutgers University climate scientist and a lead author on the coming Sixth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""What you have to do is take every mechanism we use to make decisions and integrate climate into it,"" said Kopp. ""Climate isn't just some other bucket. It's really part of everything. I think the (Biden) administration recognizes that and it's reflected by their efforts."" ""With a supportive Congress, they can change laws, tax incentives and make the infrastructure investments needed to grow the clean energy economy.""

USA-2021-66.txt,"Live politics updates: Twitter temporarily suspends account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene

Twitter temporarily suspends account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene
Twitter announced Sunday it had suspended the account of freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene for 12 hours. The Republican's last post to the site was a video in which she continued to allege debunked and unfounded conspiracy theories about widespread voter fraud in her home state of Georgia. Twitter flagged the post with a warning and blocked users from liking or commenting on the post. In another post earlier in the day, Greene attacked Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voter system implementation manager, spreading a false claim about alleged corruption from Dominion voting machines. ""Morons like you are responsible for losing GA's 2 Republican Senate seats,"" Greene said. The post was again flagged by Twitter for spreading misinformation. ""Moments ago, I was 'temporarily' banned from Twitter right after I railed against Georgia Election Officials for a rigged election and announced my Articles of Impeachment against Joe Biden,"" Greene said in a fundraising email sent out Sunday evening that referred to unfounded allegations of corruption against the incoming Democratic president. ""I'm not going back to the days of Republicans bending over backwards to appease the Democrats and the Fake News Media,"" she wrote Greene is a firebrand conspiracy theorist who has claimed the United States is experiencing an ""Islamic invasion into our government offices,"" that the Pentagon was not actually attacked on , that Black people are ""slaves to the Democratic Party"" and that billionaire Jewish philanthropist George Soros is a Nazi.


And she has expressed support for the baseless and wide-ranging QAnon conspiracy theory.
""Q is a patriot. We know that for sure,"" Greene has said.
Twitter's temporary suspension of Greene comes after it suspended 70,000 Twitter accounts connected to the QAnon believers, as well as prominent rightwing pundits and President Donald Trump.
CNN host Jake Tapper was not optimistic that Twitter's brief suspension would change Greene's ways.
""I'm sure the woman who claimed a plane never really flew into the Pentagon on , an anti-Muslim bigot who has been nonetheless welcomed by @GOPLeader and @SteveScalise into the GOP caucus, will totally be chastised by this 12 hour suspension, examining her life choices,"" Tapper tweeted with sarcasm.

GOP Sen. Ben Sasse denounces QAnon, conspiracy theories on the right
Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., condemned the popularity of conspiracy theories within the Republican Party and the broader conservative movement in a blistering op-ed for The Atlantic, telling his party it must ""reject conspiracy theories or be consumed by them.""
Sasse's opinion piece comes after a mob ransacked the U.S. Capitol. President Donald Trump had called on the crowd of his supporters to ""march down Pennsylvania Avenue"" and ""show strength"" as Congress voted to certify the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Sasse admonished his fellow Republicans, stating that many had deluded themselves about the threat conspiracy theories posed to the party. Sasse said prominent newlyelected conspiracy theorists like freshman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom he called ""cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.""
""Until last week, many party leaders and consultants thought they could preach the Constitution while winking at QAnon. They can't,"" Sasse wrote. ""Now is the time to decide what this party is about.""
Sasse argues that the rise of right-wing conspiracy theories in the Trump era has occurred for three reasons: the ostensibly poor media diet of Americans, a collapse of trust and engagement with civic institutions, and a loss of national meaning.
""A conspiracy theory offers its devotees a way of inserting themselves into a cosmic battle pitting good against evil. This sense of vocation that makes it dangerous is also precisely what makes it attractive in our era of isolated, alienated consumerism,"" Sasse writes.


The junior Nebraska senator argued that to win again, Republicans must ""repudiate the nonsense that has set our party on fire"" and then ""offer a genuine answer to the frustrations of the past decade.""
Referencing a viral confrontation between Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman and a QAnon adherent storming the Capitol, Sasse wrote. ""In a standoff between the Constitution and madness, both men picked a side. It's the GOP's turn to do the same.""

Biden aides: Threats won't stop Joe Biden from taking the oath of office and getting to work
Aides to President-elect Joe Biden said Sunday they are aware of threats nationwide surrounding this week's inauguration, but they won't stop his plans to take the oath of office and get to work.
Incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, speaking on CNN, said he has confidence that the Secret Service, National Guard, and others can protect Washington, D.C., but ""we are concerned, certainly, about these threats in other places.""
""We will have a team in place in the White House to monitor these actions going forward starting on 12:00 noon on Jan. 20,"" Klain said during an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
Less than two weeks after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, officials in Washington are bracing for the inauguration with street closings, high fences and concrete barriers, and thousands of armed police officers and National Guard troops.
Kate Bedingfield, the incoming White House communications director, told ABC News' ""This Week"" that ""you only have to look at the chatter on social media to see that we are in a volatile time, and so we are making preparations.""
That said, she added, it is ""our plan and our expectation"" to have Biden take the oath of office outside on the west front of the Capitol.
After that, aides said, Biden has an agenda of items to move forward on. They ranged from having the United State rejoin the Paris climate change accord to new plans to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We're inheriting a huge mess here,"" Klain said, referring in particular to problems with distributing COVID vaccines. ""But we have a plan to fix it.""

Trump aide: Members of impeachment legal team (including Giuliani) yet to be determined


While Rudy Giuliani was at the White House on Saturday, an adviser to outgoing President Donald Trump said he has not selected members for his impeachment defense team.
Trump ""has not yet made a determination as to which lawyer or law firm will represent him for the disgraceful attack on our Constitution and democracy, known as the 'impeachment hoax,'"" spokesman Hogan Gidley tweeted Sunday. ""We will keep you informed.""
The House impeached Trump last week on charges of inciting the insurrection and attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. The Senate is scheduled to try Trump later this year, even though he will be out of office.
Giuliani told ABC News he is working on Trump's defense, though Gidley's statement indicates that is not official ¬≠ at least not yet.

Trump approval ratings hold steady after Capitol riot, second impeachment
President Donald Trump will be leaving office with a record low, yet historically stable approval rating, according to recent polls.
An NBC News poll found that Trump's approval rating with voters nationwide stood at 43%, slightly down from the 45% the poll registered before the November election. A similar Washington Post/ABC News poll found Trump held a 38% approval rating, down seven points from when that poll was conducted in October.
The findings come after Trump became the first president in American history to be impeached twice by Congress, a week after he told a large crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol ahead of a deadly riot in which the mob stormed the building.
The recent polls underscore Trump's tenure as one of the most polarizing figures in American history.
While only 5% of Democrats approved of Trump in the NBC News poll, 87% of Republicans gave the president a positive approval rating. Those numbers show only marginal declines from late October, when Trump had a 6% and 89% approval rating among Democrats and Republicans, respectively. In both reports, independents gave the president a 44% approval rating.
Forty-nine percent of respondents said Trump was ""one of the worst"" presidents, and an additional 9% said he was ""not as good as most,"" in the NBC News poll. Nineteen percent of respondents, however, believed Trump was ""one of the best,"" and another 21% said he was ""better than most.""


A new USA TODAY/ Suffolk University poll found Americans are worried about the health of the nation's democracy. Seventy percent of respondents in that poll said American democracy was weaker than it was four years ago. Another 70% called the Capitol rioters ""criminals,"" though one in four felt the rioters ""went too far, but they had a point.""
A recent CBS News poll found that 54% of Americans believed that the biggest threat to the American way of life was ""other people in America,"" highlighting high levels of distrust within the nation.
Divisions over Trump's conduct and the legitimacy of the presidential election are also evident in the polls.
Sixty-six percent of respondents in the Post/ABC poll said Trump acted irresponsibly in the aftermath of the November election. Sixty-two percent believed that Joe Biden won the presidential election legitimately and that there was no solid evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election.
The Post/ABC poll also found persistent divides over not only the 2020 election, but also Trump's win in 2016. Fifty-seven percent of respondents said Trump's 2016 victory was legitimate versus 42% who said it was not.
It is likely these divides will persist. While 69% of voters overall would like to see the Republican Party chart a new path after Trump, 57% of Republican-leaning voters want Republican leaders to follow Trump's lead, the Post/ABC poll found.

Lindsey Graham to Trump: Don't pardon insurrectionists
South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham once criticized President Donald Trump over his demands to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden, but Graham was full of support in an interview broadcast Sunday ¬≠ though he did warn Trump not to pardon extremist supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
""To seek a pardon of these people would be wrong ... I think it would destroy President Trump,"" Graham said on the Fox News program ""Sunday Morning Futures."" ""And I hope we don't go down that road.""
Graham also praised Trump's accomplishments in office and reaffirmed the president's place as the leader of the GOP.
""Mr. President, your policies will stand the test of time,"" he said on the Fox program that Trump is known to watch. ""You're the most important figure in the Republican Party. You can shape the direction of the party, keep your movement alive.""


Demonstrating his fealty to Trump, Graham later released a letter to incoming Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., requesting a dismissal of the impeachment case charging him with inciting the Capitol riot. Holding a Senate trial, he said, would delay ""the healing of this great Nation.""
Schumer is not expected to grant the request, and several political analysts mocked Graham's call for unity.
""You don't get to whine about 'healing' now after you personally inflicted so many of the wounds,"" tweeted historian Kevin Kruse.

House prosecutor: We're developing a trial plan to detail Donald Trump egged on capital rioters
WASHINGTON ¬≠ The top House impeachment prosecutor said Sunday his team is developing a ""trial plan"" designed to detail President Donald Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told CNN the plan would be used during Trump's Senate trial later this year. Raskin said he did not know exactly when the trial might take place, but noted that a conviction would bar Trump from holding future office and end any of his remaining presidential aspirations.
""This was the most serious presidential crime in the history of the United States of America,"" Raskin said on ""State of the Union.""
The House impeached Trump on charges of inciting an insurrection designed to intimidate lawmakers into reversing his election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Ten Republicans voted for the impeachment of Trump as a result of the riot that left five people dead.
Raskin said Trump inspired the insurrection with his constant lies about widespread election fraud after Biden's win, from a series of lawsuits to his fiery speech at a rally right before the invasion of the Capitol building.
House leaders have not delivered the impeachment article to the Senate, which is responsible for trying Trump even though he is out of office. Democrats will take political control of the Senate later this week.
Raskin is leading the House prosecution team in the wake of his son's self-inflicted death.
The Maryland congressman told CNN he is inspired by the memory of his late son, as well as colleagues, aides, and workers who were threatened by the mob at the U.S. Capitol.
""I'm not going to lose my son at the end of 2020, and lose my country and my republic in 2021,"" Raskin said.

Biden outlines executive orders planned for first 10 days
President-elect Joe Biden will sign more than a dozen executive orders on his first day in office reversing key Trump Administration policies on issues from immigration to climate change, Biden's transition team announced Saturday.
On Wednesday, the day Biden is inaugurated as president, his executive actions will include:
Asking the Department of Education to extend the pause on student loan payments and interests on federal student loans Rejoin the Paris Agreement, which focuses on goals to help mitigate climate change Reverse the travel ban for Muslim-majority countries
He will also enact orders that address the ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic. As president, he will launch his ""100 Day Masking Challenge,"" which includes a mask mandate on federal property and inter-state travel. He will also extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures.
On Biden's second day in office, he will sign more executive actions addressing the pandemic that will ""change the course of the COVID-19 crisis and safely re-open schools and businesses,"" the transition team said. He will take actions that aim to mitigate the spread of the virus by expanding testing, protecting workers and establishing public health standards.
More: A Biden presidency could bring a wave of policy shifts. Here are the ones you likely care about.
On his third day in office, Biden will direct his Cabinet agencies to take immediate action to deliver economic relief to working families, though the transition team did not provide specifics.
Between Jan. 25 and Feb. 1, Biden will sign more executive actions, memoranda and issues additional Cabinet directives, including ones addressing equity and support in communities of color and underserved communities, and criminal justice system reforms.
Biden also plans to sign more executive actions addressing the climate crisis, in addition to taking his first steps to expand access to health care. And he will begin reuniting families separated at the border. As of December, 628 parents who were separated from their children at the border are still missing.

USA-2021-67.txt,"Climate Point: Earth is spinning faster, and a manatee holds a political message

Mark Olalde | USA TODAY
Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
Also welcome to the final Climate Point with Donald Trump as president. Next week, President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, undoubtedly setting off a whirlwind of activity in the District, as Democrats try to undo four years of rollbacks to environmental laws. Even as Trump became the first president ever impeached twice and even as Democrats took control of Congress, the administration continued targeting these laws (more on that later).
However, political infighting isn't the only thing running hot with Biden preparing to take office. As USA Today's Doyle Rice writes: ""Global warming didn't take the year off in 2020."" In a year with massive wildfires and hurricanes, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 2020 was also the second-hottest year in recorded human history, only slightly behind 2016. It also was the 44th consecutive year with temperatures sustained above the 20th-century average.
And these patterns of rising temperatures are becoming ever-clearer around the country and the world. As just one example, Scott Fallon at The Record in New Jersey writes that ""the first two decades of the 21st century have included 15 of the 21 warmest years in New Jersey.""

Parting shots. Reuters reports that the push to prioritize extractive industries is set to continue right up until the inauguration. On Friday, the Trump administration is poised to approve several controversial land swaps, including for a lithium mine in Nevada and a copper mine in Arizona that has seen years of opposition from Native American groups.
New Year's resolutions. I know it feels like this year has gone on for, well, years, but it's still the middle of January. Any chance you're sticking with your yearly resolution? If yours has anything to do with the environment -- even something as simple as planting some herbs on your windowsill -- I'd like to recommend my USA Today Network friends over at the Indianapolis Star, Sarah Bowman and London Gibson. They produce a series called ""Scrub Hub"" to answer readers' questions, and this week they took on several timely, at-home dilemmas. In one installment, they explain how to keep plants alive


during the winter (because I know you all started hoarding succulents to get through the stay-at-home orders), while in a second, they provide tips for how you can ""be more environmentally friendly in the new year.""
The final frontier. Do you feel like the Earth is spinning out of control these days? Well, it actually is spinning faster, USA Today reports. Apparently, the 28 fastest days on record -- this is something we started tracking in 1960, I have learned -- all came in 2020. And in other space news from our newspaper chain's mother ship (get it?), USA Today also reports that NASA is building a new telescope to extensively map galaxies as well as study the Big Bang.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
Making budget news cool again. Perhaps digging into a state budget isn't your idea of fun, but when it's California -- which is one of the largest economies in the world -- you find all sorts of gems. After an unexpected tax windfall, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom released the first salvo in the annual budget negotiations, publishing a more than $225 billion budget proposal. Among other highlights, he suggested spending $1.5 billion to build out the Golden State's electric vehicle charging infrastructure, incentivize middle-class earners to purchase zero-emission vehicles and otherwise prop up alternatives to internal combustion engine vehicles. It's already receiving pushback, but even a scaled-down version of his plan could help grease the wheels for a major transportation transition.
Blue struggling to go green. New Mexico continues grappling with its identity as a Democratic state that relies on oil and gas revenue. So, why did the state sign onto a lobbying effort to get Baja California to approve a natural gas export facility in Mexico? In another important piece of reporting, NM Political Report discovered that a letter Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed in support of the project was drafted specifically at the request of the gas company in question and some politicians didn't sign the letter until after the company paid its dues to a part-governmental, part-industry group. The governor's office told the publication that she's leading the charge on greening the Land of Enchantment, but they didn't respond to specifics regarding the gas company's involvement in the lobbying effort.
Birthing extremism. Elsewhere in the West, High Country News took a look at the recent riots at the U.S. Capitol to study how land rights battles laid the groundwork for actions that are being likened to domestic terrorism. Reporter Carl Segerstrom draws parallels between these riots and past run-ins between the federal government and ranchers Ammon and Cliven Bundy. In a thought-provoking read, he writes that the West ""isn't the only place where anti-government sentiment festers, but here the wounds are open, frequently endured and historically recent.""
STALLED MOMENTUM


Fuel inefficiencies. California and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have been locked in legal battles over vehicular fuel efficiency standards throughout much of the Trump presidency. With that backdrop, the EPA found in a new report that ""gas mileage for new vehicles dropped and pollution increased in model year 2019 for the first time in five years,"" AP writes. Cascadia's climate catastrophe. In another intriguing read, InvestigateWest and Grist dug into the forces at work in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia -- liberal forces that promised action on climate change. They also had the momentum and natural resources such as abundant hydropower needed to step away from climate-warming fossil fuels. So why, until the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily took cars off the road and planes out of the sky, were emissions emanating from those three jurisdictions continuing to rise? It's an important story of how insufficient political will and the specter of job losses, among other factors, partially paralyzed a movement. Getting in under the wire. As the Trump administration rushed to lock in proindustry policies ahead of Biden taking the White House, so too did oil companies push to protect their future business, AP reports. Their analysis found that ""energy companies stockpiled enough drilling permits for western public lands to keep pumping oil for years."" The months immediately surrounding the election saw the highest number of oil drilling approvals during Trump's entire term, including nearly 1,400 drilling applications on federal land alone.

Someone in Florida etched ""TRUMP"" in the back of a manatee, immediately drawing all sorts of criticisms and hot takes online. While it's a single animal in question, the outpouring of anger over the act raises important questions about the importance of wildlife protection and how and when we sound the alarm about humans' impact on the natural world.

USA-2021-68.txt,"2020 falls just short of being Earth's hottest year on record as global warming continues

Doyle Rice | USA TODAY
""Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important ¬≠ the important things are long-term trends."" Overall, Earth's average temperature has risen more than 2 degrees since the 1880s, NASA said. Until the world reduces emissions down to net-zero, the planet will continue to warm. Global warming didn't take the year off in 2020: The planet was near record-hot again last year, climate groups announced Thursday. While NASA said 2020 essentially tied with 2016 as the Earth's warmest year on record, other groups, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said it was the second-warmest year. ""Whether one year is a record or not is not really that important ¬≠ the important things are long-term trends,"" said NASA climate scientist Gavin Schmidt. ""The last seven years have been the warmest seven years on record, typifying the ongoing and dramatic warming trend."" Also, according to NOAA, 2020 was the 44th consecutive year (since 1977) with global temperatures above the 20th-century average. NOAA and NASA measurements go back to 1880. ""With these trends, and as the human impact on the climate increases, we have to expect that records will continue to be broken,"" said Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The burning of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the Earth's atmosphere, causing the globe to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural causes.


""We're in a position where we're pushing the climate system out of the bounds that it's been in for tens of thousands of years, if not millions of years,"" Schmidt said.
Overall, Earth's average temperature has risen more than 2 degrees since the 1880s, NASA said.
And although carbon emissions were down in 2020 amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, they continue to accumulate in the atmosphere. The amount of warming the world experiences is based on total emissions since pre-industrial times, rather than emissions in 2020, according to Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute in California.
In fact, surprisingly, the pandemic may have added ever so slightly to last year's warming, because people were driving less. That reduced the short-term aerosol pollution that acts as a cooling agent by reflecting heat.
More: 2020 was an extreme year for Earth's temperatures. But was it the hottest on record? It depends.
""What matters for the climate is not the leaderboard of individual years,"" Hausfather tweeted Thursday. ""Rather, it is the long-term upward trend in global temperatures driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Until the world reduces emissions down to net-zero, the planet will continue to warm.""
The previous record warm year, 2016, received a significant boost from a strong El Ni√±o. The lack of a similar assist from El Ni√±o this year is evidence that the background climate continues to warm because of greenhouse gases, Schmidt said. La Ni√±a, a natural cooling of Pacific Ocean water that was present toward the end of 2020, tends to lower the global temperature, while El Ni√±o does the opposite.
""It is rather remarkable that a La Ni√±a year could match the warmth of one of the strongest El Ni√±os on record just a few years ago ¬≠ illustrating the powerful impact that human greenhouse gas emissions are having on global temperatures,"" Hausfather wrote on the Carbon Brief website.
Last year's exceptional heat ""is yet another stark reminder of the relentless pace of climate change, which is destroying lives and livelihoods across our planet,"" U.N. SecretaryGeneral Ant√≥nio Guterres said in a statement.
World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, in a statement in December, said that ""2020 has, unfortunately, been yet another extraordinary year for our climate. We saw new extreme temperatures on land, sea and especially in the Arctic.""
""Wildfires consumed vast areas in Australia, Siberia, the U.S. West Coast and South America, sending plumes of smoke circumnavigating the globe,"" he said. ""We saw a record number of hurricanes in the Atlantic, including unprecedented back-to-back


Category 4 hurricanes in Central America in November. Flooding in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia led to massive population displacement and undermined food security for millions."" In the U.S., the record for the number of weather disasters that cost at least $1 billion was smashed. There were 22 such disasters in 2020, including hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and a Midwest derecho. Contributing: The Associated Press

USA-2021-69.txt,"Climate Point: A battle over glamping, drilling in Alaska, and vanishing Hawaiian beaches

Welcome to Climate Point, your weekly guide to climate, energy and environment news from around the Golden State and the country. In Palm Springs, Calif., I'm Mark Olalde.
President Trump finally conceded after a mob of his supporters overran the U.S. Capitol. Georgia continued its blue shift, electing two Democratic senators and handing control over Congress' upper branch to the Democratic Party by a razor-thin margin. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge was opened for oil drilling in a lease sale that saw a pitiful turnout. COVID-19 continued surging to unfathomable heights.
And we're one week into 2021.
But let's pick up this week in beautiful eastern Arizona, where, only five days before President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office, the Trump administration will hand over nearly 2,500 acres in Tonto National Forest to global mining giant Rio Tinto in a land swap. To call it controversial would be an understatement, as the San Carlos Apache Tribe has fought vehemently for years to protect a nearby site it says is sacred. Arizona Public Radio has the story.
Here's some other important reporting...
MUST-READ STORIES
Going to war for glamping. Sedona, Ariz., is a starkly gorgeous part of the country, its red rocks rising like monoliths not too far north of Phoenix. Due to its serenity, this area is now the center of a fiery debate: to glamp or not to glamp. A glamping -- glamorous camping -- company is at the center of the debate over whether it's appropriate to place Airstreams, fire pits and other amenities in a fire-prone area, even if they refused to comment for this Arizona Republic article. That's not all that has locals concerned. The Hopi Tribe has a sacred site half a mile away, and there are concerns that glampers will trample it.
Oil issues bubble up. I could fill an entire newsletter with oil and gas shenanigans, but, instead, I'll quickly run through some highlights for you here. Starting out east, The Post Star reports that New York's Department of Environmental Conservation has found more than 2,000 orphaned oil and gas wells to date, and it's planning to invest $400,000 in ""custom drone and imaging equipment"" to find more that are lurking throughout the state. Moving to the Midwest, Downtown, a magazine, reports that Michigan's 60,000 wells are spewing methane even as many are no longer producing, but cleaning them up presents an opportunity to put roughnecks back to work. And, heading out west, the Casper Star Tribune reports that several tribal nations are protesting a decision by the


Trump administration to allow the drilling of 5,000 new wells. The tribes worry the drilling could ""compromise air and water quality, violate existing treaty rights and destroy cultural resources.""
The future of transport. The transportation sector is arguably the largest contributor of climate-warming gases in the country, so its switch low-emission vehicles would have an immediately positive impact. But to make that switch, we need infrastructure to service those vehicles, just as we have gas stations on seemingly every corner. Midwest Energy News reports on how the federally funded Michigan-to-Montana Alternative Fuel Corridor is demonstrating how that might be achieved. Following I-94, the project accelerated the deployment of charging or fueling stations for battery-electric, compressed natural gas and propane-powered vehicles.
POLITICAL CLIMATE
Drilling the refuge. After a federal judge this week denied a request to halt an impending lease sale, Trump was finally set to accomplish one of his long-held goals: selling off chunks of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to be drilled for oil. But, then, the sale flopped. ""Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation was the only bidder on nine of the tracts offered for lease in the northernmost swath of the refuge ... Half of the offered leases drew no bids at all,"" Alaska Public Media reports.
Senate shift. The Peach State will be represented in the Senate by Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, two Democrats. And with those Georgians come massive environmental implications. In his time as the majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell (RKy.) has been efficient at blocking legislation that could address climate change, but now the chamber will be evenly split with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to become the deciding vote, should votes come to that. Science Magazine writes that the Senate shakeup would impact the environment by making it easier to confirm Biden's nominees (at EPA and Energy, for example), handing the keys to committee leadership posts to several climate-friendly Democrats and leading to environmental legislation actually passing, especially alongside a blue House.
Shady science. Back in the nation's capital, The Washington Post reports that the EPA finalized its so-called ""secret science"" rule, which has detractors concerned that Trump officials are trying to make it harder to use science in governmental decisions. The rule will ""limit what research it can use to craft public health protections, a move opponents argue is aimed at crippling the agency's ability to more aggressively regulate the nation's air and water."" The EPA said it will bring greater transparency to decision-making.
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WATER
Down by the river. These days, roughly 40 million people rely on the Colorado River. Suffice to say, as the river goes, so does much of the West. That's what makes Ian James' latest dispatch for the Arizona Republic so disturbing. In this very deep dive, he examines our relationship with the river, why its future flow is being threatened by climate change and how it could fare in the face of fire, drought and declining snowpack.


The water level's rising. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser and ProPublica partnered for this must-read series on Hawaii's disappearing beaches. In it, they find that sea walls, while protecting individual houses from rising oceans, are causing the sped-up erosion of the state's beaches, which are -- legally speaking -- a public good. Even though officials said they'd stop permitting these walls, they're letting residents and developers exploit loopholes to continue the practice on properties that have at times been lucratively flipped. Saline solution. For The Desert Sun, I'm out with one more look at the Salton Sea, California's enigmatic largest lake that is a sump for agricultural runoff, a public health disaster and a once-cherished vacation destination all wrapped into one. As the state and feds fail to fix the problem of toxic dust emanating from the shrinking body of water's exposed lakebed, some nearby homeowners are taking it upon themselves to try to save their way of life.
AND ANOTHER THING
The battery of things. Desert Sun alumnus Sammy Roth is out with an interesting look in the Los Angeles Times at the future of energy in California, which experienced rolling blackouts in August. Dispersed batteries are being looked at as a way to store energy off the traditional grid. This would allow the use of renewables (like solar) at times when generation is low but demand is high (like when the sun goes down but it's still hot enough for AC). The idea still has kinks to work out, but as Roth writes, ""as California works to build a future without fossil fuels, electricity generation isn't just getting cleaner -- it's getting smaller and nimbler."" Scientists agree that to maintain a livable planet, we need to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration back to 350 ppm. We're above that and rising dangerously.

USA-2021-70.txt,"On 18th birthday, Greta Thunberg says 'we shouldn't be relaxing' on climate change. She wants new headlights for her bike, too.

Elinor Aspegren | USA TODAY
Greta Thunberg had two wishes for her 18th birthday on Sunday.
The first was a ""promise from everyone that they will do everything they can"" for the planet, she said in an exclusive interview with The Sunday Times.
She had another, more tangible gift: Replacement headlights for her bike.
""In Sweden, it gets very dark in the winter,"" she said.
The climate activist, who is from Sweden, also took to Twitter to celebrate her birthday with a jab at climate change conspiracy theorists.
""Thank you so much for all the well-wishes on my 18th birthday!"" she said. ""Tonight you will find me down at the local pub exposing all the dark secrets behind the climate- and school strike conspiracy and my evil handlers who can no longer control me! I am free at last!!""
Other interview highlights:
On celebrities who talk about the climate emergency while flying around the world: ""I don't care. I'm not telling anyone else what to do, but there is a risk when you are vocal about these things and don't practise as you preach, then you will become criticised for that and what you are saying won't be taken seriously."" What's not on her birthday list: New clothes. "" I don't need new clothes. I know people who have clothes, so I would ask them if I could borrow them or if they have something they don't need any more. I don't need to fly to Thailand to be happy. I don't need to buy clothes I don't need, so I don't see it as a sacrifice."" Though the biggest way to slow carbon emissions is to not have children, Thunberg was not about to tell people not to do so. ""I don't think it's selfish to have children,"" she said. ""It is not the people who are the problem, it is our behavior."" Her concern for the environment isn't paralyzing: ""I don't sit and speculate about how the future might turn out, I see no use in doing that,"" she said. ""As long as you are doing everything you can now, you can't let yourself become depressed or anxious.""


The activist, known for her wit, has become a symbol for young people across the world protesting climate change inaction.
Thunberg burst onto the global stage with #FridaysForFuture, an international movement that began in 2018. Thunberg, then 15, started taking weeks off school to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament.
At 16, Thunberg inspired the largest climate strike in history, testified before Congress and addressed the United Nations for the second time.
""People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing ... and all you talk about is money and eternal fairy tales of economic growth. How dare you?"" she said before the UN.
Also in 2019, Time magazine named her as its 2019 Person of the Year for ""sounding the alarm about humanity's predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends background and borders"" and ""for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads.""
She's also gone up against world leaders on frequent occasions: Russian President Vladimir Putin called her ""a kind and very sincere girl"" who doesn't understand the complexities of ""the modern world,"" and Brazil's far-right president Jair Bolsonaro labeled her a ""brat.""
She has most famously clashed with President Donald Trump on multiple occasions.
After Thunberg delivered her emotional speech to world leaders at the UN, news cameras captured her staring at President Donald Trump when he arrived in the same lobby.
Trump tweeted after her speech that Thunberg ""seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future.""
Greta Thunberg won $1.15M. She's donating it all to environmental groups.
Trump also criticized Thunberg after Time's decision to recognize her in 2019.
""So ridiculous. Greta must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill, Greta, Chill!"" he tweeted.
Thunberg copied his exact phrasing in her reply to Trump's November 2020 tweet-storm calling for states to ""stop the count"" in the November election.
She also endorsed President-Elect Joe Biden, who has pledged to return the U.S. to the Paris climate accord.
During the interview with the Times, Thunberg addressed Biden's pledge, cautioning that ""just because of that shift we shouldn't be relaxing and thinking everything is all right now.""

USA-2021-73.txt," I study tornadoes. We need to know more about how they're affected by climate change. eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices//13/tornadoes-kentucky-climate-change-study/6478150001 Significant tornado outbreak outside the typical tornado season raises the question of whether climate change may have played a role. John T. Allen | Opinion contributor Storms on Friday night into Saturday morning produced a tornado outbreak across Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi and Tennessee. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk outlook with potential for significant tornadoes over the region, including expectations of strong and long-track tornadoes. As the event unfolded with many tornado warnings, at least one storm prompted a tornado emergency, a warning reserved for strong tornadoes likely to produce significant damage and fatalities and expected to move into a highly populated area. Though official surveys will likely take weeks, preliminary data identified dozens of tornado reports across the region. Sadly, we already know that there were many fatalities and many more injuries, and in the coming days this toll will grow, particularly from the extremely long-tracked tornado or tornadoes that tracked from near Jonesboro, Arkansas, to Bremen, Kentucky. While we can speculate about the intensity of the tornadoes, or that this might be one of the longer tracks ever recorded, official ratings will take time. Preliminary indications suggest that there could be more than 200 miles of tornado damage to survey from the single storm that struck Mayfield, Kentucky. There are also several other paths being investigated. Was this storm unprecedented? In coming days, meteorologists from National Weather Service offices and damage survey experts will forensically assess each home, structure and other tornado-impacted objects and post-analyze how intense the tornadoes were, how many tornadoes occurred, and their path length and width. Then NWS offices will deliberate over the ratings for the event and release an official statement. This process, however, can begin only once recovery and safeguarding those impacted by this terrible event are complete. The focus, for now, will be on mourning those lost and assisting in the recovery for people affected in the lead-up to the holiday period.   Was this storm and event unprecedented? Historically, tornado outbreaks have occurred on nearly every day of the year ÔøΩ if the conditions are right, any day can produce devastating tornadoes. We know that long-track tornadoes have occurred in the past with path lengths exceeding 100 miles. The longest single-track tornado traveled an extraordinary 219 miles across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana ÔøΩ the ""tri-state"" tornado of March 18, 1925 ÔøΩ and killed 695 people, injuring thousands. We also know that many of what were thought to be single tornadoes in history turned out to be families of tornadoes. Whether the longest tornado track for this event is a record or is discontinuous remains unknown; damage on the ground will reveal what happened. Even if it wasn't just a single tornado, this doesn't diminish the impact of a long-track tornado at night, which we know produce significantly more fatalities. If this tornado were to be rated an EF5 with winds in excess of 200 miles per hour, it would be one of the rare few that have occurred outside of the spring months typically associated with tornado season. December, though, is no stranger to EF5s. On Dec. 18, 1957, Sunfield, Illinois, was destroyed by one. While a rating is sometimes used to ascribe importance to an event, we need to remember that for those impacted, the tornado rating matters little, and people's lives will never be the same for what they have experienced and lost. EF2-EF4 events have produced no shortage of damage, injuries and fatalities. Does climate change play a role? Significant tornado events outside typical tornado season raise the question of whether climate change may have played a role. Event-based attribution for climate change is still in development, particularly for tornadoes that need fine scales to model. Given the historical precedent, it would be misleading to definitively state a relationship to climate change without further assessment. Even so, there are potential signs. Observations suggest an eastward shift in tornado frequency in recent decades and increasing frequency of tornadoes in outbreaks, though the ties to climate change are as yet uncertain. Climate projections for the late 21st century have suggested that the conditions favorable to the development of the severe storms that produce tornadoes will increase over North America, and the impact could be greatest in the winter and fall. New research has also identified that these changes might be more rapid than we thought. Projections suggest increases in severe storm environments in fall and winter of 16% to 25% relative to now, per degrees Celsius of warming. How this will impact tornado frequency or intensity remains uncertain, but even with frequency remaining static, the expansion of built-up areas in the frequently impacted southeastern USA is seeing increasing tornado vulnerability.   There have been no EF5-rated tornadoes since 2013. This year, we are running below the average of 1,368 a year, with 1,230 preliminary tornadoes through Saturday. As recent events demonstrated, it can all change in a single day. John T. Allen is an associate professor of meteorology at Central Michigan University. His expertise is on the impacts of a changing climate on severe thunderstorm phenomena such as hail and tornadoes, and the historical occurrence of severe weather.   "

So-called ""Tornado Alley"" is shifting farther east away from the Kansas-Oklahoma area and into states where Friday‚Äôs killer twisters hit. More strong to severe storms are possible later this week in portions of the South. A devastating tornado outbreak across five states Friday night left dozens of people dead and reduced hundreds of homes to rubble, and some scientists say this may be the harbinger of future tragedies as the planet warms. ""The latest science indicates that we can expect more of these huge (tornado) outbreaks because of human-caused climate change,"" Penn State meteorologist Michael Mann told USA TODAY. Spring-like temperatures across much of the Midwest and South last week helped bring the warm, moist air that formed the thunderstorms that spawned the tornadoes. The warmth was at record-breaking levels, meteorologists said, including in Memphis, Tennessee, which soared to a record high of 80 degrees on Friday, the National Weather Service said. While some of this is due to La Ni√±a ‚Äì a natural climate pattern that usually brings warmer-than-normal winter temperatures across the southern U.S. ‚Äì scientists also expect atypical, warm weather in the winter to become more common due to climate change: Northern Illinois University severe weather researcher Victor Gensini told USA TODAY that these type of events are exactly what climate models say will occur as the climate warms. ""The unusual warmth had a big impact on the tornado outbreak,"" he said. Jennifer Francis, a senior scientist at Woodwell Climate Research Center, told the Guardian that climate change was ‚Äúmaking some of the ingredients needed to create an outbreak like this more likely."" ‚ÄúThe atmosphere has more fuel in it now, both in terms of heat and moisture,"" Francis said. ""The large dip in the jet stream that created the clash between warm, tropical air and cold, Arctic air ‚Äì another necessary ingredient ‚Äì is also more likely to occur in our changed climate.‚Äù  Dan DePodwin, the director of forecast operations for AccuWeather, told USA TODAY that ""because we know the climate‚Äôs warming, there‚Äôs usually the potential for more moisture and more sort of rich moisture to be present at different times of the year than had been the case previously. In order to have an outbreak like this, you need warm, moist air, and in this case it comes from the Gulf of Mexico."" More: Kentucky governor confirms 64 dead after devastating weekend tornadoes: 'Undoubtedly there will be more' Gensini said it's as if the Gulf of Mexico is ""running a fever."" DePodwin added that ""I think the warm December certainly played a role. We haven't had a lot of cold fronts make their way all the way down into the Gulf of Mexico yet so that can sometimes help cool off the sea surface temperatures."" ‚ÄúThe worst-case scenario happened. Warm air in the cold season, middle of the night,‚Äù said John Gordon, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Louisville, Kentucky. In addition, so-called ""Tornado Alley"" is shifting farther east away from the Kansas- Oklahoma area and into states where Friday‚Äôs killer twisters hit. The USA TODAY Network recently talked with scientists and experts and examined years of tornado data to determine that millions of Americans living in the South are now at an even greater risk for tornadoes than those in the Plains. More: 'Tornado Alley' is expanding: Southern states see more twisters now than ever before The latest science also indicates that the combination of these factors is increasing over time, particularly in the winter months in the south-central and southeastern states, Mann said. ""The latest science also indicates a trend toward more intense, destructive tornadoes,"" he said. ""The tornado that hit Mayfield, Kentucky, was at the upper end of the scale, with radar-measured winds that neared 300 mph."" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that 64 deaths were confirmed in his state alone and that ""undoubtedly there will be more."" He said the victims ranged in age from 5 months to 83 years. ""This was a very large outbreak,"" Mann said. One of the twisters ‚Äì if it is confirmed to have been just one ‚Äì likely broke a nearly 100- year-old record for how long a tornado stayed on the ground in a path of destruction, experts said. The previous record for a long-track tornado was from 1925, when the F-5 Tri-State Tornado traveled 219 miles through Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according to the Conversation, an online news agency. The ‚ÄúQuad-State Tornado,‚Äù as this tornado has been nicknamed, is expected to break that record.

More climate coverage: A perfect storm of raw sewage and rainfall hits cities that can least afford it Deadly mudslides:Slides threaten more Americans as heavy rains loom over scorched lands As of October of this year, the U.S. has experienced 18 weather and climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each. These events have included one drought, two floods, nine severe storms, four tropical cyclones, one wildfire and one winter storm, according to the NationalClimate Data Center. When it comes to tenants' rights in the face of natural disasters, such as floods, storms, earthquakes, or wildfire, there is not much protection beyond getting the security deposit back and the ability to break the lease if the dwelling is deemed uninhabitable, say experts. In a 2018 study, sociologists Junia Howell and James Elliott found that most postdisaster recovery efforts are geared toward property owners which exacerbates wealth inequality. For instance, the National Flood Insurance Program insures 5 million policyholders claiming more than $1 trillion in coverage on properties that would otherwise go mostly uninsured, the authors say.   While property owners may gain access to low-interest loans through public disaster recovery efforts and receive insurance payouts, renters are often forced to make expensive moves to higher-priced apartments. 'The children were exhausted and emotional' That was the case with Catalano, who was paying $1,600 for a two-bedroom apartment she shared with her children and two dogs. She first had to leave her building when a report deemed its foundation unsafe and cautioned it could result in ""possible loss of life."" ""It was late night when they knocked at our door. I took my children's clothes and book bags for school. I took dog food, and the children's lunchboxes,"" says Catalano, a single mother of two young girls. ""I had four bags with me. The children were exhausted and emotional."" Later,the displaced tenants were told by the landlord's lawyer that the building will be demolished. Theyhad until Dec. 1 to collect any of their remaining belongings. Tips: The hot housing market isn't cooling down. Here what potential buyers can do By the beginning of November, less than one month after the evacuation, the town had spent more than $200,000 putting up the tenants in local hotels, Joseph Fagan, a spokesperson for the township told USA TODAY. ""That's a conservative estimate,"" he says. On Nov. 8, West Orange Mayor Robert Parisi wrote in a letter to the displaced tenants that the township, ""having limited resources,"" cannot provide hotel assistance beyond Dec. 4. Catalano says finding a new home has been a struggle. Catalano, who has lived in hercomplex for more than 26 years, says every apartment she's seen in town so far that would allow pets is between $2,300 and $2,600 a month. She says she doesn't want to move away from the town and look for new schools in the middle of the school year. ""My younger daughter has special needs and she loves her current school,"" she says. ""This is the first time she's had in-person classes five days a week in a long time."" Inflation and child care: Families struggle to cope amid surging child care costs   Housing: Demand for a single-family rental is 'through the roof': And Wall Street is on alert Flood disclosure laws vary Leslie Chapman-Henderson, CEO of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, an advocacy group that works to strengthen homes against natural and humanmade disasters, points to another area where renters are at a disadvantage. ""We are not aware of any state-level renter flood disclosure requirement,"" she says. ""But there are a growing number of states that require homebuyer disclosures."" Even when it comes to homebuyers, flood disclosure laws vary from state to state. Climate change worsens atmospheric rivers The Northwest has been repeatedly hit by rainstorms this fall, causing major flooding and damage. The deluges are from atmospheric rivers, or huge plumes of moisture extending from over the Pacific. Climate change is intensifying such storms. (Nov. 30) Only 29 states have regulatory requirements that a seller disclose a property's history of flood damages to a buyer, according to the Flood Disclosure Scorecard put out by the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""The disclosures are accelerating because of a variety of factors, beginning with the availability of data and additionally, the increasing awareness of climate risks like sea-level rise, increased rainfall, rapidly intensifying hurricanes,"" says Chapman-Henderson. A standard renters' insurance policy typically doesn't cover flood damage. While a landlord may have flood insurance to cover the building, their insurance will not cover a tenant's personal belongings. Renters can buy a policy from the National Flood Insurance Program to cover their personal belongings up to $100,000, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Catalano's case, even though she had a renter's insurance policy, it did not cover her hotel stay as her apartment itself was not damaged, she says. Catalano and other tenants received their security deposit, rent for October and an additional $1,250 for relocation costs from the landlord.   Steven Eisenstein, the lawyer representing the landlord, did not return calls seeking comment on whether their insurance could cover the tenant's hotel stays. Landlord/tenant rules are a mixed bag Just like flood disclosure requirements, landlord-tenant laws vary widely across the country. When asked why the township had taken up the responsibility of paying the hotel bills with taxpayer dollars and why the landlord's insurance company was not required to foot part of the bill, Fagan said he couldn't speak for the landlord. ""This was a life-changing event for our residents. The township of West Orange likely exceeded its responsibility to the residents in doing so (providing hotel accommodation to residents),"" he says. ""When it started out, the immediate concern was to find housing for the residents in the local hotels."" Initially, the cost of the hotel stays was being paid out of the Mayor's Sunshine Fund, a charitable fund made up of private donations. But that fund was quickly exhausted. Within less than a month, the town had spent $200,000 from its budget. ""This is only my opinion,"" says Fagan. ""I think that the township residents, as much as they want to be charitable and helping their fellow residents that ... cannot go on indefinitely, in terms of the taxpayers' funding."" The township is helping tenants apply for assistance from FEMA, he said. Extreme rain: How a summer of extreme weather reveals a stunning shift in the way rain falls in America. Thirty of the tenants, including Catalano, meanwhile, have hired a pair of lawyers to investigate the cause of the rockslide and are considering a possible lawsuit against the town, the landlord and a private school, Seton Hall Prep. The school, whose athletic turf fields are perched above the complex, was completed in 2017 after chopping down 1,000 trees, which could have increased the flow of stormwater runoff to the complex, says Thomas Cataldo, a lawyer for the tenants. Catalano is hoping the town will extend her hotel stay until Dec.18, when she can move into a relative's apartment. The town, on Thursday, agreed to let her stay until Tuesday.   ""I appreciate what the town has done for us,"" says Catalano. ""It's very hard with the holiday season. We would have a Christmas tree up by now. I would be shopping for Christmas presents. I haven't done any of that. I don't sleep at night because everything's on my mind, you know. I worry because I have two kids to think about."" Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is the housing and economy reporter for USA TODAY. Follow her on Twitter @SwapnaVenugopal   "
USA-2021-76.txt,"The Arctic will soon see more rain than snow. Scientists say it may speed up global warming. eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//01/arctic-more-rain-than-snow-study/8823011002 Jordan Mendoza | USA TODAY Earlier in August, it rained on the summit of Greenland's ice sheet for the first time in recorded history, and new research suggests that it not only will become a normal occurrence, but it will happen much sooner than previously thought. The majority of Greenland is considered part of the Arctic region, along with some of northern Alaska, Canada and Russia. Known for its frigid temperatures, which average -40 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, it snows quite often. The Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in northern Alaska records snow at least eight months of the year, and it has snowed at least once in each month of the year in recorded history. But research published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday shows much of the region will, on average, experience more rain than snow in the future. The team of international researchers had previously concluded the region would eventually see more rain, but originally thought it wouldn't start until around 2090. The new analysis on the region determined the rain would dominate the region as early as 2050 in some areas. The reason for more rain is melting ice. When sea ice melts or breaks away, the open ocean water mixed with rising global temperatures results in more water evaporation, which then leads to rain falling. When Greenland's summit experienced rain earlier this year, temperatures were above freezing for over nine hours, the third time since 2012 it had happened. ""The take-home message from this is really that changes are likely to occur much more rapidly and earlier than previously projected, which of course will mean that the subsequent impacts of this will also occur earlier,"" Michelle McCrystall, lead researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, told USA TODAY. Greenland's ice sheet is roughly 656,000-square-miles big, and if it were to completely melt, NASA says the global sea level would rise about 23 feet and Earth's rotation would slow down enough to make the length of a day two milliseconds longer. A recent study showed that ice sheet melting would raise sea levels nearly a foot higher by the end of the century.

Mark Serreze, co-author of the study and director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in a statement local wildlife and humans may not be able to adapt to the rapid changes. But McCrystall points out that this will also affect the rest of the world. ""With more rain and less snow, this can also result in more permafrost melting, which could result in an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,"" McCrystall said. ""It can be released in to the atmosphere and therefore cause an increase in greenhouse gases and thus further global warming."" In August, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released their ""code red for humanity"" report on climate change, and noted Earth would see global temperatures rise 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. McCrystall and her team said if the planet can keep global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius, then the changes can be prevented. But if this things persist, it can result in very severe global consequences. ""More urgent action is required to limit this as much as possible,"" McCrystall said.

USA-2021-77.txt," Meet Biden's 'climate cabinet': A who's who of 9 senior officials tackling climate change eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics//30/biden-climate-team/6250064001 Matthew Brown | USA TODAY Correction: A previous version of this article misstated the historic nature of EPA administrator Michael Regan's position. Lisa Jackson was the EPA√ïs first African American administrator from 2009 to 2013, Regan is the second. WASHINGTON √ê As congressional Democrats prepare to send the party's sweeping social care and climate plan to President Joe Biden's desk, the administration is marshaling itself to execute key environmental goals. Biden consistently stresses that climate change is one of his top priorities and part of his presidential mandate. Officials focusing on climate permeate the administration, including Cabinet secretaries and senior advisers who transcend traditional hierarchies. The administration's climate ambitions have been praised by environmental groups, though climate activists remain skeptical that proposed regulations and laws will be enough to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. ""It is a 180-degree change to be working with an administration that has made climate, environmental justice and people's health top priorities,"" said Abigail Dillen, the president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit group that litigates environmental cases. Dillen praised Biden's appointments for their experiences on climate issues from the Cabinet level to throughout the administration. Environmental groups, however, also had concerns. In several cases, the Biden administration has continued litigating policy rollbacks initiated during the presidency of Donald Trump, when environmental policies were cut back significantly. ""It is hard to recover from the damage that was done to the agencies that are charged with protecting us,"" Dillen said, adding that ""political will and resources too often run short in government"" when it comes to environmental issues. In most areas, however, the administration's swift policy reversals have earned praise. As Democrats hope to enact $550 billion in funding for climate transition in their upcoming reconciliation package, environmental groups are optimistic the administration will not only reverse Trump-era policy but advance the climate movement's goals.  ""It's not just a matter of undoing the actions of the Trump administration,"" Dillen said. ""It's investing in affirmative reform,"" across all federal agencies. ""Yeah, that's a big job, but it's the premise the president ran and won on."" Biden has sought to link his climate agenda to broader themes of his presidency, including jobs and infrastructure, social justice and economic mobility and democracy promotion. ""We√ïll demonstrate to the world the United States is not only back at the table but hopefully leading by the power of our example,"" Biden told world leaders during the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, earlier this month. More: Biden announces rule to limit methane leaks, targeting oil and gas industry at COP26 climate summit ""I know it hasn√ït been the case, and that√ïs why my administration is working overtime to show that our climate commitment is action, not words,"" he continued. Accompanying Biden to the Nov. 1 conference were 13 senior administration officials, each of whom will be tasked with implementing parts of the president's climate goals. Yet even in an administration taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling climate change, there are standout leaders and liaisons influencing Biden's agenda. Here are some of the top officials building Biden's climate program: John Kerry Kerry serves as Biden's special envoy for climate issues. A former U.S. senator, secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee, Kerry has said his role as special envoy is a capstone to his career. His office works closely with the State Department and the national security community to negotiate with other countries on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Kerry has visited at least 15 countries, including China, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Kerry plays at times a difficult balancing act in negotiations with his counterparts in China and other key nations as he strives to represent the Biden administration while not undermining other diplomatic channels, like formal connections through the State Department. Civilian Climate Corps.: Biden's Build Back Better bill would give young people jobs to fight climate change. What would a new CCC look like? Gina McCarthy McCarthy, a former director of the Environmental Protection Agency, serves in a new White House post as national climate adviser, a nod to the centrality of climate in Biden's policymaking. The role is the domestic counterpart to Kerry's foreign policy role.  McCarthy's broad mandate touches issues of economics, environmental protection and national security among other issues, making her White House office a key nerve center in the administration for climate policy. So far, McCarthy has been a force in crafting Biden's preferred climate policies and negotiating them through Congress. Her team also includes veterans of the climate movement like Sonia Aggarwal, who cofounded the think tank Energy Innovation, and Maggie Thomas, who served as political director for Evergreen Action, a climate advocacy group. More: The US spy community issues its first-ever National Intelligence Estimate on climate change √ê and it's not pretty Michael Regan Regan is the second Black head of the EPA who comes to the agency after a lauded term as the top administrator for North Carolina's environmental agency. He earned a reputation as an advocate for environmental justice and public health in that role after helping minority communities affected by toxic spills and improving water quality across the state. He has said a goal of his tenure is to craft environmental rules that will withstand court challenges or attempted rollbacks by future administrations. √íWe have some lessons learned from past attempts,√ì Regan told the Washington Post. √íWe have looked very closely at what has worked and what the courts would not accept.√ì Much of Regan's term at the EPA has been spent reforming the agency after it was cut down under the Trump administration. He has, however, expressed greater ambitions for environmental regulations, especially on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. Climate spending included: What's in the House-passed Build Back Better bill? Paid leave, universal pre-K and more Deb Haaland A former advocate for the Green New Deal, Haaland is arguably the most progressive member of Biden's Cabinet. She is the first Native American to oversee the Interior Department, an agency with a violent history of suppressing Native communities. Haaland has played an integral role in outlining the administration's plans on clean energy, public lands usage and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Under her leadership, Interior has fast-tracked the construction of wind turbines around the country and pushed to raise the costs of drilling oil wells on federal lands, citing the future cost of climate change.  Jennifer Granholm As Energy Department secretary, Granholm has turned the agency into a nerve center for climate policy. The department has released goals to rapidly increase the nation's solar energy output and outlined clean energy targets on her watch. At the U.N. Climate Summit, Granholm outlined a plan to invest in technologies to remove carbon from the atmosphere as a solution to climate change. The move is part of the administration's Energy Earthshots Initiative, which will fund new technologies to solve major climate issues. The department, however, has also been faced with stabilizing energy prices. In November, Biden ordered the department to release 50 million barrels of oil from the country's emergency reserve. ""Our administration is deeply committed to tackling this existential threat by transitioning to clean energy while, at the same time, making sure that every American has access to affordable energy,"" Granholm said during a November White House press briefing. Pete Buttigieg Buttigieg has been a major surrogate for the administration, where he often highlights the White House's work on climate within its goals on infrastructure and transportation. His team at the Department of Transportation includes Christopher Coes, the deputy assistant secretary, who worked for Smart Growth America, which lobbies for sustainable neighborhoods. He's also authored research examining the effect of climate change on American housing. Buttigieg will soon oversee the largest amount of infrastructure spending the department has ever managed. The secretary has repeatedly contended that the funding will be distributed with an array of climate and environmental issues in mind. Brenda Mallory Mallory serves as the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, which coordinates environmental policy between federal agencies. Since Biden took office, the council has worked to undo the Trump administration's role in the National Environmental Policy Act. The law, which remained largely unchanged for the first 50 years of its existence, was winnowed down under the Trump administration's environmental policies. Biden has sought to restore those powers, with Mallory being a key official in executing on that wish.  A top environmental lawyer, Mallory is the former CEO of the Southern Environmental Law Center and the first African American to hold the White House position. Her mandate also requires her to increase public awareness around environmental regulation and issues affecting their communities, like the risks posed by pollution. Brian Deese Deese is the director of the National Economic Council, the White House's center for economic policymaking. Deese, who served in the Obama administration, spent much of his time out of the White House researching the intersection of climate change and economic issues. He now brings that focus and concern to his role as Biden's chief economic adviser. ""The United States must integrate climate risks throughout all relevant aspects of the economy and financial system. And, in doing so, it must meet the moral and economic imperative to rectify decades of disproportionate environmental damage imposed on historically disadvantaged neighborhoods,"" Deese co-wrote in an October climate report with McCarthy, the domestic climate adviser. Deese touches all aspects of White House economic policy and has said that climate is central to the crafting of the administration's domestic agenda, including on infrastructure and economic regulation. Sally Benson Appointed in November, Benson will oversee climate policy from inside the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy. A Stanford University professor, Benson is well known for her work on technologies to recapture carbon from the environment, research she will work to implement from her post in the West Wing. Benson will work closely with McCarthy, the domestic climate adviser, in her post. Follow Matthew Brown online @mrbrownsir."
USA-2021-78.txt," Climate negotiators strike a deal with coal compromise eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//13/climate-consensus-appears-near-india-objects-coalplans/ 8604462002 Frank Jordans and Seth Borenstein | Associated Press GLASGOW, Scotland √ê Government negotiators from nearly 200 countries have adopted a new deal on climate action after a last-minute intervention by India to water down the language on cutting emissions from coal. Several countries including small island states said they were deeply disappointed by the move to √íphase down,√ì rather than √íphase out√ì coal power, the single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Other nations described the revision as odious and against the rules, but said it was something they had to accept to bring the two weeks of U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, to a close. Before India succeeded in getting the change made, nation after nation talked about the final provisions not going far or fast enough but a compromise was better than nothing and provided progress, if not success. Negotiators say the agreement is aimed at keeping alive the overarching goal of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit since pre-industrial times. The world has already warmed 2 degrees Fahrenheit. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP√ïs earlier story follows below. GLASGOW, Scotland √ê Almost 200 nations were poised Saturday to adopt a compromise on how to curb climate change and to keep a key global warming target alive after 15 days of contentious climate talks. A rich-poor divide widened at the U.N. summit in Glasgow, Scotland, in recent days, with developing nations complaining about not being heard. But when the representative from Guinea, speaking for 77 poorer nations and China, said his group could live with the general results, negotiators applauded. The Chinese delegation also said it was fine with the positions that would come out of a Glasgow in a final conference agreement. But Indian Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav potentially threw a wrench when he argued against a provision on phasing out coalfired power plans, saying that developing countries were √íentitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels.√ì  Yadav said that there was no consensus on key issues and blamed √íunsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns√ì in rich countries for causing global warming. It was unclear whether India would try to stop a potential deal. A frustrated European Union Vice President Frans Timmermans, the 27-nation EU√ïs climate envoy, begged negotiators to be united for future generations. √íFor heaven√ïs sake, don√ït kill this moment,√ì Timmermans pleaded. √íPlease embrace this text so that we bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren.√ì Small island nations that are some of the most vulnerable to catastrophic effects of climate change and had pushed for bolder actions said they were satisfied with the spirit of compromise. √íGlasgow has developed a strong message of hope, a strong message of ambition,√ì Seve Paeniu, finance minister for the South Pacific island nation Tuvalu, said. √íWhat is left for us to deliver.√ì Earlier Saturday, the negotiators in Glasgow pored over fresh proposals for sealing a deal that they hoped could be credibly said to advance worldwide efforts to tackle global warming. More: Biden and China's Xi Jinping to meet at virtual summit Monday to discuss tensions The last-minute huddles focused on a potential loss-and-damage fund for poor nations hurt by climate change and forest credits in a carbon-trading market. √íI hope we can have some resolutions before formally starting this plenary,√ì conference president Alok Sharma, an official from host nation Britain, told negotiators. √íCollectively this is a package that really moves things forward for everyone.√ì Until late Saturday afternoon, divisions remained on the issue of financial support sought by poor countries for the disastrous impacts of climate change they will increasingly suffer in the future. The United States and the European Union, two of the world√ïs biggest historic emitters of greenhouse gases, continued to have deep reservations about the socalled √íloss and damage√ì provisions. Mohammed Quamrul Chowdhury of Bangladesh, a lead negotiator for less-developed countries, ticked off the ways that vague wording in a Saturday morning draft fell short of committing wealthier countries to putting new money on the table for countries struggling with climate damage. √íThere is a lot of frustration,√ì he told AP. Another issue that caused problems Saturday had confounded negotiators for six years: setting up carbon-trading markets. The idea is to trade credits for reducing carbon like other commodities, unleashing the power of markets, with poorer nations getting money, often from private companies, for measures that reduce carbon in the air.  One huge issue has been rich nations want to make sure that poor nations that sell their credits for making carbon reductions, which include carbon-sucking forests, don√ït include the same settings as reductions in their national emissions, called double counting. Biden at COP26 climate change summit: 'None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come' Saturday√ïs draft provided √ístrong√ì provisions to prevent double counting of offsets, but new issues involving forests reemerged later in the day, according to Environmental Defense Fund Vice President Kelly Kizzier, a former European Union negotiator and expert on carbon market negotiations. Before the areas of disagreement between rich and poor nations demanded urgent attention, coal had garnered more consideration. A proposal for the overarching decision retains contentious language calling on countries to accelerate √íefforts towards the phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.√ì But in a new addition, the text says nations will recognize √íthe need for support towards a just transition√ì √ë a reference to calls from those working in the fossil fuel industry for financial support as they wind down jobs and businesses. Some advocacy groups said early Saturday proposals were not strong enough. √íHere in Glasgow, the world√ïs poorest countries are in danger of being lost from view, but the next few hours can and must change the course we are on,√ì Oxfam senior policy adviser Tracy Carty said. √íWhat√ïs on the table is still not good enough.√ì But the possibility of having fossil fuels explicitly mentioned for the first time in a decision coming out of the U.N.√ïs annual Conference of the Parties meeting, or COP, was wellreceived by some environmentalists. √íIt√ïs weaker and compromised, but we see it as a bridgehead, a bit of a breakthrough,√ì Greenpeace Executive Director Jennifer Morgan said. √íWe will have to fight like hell to keep it in there and have it strengthened in the coming hours,√ì Morgan said, adding that there were √ía clutch of countries really seeking to strike that line from the deal.√ì What is COP26?: Your quick guide to United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow In another proposal, countries are √íencouraged√ì to submit new targets for emissions reduction for 2035 by 2025, and for 2040 by 2030, establishing a five-year cycle. Previously, developing countries were expected to do so only every 10 years. Developed countries are also being asked to submit a short-term update next year.  The proposed agreement states that in order to achieve the 2015 Paris accord√ïs ambitious goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial times, countries will need to make √írapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in other greenhouse gases.√ì Scientists say the world is not on track to meet that goal yet, but various pledges made before and during the two-week talks, which are now in overtime, have brought them closer. The latest draft agreement expresses √íalarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1C (2F) of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region.√ì Next year√ïs talks are scheduled to take place in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el- Sheikh. Dubai will host the meeting in 2023. Anniruddha Ghosal and Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this report."
USA-2021-79.txt," COP26 climate deal boosts global emissions pledges but falls short on 1.5 degrees Celsius target eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//13/cop-26-global-climate-deal-reached-not-enough-limit-1-5-degreescelsius/ 6366997001 Kim Hjelmgaard | USA TODAY Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, on Saturday struck a global climate deal aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and averting catastrophic global warming, but the pledges won't be enough to limit a planetary temperature rise to a key 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold. The COP26 text builds on greenhouse-gas reduction targets established in Paris six years ago by requesting countries, by the end of 2022, revisit and strengthen goals for cutting carbon emissions in line with an ambition to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and ideally 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030, according to the document. Negotiators called for ""clean energy power"" to be ""rapidly scaled up"" and the ""phase down"" of coal power and ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies to be accelerated. There was also a commitment by participating countries to boost climate-related finance and support to help poorer countries that bear the brunt of intensifying extreme weather events and public health impacts related to greenhouse-gas emissions. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said the text of the agreement ""raises ambitions"" and ""we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good."" But experts and climate campaigners said the agreement leaves many issues unresolved and that many earlier proposals were watered down for the final text. Just minutes before the summit reached its conclusion, China and India insisted on weakening a coal clause to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out."" ""The (agreement) out of Glasgow shows the oily imprints of fossil fuel influence,"" said Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity nonprofit organization. ""In a major blow to the credibility of these talks, the final language throws a lifeline to climate-killing fossil fuels through carbon capture technologies and continued subsidies to oil, gas and coal. We need more than weak gestures towards 'lowemission' energy. To have any hope of preserving a livable planet, we need to ignite a zero-emission revolution now. We√ïre waiting for world leaders, especially President Biden, to break this destructive pattern and finally put people over fossil fuels."" U.N. Secretary General Ant¬ónio Guterres said the deal did not go far enough and the world must ""go into emergency mode.""  According to Climate Action Tracker, which monitors climate policy action, the vast majority of countries around the world do not have climate measures in place that will meet the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. Scientists say the target can only be met if global emissions are reduced by about 45% by 2030 √ê relative to the 2010 emissions level √ê and cut to zero by 2050. The pledges and targets announced in Glasgow require countries, through domestic legislation, to self-police their goals. Congress has approved a Biden administration plan to invest in tackling climate change as part of $1 trillion infrastructure improvement measures. U.S. infrastructure spending: Charts show where billions of dollars would go A number of separate new pledges were made by governments over the two weeks in Glasgow including measures to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030, promises to halt deforestation and announcements by some countries √ê though not the U.S. or China √ê to shift away from domestic coal production. Dozens of financial corporations agreed to back renewable energy schemes and halt investments in fossil fuels. Perhaps most notable of all, there was a surprise declaration from the U.S. and China, the world's two top greenhouse-gas polluters, who agreed despite their many other recent stark policy differences from economics to human rights to work together to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate impacts. The joint statement was ultimately light on detail but Kerry said the deal is ""a step in the right direction, a mark of progress and a solid foundation for continued cooperation in climate between our two countries."" China faced criticism for not sending its leader, Xi Jinping, to the COP26 summit in Scotland. In his closing news conference following a two-day stop at the summit, Biden said Xi's decision to skip the conference was ""a big mistake."" MoreBiden at COP26 climate change summit: 'None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come' Climate Action Tracker calculates the planet is on track to warm 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100, a temperature that would lead to ever-increasing dangerous climate-related events such as floods, heatwaves, rising sea levels, drought and animal species extinction. Human activities have caused around 1.1 degrees Celsius of global warming to date. Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels will protect the planet from the most serious climate change impacts, scientists say, such as catastrophic wildfires and island nations being completely submerged. Marcene Mitchell of the World Wildlife Fund environmental organization said U.S. climate negotiators in Scotland ""returned the U.S. to its traditional role of global climate leader, but it's clear that we have a lot of lost time to make up for. The work done in Glasgow has been important but does not meet the moment. We are returning to the invigorated and with a clear vision of the hard work ahead.""  COP26 takeaways Two hundred countries were asked to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions in half by 2030, and to zero by 2050. If that happens, there is a chance the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal can be met. As it stands, current pledges are not enough to reach that target, according to Climate Action Tracker, which monitors government action on climate. Current pledges would see warming of above 2 degrees Celsius. Chinese President Xi Jinping did not attend the climate summit, but Beijing and Washington surprised participants by agreeing to work together on combatting climate change despite the countries' host of policy and national security differences. The inclusion of language addressing the need to ultimately end the use of coal and other fossil fuels was not as robust some participants had hoped, but it still marks the first time such references were made in a U.N. climate summit. China and India requested changes to the text, substituting ""phase down"" for ""phase out."""
USA-2021-80.txt,"Residents in Wales coastal village dubbed the UK's first 'climate refugees' eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//11/frustration-defiance-village-abandoned-sea/6384462001 Associated Press | SYLVIA HUI FAIRBOURNE, Wales -- Like many others who came to Fairbourne, Stuart Eves decided the coastal village in northern Wales would be home for life when he moved here 26 years ago. He fell in love with the peaceful, slow pace of small village life in this community of about 700 residents nestled between the rugged mountains and the Irish Sea. ""I wanted somewhere my children can have the same upbringing as I had, so they can run free,"" said Eves, 72, who built a caravan park in the village that he still runs with his son. ""You've got the sea, you've got the mountains. It's just a stunning place to live."" A sinking nation asks for help: This nation is 'sinking' because of climate change. Residents are pleading for help. Update on climate change crisis: U.N. COP26 Summit focuses global attention on climate change crisis That changed suddenly in 2014, when authorities identified Fairbourne as the first coastal community in the U.K. to be at high risk of flooding due to climate change. Predicting faster sea level rises and more frequent and extreme storms due to global warming, the government said it could only afford to keep defending the village for another 40 years. Officials said that by 2054, it would no longer by safe or sustainable to live in Fairbourne. Authorities therefore have been working with villagers on the process of so-called ""managed realignment"" -- essentially, to move them away and abandon the village to the encroaching sea. Overnight, house prices in Fairbourne nosedived. Residents were dubbed the U.K.'s first ""climate refugees."" Many were left shocked and angry by national headlines declaring their whole village would be ""decommissioned."" Seven years on, most of their questions about their future remain unanswered. ""They've doomed the village, and now they've got to try to rehome the people. That's 450 houses,"" said Eves, who serves as chair of the local community council. ""If they want us out by 2054, then they've got to have the accommodation to put us in."" No one here wants to leave. While many are retirees, there are also young families raising a next generation. Locals speak proudly of their tight-knit community. And although the village center only consists of a grocer's, a fish and chip shop and a couple of restaurants,   residents say the pebbly beach and a small steam train draw bustling crowds in the summer. Natural Resources Wales, the government-sponsored organization responsible for the sea defenses in Fairbourne, said the village is particularly vulnerable because it faces multiple flooding risks. Built in the 1850s on a low-lying saltmarsh, Fairbourne already lies beneath sea level at high spring tide. During storms, the tidal level is more than 1.5 meters (5 feet) above the level of the village. Scientists say U.K. sea levels have risen about 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the past century. Depending on greenhouse gas emissions and actions that governments take, the predicted rise is 70 centimeters to 1 meter by 2100. Fairbourne is also at the mouth of an estuary, with additional risks of flash floods from the river running behind it. Officials have spent millions of pounds in strengthening a sea wall and almost 2 miles of tidal defenses. While there are flood risks in many other villages along the Welsh coast, decisions on which areas to protect ultimately boil down to cost. Officials say that in the case of Fairbourne, the cost of maintaining flood defenses will become higher than ""the value of what we're protecting."" The effects of climate change that negotiators at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, are working to mitigate already are a reality here. Catrin Wager, a cabinet member of Gwynedd Council, the local authority overseeing Fairbourne, stressed that while Fairbourne may be the first Welsh coastal village to be designated unviable due to climate change, it certainly won't be the only one. There's no precedent for how to develop policies for helping the villagers adapt, she said. ""We need more answers from the Welsh and U.K. governments, that's my message going into this (U.N. summit),"" Wager said. ""We really need to get some guidance on not only mitigating the effects of climate change, but about how we adapt for things that are already happening."" Across the U.K., half a million properties are at risk of coastal flooding -- and that risk figure will jump to 1.5 million by the end of the 2080s, according to the Climate Change Committee, an independent advisory body set up under climate change laws. Britain's government, which is hosting the U.N. climate summit, needs to be much more upfront about such risks, said Richard Dawson, a member of the committee and professor of engineering at Newcastle University. Ultimately, ""difficult decisions"" need to be made about many coastal settlements with disproportionately high numbers of older and poorer residents, he said, and officials need to prepare people for moving inland.   ""Whatever happens at COP the sea level will continue to rise around the U.K., that's something we absolutely need to prepare for,"" Dawson said. ""We have to be realistic. We can't afford to protect everywhere. The challenge for government is that the problem is not being confronted with the urgency or openness that we need."" In Fairbourne, a continuing standoff between villagers and officials underlines that challenge. Residents feel they have been unfairly singled out and aren't convinced there is a clear timeframe on how quickly sea levels will rise enough to threaten their homes. When and how will evacuation take place? Will they be compensated, and if so how much should it be? There are no answers. The village vicar, Ruth Hansford, said many residents suffered ""emotional fatigue"" from years of uncertainty and negativity. Others simply decided to carry on with their lives. Becky Offland and her husband recently took on the lease of the Glan Y Mor Hotel, going against the grain and investing in the village's future. They're hopeful their business will bring more visitors and financial support to Fairbourne. ""It's like a big family, this place. It's not a village, it's a family,"" said Offland, 36. ""We'll all fight to keep it where it is."" Down the street, Fairbourne Chippy owner Alan Jones, 64, also said he has no plans to go anywhere. ""Until water actually comes in here, 'til we physically can't work, we'll carry on,"" he said. Eves said he and his son believe that ""what will be, will be."" But he will mourn the inevitable disintegration of the village he loves. ""You can't sort of take this village here, and put it over there and expect it to work again,"" he said. ""What you have here is a human catastrophe, albeit on a small scale.""   "

Residents are pleading for help. eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//10/tuvalu-officials-cop-26-speech-draws-attention-rising-sealevels/6368454001 Christine Fernando | USA TODAY Standing at a lectern dressed in a suit and tie, the foreign minister of a small Pacific island nation called on the United Nations for urgent action against climate change. Then the camera zoomed out, and revealed he was actually standing knee-deep in the sea. Simon Kofe recorded the now viral speech to the UN COP26 climate summit to raise awareness about how rising sea levels have affected the country of Tuvalu and its nine islands that Kofe said are ""sinking."" In the speech Tuesday, Kofe pleaded for ""bold, alternative action"" against climate change on behalf of the 11,600 citizens of Tuvalu. ""In Tuvalu, we are living the realities of climate change and sea level rise,"" he said. ""... We cannot wait for speeches when the sea is rising around us all the time."" The islands of Tuvalu are sacred to its residents, he said. ""They were the home of our ancestors,"" he said. ""They are the home of our people today, and we want them to remain the home of our people into the future."" US grapples with environmental justice: Urgency pervades COP26 climate change summit Tuvalu may be among the Pacific island nations that are uninhabitable by 2030, forcing many to move to locations less vulnerable to sea level rise, according to a 2012 paper from the United Nations Development Programme. Tuvalu rarely exceeds 3 meters above mean sea level, making it the world's second lowestlying country, according to the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Australia in 2019 pledged $500 million ""to strengthen climate change and disaster resilience in the Pacific."" Five low-lying islands of the Solomon Island archipelago in the western South Pacific Ocean have already been submerged, the Diplomat reported. The Pacific islands are susceptible to other issues that are exacerbated by climate change, including drought, heat waves, coastal erosion and increasing acidity of ocean water, according to the Australian department's website.   Kofe raised concerns in his speech about this climate mobility, which refers to the forced displacement and movement of people as a result of climate change. About 76% of respondents in Tuvalu said they would migrate if sea level rise becomes more serious, according to a United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific project conducted from 2013 to 2016. But only 53% of respondents said they would be able to afford the moving process. NASA: Climate change expected to impact the world's wheat and corn crops by 2030 Kofe told Reuters that Tuvalu is considering legal ways to maintain its statehood recognition and ownership of maritime zones even if the islands are completely submerged and its people displaced. ""We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged,"" he said. Kofe added that while many will leave Tuvalu, some older residents say they are happy to go down with the land, noting the ""close tie"" people have to their land. Before Kofe's speech was broadcast at the UN climate summit, the Tuvalu Department of Trade tweeted on Sunday that they had taken an ""innovative approach"" to help its message stand out. And it worked. Images and clips of Kofe's speech have been shared widely on social media, launching Tuvalu's struggle against rising sea levels into the global spotlight. Kofe told Reuters that they didn't expect it to be so popular. ""Hopefully that carries the message and emphasizes the challenges that we are facing in Tuvalu at the moment,"" he said.

USA-2021-82.txt," Obama hits Russia, China for 'lack of urgency' on climate at COP26 eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//08/barack-obama-cop-26-china-russia-climate-lackurgency/ 6339621001 Ellen Knickmeyer, Aniruddha Ghosal and Seth Borenstein | Associated Press GLASGOW, Scotland √ë Barack Obama expressed confidence at UN climate talks Monday that the Biden administration will ultimately get its $555 billion climate package through Congress, and faulted U.S. rivals China and Russia for what he called a ""dangerous lack of urgency"" in cutting their own climate-wrecking emissions. ""When it comes to climate, time really is running out,"" Obama told climate advocates. Though there has been progress since the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement, ""we are nowhere near where we need to be."" His comments came as conference leaders acknowledged Monday that many key sticking points exist after a week of talks. A trust gap between rich and poor nations on climate change issues emerged when the negotiations went through a check of what's been accomplished and what's left to be done. Developing countries used versions of the word ""disappointing"" five times when leaders talked Monday about the progress to date. More: Biden announces rule to limit methane leaks, targeting oil and gas industry at COP26 climate summit The U.N. climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, is the former American president's first since he helped deliver the triumph of the 2015 Paris climate accord, when nations committed to cutting fossil fuel and agricultural emissions fast enough to keep the Earth's warming below catastrophic levels of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That celebration has faded and been replaced by worry. Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord. President Joe Biden put America back in the climate deal as soon as he took office this year, but the Trump move set back U.S. efforts at fighting climate change for years. ""1.5 C is on life support now, it's in ICU,"" said Alden Meyer, a longtime observer of climate talks with E3G, an environmental think tank. Obama's appearance on the sidelines of the talks sought to remind governments of the elation that surrounded the Paris accord and urge them to announce more immediate, concrete steps to put the 2015 deal into action.  Obama noted efforts by the United States √ë the world's second-worst climate polluter now after China √ë stalled when Trump pulled out of the climate accord. ""I wasn't real happy about that,"" he admitted, but added that optimism and unity is required to save the planet, both in the U.S. and around the world. ""It doesn't matter if you're a Republican or a Democrat if your Florida house is flooded by rising seas, or your crops fail in the Dakotas, or your California house is burning. Nature, physics, science √ê they don't care about party affiliation,"" Obama said. ""We need everybody √ê even if we disagree on other things."" More: Biden at COP26 climate change summit: 'None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come' Despite opposition within Biden's own Democratic Party that has blocked the climatefighting legislation, Obama said he was confident that some version of Biden's ambitious climate bill will pass in Congress and said it will be ""historic."" ""It will set the United States on course to meet its new climate targets,"" he said. Absence of China, Russia draws criticism And while in 2015, rapport between Obama administration negotiators and their Chinese counterparts was seen as paving the way to the global Paris accord, Obama on Monday criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin for not joining other global leaders at the climate talks in Glasgow. ""It was particularly discouraging to see the leaders of two of the world's largest emitters, China and Russia, decline to even attend the proceedings, and their national plans reflect what appears to be a dangerous lack of urgency,"" Obama said. Obama spoke earlier Monday to a session on Pacific Island nations, including ones whose existence is threatened by rising oceans under climate change. ""All of us have a part to play. All of us have work to do. All of us have sacrifices to make"" on climate, he said. ""But those of us who live in wealthy nations, those of us who helped to precipitate the problem ... we have an added burden."" Deals are few at COP26 When he was briefing the UN climate conference (COP26) on the first week's progress, COP26 President Alok Sharma had to correct himself about the number of issues settled, changing ""many"" into ""some."" No deals have been made yet on three main goals of the U.N. conference. Those are pledges to cut emissions in half by 2030 to keep the Paris climate deal's 1.5 degree Celsius temperature limit goal alive; the need for $100 billion annually in financial help from rich  countries to poor ones; and the idea that half of that money goes to adapting to global warming's worst effects. Several other issues, including trading carbon and transparency, also weren't solved yet. Numerous developing nations were pessimistic. They called progress ""disappointing"" and not near enough, saying announcements on fighting climate change were high in quantity but worried that they were low in quality. Representatives of 77 developing nations, along with China, said until this climate conference fixes the financial pledge problem to help poor nations cope with climate change these talks cannot be successful. Ahmadou Sebory Tour¬é of Guinea, speaking on behalf of poor nations, said rich countries not fulfilling their $100 billion pledge shows those countries are just making ""an empty commitment."" ""There is a history of broken promises and unfulfilled commitments by developed countries,"" Diego Pacheco Balanza of Bolivia told the conference. Scientists say the urgency of global warming is as great as the dire speeches at Glasgow have conveyed, with the planet only a few years away from the point where meeting the goals set in the Paris accord becomes impossible, due to mounting damage from coal, petroleum, agriculture and other pollution sources. The last few days have seen huge protests in Glasgow and around Europe for faster action in fighting global warming. Obama told young people ""you are right to be frustrated,"" but then relayed the advice his mother gave him when he was young. ""Don't sulk. Get busy, get to work and change what needs to be changed,"" he said. ""Vote like your life depends on it √ë because it does."" Associated Press reporter Frank Jordans contributed to this report."
USA-2021-83.txt," Frustrations grow as protesters demand faster climate action eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//06/un-climate-summit-thousands-march-demand-faster-climateaction/ 6320701001 Ellen Knickmeyer, Seth Borenstein and Frank Jordans | Associated Press GLASGOW, Scotland ‚Äì Tens of thousands of climate activists marched Saturday through the Scottish city hosting the U.N. climate summit, physically close to the global negotiators inside but separated by a vast gulf in expectations, with frustrated marchers increasingly dismissive of the talks and demanding immediate action instead to slow global warming. The mood at the protest in Glasgow was upbeat despite the anger and bursts of rain. Similar protests were also held in London, Amsterdam, Paris, Dublin, Copenhagen, Zurich and Istanbul. Many of the marchers condemned government leaders for failing to produce the fast action they say is needed, with some echoing activist Greta Thunberg‚Äôs view Friday that the talks were just more ‚Äúblah, blah, blah.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having these conversations, but there‚Äôs no policies to actually back them,‚Äù said Daze Aghaji, a marcher from London at the Glasgow demonstration, shouting over the steady beat of the drums. ‚ÄúAnd on top of that, the real people should be in the room,‚Äù Aghaji said, referring to complaints that the Glasgow summit has too sharply limited participation by the public. ‚ÄúHow are we expecting to make decent policy when the people who are the stakeholders of this aren‚Äôt even present in the room?‚Äù Marchers held signs with messages including ‚ÄúCode Red for Humanity,‚Äù ‚ÄúStop big polluters,‚Äù ‚ÄúCOP26, we are watching you‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúI‚Äôm angry.‚Äù One sign asked ‚ÄúIf not you, then who? If not now, then when?‚Äù Megan McClellan, 24, of Glasgow said she doubted that climate negotiators were listening. ‚ÄúThis is a very easy thing for them to ignore. They‚Äôre nice and comfortable‚Äù inside the summit conference center, she said, which is ringed by steel fences. But her friend Lucette Wood, 30, of Edinburgh disagreed. ‚ÄúThey might not actually do anything about it but they pretend that they do ... and they will just put it off for 20-30 years,‚Äù Wood said.  Thunberg‚Äôs dismissive talk of the two-week climate summit ‚Äî which has another week to go ‚Äî has touched a nerve inside and outside the summit site. Government leaders and negotiators insist they are as equally aware as the marchers of the urgency of their task, with time slipping away to rein in pollution from fossil fuels before the Earth faces much higher levels of warming. More: What is COP26? Your quick guide to United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow Jamila Khatoon from Pakistan carried a sign in Glasgow about three glaciers in her region that may disappear because of climate change. ‚ÄúThe glaciers are melting,‚Äù Khatoon said. ‚ÄúVillages are drowning. Nobody is doing anything.‚Äù Elaine Knox, 69, and William Oliphant, 60, both from Glasgow, said they were attending the rally for the next generations. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dying before the worst happens,‚Äù Knox said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the youngsters we‚Äôre leaving a horrible, horrible world.‚Äù British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose country is hosting the talks, has defended the progress made by governments in raising promises of emissions cuts and climate financing, while acknowledging the public‚Äôs demands that more needs to be done. At the huge U.N. conference venue, negotiators spent a seventh straight day haggling over draft agreements that can be passed to government ministers for political approval next week. Among the issues under discussion were a fresh commitment to capping global warming at 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, pushing countries to review their efforts more frequently to increase the pressure for deeper cuts, and providing more financial support for poor nations to adapt to climate change. More: Biden at COP26 climate change summit: 'None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come' The summit‚Äôs president, Alok Sharma, told reporters he understood the protesters‚Äô frustration. ‚ÄúI think we have overall made progress,‚Äù Sharma said Saturday. ‚ÄúI think people have been constructive in the negotiating rooms.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are getting to the point where the rubber hits the road, where we‚Äôre going to have to make, you know, tough decisions‚Äù by government officials, he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, certainly do not, underestimate the difficulty of the task which is ahead of us.‚Äù Saturday‚Äôs marches drew a range of participants and ages, a day after tens of thousands of young people in the Fridays for Future movement protested outside the Glasgow conference‚Äôs fences. Thunberg‚Äôs mix of school strikes, blunt and impatient talk about  government excuses, and mass demonstrations have galvanized climate protests since 2018, especially in Europe. The climate protest movement ‚Äî and the worsening droughts, storms, floods, wildfires and other disasters around the world this year ‚Äî have brought home to many the accelerating damage of global warming and have kept the pressure on governments for stronger and faster action to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Elizabeth May, a Canadian member of parliament and 16-time participant in the U.N. climate talks, said the protests are making a difference. ‚ÄúMost of the people on the inside are here in their hearts and sometimes physically,‚Äù May said, who joined the Glasgow demonstrators Saturday. In central London, thousands of climate protesters marched from the Bank of England to Trafalgar Square. Protester Sue Hampton, 64, said everyone is at risk and all generations need to press for action. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let the young people do all the work here. We‚Äôve all got to do it together,‚Äù she said. In Istanbul, climate protesters brought their children to the demonstration Saturday, emphasizing the impact of global warming on future generations. ‚ÄúI want my children to live on a beautiful planet,‚Äù said Kadriye Basut, 52, in Istanbul.

USA-2021-84.txt," Climate change is hurting the great American road trip. Will my daughters go on one again? eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices//08/climate-change-national-parks/6286845001 Our national parks still wear the scars of devastating wildfires past. This summer, I saw the new scars forming on our beautiful landscape. Chris Marvin | Opinion contributor I filled the gas tank of our rented 2002 Volkswagen Eurovan 17 times in 31 days from mid-July to mid-August. It was a green Weekender camper van with a Westfalia pop top. The kids slept upstairs. During that month, we drove more than 3,000 miles exploring seven national parks, from the Rockies to the Olympic Mountains. The purpose of this adventure was to share the legacy of the national parks with my children. As a combat-wounded veteran of the war in Afghanistan, there aren√ït many tangible items I can show my daughters to demonstrate what I fought for overseas. Outside of an American flag or a voting booth, there are few physical manifestations of patriotism, freedom or democracy. Yet, in the national parks we can see, smell, hear and touch the very national treasures I fought to protect. I loved traveling by camper van but felt guilty about the environmental impacts the emissions from our van were making. My feelings were compounded by the real-time climate impacts we witnessed throughout our trip. So, while the planned theme for our trip was legacy, the surprise theme was climate change. Tour of climate change Our photos of the Grand Tetons in Wyoming were obscured by smoke. Rangers at Olympic in Washington told us to skip Hurricane Ridge because smoke from Oregon wildfires made the air hazardous to breathe. In the North Cascades, we drove through an active burn and witnessed wildland firefighters in action. We were often prohibited from building a campfire because of drought-induced burn bans. (So much for s√ïmores and ghost stories.) I even bought two portable air filters for nights when wildfire smoke seeped into our van. USA TODAY's Jill Lawrence: COVID and wildfires gave us an education instead of a vacation. We'll never be the same.  In Colorado's Rocky Mountains, my daughters participated in a Junior Ranger program led by wildland firefighters just back from a deployment to Idaho. And in every park, we saw the toll that wildfires take on the forest, including areas still closed to hikers after fires last season. Wildfires weren√ït the only signs of climate change we encountered. The glaciers at Glacier National Park are expected to mostly melt before the century ends. Eerie photos on park service displays show the erosion of the glacial pack at Mount Rainier in Washington. This summer√ïs droughts ended boating at Grand Teton√ïs Jackson Lake by mid-August because the docks would soon be sitting on a dry lakebed. And, the heat! The Pacific Northwest saw highly unusual triple-digit temperatures this summer. What the Biden administration can do I treasure the idea of the national park road trip. It√ïs a part of our national culture and something everyone should experience. Many parks are only accessible by car, and most lack reliable cell service, let alone enough infrastructure to charge electric vehicles. The automobile and the road trip are here to stay. But we can √ê and should √ê make cars less harmful to our climate. Cars and light-duty trucks are one of the largest sources of climate and air pollution in the United States, and light-duty trucks account for roughly 17% of transportation greenhouse gas pollution. At home, I drive an electric car charged from solar panels. That√ïs my drop in the bucket. To achieve reductions on a global scale, the Biden administration must follow through on its promise to tighten emissions standards for new cars. With new rules underway to undo the previous administration√ïs rollbacks, we must ensure that any new standards are free of loopholes and are more ambitious than those introduced under any previous administration. Prince William, Michael Bloomberg: We're in a race to save Earth from climate change In 1988, huge swaths of the wilderness at Yellowstone National Park were consumed by wildfire. Hiking through those areas today, the impacts are still obvious. The regrown trees are just about 20 feet tall, and fallen tree trunks litter the landscape. When my daughter asked me how long it would take for the 100-foot-tall Engelmann spruces or 75-foot-tall Lodgepole pines to finally return to the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park √ê which was devastated by the East Troublesome fire last fall √ê I had to tell her it would not be until long after she√ïs dead. Our national parks are a gift passed down through generations, and the choices we make about them now have long-term effects. I am sharing this legacy with my children today, and I hope that they can pass it on to their kids in the future. For that to be possible, the federal government needs to take bold action on climate change now.

USA-2021-85.txt,"What can help fight climate change? More whale poop, study suggests eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//08/whale-poop-can-help-fight-climate-change/6341472001 Jordan Mendoza | USA TODAY The popular children's book ""Everyone Poops"" details what every human and animal does. But what the book may not detail is that one animal's waste is actually good for the environment. Marine researchers say baleen whales, some of the largest animals on Earth that include the blue, gray and humpback whales, eat more than had been thought. But what goes in must come out, and what comes out of these massive whales actually gives back to the ecosystem. In 2008, a study published on whales eating off the coast of British Columbia to Mexico found that whales required about 2 million tons of food a year, with a diet that includes fish, squid, krill and zooplankton. But research published in the journal Nature on Wednesday determined the amount was much more. The team, led by marine ecologist and Stanford postdoctoral fellow Matthew Savoca, used data from whales tracked in the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans from 2010 to 2019. The whales were tagged with smartphone-like devices to track their movements, along with drone photography and boats equipped with echo sounds to detect the size of potential whale food. By determining a whale's growth, how often it ate and how much food there was, the results more than doubled the findings from 2008. For example, the North Pacific blue whale, which can grow up to 90 feet and weigh more than 100,000 pounds, ate about 16 tons of krill a day. That would equal 5,840 tons a year. Other whales included the North Atlantic right whale and bowhead whale eating more than 1,825 tons of zooplankton a year. Eating more than thought means the whales also poop more than thought. But that poop helps out oceans because of the nutrients, like iron, it contains. Because whales usually defecate near the ocean surface, the nutrients inside help bloom carbon-absorbing   phytoplankton that ""form the base of ocean food-webs."" ""Consider that whales are acting as mobile krill processing plants,"" Savoca said in a statement. ""These are animals the size of a Boeing 737, eating and pooping far from land in a system that is iron-limited in many places."" What researchers want people to learn from the study is that the world needs whales. Numerous types of whales were hunted throughout the 20th century, damaging a population that has yet to fully recover. One of the rarest whales, the North Atlantic right whale, had its population drop to 336 in 2020, the lowest it had been in nearly two decades. `Very chunky': Great white shark leaves researchers in awe Watch: Fearless seagull surfs on the back of a southern right whale While whaling has been banned in most countries with the exception of Japan, Iceland and Norway, whales are still struggling with climate change. Rising ocean temperatures could mean less food would be available. ""Our results say that if we restore whale populations to pre-whaling levels seen at the beginning of the 20th century, we'll restore a huge amount of lost function to ocean ecosystems,"" said Nicholas Pyenson, co-author and curator of fossil marine mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum. ""It may take a few decades to see the benefit, but it's the clearest read yet about the massive role of large whales on our planet."" Further analysis supports the need for whales as the amount of krill in places like the Southern Ocean have significantly dropped since the early 1900s. The amount of nutrients in poop also has dropped since then. All wrapped up together, more whales means more krill, and more krill means more ocean-benefiting poop. ""Our results suggest the contribution of whales to global productivity and carbon removal was probably on par with the forest ecosystems of entire continents, in terms of scale,"" Pyenson said. ""Helping whales recover could restore lost ecosystem functioning and provide a natural climate solution."" Follow Jordan Mendoza on Twitter: @jordan_mendoza5.   "
USA-2021-86.txt,"One of the harshest deserts in the world may help us avoid climate famine eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world//05/climate-change-crisis-lessons-from-dry-desert-chile/6253210001 Michelle Shen | USA TODAY A new study on plants thriving in one of the harshest deserts on Earth may unlock findings on how we can prevent famine amid the growing effects of climate change. The Atacama Desert in Chile is known as one of the driest places in the world. With dusty red rocks stretching for miles on end, the region receives only slightly more than half an inch of rain per year, according to National Geographic. Despite the dearth of water, dozens of species of plants grow in the area. The study calls the desert an ""unparalleled natural laboratory to study plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."" One of the effects of climate change is global desertification, and the study cites that, by 2035, 65% of our total land surface will be affected by desertification, up from 48% in 2016. The associated drought, elevated radiation, salinity and extreme temperatures will make it increasingly hard to grow crops in parts of the world. A combination of climate change, land mismanagement and unsustainable freshwater use is already causing water to become scarce and soils to become poor in minerals in several regions of the world, according to Carbon Brief, a U.K.-based website covering the latest developments in climate science. More bad news for climate change: Pandemic dip in carbon emissions was temporary, report says Biden at COP26 climate change summit: 'None of us can escape the worst that is yet to come' By studying the genetic makeup of these plants, researchers were able to identify what particular qualities made them so resilient in the unforgiving desert. So what shared genes showed up in these plants? The most common genes in 32 of the species were in relation to stress response, metabolism and energy production. Researchers noted 265 genes that provided the desert plants with an evolutionary advantage, and they've described this repository as ""a 'genetic goldmine' to engineer crop resilience to face climate change.""   How did the researchers do it? Turns out, it was an effort that spanned over 10 years and 27 researchers across various institutions and universities around the world. The researchers studied 22 sites at every 328 feet of elevation. Upon studying the soil, they also found that it lacked many essential minerals typical for plant growth. The study reported ""extremely low"" levels of nitrogen in all of its samples. The researchers then discovered that nestled near the plant roots were scores of growthenhancing bacteria. The bacteria can suck nitrogen from the air to provide crucial minerals for the plants, protect the plants against pathogens, make the plants more drought-resistant and increase plant hormone production. The treasure trove of data gathered from the study has broad implications for the future of food security. ""Some of these extraordinarily resilient plants are closely related to staple crops, such as cereals, legumes, and the potato family, and therefore can provide invaluable genetic material for crop breeding,"" the study says. COP26 tackles land use and desertification The study was released on Monday as world leaders gathered in Glasgow, Scotland, for COP26, a United Nations climate summit aimed at limiting the increase in global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. One of the goals of the conference was also to ""implement and, if necessary, redesign agricultural policies and programmes to incentivise sustainable agriculture, promote food security, and benefit the environment,"" according to the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use.

USA-2021-87.txt," Climate anxiety: Amid feelings of hopelessness, some turn to 'climate-aware' therapists for help eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation//04/feeling-climate-anxiety-consider-climate-aware-therapisthelp/ 6281007001 PROVIDENCE, R.I. √ë Sixteen-year-old Ben Doyle often feels ""pervasive guilt."" It creeps up when he leaves the water running a little too long while brushing his teeth, or when he drinks from a single-use plastic bottle. In those moments, he says, ""I really feel like I√ïm only hurting myself and acting against my interests and the interests of everybody around me."" Doyle, a student at Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, said he experienced ""hopelessness"" when the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2020. The term ""climate anxiety"" immediately strikes a chord with him √ê the phenomenon of emotional distress stemming from the planet's environmental crisis. Around the world, members of Generation Z √ê currently 9-24 years old √ê are experiencing it acutely, according to new data. And many people in their child-bearing years are torn between the future that awaits and their personal desire to have kids. From not having kids to battling anxiety: Climate change is shaping life choices and affecting mental health A first-of-its-kind global survey published in September, led by academics from the University of Bath in the U.K. and the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health, showed the psychological toll the climate crisis is taking on young people. Among high percentages thinking the future is frightening, or that humanity is doomed, many of the 10,000 respondents √ê ages 16-25 from 10 countries √ê also said the perceived inadequate government response is associated with feelings of betrayal. Forty-five percent of young people surveyed said their feelings about climate change negatively affect their daily life and functioning. Therapists specialize in 'climate awareness' Addressing this rise in personal suffering over the climate crisis, a new brand of psychological research and practice has emerged. People looking to ease their anguish can now see ""climate-aware"" therapists √ê therapists who ""recognize the current climate crisis both as a globe-spanning challenge to the sustainability of human and non-human life on Earth and as a deeply personal challenge with many psychological impacts,"" according to the Climate Psychology Alliance of North America.  Kelsey Hudson, a climate-aware therapist who works at Boston University's Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders, said climate ""distress"" √ê the term she prefers to use because it encapsulates a wider range of emotions √ê shouldn't be viewed as a diagnosis, but rather a normal and rational response to an existential crisis. ""We don't want to challenge people to reframe or change how they√ïre thinking, because it√ïs invalidating to say, 'You√ïre anxious about the climate crisis? That√ïs catastrophizing.' It√ïs really not, it√ïs adaptive."" Hudson, who lives in Cambridge, also runs a private practice specifically dedicated to young people and adults with climate distress. Her clients √ê a lot of whom are activists √ê are experiencing overwhelm, traumatic stress, grief, sadness and anger, she said. ""Many of my clients are angry with the focus on individual action, versus the need for societal action,"" Hudson said. ""And many are distressed how climate change is an inequality multiplier, how the impacts will not be felt equitably amongst people."" Because people of color are inequitably touched by climate change, research has shown they care more about it, too. A 2020 Yale University study found that Hispanics/Latinos (69%) and African-Americans (57%) are more likely to be alarmed or concerned about global warming than whites (49%). They're also more likely, the study showed, to join a campaign to convince elected officials to take action. 'I wish I had been wrong' On a spring morning in 2014, Kate Schapira, a poet who teaches at Brown University, set up a table and stool in a downtown Providence, Rhode Island park and put a handpainted sign out in front. It read: √íCLIMATE ANXIETY COUNSELING 5¬¢. THE DOCTOR IS IN√ì. Part public art installation and part serious effort to stimulate conversation around a subject that was consuming her, Schapira√ïs act, with its tongue-in-cheek nod to Lucy√ïs psychiatric booth in the Peanuts comic strip, drew international media attention. What seemed a novelty then, appears prescient now. Schapira√ïs expression of her worries over the warming planet came before the words √íclimate anxiety√ì or √íclimate grief√ì entered the popular lexicon. √íI wish I had been wrong,√ì she said recently. √íI wish that was a turning point for the damage that all of us are caught up in.√ì Schapira is not a trained therapist. She came up with the idea for √ícounseling√ì sessions after talking with friends who all believed that climate change was happening but didn√ït feel the same type of angst. She wanted to sit down with strangers to understand if they felt differently.  As it turned out, there were other things of more pressing concern to many of them √ê housing uncertainty, health problems, domestic abuse. To Schapira, the problems appeared to lead back to the same economic systems and power structures that gave rise to the fossil fuel industry and climate change. Costs of climate change: What are the effects of climate change costing consumers, on average? It spurred her to community action, getting involved, for example, in the successful fight against a proposed natural gas-burning power plant in northwest Rhode Island. And she encouraged others to do the same, giving them the names of social justice and environmental groups. √íWhat I was trying to do was connect people with each other and with their own strength and potential,√ì she said. Schapira kept up the sessions summer after summer, setting up in farmers√ï markets, art fairs and other community events. Before going on hiatus last year because of the pandemic, she had talked to more than 1,200 people. Now, she√ïs putting together a pitch for a book that would be based on those conversations. Climate change impacting decisions on whether to have children Schapira feels better for the work, but her fears about the climate have hardly eased. A few years ago, she and her husband decided not to have children, a choice made in response to a combination of environmental and political concerns. In part, Schapira feels that having a baby would shift her focus from activism, she said in an essay for the website Catapult. The couple is not alone in questioning whether to bring children into an uncertain world. Four of every 10 young people are hesitant about having children, according to the results of the global survey released in September. Lucia Hillman is a junior at Portsmouth High School in New Hampshire, and with Doyle participates in the school's Eco Club. She started listening to a podcast on climate change that said deciding to forgo having children is the best thing someone can do to ease the crisis. ""I think I would want to have kids one day, but whether I raise a climate activist or not, how will that help the planet?"" Hillman said. ""And then I think, by then, will it even be safe?"" Seven years ago, when Meghan Kallman, an activist and academic in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, met Josephine Ferorelli, a Chicago-based writer, they had an immediate connection and got around to sharing similarly conflicting thoughts around having children.  The exchange helped expose what they saw as a gap at the time between the talk around climate change and how people believed it would affect their lives. And it spurred them to create Conceivable Future, a global forum for people to air their concerns about reproduction in the age of climate change. √íI had this feeling that these are the type of conversations we want people to be having,√ì Ferorelli said of that first meeting with Kallman. √íThese judgment-free conversations that permit people to feel into the experience they√ïre having, instead of imagining a glacier or a polar bear, but understanding that the crisis is here as well and we won√ït get anywhere until we understand the stakes of it.√ì The group's website has dozens of testimonies of people grappling with questions about their carbon footprint and more severe climate impacts. √íEvery time a family member or friend announces they are expecting a baby, I am overwhelmed with sadness and helplessness,√ì a person identified as Kate wrote. But while the site and the house parties organized by Conceivable Future are designed to facilitate discussion, Kallman and Ferorelli √ê neither of whom have decided whether to have children √ê hope that their work can also lead to action. √íFor us, the only right thing is to fix our system so that we emit less and we create fair jobs, opportunities, lives, access to healthcare. It√ïs the only moral position that we√ïre taking,√ì said Kallman, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston who was elected to the Rhode Island Senate last year. 'The kids are not alright' Olivia Chatfield found herself driving towards Alewife station this summer without sight of the Boston skyline √ê smoke coming from the western wildfires blanketed Massachusetts and much of New England. Her summer school students noticed it, too, as they readied to go outside for playground time. ""These are 5- and 6-year-olds, and they were asking questions about it, asking what√ïs going on,"" she said. Looking back, Chatfield √ê who lives in Somerville and is a member of Sunrise Movement Boston √ê wishes she'd educated them with stories on how Indigenous people have historically used fires to take care of ecosystems, paired with modern-day fire safety information. Helping them relate the problem to something tangible, she said, is important. Otherwise, they just have fear. Being a young person herself and spending her working life with even younger people as a fifth-grade teacher in Revere, Chatfield said the climate crisis paired with an overall feeling of instability is ""really heavy."" Many of her students are also low-income and of color, meaning they're historically more exposed to climate change impacts.  ""The kids are not alright,"" said Chatfield. ""The most tangible way we can get the kids alright is actually changing things, on a big scale. If we want to improve youth mental health, we also have to make a better place for them to be kids."" That large-scale change is what keeps Vickash Mohanka up at night √ê the fact that politicians have proven so far they're unwilling to take those steps. Over the last few years, he said, he's struggled to find optimism. ""We all feel like we're left out to hang, while nothing is happening to help regular people."" Mohanka, a Westborough resident, previously worked for the Massachusetts state Legislature writing energy legislation, but ultimately chose to leave for climate activism work. He found working in politics frustrating, vexing. ""We spend all this time accurately describing problems, and then we come up with solutions that are nowhere near the scale of the problem,"" he said. 'The power of talking' Remaining hopeful and empowered is the theme of several recently published books, including √íSaving Us: A Climate Scientist√ïs Case for Hope and Healing in a Divided World,"" √íAll the Feelings Under the Sun"" and ""How to Talk to Your Kids about Climate Change: Turning Angst Into Action."" A popular online newsletter called Gen Dread focuses on ""staying sane in the climate and wider ecological crisis."" People can languish in their climate distress, or they can turn it on its head and use it for good. Hillman, 16, believes strongly in local displays of collective action. She cited a recent climate strike in her downtown that drew 40 people. ""I think these small but very significant representations of fight for climate action, those really empower others,"" she said. ""The more people that act and show care, it√ïs signs of hope for change."" Hudson agrees that young people talking to each other is perhaps one of the most powerful mechanisms for combatting climate distress √ê in lieu of systemic change by governments and industries. ""One thing I come back to over and over again is that there is pretty much nothing as powerful as peer messengers,"" Hudson said. ""The power of talking about your feelings to friends, families, teachers cannot be overstated. And that is something I talk with a lot of my child and teen clients about. No, you can√ït vote, but you could talk with several of your friends and have a great deal of influence.""  The idea of focusing on solutions is also at the center of a training program on climate change communication that Jennifer West leads in Rhode Island. Hundreds of people with state and federal agencies, environmental organizations, land trusts and political groups have gone through the sessions, says West, a coordinator with the Narragansett Bay Research Reserve. For scientists and other environmental officials who work every day on issues related to climate change, a feeling of beleaguerment can set in. How does a wetlands expert not get down knowing that salt marshes, which are vital habitats for fish and birds, are being flooded by rising seas? West√ïs response: There are places where marshes have been elevated by adding sand on top of them and then planting grasses in the new material. √íThat√ïs what we√ïre taught to do,√ì she said. √íIf we don√ït give people some hope and give people the tools to effectively communicate to give others hope, then we√ïre kind of doomed.√ì And similar to what Conceivable Future and others are doing, the aim is more than just having a conversation. √íThe communities that are most resilient are the ones with the highest social cohesion. It√ïs all about getting with other people and talking about this,√ì West said. √íHope promotes dialogue and dialogue promotes action.√ì "
